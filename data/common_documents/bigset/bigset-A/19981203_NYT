RANGERS TOP ISLANDERS, 3-2

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ If Tuesday's dramatic victory wasn't enough to
give the struggling New York Rangers new life, maybe Wednesday
night's inspiring 3-2 victory over the rival New York Islanders
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who were coming off an exhilarating overtime
triumph against the Florida Panthers, extended their winning streak
to three games with a combination of timely scoring and splendid
goaltending. It was the Rangers' second victory over the Islanders
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who lost their third straight game, did not help
themselves by failing to convert on several juicy scoring chances
in the second and third periods. They outshot the Rangers by 25-17
and dominated the final 40 minutes of play, but could not beat
Rangers goalie Mike Richter. Tommy Salo, the Islanders' goalie,
made several difficult saves, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders appeared to cut the Rangers' lead to 3-2 at 8
minutes 28 seconds of the third period on a shot by Joe Sacco. The
home team requested a review of the play, which was never signaled
to be a goal by Referee Stephen Walkom or the goal judge. The
Islanders were not awarded it because the replay was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   With 4.5 seconds remaining in the game, the Islanders' Claude
Lapointe scored to make it 3-2. But by then, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a pretty big hole with four straight
losses at the start of the season,'' said Brian Leetch, the
Rangers' captain. ``We've been a .500 club since. We're starting to
get some good things going now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Islander Coach Mike Milbury said: ``I thought we worked hard and
didn't get any breaks. A few pucks hit posts, a couple trickled
through legs.''
</P>
<P>
   given us the offense we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead a 4:10 of the third
period when he skated through the Islanders defense and backhanded
the puck past Salo.

THQ ACQUIRES RIVAL IN GERMAN MARKET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Video-game maker THQ Inc. said Wednesday that it
has paid $6million for a German competitor in an effort to expand
its European presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, THQ bought Rushware Microhandelsgesellschaft and
its subsidiaries, Softgold Computerspiele and ABC Spielspass.
Softgold specializes in publishing and localizing personal computer
and console video games, while ABC is Rushware's distribution arm.
</P>
<P>
   THQ Chief Executive Officer Brian Farrell said the purchase is
an instrumental part of his company's plan to increase its
international sales. ``We now have direct distribution capabilities
in a market that has a population of over 80 million (people),''
Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rushware will continue for at least the next 21 months to
distribute PC and Sony PlayStation products developed by LucasArts
Entertainment in German-speaking Europe, including an upcoming
title based on director George Lucas' pending ``Star Wars: Episode
One _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   THQ paid for the German game house with $1.5 million in cash and
$4.5 million in THQ stock. The company's shares rose $1.3125
Wednesday to close at $28.50.

   LATIN-ARMS (Cartagena, Colombia) _ Sixteen months ago, the

auction house or the consignors for legal reasons. Three other
objects _ a Plains ceremonial club, a Yurok ceremonial dance apron

asked to be withdrawn from the sale were bought by three determined

computer peripherals. But Arthur and D.W. are not alone. This fall

Interactive Pooh ($99.99) by Mattel and two less expensive toys,
Furby ($34.99) from Tiger Electronics and Real Live Babe ($40), a
toy pig from Equity Toys based on the movie character. All these
dolls offer varying levels of interactivity and differing claims
about educational value. But the educational value of these kinds
of interactive toys is a matter of keen debate among

biting humor and a legendary, often withering grumpiness toward
those who disagree with him. Kalman's visual manifestoes rail
against technological hyperbole and other fetishes about ``the
Future.'' His work in advertising, journalism and graphic design
constitutes a eulogy for the single clear voice. That voice, a

the late architect Paul Rudolph's Beekman Place triplex, perhaps
the city's most unusual apartment.

   SEE-THROUGH-CAMERA (Undated) _ Rarely has an urban legend been
born so quickly and openly as the tale that Sony's NightShot video
camera could see through clothes. Jay Leno joked about it: ``Hear
about this new video camera that looks through clothes? Well, Sony
has recalled it _ and raised the price.'' The titillating tale
rippled through the news media like snickers through a sophomore
science class. It had only the tiniest grain of truth: in skilled
hands, during the day, under just the right conditions, with just
the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible to produce an image
of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, see through
clothes, and there was no recall. By Phil Patton.

   FANTASY-CAKE-DECORATOR (New York) _ The call came in from the
White House on Nov. 10. Could Colette Peters, fantasy cake
decorator to Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Al Pacino, Joan Rivers
and Rockefeller Center, make edible Christmas decorations for the
mantels in the Red Room and the Green Room and for the Grand Foyer.
And could she have them installed by Saturday night, Dec. 5? Not
too many people say no to the White House. Neither did Ms. Peters,
who gave up a career as a painter _ that thing about making a
living _ to bake and decorate cakes for the rich and famous. The
latter turned out to provide a very nice living. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   TIFFANY-WINDOWS (New York) _ When you enter the long nave of St.
James African Methodist Episcopal Church here, there is a deep,
rich glow near the altar, coming from windows that pulsate with
color and light. The dazzling interplay of emerald greens, dark
blues, ambers and rubies inspires a feeling verging on rapture.
Anyone seeing these six windows will wonder if they are by Louis
Comfort Tiffany. The answer is a definite ``maybe'' and, in fact,
the mystery may never be resolved. By Caroline Seehohm.

TEAMMATES ARE BURGLARY VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA offensive tackle Kris Farris rarely eats
post-practice training table at Ackerman Union. But Tuesday
evening, after attending to bowl-related paperwork on campus, he
joined his teammates for a quick bite.
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly meal.
</P>
<P>
   Farris had $2,000 stolen Tuesday evening from the West Los
Angeles apartment he shares with receiver Brad Melsby and defensive
end Pete Holland. He believes the thieves were in the apartment
when the trio arrived after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, the first one in, heard something at the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking what might have happened if I'd gotten home 30
minutes earlier,'' Farris said. ``I might have done something to
stop them, or they might have had a gun. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris hadn't given up a sack all season, but his room was
sacked. Clothes were everywhere, drawers were removed and his
closet was trashed. The thieves took his cell phone, CDs and
Nintendo. They used his pillowcase to take the CDs. He canceled his
cell phone 90 minutes after discovering the theft, but
long-distance calls had already piled up.
</P>
<P>
   He was awake until 4:30 a.m. cleaning and organizing, then had a
7 a.m. weightlifting session.
</P>
<P>
   The burglars stole cash from Melsby. Holland's room was
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wonder is if whoever did it knew we were football
players,'' Farris said. ``If they can read, they do now, because I
had football stuff in my room. I'm worried about being in a bowl
game if they know we're players and we'll be out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   The West L.A. Division of the Los Angeles Police Department was
slow responding _ five hours slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called them at 6:30 (p.m.), called several more times, and
they came at 11:20,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Have ticket, will travel: There are no restrictions on the
size of travel squads for nonconference games, so 76 Bruins will
make the Miami trip. Coach Bob Toledo based his decision on
football effort and academic performance. At-risk players will stay
on campus and prepare for finals, which begin Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the trip are the freshman offensive linemen:
Mike Saffer, Blake Worley, Steve Morgan and Scott Wiegand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensive linemen are always the smartest guys on the team,''
Toledo said. ``I don't know why that is, but they always are.''
</P>
<P>
   Injured receiver Freddie Mitchell, a native of Lakeland, Fla.,
will not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie went home for Thanksgiving and he needs to stay here
and get ready for finals,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Silliness of schedule: Quarterback Cade McNown believes
strength of schedule is a flawed component in the Bowl Championship
Series formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is it's up to the athletic director, five or
seven years ago, to pick the right teams,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Reserve receiver Jon Dubravac has a strained
hamstring and has not practiced this week. He's questionable for
Miami. Reserve tight end Randy Hakes had an appendectomy last week
and will not play.

MOBIL CEO HAS PAY INCENTIVE TO SELL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 2nd and 3rd grafs for clarification; also more details in
17th graf about Noto's stock options)  (See also EXXON-TEXACO, EXXON-GAS-STATIONS, EXXON-OPEC,
EXXON-ROCKEFELLER) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people were surprised that Mobil Corp. chairman Lucio
Noto was willing to sell the company to Exxon Corp., but a look at
his pay package shows that he had powerful incentives.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Noto, 60, may collect at least $6 million in
cash just by leaving if the deal goes through, although he said
Tuesday he would become vice chairman of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, he would be free to harvest stock options
that otherwise would not be ripe, removing the risk that depressed
oil prices will make them worth less in the future. And if he were
to sell now, the value of his 1996 and 1997 options would balloon
by 41 percent under terms of the deal, which greatly increases the
value of Mobil stock.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by selling Mobil and then leaving the company, Noto
would be freed from company policies that force him to hold almost
all of his wealth in a basket filled with Mobil shares. For a man
who has said that he foresees some tough years for the oil industry
_ oil is selling at the depressed price of about $11 a barrel _
there must have been at least a few thoughts about the benefits of
taking some of his $58 million or so of Mobil wealth out of that
basket and spreading it around in investments with a less risky
future.
</P>
<P>
   Those benefits would be significant achievements for Noto, a
lifelong Mobil employee, especially since the Mobil board of
directors compensation committee determined that in his first three
years as chief executive, 1994 to 1997, the company's performance
was merely average compared with other large oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that committee also decided that Noto's salary and bonus
have been low relative to chief executives at comparable oil
companies and gave him a $40,000 raise to $930,000 starting July 1,
1997, as well as a bonus of $1.13 million, up from $650,000 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1997 Mobil's board also doubled his annual award
of stock options to 140,000, then doubled it again ``in recognition
of special achievements of long-term value to the company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are sharp differences in style between Noto, a man with
social skills and considerable charm, and Lee Raymond, who would
remain chief executive at Exxon and is a very private man known for
his ability to recall minute details. These and other differences
have raised some questions about whether the two could work
together for long.
</P>
<P>
   William Randol, an independent energy consultant in New York,
expressed bewilderment over what prompted Noto to recommend that
the board sell Mobil. ``He has a strong personality, he is an
energetic guy and a not insignificant ego,'' Randol said. ``He is
going to be taking the back seat in this combination and that is
very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative inattention outsiders have given to Noto's pay
package and how he will be better off if the merger goes through is
not surprising. Mobil is a master at making sure it discloses as
little as legally possible about how it pays executives.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains,
N.Y., spent several hours going over Mobil documents trying to
flush out the subtle points that can add enormous value to pay
packages. He found little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mobil guys have taken a lean cuisine approach to
disclosure,'' Foley said, adding that he tried to parse one key
document, a 1995 pay plan that is critical to analyzing how
executives will fare in the merger, and concluded ``that it doesn't
say boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Meyer, whose Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners in New York advises
companies on executive pay, also said she was struck by how little
Mobil has disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   She found that the Mobil board has ``an unusual plan,'' which is
more restrictive than other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the majority of companies you have automatic triggers''
that let executives cash out if a company is sold, she said.
Mobil's plan, however, leaves to company directors the discretion
to let executives collect their severance packages and exercise all
their options.
</P>
<P>
   A Mobil spokesman, David Bailey, said the company would not
comment on whether Mobil directors had taken any steps to let
executives collect these so-called golden parachutes and other
benefits. He said the sale was recommended by Noto solely because
``it is in the best interests of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Noto's 1996 options allow him to buy Mobil shares for $57.50
each and his 1997 options allow him to buy the shares at $61.75
each. All told they are worth $8.3 million on paper without the
Exxon deal. If it goes through and assuming the Mobil directors
allow Noto to collect, he not only can turn those options into
cash, they will also swell in value to $11.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The options are worth more because each Mobil share would be
exchanged for 1.32 Exxon shares, effectively raising the value of
Mobil shares, which closed Wednesday at $84.1875, to $94.06, based
on Exxon's closing price of $71.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   How much Noto is paid this year, and how many stock options he
was awarded, will not be known until the next proxy statement. That
is not due until May, but may be issued sooner because of the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the board followed the pay practices outlined in its
disclosure statements, Noto would have received at least 140,000
options last February. That would mean he has options worth $10.3
million but that cannot be converted into cash yet. If the deal
goes through these options would be worth $15 million, a 46 percent
increase.

O.J. JERSEY FLAP SHOWS NO SIGN OF GOING AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If anyone thinks the name O.J. Simpson doesn't
still push people's buttons in this town, you should have been
answering my phone Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people called and left messages offering insights,
insults and bids after the column I wrote Tuesday on a family
aiming to sell a USC football jersey O.J. wore in his great game
against UCLA in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to give the money to a charity, most likely a
shelter for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   The public reaction was overwhelming. Nobody could agree on
anything. Verbal barbs and bullets were flying all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of callers, mostly male, were willing to pony up $100 to
$200 for the jersey just so they could throw a party _ and burn it.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of people thought it should be donated to a charity,
which could then pin it up on a dartboard _ and sell darts at $20 a
pop to throw at the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of people also thought O.J. is still getting a raw
deal in the media _ and that his old jersey should be given back to
him, not auctioned off for charity.
</P>
<P>
   One guy threw some pretty interesting, colorful names at me for
being anti-O.J., then proceeded to spend the next minute belching
steadily into my phone until the tape ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Hands down, he got my vote as the most unique caller.
</P>
<P>
   Most O.J. supporters just chose to yell. One woman was screaming
herself into such a fit about how O.J. was railroaded, she had to
pause to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   But those were mainly the fringe reactions. The majority of
callers were legitimately interested in bidding on the jersey O.J.
wore in the 1968 USC-UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   The bids ranged from $25 from a guy who said he was one of the
working poor to $12,500 by a guy who didn't return my call to see
if the offer was legit.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it, since all the sports memorabilia people I talked to
were telling me O.J. stuff is hard to move these days. A few
callers, though, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one of the best O.J. collections around,'' said Al
Beardsley of Burbank. ``I turned down $8,000 for a signed O.J.
jersey. There's still plenty of O.J. memorabilia interest out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley said he'd like to bid on this jersey. But he couldn't
go too high because he's saving most of his money for O.J.'s
Heisman Trophy, which goes on the auction block in February, along
with 100 items seized from his former Brentwood home.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people interested in buying the jersey, and the
intense reaction of many of the callers, was surprising and
startling, said Pat Moore, wife of Gene Grobman. Grobman and his
brother-in-law, Mitch Kaye, have shared O.J.'s jersey these past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a student physical therapist with the USC team back in
1968, said he took O.J.'s jersey from the locker room after the
UCLA game and gave it to his sister-in-law as a wedding anniversary
gift.
</P>
<P>
   He said O.J. didn't object to his taking the jersey. Kaye
offered to return it to him in early 1994, but before they could
meet, the slayings of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and
her friend Ronald Goldman occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lot of people thought the two families shouldn't be
trying to auction off the jersey and should just give it back to
O.J. or USC, Moore said she's glad they went public trying to sell
the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This jersey is important,'' she said. ``During the (Simpson)
murder trial, some charities that help battered women came about or
survived because more people became aware of this terrible problem
and got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by selling this jersey, and giving the money to a battered
women's shelter, it continues to help shed more light on this
problem, we'll all feel very gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as what happens to O.J.'s old football jersey next, it's
up to Moore, her husband and brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   An offer to auction it off at a major fund-raiser for a
nonprofit organization at the Skirball Center fell through
Wednesday when the auctioneer balked, saying it would be a mistake
to include any O.J. memorabilia in the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I will be giving Moore the names of other local
charities and organizations that called and expressed an interest
in auctioning off the jersey at their fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I will give her the telephone numbers of individuals who
seemed serious in offering a legitimate bid for the jersey.

EDITORIAL: CITY HALL, BEHIND BARRICADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Dec. 3:
</P>
<P>
   In an age when terrorists are on the loose, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has every right to be concerned about protecting New
York's City Hall from attack. The bombings of the World Trade
Center and of the federal building in Oklahoma City and the
spraying of bullets around the Capitol in Washington are ample
proof of the threat. But there is always a danger that the concrete
barricades and police blockades now surrounding City Hall to thwart
terrorists will stifle dissent and frustrate public access to the
nerve center of government. Security is an issue that calls for an
exquisite balance of competing values, and full public discussion
of the reasons for it. The mayor and the City Council need to think
these through.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, protesters have lost their traditional right
to hold press conferences on the City Hall steps. Casual visitors
are barred from walking on the premises, and police now shoo even
City Council members away from the front porch that always served
as an informal meeting place for the politicians, advocates,
journalists and dissidents who make up the city's political
community.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says the restrictions are necessary because of security
concerns connected to an upcoming terrorist trial. He has a duty to
state more clearly the nature of the threat. Giuliani's critics,
meanwhile, attribute the new controls to his aversion to dissent
and even minimal amounts of disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The danger that security measures can repress dissent was seen
in the administration's handling of a press conference by an AIDS
service organization this week. Members of the group, Housing
Works, won a court order giving them the right to hold a public
event in the City Hall parking lot. The demonstrators, who numbered
less than 200, were sent through outdoor metal detectors. Their
spokesmen were then corralled into a small pen surrounded by
barriers, separated from their hundred-odd supporters. The media
were herded into another pen. Inspectors from the Department of
Environmental Protection bearing noise meters monitored a reading
of the names of people who had died from AIDS, to make sure the
roll call of victims was not exceeding official decibel limits. A
reporter who attempted to watch the activity from the City Hall
porch was ordered to go inside by officers who asserted that there
was a danger the demonstrators might rush the building.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council needs to take a serious look at the entire set
of policies that has cut City Hall off from the public. Giuliani
and his police commissioner seem to regard use of the City Hall
steps and porch as a potential threat. Yet they apparently felt it
was safe to allow thousands of people to come to the City Hall
grounds for rallies on behalf of the Yankees and John Glenn. The
police have now been given the discretion to decide which visitors
have a good reason for entering City Hall, but they have no formal
guidelines for making those judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone met with the mayor Wednesday and
appeared to believe that Giuliani was willing to compromise, allow
more public access and reduce the repressive atmosphere around the
building. But later Giuliani said he had agreed only to permit tour
groups for a limited number of set hours. The mayor compared his
precautions to those taken to protect the Capitol in Washington,
which has been the scene of many violent incidents. But the public
is in fact welcome in the Capitol. Like City Hall, it is guarded by
police who require all visitors to pass through metal detectors.
But Congress, in its attempts to balance security with the public's
right of access, has declined to impose further restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to risk vetoing a precaution that might turn out to
be crucial in averting violence. But Giuliani must show the city
that his actions are based on more than a conviction that he knows
better than anyone how to handle public safety issues. Fear cannot
be the single factor that determines how the business of the city
is conducted, and if extraordinarily tight security is warranted,
the reason can be explained to the public without compromising
police intelligence sources.

SOTHEBY'S AUCTION IS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An auction of American Indian art at Sotheby's in
Manhattan turned out to be less of an auction than expected on
Wednesday, after protests by several Indian tribes that argued that
their cultural heritage should not be sold into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the objects, including six that several tribes had
asked to be removed from the auction block, were withdrawn by the
auction house or the consignors for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In three other cases, objects that Indians had also requested be
withdrawn _ a Plains ceremonial club, a Yurok ceremonial dance
apron and a 16th- or 17th-century Aleut wooden mask _ went to
buyers who said they intended to turn them over to the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the lines were drawn between those who
support the Indians' right to repossess sacred objects and those
who believe that objects in private hands should remain so.
</P>
<P>
   In the former camp is Elizabeth Sackler, who advised the
successful bidders for the three disputed items. Ms. Sackler, the
daughter of the antiquities collector Arthur Sackler, is the
founder and president of the American Indian Ritual Object
Repatriation Foundation in Manhattan. She created the foundation
after another Indian auction at Sotheby's in 1991, where she bought
and returned to the tribes three masks, two Hopi and one Navajo,
that the Indians consider sacred and had asked to be withdrawn from
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side was the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who
said that he was ``saddened'' by the auction's direction. ``Disgust
is too positive,'' he said. ``It's a sad scene.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he deplored a 1990 federal statute that provides for the
return of many Indian objects to the tribes, but makes no provision
for housing or caring for the objects.
</P>
<P>
   An Eskimo wood mask consigned by Carpenter's wife, Adelaide de
Menil, and sought by the Aleuts was purchased by a California
woman, Anne Bleecker Corcos, for $46,000. Ms. Corcos, the head of a
nonprofit organization that supports Indian issues, said she
planned to return the mask to the Aleuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal thing,'' she said. ``I feel it's important for
native Americans to receive these things back, especially those of
ceremonial and spiritual value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Rockefeller Roberts, president of Fund of the Four
Directories, a group that offers grants to Indian causes, bought
the Yurok apron for $11,500 ``because this is an object that the
Yurok nation has identified as sacred to their spiritual practices
and cultural lineage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gutstein, an IBM administrator at the company's
headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., paid $7,475 for a Plains ceremonial
club that the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Montana had
asked be withdrawn from auction. ``My interest,'' he said, ``was to
return it to its owners. It's a ritual object that has meaning to
its community and serves a binding role.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than 600 lots of American Indian art were at
auction on Wednesday, and in most cases, their sale was not in
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 19 objects that were pulled from the sale at the last
minute because of unresolved legal issues, 7 were withdrawn because
Sotheby's said further research was needed to ascertain whether
tribes claiming the items had been notified.
</P>
<P>
   In the other cases, items were withdrawn because the auction
house had not determined whether the feathers on them were covered
by a 1916 act regulating the sale of feathers from certain
migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items was a bentwood hunting hat from the Aleut
Indians. Representatives of the tribe had protested the hat's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Menil, the hat's consignor, and Carpenter had rejected
requests to withdraw the hat and the Aleut mask, saying that they
feared the objects would not be properly cared for by the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I,'' Carpenter said, ``have been vigilant in
protecting these objects for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutstein and his wife, Nancy, have set up two scholarships (for
a young man and young woman) at each of the 30 American Indian
tribal colleges in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member delegation of Aleuts from the Aleutian/Pribilof
Islands Association that had flown in from Alaska for the sale
expressed pleasure at the outcome on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finally breaking the ice and working toward gathering
items, spiritual, ritual and cultural items,'' said Dimitri
Philemonof, who heads the association.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the wood mask to be returned to the Aleuts, Allison
Young, the cultural heritage director of the association, said,
``There are no words to describe the joy the people in the region
will feel when they see the ancestral object.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ At last the appointed time had arrived for the
Angels to unveil their rare acquisition. Alas, the
long-sought-after proof that Disney does indeed have deep pockets
and discriminating tastes was late arriving (tell Angels fans about
it!).
</P>
<P>
   So for an hour Wednesday all anyone in the assemblage at Edison
Field saw of Mo Vaughn was his likeness luminating the outfield
Jumbotron.
</P>
<P>
   As the seconds passed like centuries, suits with cell phones
paced the restaurant area behind home plate as nervously as
secret-service agents. Imagine their panic, misplacing something
that weighs 250 pounds and is worth $80 million. It turns out
Vaughn wasn't lost, just stuck in traffic, first in the skies above
a fogged-in LAX and then on the 405 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Where Vaughn came from, some wild story about him having been in
an accident or having decided to slip into a bar for a quick scotch
surely would have beaten him to the ballpark. But this being the
blase capital of the country, Vaughn's entrance was greeted with
warm applause.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, this offseason's most-sought-after slugger, signed with
the Angels primarily because he covets a World Series ring to wear
next to his diamond-encrusted pinkie ring (the jewels form a 42,
his jersey number).
</P>
<P>
   However, it made it a whole lot easier pulling up roots from his
native New England knowing he was going to a place where people
aren't inclined to suspect the worst should he show up an hour late
for an engagement.
</P>
<P>
   As hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and basketball superstar Shaquille
O'Neal found out before him, Southern California might be teeming
with people, but it offers something elementary that a small market
cannot: breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be yourself here and that's an added plus,'' said the
30-year-old Vaughn, flashing a smile that outsparkled his
mismatched pair of diamond-studded earrings and the
thick-as-his-biceps gold chain around his neck. ``Everybody out
here is relaxed and takes things as they come. I look forward to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is coming off an eight-year marriage with the Boston Red
Sox that ended badly, with each side excoriating the other. The
ballplayer who won the 1995 American League MVP award earlier this
year charged the front office with hiring somebody to tail him.
General manager Dan Duquette countered by voicing concerns over
Vaughn's drinking habits in the wake of three separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who is single, sounded much like a jilted suitor as he
tried to make sense of the Red Sox's failure to try to sign him
during a two-week window following the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe (Boston) did not bargain with me,'' said
the first baseman, who is coming off a season in which he hit 40
home runs and batted .337. ``When you have been in an organization
as long as I had, sometimes people tend to begin to take for
granted your efforts. I really feel like it's their loss.''
</P>
<P>
   All the big fish are nearly gone from baseball's freshly stocked
pond, and the Red Sox have yet to reel in a sizable free agent.
They got nibbles from outfielder Bernie Williams before he
re-signed with the Yankees, but that was about it. Asked to comment
about Boston's futile fishing expedition, Vaughn smartly declined
to take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox have enough to worry about without me trying to
make them look bad,'' he said. ``I've got too much class as a man
and a person to belittle somebody else because of my good fate. I
hold no grudges against the Red Sox, you know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   We do know this: Whatever transpired in Boston is history. After
all, California is the land of sunshine, second chances and
Disneyland, the self-proclaimed happiest place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anything to hide about my life or about
myself,'' Vaughn said. ``I'm a little tired of the controversy. I
hope I get judged for what I do on the field. That's all I think is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, when you're the highest-paid player in baseball,
there is no foul territory in your life. Every move you make, good
or bad, becomes fair game for your fans and foes alike. We hope
Vaughn remembers to conduct himself as an Angel on and off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   He's lucky in that he already has a sizable support group, as
evidenced by the handful of Angels players who showed up at Edison
Field Wednesday to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I came here,'' quipped pitcher Chuck Finley,
``is to find out which half of Disneyland they gave Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   Silly Chuck, everybody knows it was Tomorrowland.

COYOTES' STREAK ENDS  
 OILERS TAKE CHARGE TO FINISH OFF UNBEATEN ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ As they filed out of the dressing room for
the start of the third period, the Coyotes looked like a team that
was facing the final 20 minutes of their season.
</P>
<P>
   Like the final period of Game 7 in the Stanley Cup Finals.
Wednesday night's game against the Edmonton Oilers wasn't nearly
that important. Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   But try telling that to the emotionally charged Coyotes, who
overcame a 2-1 deficit in the second period and grabbed an early
third-period lead, only to watch Edmonton storm back for a 4-3
victory at the Skyreach Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Buchberger and Rem Murray scored goals 1 minute and 35
seconds apart for the Oilers, who got some revenge for a recent 3-2
overtime loss in Phoenix by putting an end to several of the
Coyotes' streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is their 14-game unbeaten streak, which already was a club
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is their eight-game winning streak, which ended one shy of
tying a club record.
</P>
<P>
   And gone is their unprecedented string of 17 straight games
without allowing more than two goals, which stopped two shy of
tying the NHL's modern-day mark set by Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was bound to happen. You can't win every game,''
Keith Tkachuk said. ``But it was a weird game. We felt we should
have won. We put 48 shots on net. . . . I mean, 48 shot? And we
only scored three goals. But stats prove you should win the hockey
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (14-3-2) had their work cut out for them all night.
They fell behind early, and had to play catch-up the rest of the
way until Tkachuk gave them their first lead at the 1:17 mark of
the third when he redirected Jyrki Lumme's slap shot past Mikhail
Shtalenkov on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's 13th goal, which Shtalenkov never saw, wasn't enough,
however. Neither was their season-high 48 shots. The Coyotes'
usually clamping defense didn't shut down the Oilers like it has
everyone else since a season-opening 4-1 loss to the Ottawa
Senators. Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who routinely has come up with
huge, game-saving performances down the stretch, also wasn't
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he didn't seem to be on his game from the beginning of
pre-game warm-ups. The NHL's second-ranked netminder, who entered
the game with a 1.57 goals-against average, allowed four goals on
22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been unbelievable for us all year, though,'' Tkachuk
said. ``It wasn't Niki's fault. We just made a couple bad decisions
out there, a few mistakes we normally don't make.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals by Buchberger and Murray were back-breakers, not just
streak-busters. Buchberger tied the score at 3 at the 9:54 mark
when he wristed a shot to the far top shelf past Khabibulin. Then
at 11:29, defenseman Tom Poti rifled a blast that Khabibulin
knocked down, but couldn't control.
</P>
<P>
   With the puck resting at his knees, Murray swept in and jammed
it into the net, bringing the crowd to the feet and the Coyotes to
the sudden realization that they weren't bring to go the rest of
the season without a loss.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game, however, that Phoenix had been winning during
its torrid early-season start. It just never seemed to be their
night from the moment Edmonton left wing Dean McAmmond scored his
first goal of the year with 1:48 left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Teppo Numminen couldn't pinch Pat Falloon off the
boards before his centering pass found McAmmond. Coyotes center
Jeremy Roenick, who dropped deep to cover McAmmond in the slot,
couldn't knock him out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we weren't going to go on forever, but this loss
hurts, though,'' Coyotes center Daniel Briere said. ``We played so
well and this is a little hard to take. But at the same time, we
need to take a lesson and learn something from this. If we keep
playing hard, good things are going to keep happening for us.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks way of life has met sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   No eulogy is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have someone who can compete in any sport, you give
him space,'' Jerry Colangelo said. ``If that means he has long
hair, he has long hair. You've got to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a 97-loss season comes many promising things, but
nothing more refreshing than this drastic change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks don't need choirboys. They don't need
clean-shaven robots. They don't need pretentious talk about
character and good citizens and appearance codes better suited for
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks need nasty. And with Randy Johnson, that's just
what they're getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be days when he's very temperamental,'' Colangelo
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as Johnson's two agents spewed damage control like
oscillating sprinklers, as Johnson harped about the importance of
family, an interesting thing happened. The manager, Buck Showalter,
didn't say a word. And then he left the proceedings for an
afternoon engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Showalter is ecstatic over inheriting a pitcher of
Johnson's pedigree. But his vision of a homogenous clubhouse of
crew cuts has been trampled, replaced with the reality of now: If a
guy can play, who cares if his tongue is pierced and Marilyn Manson
lyrics decorate his locker?
</P>
<P>
   This could be a significant shift in power, a sign that the
Diamondbacks are now being built with Colangelo's vision rather
than Showalter's. Or it could be the simple case of bending around
unique talent. Either way, it was a much-needed change.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Diamondbacks were bad and boring. They entered
the league with an abundance of attitude and no one to back it up.
They were quickly exposed as a bunch of puppies, all yap and no
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have the attitude of Greg Swindell, the chair-throwing
fire of Todd Stottlemyre, and best of all, the menacing scowl of
Johnson. A faceless team is finally growing an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fifth day that I go out there, I'll bring something to
this team that they haven't had before, that the fans haven't seen
before,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be easy on us, mind you. If the Diamondbacks wanted
revenge on the media, the ones they blame for the outrage over
ticket prices, they couldn't have done much better, save for Albert
Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did his best to distance himself from the strained
relationships of his past on Wednesday, but most journalists who
have covered the Big Unit have a few war stories to tell. And a
television reporter who showed up at his home in Paradise Valley on
Tuesday is already banned for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   He is moody, surly, a lightning rod in the clubhouse. Just what
the Diamondbacks need.
</P>
<P>
   Although mercurial, Johnson also carries a genuine warrior's
mentality. In 1996, he underwent significant back surgery. Given
Johnson's size, that's like treating a giraffe with a sore throat.
Nevertheless, the following season, he pitched 213 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Brian Holman, a former teammate who tells a
wonderful story. Once upon a time, before Johnson became an
enigmatic star, he was a minor league pitcher at Indianapolis. And
once upon a time, he drilled a minor league batter with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The minor league batter started toward the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy screamed at him, `Don't mess with me, I'll take your
life,' '' Holman said. ``The guy went right to first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is risk in giving a 35-year-old pitcher a
multiyear contract. There are no guarantees he'll stay healthy or
happy. Nothing guaranteed except for the $53 million he's owed by
the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But he is emotional, disciplined, animated. And every time he
pitches, it's an event. He brings an infusion of energy and
attitude much needed on Jefferson Street, especially entering a
season when the stadium is no longer a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to play, you've got to pay,'' Colangelo said.
``These days, there's no halfway. You either go all the way or you
go to sleep. And I'm not going to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, neither will the fans. With the arrival of
Johnson, the Buck _ and the boring _ stops here. &QL;

CLEMENS SEEKING A TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers gained a second opportunity to
acquire a No. 1 starter yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Roger Clemens, 36, who lives in the Houston suburb
of Katy, informed the Toronto Blue Jays of his desire to be traded
to an organization closer to his home or traded to a playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Houston Astros fit both descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'll talk about it,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``We're one of the clubs he'd want to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman yesterday
acknowledged his team's interest, and the Cleveland Indians likely
will be interested in acquiring Clemens, too.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who spent his vacation last week with general managers
Gord Ash of the Blue Jays and Walt Jocketty of the St. Louis
Cardinals, made inquiries then regarding Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Ash, though, replied that the Blue Jays did not plan to part
with Clemens ``unless the demand came that he wanted to be
traded,'' Melvin said. That occurred yesterday afternoon, less than
48 hours after the Rangers learned that left-hander Randy Johnson
spurned their four-year contract offer worth $50 million to sign
with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' representatives, Alan and Randy Hendricks, secured a
gentlemen's agreement with Ash that the five-time Cy Young Award
recipient could demand a trade if the Blue Jays did not appear to
be a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize they would have a decent team,'' said Randy
Hendricks, who telephoned Ash to make the demand. ``The reality is,
they're not prepared to add players and contend at the highest
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers inquired about Clemens before the July trade
deadline, but nothing materialized. Melvin and Ash discussed a
trade that would send Clemens to the Rangers for left fielder Rusty
Greer, left-hander Darren Oliver and minor-league catcher Cesar
King, a Blue Jays official said then.
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations never found common ground for a trade,
because the Blue Jays reportedly wanted Ruben Mateo instead of
King, and it remains to be seen whether it can be accomplished now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Melvin said. ``I'll have to talk to Gord
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays hope to trade Clemens within 10 days, and Major
League Baseball's winter meetings _ scheduled Dec. 11-15 in
Nashville, Tenn. _ will provide a convenient forum for Ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not done with any acrimony or with any anger
on either side,'' Ash said. ``I think it's important not to let his
drag out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are not seeking prospects in return for Clemens,
who will earn $8.25 million annually for the 1999 and 2000 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're really going to be interested in future
returns,'' Ash said. ``We're looking more for present value. I want
clubs to come forward and tell us what they're prepared to do. I
don't want to put any parameters on it.'' Selling the name Rangers
owner Tom Hicks' agenda includes upcoming discussions regarding the
sale of the naming rights to The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just now starting that process,'' Hicks said. ``We're
setting up some meetings within the next couple of weeks. We'd like
to get that done before this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants received a 25-year contract worth $50
million _ including $24 million up front _ for the sale of the name
of their new ballpark to Pac-Bell. The Giants' new ballpark is
scheduled to be ready for the 2000 season. Briefly The Rangers
designated reserve infielder Domingo Cedeno for assignment. The
Rangers must trade or release Cedeno within 10 days or assign him
outright to the minor leagues. Cedeno can reject any minor-league
assignment and elect free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed catcher Mike Hubbard and assigned the
27-year-old to Triple-A Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League.
Hubbard, who this past season hit .145 with one home run and three
runs batted in during 32 games for the Montreal Expos, will receive
an invitation to spring training as a non-roster player.

THERE'S DANGER IN THE DESERT AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He reminds you of one of the Dalton gang. The tall one
they call Slim.
</P>
<P>
   His blue eyes are deep-set, watchful. The thick mustache is the
saloon variety, made for stud poker and collecting sarsasparilla
foam.
</P>
<P>
   The tangle of brown curls cascade to a powerful set of shoulders
so wide that when he slipped on the new uniform top with his last
name printed across the back, the team publicist drew a breath and
held it, fearing size 52 might be too small.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 10, he looked almost uncomfortable in a business suit
and tie.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to imagine him in faded jeans _ holster riding low
on his hip _ or better yet, in Diamondbacks colors, a towering
angular figure on the mound, those blue eyes narrowed in
concentration, peering coldly over the webbing of his glove.
</P>
<P>
   How many hours have those eyes spent staring toward home plate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's my life,'' he said. ``Been doing it since I was 7
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Little League. High school. In college, at USC, he played on the
same team with Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He once said of those wild, wild days, ``I could throw real
hard. But about every third pitch hit the backstop on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time the thrower developed into a fearsome pitcher. Today,
ball in hand, hidden behind his back, he is the most intimidating
presence in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine crouching over the plate, heart thumping as he begins
the windup. All arms and legs and knees and elbows. His long left
arm comes over his shoulder, a bullwhip. The ball flies into the
batter's face like a hawk.
</P>
<P>
   How fast _ 95? 98? 100 mph? ``I don't have any trick pitches,''
he said. The scariest competitor in baseball doesn't need any.
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of danger about him. If what Yogi said is true,
that 90 percent of baseball is half mental, some batters step to
the plate with two strikes against them.
</P>
<P>
   When he delivers a fastball beneath a batter's chin it likely is
no accident. They used to call it crop-dusting although in this
case the term is a little genteel.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about a single-engine plane gliding lazily
over a field of alfalfa or sweet corn, spraying a thick white
cloud.
</P>
<P>
   When this guy comes high and inside, the mental picture is that
of an F-16 fighter. The ground shakes with its thunder. A voice in
the batter's mind screams, ``Code Red!'' No time to react. This guy
doesn't dust. He strafes.
</P>
<P>
   This, in part, may help explain why a few players have reached
the prayerful decision to take themselves out of the lineup when he
is scheduled to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, he looked into the audience. His
mother was there, as was the memory of his late father. His wife,
Mrs. Unit, was holding two of their three small children. The
smallest squirmed and chewed on a plush toy rattlesnake _ a symbol
of daddy's new employer and his game-day disposition.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged them with a brief smile. ````They,'''' he said,
of his family, ``don't even come around me on the day I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The watchful eyes show no fatigue. Nor does his arm. As they say
at the theater, we know what he did last summer. Acquired after
mid-season by the Astros _ ``Houston, We Have Liftoff'' the
``Sports Illustrated'' cover read _ the ex-Mariner won 10 games and
lost one. His earned-run average was 1.28. He pitched well in the
playoffs against the Padres, but the Astros' bats fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   He had back surgery at age 33. Now he is 35. A gamble?
Certainly. ``Pitchers are like racehorses,'' said Gerry Hunsicker,
the Astros' general manager. ``The expensive ones break down just
like the inexpensive ones. Only the risk is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo saw what we saw last season. ``It was like men
playing against boys to some degree,'' he said. So he took the risk
and in keeping with baseball's financial insanity offered one
pitcher $52 million (plus per diem).
</P>
<P>
   The player who makes his home in Paradise Valley accepted. He
``put family over money,'' his agent said _ one of those noble
statements that makes the public gag.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Diamondbacks overpay? Of course they did. But don't
blame the new ace of the pitching staff for accepting the home
team's open-armed generosity. Who among us wouldn't take the money?
</P>
<P>
   In return, the ball club gets a marquee player. ``El Unit-o
Grande.'' An athlete who will fill the ballpark. Create excitement
in any language. Give his team some much-needed personality. Make
the players around him better.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry finally got the big man he wanted. Too bad he doesn't play
for the Suns. &QL;

GOLFERS ADD TWIST TO GIFT PLAN _ THEY DELIVER, TOO

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Salvation Army estimates there are 37,000 needy
kids in the Valley, many of whom will wake up on Christmas morning
without presents under their trees. Many won't even have trees.
Living on the street can be mean in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Magee and Gary McCord were aware of these depressing
facts of life when they founded the Santa Claus Classic in 1994. By
enlisting the help of their fellow PGA Tour professionals who live
in the Phoenix area, they were able to do something about it,
raising more than $1 million over the past five years for
underprivileged kids at Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   As the Santa Claus Classic grew, the pros wanted to do more than
just raise money for the human services agencies that take care of
these impoverished families. That's why they will take half of this
year's proceeds _ $100,000 _ and go directly to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and I decided last summer that we wanted to make a bigger
impact and really see some tangible results this Christmas,'' Magee
said. ``We made up our mind that we'd round up $100,000 worth of
toys and give them out personally, along with Santa Claus, to each
kid who needs one.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributing 5,000 toys, however, was a much bigger undertaking
than Magee and McCord had imagined. But remember, these guys are
globetrotting professional golfers with a lot of connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turned out, I was playing in a pro-am in Cape Cod
(Mass.) not long after Gary and I decided to take on the toy
mission,'' Magee said. ``One of the guys I happened to be paired
with was a friend named Bob Nakasone, the (chief executive officer)
of Toys `R' Us.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee didn't even have to twist Nakasone's arm to get the toy
company involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob said he would love to do it,'' Magee said. ``From that
point, it was just a matter of getting down the logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would get the toys and how they would be distributed came
from input from family service agencies, Magee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the Salvation Army's computer and all of its
information, we've been able to plan this thing right down to the
age and the gender of most of the kids who will receive toys,''
Magee said.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Santa Claus gift giveaways takes place from 9
a.m. to noon Saturday at the Phoenix/South Mountain Family Services
Center at the South Mountain Park Activity Complex, 10919 S.
Central Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the toys are being loaded in Los Angeles
on special pallets, each one earmarked for specific giveaway dates,
which also include: Dec. 11 at 3:30 p.m. at the Phoenix/Sky Harbor
Family Services Center at the Ann Ott School Cafeteria, 1801 S.
12th St.; Dec. 12 at 9 a.m., Phoenix/West Phoenix Human Services
Center at Maryvale Baseball Park, 3600 N. 51st Ave.; Dec. 15 at
8:30 a.m., Santa Claus Classic Day at the Salvation Army Family
Services Center, 2702 E. Washington; and Dec. 25 at 11 a.m.,
Salvation Army Christmas Day Dinner at the Phoenix Civic Plaza, 225
E. Adams.
</P>
<P>
   What really depicts the Christmas spirit of the giveaway is that
three of the five Santa Claus gift sessions will take place before
this year's tournament, Dec. 18 at the TPC of Scottsdale. In other
words, the toys were given to the pros to distribute to the
children basically on good faith, as well as at a reduced cost,
from Toys `R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted to have such a positive relationship with the
Santa Claus Classic people and to provide them with our toys for
this unique program,'' said Toby Cogswell, the area director for
Toy `R' Us. ``We see every day how important it is to youngsters to
receive gifts during this time of year, and it makes us proud to be
able to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee said the list of those who deserve a special tip of the
golf cap for pulling off this Christmas miracle is a long one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and I got the ball rolling, but a lot of people have
played key roles, like my good friend John Russell, who is the
tournament director,'' the Paradise Valley pro said. ``And this
year, because of the uniqueness of what we had planned, I also had
to lean on my neighbor, Richard Jackson, for some help in
coordinating all this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But over the years, all the tour guys in the Valley have taken
part at one time or another, plus a few of the ladies from the
LPGA. Don't forget, besides all the amateurs who pay to play in the
Santa Claus tournament, the players also pitch in some money to
help the kids, too. I think that's pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, others think so, too, such as ESPN and The Golf
Channel, which plan to air featured broadcasts on several of the
Santa Claus giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The look on a child's face at Christmas time is one of the
most precious things in all the world,'' said Magee, who will be on
hand with several of his brethren at each stop on the Santa Claus
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Those family agencies who keep track of the needy are especially
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Claus Classic has been a godsend,'' said Lt. Colonel
Olin Hogan of the Salvation Army. ``The commitment to the community
of Phoenix will enable us to make thousands of children smile on
Christmas morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Hurtado, human services director for the city of Phoenix,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being fortunate enough to pair up with the Santa Claus Classic
is a genuine reason to smile this holiday season,'' she said. &QL;

CRITICISM GIVES RICE INCENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice never has
met New York Giants offensive line coach  &UR; John Matsko.
</P>
<P>
   So he has no idea whether Matsko, the former Cardinals and
University of Arizona assistant, called him ``a coward,'' as two
listeners reported this week on a Valley radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The listeners said that Matsko told them one reason the Giants
had dominated the Cardinals the past two seasons was because Rice
was ``a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' Rice said. ``I say that not from the
perspective of someone calling me that, but I'll use that. Thank
you. I appreciate knowing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who play Sunday at Sun Devil Stadium, have beaten
the Cardinals three consecutive times, including a 34-7 victory on
Oct. 18 in Giants Stadium. In those three games, the Giants have
rushed for 581 yards, often running right at Rice, who weighs 260
pounds, small for a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was presented with the situation in the past that Simeon
can't play the run,'' Rice said. ``Then I went out and dominated
the run. I like that, even if he didn't say that. I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsko said he never called Rice a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Matsko said from Tucson, where the
Giants are practicing this week. ``I've watched that guy play. I've
got great respect for that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is leading the Cardinals in sacks with nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of situations, I'm from the new school,'' Rice said.
``But I've got an old work ethic. I have a throwback work ethic. My
mentality is that of a throwback player, go out there and grind,
play hurt. I've done that.'' &QL; 
Decision remains &QL; 
 &UR; Jamir Miller doesn't know where he will play Sunday _ outside or
middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved to middle linebacker Tuesday because of knee
injuries to
 &UR; Ronald McKinnon and  &UR; Mark Maddox and worked there in practice
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said Miller looked ``pretty good'' playing
inside but that he will be able to make a better evaluation after
today's workout in pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a final decision,'' Miller said. ``When we get
the pads on and start banging, I'll know more. We'll see how I
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were healthy, it wouldn't be an issue. But I have the
(dislocated) wrist, and there's a lot more pounding in there than
playing outside.''
</P>
<P>
   If Miller starts at middle linebacker,  &UR; Patrick Sapp will
replace him at left outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals have other injury problems at outside
linebacker.  &UR; Tony
 &UR; McCombs, who starts on the right side, missed Wednesday's workout
because of a toe injury. He is expected to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Toothache &QL; 
Giants wide receiver  &UR; Ike Hilliard missed practice Wednesday in
Tucson because of a tooth injury. He had two teeth pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent too much time on Halloween when he was a kid,'' said
Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, former Cardinals offensive coordinator. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Kicker  &UR; Joe Nedney (knee) was placed on injured reserve to make
room on the roster for his replacement,  &UR; Chris Jacke.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, out for the past two games, returned to practice
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Cardinals have forced only three turnovers in
their past three games, they still lead the NFL in takeaways with
30.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell and his wife,  &UR; Tanya, are the proud
parents of a baby girl born Tuesday. Aryn Brice, who weighed 6
pounds, 10 ounces, is their second child. &QL;

SUN DEVILS COME UP SHORT WITH TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State more than messed with Texas in the
first women's basketball game between the schools Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite enough to win, but enough to force the Longhorns into
overtime before falling, 77-75, before 1,042 at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've been in a basketball game,'' said Texas' Jody
Conradt, the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history. ``Both
teams played about as hard as they could play. We felt frustration
at losing two leads and some of it was our not handling the ball,
but a lot of it was Arizona State being aggressive defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (2-2) trailed by 16 at halftime then used a 16-4 run to
close with six, 55-49, at the 10:34 mark. But the young Sun Devils
spun somewhat out of control trying to press their comeback, and
Texas (2-3) scored all but two points of a 14-0 run on layups to
lead 69-49 with 7:28 left. Amazingly, ASU was not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Kitch Kitchen had seven of her team-high 16
points in a 16-2 run to bring the Sun Devils within 71-65 at the
2:22 mark. After that, ASU had to foul and hope for missed free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Texas obliged, going 4 for 11 from the foul line down the
stretch. Then, ASU scored on three critical possessions in the
final 37 seconds: a three-pointer by Shelly Tom; a running
five-footer by point guard Natalie Tucker; and a two-footer by
freshman Leah Combs to tie the score at 75 with 14 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ASU continued to press, and Tom was charged with a quick foul
that Kim Lummus converted into two of her four points. Lummus was
coming off a 26-point game against three-time defending national
champion Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd trade those 26 for these two tonight,'' said Conradt, who
called timeout at 11.2 seconds to set her defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns showed press then smartly dropped back to protect
against a 3-pointer and better prepare for ASU picks. When Tucker
found no one open in the post, she drove toward the baseline and
was bumped but not enough to warrant a foul in leaving a 3-footer
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the first half like we played (No. 11) Rutgers,''
ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne said, referring to a 67-48 loss
Sunday. ``We're still learning how to play hard. We played the
second half like the team we're going to be. Texas is too good to
waste the first 20 minutes and spot them 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have learned everything in the Rutgers game,
but I'm not sure that's too realistic. I hope these two games
together turns the light bulb on for this team in terms of how hard
they have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Rashunda Johnson scored eight of Texas' first 14
points as the Longhorns built a seven-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ASU still was within five, 20-15, with 10:19 left before
intermission when Texas went on an 8-0 run thanks to its veteran
perimeter. a pair of baskets each by seniors Vanessa Wallace and
Dee Smith and junior Edwina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns stretched that run to 12-1, going up 32-16, and
maintained the 16-point margin at half, 44-28.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, working too often from short range, fired 65.6 percent in
the first half. The Sun Devils, by contrast, were at 30 percent and
16.7 (1-for-6) from three-point. &QL;

UA SUSPENDS EDGERSON 1 GAME FOR EL BOW FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene Edgerson has been suspended by Arizona Coach Lute Olson
for Saturday's game against Wyoming in the Southwest Showdown at
America West Arena for a flagrant elbow thrown by Edgerson in a
game last week at Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerson, a 6-foot-6 junior forward for the 13th-ranked Wildcats
(3-0), has issued a public apology and written a letter of apology
to forward Bret Jepsen, whom Edgerson leveled with a forearm during
the Wildcats' overtime win.
</P>
<P>
   Jepson was unconscious for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the videotape, Olson said even though the
officials did not rule Edgerson's act to be flagrant, the coach
considers it to be, warranting a one-game suspension. Olson removed
Edgerson from the game immediately. Edgerson's replacement,
freshman Michael Wright, scored 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I looked at the tape, I determined Gene had committed a
flagrant foul, although it wasn't called when it happened,'' Olson
said. ``The penalty for a flagrant foul of that type is removal
from the game _ which I did _ and a suspension for the following
game. I know Gene is truly sorry for what happened and he has
assured me something like this will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgerson will travel to the Valley for Saturday's game will
return to action Dec. 14 against UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   In his public apology, Edgerson described his action as
unsportsmanlike conduct stemming from frustration about a previous
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the heat of the battle, I lost control of my emotions,''
Edgerson said. ``We are all human beings and there is no way we
should treat one another like I did in the game. I sincerely
apologize to Bret Jepsen and I hope he is doing better.'' &QL;

TOCCHET THINKING EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Jumping out to one of the best starts in his
career and staying healthy again has got veteran forward  &UR; Rick
Tocchet thinking about staying in the NHL possibly until he turns
40.
</P>
<P>
   His two-year contract, which pays him $2.15 million this season,
expires in July. He has an option to return for a third year, which
he almost certainly will do _ if he isn't given an extension before
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm proud of is I've worked very hard to get back where I
am,'' said Tocchet, who with eight goals and 19 assists entering
Wednesday's game against the Oilers was on pace for his best season
since 1992-93, when he scored 109 points for Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me a lot of summers to get where I can compete,
where I can be a good player again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Tocchet, who had a history of back problems
before joining the Coyotes last season, told the ``Edmonton
Journal'' that his improved health and the quality, young players
on the Coyotes makes him want to play for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something to be said, then I'll say it. The kids
here, they want to improve, so they listen,'' Tocchet said. ``That
makes my job easier, actually.'' &QL; 
Roster moves &QL; 
As expected, defenseman  &UR; Jason Doig has been activated from the
injured list and has been cleared to play by the Coyotes' medical
staff after missing all of training camp and the first two months
of the regular season because of a torn pectoral muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Doig was assigned to Springfield of the
AHL for a two-week conditioning stint. After that, the Coyotes must
either recall him to Phoenix or risk losing him on waivers if they
decide to keep him in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, the Coyotes announced that left wing  &UR; Louie
DeBrusk has been reassigned from Las Vegas of the IHL to
Springfield. DeBrusk, obtained during the summer from Tampa Bay in
the  &UR; Craig Janney trade, had two goals, eight points and 134
penalty minutes in 17 games with the Thunder. &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
The Coyotes' defensive trio of  &UR; Teppo Numminen, Keith Carney and
 &UR; Jyrki Lumme rank in the top five in the NHL in takeaways. Numminen
entered Wednesday's game third overall with 37. Carney and Lumme
each had 36, tying them for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth consecutive game, Coyotes enforcer/right wing
 &UR; Jim Cummins was a healthy scratch. Defenseman  &UR; Gerald Diduck was
back in the lineup after missing two games with a bruised
shoulder. &QL;

DESPITE DEMOTION, VENERABLE PRO MOON GOING OUT WITH HEAD HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe it is not such a great thing to be 42, in
terrific shape, maybe the best of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon's body tells him to keep on trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is not such a great thing that with 21 years of
professional experience, Moon's football IQ makes him a walking
telestrator, ready to break down zone coverages at the drop of a
hat.
</P>
<P>
   His mind tells him he has seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all those years Moon spent learning to play coolly under
pressure has muted the most critical ingredient for success as an
NFL quarterback _ the ability to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all those miles of pass completions, all the career
accomplishments that make Moon's section in the Seahawk media guide
as thick as this week's playbook, can't explain why Moon's career
looks like it is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, I can accept it,'' Moon said Wednesday. ``I've
beaten all the odds. I've done everything and more than anyone,
including myself, dreamed of. I've had a good, good career, and
like any athlete I want to play as long as I can. You can't come
back. It's never the same. That's why I wanted to get it all out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Moon was on the sideline, watching a 26-year-old
``nobody'' named Jon Kitna lead the Seahawks to a victory over the
Oilers, Moon's old team.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, Moon again will be on the sideline, watching Kitna
get his third NFL start when the Hawks visit the Meadowlands for a
date with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Moon appeared on ESPN's ``Up Close'' and was completely
surprised when the host asked how Moon felt about being benched for
the rest of the season in favor of Kitna. Turned out to be an
erroneous report, which Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson and Moon
clarified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the starter until he wants to start me,'' Moon said.
``I'm fine with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, with Kitna getting the call to be the
``spark'' for this moribund offense ranked 25th in the league, the
door has been opened on the inevitable discussion about Moon's
future, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   With four games left in a Seahawk season that very likely will
end without a playoff berth, and with Moon likely to be on the
sideline the rest of the way _ why would he start once the Hawks
are mathematically eliminated? _ the Moon story in Seattle is in
all likelihood being concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Moon's salary and bonuses would count $5 million
against next year's cap _ a huge number that will make it all but
necessary for the Hawks to cut him. Also, Moon has said will not
play another season unless he is the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing well up until the game in Kansas City (where he
suffered broken ribs). I had the most touchdown passes. I had only
one interception,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, though, with his sore ribs keeping him out of
practice and barely able to tolerate cortisone shots, Moon's clout
did not serve him or the team well. Moon was able to talk Erickson
into letting him start against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The result was terrible. Moon played three painful quarters. The
Hawks lost, falling to 3-3, squandering their 3-0 start and all but
demonstrating that this playoff hopeful team had taken a step
backward from 1997, when Moon set club passing records and won the
Pro Bowl MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, ever the diplomat, has accepted responsibility for the
offense's struggles this season, but he is hardly the sole culprit.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant factor was Erickson's decision to play
smash-mouth offense with the addition of running back Ricky
Watters. Next, when the offense did look to pass, there was special
emphasis on getting the ball to Joey Galloway _ a good idea, except
that the new formations made it tough for other receivers like Mike
Pritchard and James McKnight to get into a flow.
</P>
<P>
   These things all amounted to Moon struggling to find his own
rhythm. Finally, right before the loss to Dallas two weeks ago,
Moon said Erickson came to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said we've got to get back to spinning it,'' Moon said.
``That's what Dennis calls it. So he wanted to open up the passing
game. I agreed. I mean, if we're going to go down, we should do
what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with a game plan better suited to Moon's passing, he
could not make plays. The Cowboys pummeled the pocket-rooted Moon,
who went 15-for-28 for 201 yards with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   If that was Moon's final start as a Seahawk, surely he can look
and see an offensive line that did not help him by committing so
many penalties. He can look at a coaching staff that took too long
to get back to what the Seahawks and Moon did so well in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact remains, the Hawks need something now that Moon
could not give them. Even Moon does not dispute this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure that if I was the coach, I wouldn't do exactly
the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the cool head of one of the NFL's most veteran veterans.
He is not happy about his backup status. But Moon is picking his
head up now. The horizon is wide open, including an alluring dream
of being part of an NFL ownership group for putting a team back in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Time has a funny way of passing you by, even when your mind and

CHICAGO _ College basketball at this point in the season can be a
lot like listening to the orchestra tune up before the concert _
plenty of off-key notes that don't mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   If this were the 100 meters for the Olympic gold medal, the
sprinters would barely have begun to stretch. If it were the opera,
the fat lady would still be gargling. If a political campaign, the
candidates wouldn't even have thought up the first lies.
</P>
<P>
   In two nights of the Great Eight spilling across the floor at
the United Center, the artwork looked hardly of museum quality.
</P>
<P>
   It took three games for a team to finally crack 50-percent
shooting. It took a second night to eventually get an upset when
unranked Rhode Island picked off Utah 70-63. It took the back end
of a pair of marquee doubleheaders to at last get a sparkling duel
of individual stars in Rams freshman Lamar Odom and Utes senior
Andre Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the history of this event says it is not only a
made-for-prime-time dress rehearsal but a barometer of things to
come. Consider that a year ago Utah, Kentucky and North Carolina
won three of the four games in the Great Eight and went on to make
up three-quarters of the Final Four in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're looking for early favorites to plug into your
brackets in March, try UConn, Kentucky, Duke and upstart Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   What did we learn?
</P>
<P>
   That while UConn may be ranked No. 1 in the polls, Duke is back
and may be once again the team to beat. Despite a second-half run
by Michigan State that held their winning margin down to 73-67, the
Blue Devils have it all in the speed, agility and strength inside
of Elton Brand, the long-range sniping of Trajan Langdon, the
quarterbacking of William Avery and the rest of a roster that's
deeper than an advanced philosophy class.
</P>
<P>
   That while the hype machine that is labeling the 6-10 Odom
another Magic Johnson is unfair and oh-so-premature, this is a
unique talent. On one trip down the floor, he grabs a long
offensive rebound, does a 360-spin and stabs a 3-pointer right in
the face of a defender. On another, he weaves through traffic down
the lane and slides a nice no-look pass for a layup. And he follows
Utah's fleet Miller all the way down the floor on a fast break,
then erases a layup with a monster blocked shot that had the dozens
of NBA scouts who were present drooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great opportunity for me and my team,'' Odom said.
``I always tell them, `When the scouts come to see me, they see
you, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, maybe someday he'll let them ride in his limousine with
him.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that with seniors Wayne Turner and Scott Padgett to
lead his bunch, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith has enough talent on
hand to make a run at another title.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that while UConn has a couple of great talents in
reed-thin Richard Hamilton and stevedore look-alike Khalid El-Amin,
the Huskies will live up to the early high rating only if the likes
of junior center Jake Voskuhl from Katy and Strake Jesuit High
gives them solid play up front as well.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches have similar views about this kind of December
encounter with other giants. After working out some of the kinks in
assorted exotic ports of call from Hawaii to Puerto Rico to Alaska,
this is an opportunity to get back to the basics in a
meat-and-potatoes town and make a few determinations about their
teams that will pay off in the only season that really counts:
March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (college) football, you lose a game early in a big matchup
against another power, and you might take yourself out of the
running for a championship,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.
``But to me, in basketball, if you play in these situations, it can
actually enhance your chances of doing well in the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The rankings at this time of the year have all the impact of a
ceiling fan turning in a hurricane. It hardly matters who is No. 1
in the first week of December. Unless, of course, it happens to be
you, and, as with the Huskies from UConn, it is only the second
time that has happened in the history of your school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like an NCAA Tournament atmosphere,'' said Huskies
coach Jim Calhoun. ``It's very comparable as far as the matchups
and the site. It gives you a chance to evaluate what your kids are
going to be like when the heat is on.''
</P>
<P>
   We heard about turnovers attributed to slippery basketballs and
saw so many shots clank off rims that were called too tight. We saw
that it was only December in the long race to March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   But never too early to start filling in your bracket.

TV REPORTER GETS AN EARFUL FROM JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There were the dozen or so television vehicles, even a
Hummer stretch limo that cost a local radio station big bucks to
rent. It was The Event of the off-season. The Big Unit speaks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 media members crowded into a room at Bank One
Ballpark on Wednesday for Randy Johnson's first Phoenix press
conference, and the frenzy surrounding it rivaled the day Charles
Barkley joined the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was there.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost everybody. One person, you see, had the opportunity
to meet Johnson at his Paradise Valley home on Tuesday. Gil Tyree
of Channel 3 (KTVK), who showed up uninvited in the gated
community, reportedly was met with a stream of harsh words from
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that are do's and don'ts,'' Johnson
said. ``Coming to my home is a don't. It's the only place I have to
unwind, to have solitude. I don't feel my home is the place to do
an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that one of his daughters was sick Tuesday and that
she was taken to the hospital shortly after Tyree left.
</P>
<P>
   Tyree said he was told by the assignment editor and his
immediate supervisor to go to Johnson's house for an interview. ``I
was in a very difficult situation,'' Tyree said. ``I was told to
get the story. What could I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he would make himself available to the media every
day of the season _ when he wasn't pitching. That's when he turns
into a bear.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also tried to push across the idea that money, more than
$52 million, was not an issue, saying he could have gotten more in
Los Angeles or New York. That went over big with a crowd that was
scrambling for the last of the free softs drinks and popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Johnson did a much better job handling the media than
his agents. One of them even told the gathering what questions
should be avoided. ``Hold off asking the tough questions for
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   His plea went unheeded, and he visually showed displeasure when
unpleasant questions were asked. &QL;

`SWEET PEA' HAPPY TO BE HOME  
 DIAMONDBACKS WERE PICK IN '96 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As early as February 1996, Randy Johnson said he had
an interest in pitching for Arizona's new major league team.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander had just purchased a home in the Valley and had
reported to spring training in Peoria with the Seattle Mariners
when he told ``The'' ``Republic,'' ``I've got two years left here
(with the Mariners) and then I'll be down, playing with the
Diamondbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a year off _ the Mariners exercised a team option
for 1998 and later traded him to Houston _ Johnson fulfilled his
own prophecy Wednesday when he officially joined the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wore a charcoal pinstriped suit as he arrived for a news
conference in a party suite overlooking right field at Bank One
Ballpark. Before he sat down at a table filled with a row of
microphones, he walked over to his mother, Carol, who came from
northern California for the special occasion, and smothered her
with a long-armed embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Sweet Pea,'' she cooed, kissing him on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Pea? That's a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been called many things on the field and in the
clubhouse, probably a few unprintables, but never that.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the man who throws peas to help transform the
team from a National League side dish into the main course.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson talked about the importance of chemistry in the
clubhouse. In Seattle, he interacted at times, particularly with
outfielder Jay Buhner, but at other times maintained his distance.
In Houston, the pattern was similar, although some of it was
attributable to unfamiliarity with his teammates. Johnson did
develop a kinship with reliever Billy Wagner, who like him is
left-handed and has above-average velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hardly saw his wife and three children during his six
weeks in Houston, but he said he was welcomed by the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were extremely friendly,'' he said. ``They offered me a
car, help with whatever was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar wheels will carry Johnson to Tucson for spring training
beginning Feb. 18. That's when he said the chemistry will begin,
but it already has begun in many respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (pitcher) Andy Benes the other day, and he
was talking about the young rotation,'' Johnson said. ``It didn't
offer him many opportunities to talk shop, and now he has that with
me and Todd (Stottlemyre). We're bookends.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hopes to co-author an early chapter with Kelly Stinnett,
who likely will be his primary catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to give Kelly a call, wherever he is (Oklahoma).
Maybe he can hop on a plane and come here so we can get in some
early work,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take long, Johnson said, for a good working
relationship to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining in the NL likely will have Johnson shaking his head in
frustration for a while as he attempts to get a grip on hitting. He
has five career hits in 55 at-bats, 32 of those coming after his
July 31 trade to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've gotta hit now,'' he said with a sigh. ``When I was
in Houston, people said it was kind of comical, that the bat looked
like a toothpick in my hands. But I'm taking a great deal of pride
in hitting. And I know that I'll have to make contact with the
bunting. I'm going to go into the cage, do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson certainly is not lacking confidence, and can rattle off
many of his career statistics. But he is quick to point out that he
is not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't walk on water,'' he said. &QL;

WASHINGTON NEEDN'T FRET; LOSS TO UCONN WON'T MEAN MUCH IN MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The University of Washington basketball team arrived
Monday in the city of big shoulders, fresh off the program's first
victory in an eight-team tournament in 23 years. So even was the
Huskies' performance in the Big Island Invitational, they gave off
the sense they might have graduated to an elite dozen or so in
college hoops.
</P>
<P>
   They left here Wednesday, taking their act to a different time
zone again, repeating the kinds of things they said late last
February in a season-turning loss at California. Rather than the
top dozen, their last 15 minutes of a 69-48 defeat to Connecticut
only certified them for maybe the top gross in the college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were awful,'' said a bulky fellow with a scruffy beard in
a nondescript brown sweater, idly watching the second night of the
Great Eight doubleheader. He was George Karl, the ex-Sonics coach
now with Milwaukee, as always more straightforward than diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get killed by the pressure, but I thought it wore
at them at both ends. It affects shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was cause for celebration when the Huskies were named to the
Great Eight last spring, a fill-in for Stanford from the 1998 NCAA
final eight. UW coach Bob Bender wasn't inclined to stray from that
opinion despite the 21-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, and certainly everybody in our locker room
is disappointed,'' Bender said. ``But I believe this whole
experience will make us a better basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what to make of the UW's wide loss. But
the inclination is to guess it may be sound and fury signifying
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In big-time college football, scheduling is done with the same
care as diamond-cutting, lest it imperil a conference or national
championship. That doesn't happen in college basketball, which
sorts out the chaff with a postseason tournament. The top-shelf
programs are willing to risk losing early, knowing it has next to
nothing to do with the real season in March.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of quality early tournaments and the
influence of TV, the matchups are prodigious but the meaning is
minimal. When the NCAA basketball committee selects teams for the
tournament, it tends to treat early-season results with a
collective shrug. Duke and Stanford, the 1-2 teams in the coaches'
preseason poll, already have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Although the talent was monstrous here _ Lamar Odom, Richard
Hamilton, Andre Miller, Elton Brand and Todd MacCulloch were
eyeballed closely by a passel of NBA scouts _ the atmosphere at the
United Center was befitting the impact of the games. They were like
scrimmages, albeit high-level ones.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the season is beginning earlier than ever _ Nov. 7, the
better to squeeze in attractive matchups for TV _ which makes for
less practice and more unpredictability. Earlier this decade, NCAA
rules prohibited first games before Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' snorted Dick ``Hoops'' Weiss, longtime
observer of the game for the New York Daily News. ``First-semester
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider: When Washington faced Connecticut last March in the
NCAA tournament, the UW hadn't played in the previous four days.
Washington prepared for this meeting with UConn with three games in
the previous four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Washington) looked tired,'' said Danny Ainge, the Phoenix
Suns coach. ``But they played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Huskies looked in the final 15 minutes, finishing
with their lowest point total since 1994, they can take some good
things away. For the second straight time, Connecticut had more
turnovers, often the virus with which UConn shatters opponents.
Still, a few of those by Washington resulted in immediate
Connecticut baskets.
</P>
<P>
   It may develop that Washington misses Patrick Femerling, the 7-1
forward who left a year early to sign a pro contract in Germany.
The Huskies never found a way to use him in effective offensive
tandem with MacCulloch, but his size and athletic ability
discouraged opponents defensively and protected MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   Bender is preaching toughness as the Huskies prepare for two
more games on the road, at Boise State Saturday and Gonzaga
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least he's got games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going nuts,'' said Karl, looking bored. He'd kill for a
game, even one of these college shakedowns in early December.

HAWKS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN '97 DEBACLE AGAINST JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Chad Brown's first game as a Seahawk made a
lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps depression is a better description of the
season-opening, 4-1 loss to the New York Jets last year at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing. They did stuff at will,'' Brown said
Wednesday, when the Seahawks began preparing for Sunday's rematch
with the Jets at the Meadowlands. ``They got us off balance and
knocked us over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly, especially because of all the expectations the
Seahawks carried into that game after the free-agent signings of
Brown, a Pro Bowl linebacker; quarterback Warren Moon, cornerback
Willie Williams, defensive tackle Dan Saleaumua and strong safety
Bennie Blades; and the additions of cornerback Shawn Springs and
tackle Walter Jones in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   These Jets, 8-4 and tied for first in the AFC East, are better
than those Jets, who finished 9-7 and out of the playoffs in their
first season under coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' have scored more points (315) than every team in the
AFC except the unbeaten Denver Broncos. Vinny Testaverde is the
conference's top-rated passer (104.0). Running back Curtis Martin
last week became only the sixth player in NFL history to rush for
1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons. The mismatched duo
of Keyshawn Johnson (56 for 832, eight TDs) and Wayne Chrebet (56
for 830, six TDs) have put up almost identical receiving numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense ranks fourth in the league and has held five
of its last six opponents to fewer than 225 yards in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Seahawk personnel harbor we-owe-'em-one feelings.
But defensive end Michael Sinclair said there already is enough
riding on this game to provide ample motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to think about the Jets beating us last year. We
know what happened,'' Sinclair said. ``But this is an important
game. We're playing on one of the largest stages in the world. We
know their fans will be rowdy. They're one of the hottest teams in
the NFL right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown agrees. ``This is a completely different year. A different
team. A different time of year. We're fighting for a playoff spot.
So I'm not going to go back and look at that (game video). I don't
need additional motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Erickson is one who can't get the taste of last
year's slap in the face out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the video on, vomited halfway through it and threw it
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding. Wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember that,'' Erickson said. ``To get
embarrassed and humiliated. I wasn't proud of how we played. I
don't think anybody who played was very proud of how we played in
that game. Again, I'll remember that for a long time.''

NEW EXCUSES BUT SAME OLD RESULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Kings coach Larry Robinson tried something new
Wednesday night, praising his team rather than burying it, and
excusing its latest loss as the result of a hot arena, a grueling
travel schedule and bad bounces.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line was the same as in nine of the last 10
games. This time, it was a 3-1 setback to the Toronto Maple Leafs
in the second leg of a three-game trip that ends tonight in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto (14-9-2) got two goals by Sergei Berezin, three assists
by Mats Sundin, all its scoring on the power play and 27 saves by
Curtis Joseph in notching its seventh consecutive home victory
before a sellout crowd of 15,726 at Maple Leaf Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (6-15-3) got a shorthanded tying goal by Vladimir
Tsyplakov eight minutes into the third period, then tossed the game
right back to the Leafs by taking two penalties and allowing goals
to Berezin and Dimitri Yushkevich in the next five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a fragile team like ours, we have negative stuff going
through our heads,'' defenseman Doug Bodger said. ``The guys didn't
give up, but we're getting into a deep hole. It's tough to get out
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' performance was better than the one they gave in a
loss by an identical score two nights earlier in Montreal. They
made fewer defensive mistakes, gambled less on offense and had a
number of decent scoring chances. Still, though Robinson had
implored his players to create traffic in front of the opposing
net, there was not nearly enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a great job letting me see the puck and that's
key,'' Joseph said tellingly.
</P>
<P>
   And on one occasion when a King went to the net, it cost them,
with an apparent first-period go-ahead goal by Craig Johnson
nullified because Josh Green was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings stayed composed, but were undone by needless
penalties, Toronto scoring in the second period with Mark Visheau
in the box, and in the third with Glen Murray and Ray Ferraro
serving penalties.
</P>
<P>
   During another Visheau penalty, Tsyplakov recorded the Kings'
ninth shorthanded goal of the season, a double-edged statistic
because it is the same number of goals the Kings have scored on the
power play. The Kings were 0 for 4 against Toronto with the man
advantage despite adjustments by Robinson. The penalty killing,
meanwhile, has declined lately, too, after being impenetrable early
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, asked to rate his team's performance, Robinson said, ``It
was a great effort. Of the goals they scored, one, Berezin was
trying to get out of the way and the puck hits him, the second one
hit (Sean) O'Donnell's stick...that's the way it's going. Two
penalties hurt us and I thought they were a little borderline. We
shoot the puck and it goes off a stick and into the corner. They
shoot the puck and it goes off a stick and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hot in the building and you could see by the end of
the second period and the third period, guys were starting to slow
down a little bit. (Toronto) hasn't played in four days. It's a
little easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson made a curious decision when the Kings had a man
advantage with 2:20 left and his team down two goals, never opting
to pull goalie Jamie Storr to gain a two-man advantage and
afterward acknowledging he was trying to limit the final deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had scored early on the power play, I probably would
have done it,'' Robinson said. ``But when you're down by two, I
think at this point, the guys feel dejected enough. You pull the
goalie there and then they score to make it 4-1, I think it's just
a bigger downer for them.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Yankees are going to make a run at him, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles will be there, too. Cleveland might be in
the hunt, so might Anaheim, and so might the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the well-funded Atlanta Braves? Anything is
possible when it comes to the Braves, although adding Roger Clemens
to a staff that has three Cy Young winners not only would be
unfair, it would be a baseball merger along the lines of Exxon and
Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   But with much more gas.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the best pitcher in baseball no matter what kind of
Units one uses to measure greatness, officially is on the trade
market today. Late Wednesday, he asked the Toronto Blue Jays for a
trade and the Jays said they would grant it.
</P>
<P>
   It means virtually every team in the majors will give it a shot.
It means everyone will look hard at their lineup and try to find a
deal the Jays cannot refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will chase the Rocket. Everyone will check budgets and
salary caps. But not everyone is the Astros or Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of Wednesday's news called for Clemens to go only to a
contender, which Toronto also said it will try to accommodate.
Which leads to something altogether tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Barely more than a handful of teams in reality are in the hunt.
But only two of those teams woke up today knowing they must have
the early lead in the race for the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   One of those teams is the Texas Rangers, with all their deep
pockets, deep talent and thin skin, after their scrambling entry
into the 1998 playoffs and quick elimination by the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The other team is the Astros, who are on the verge of either the
World Series or a nervous breakdown, depending on how this Clemens
deal goes.
</P>
<P>
   You thought a homesick Ken Caminiti passing on $21.5 million
from Detroit put a lot of pressure on Drayton McLane Jr. and Gerry
Hunsicker to come through with a deal in the clutch?
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed. But as significant and pressure-packed as
Caminiti's signing had to be for McLane and Hunsicker, it was a
mere candlestick compared to the Clemens inferno raging before them
today.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was a sweet kind of pressure. Clemens is the kind of
pressure that could leave a sour taste in so many mouths,
especially if it is the Rangers who get him.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two words: Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This same Astros organization made countless new hometown
friends in 1979 when it signed Ryan, the free-agent local hero, to
the first $1 million-a-year contract in major-league sports.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that immediately gave the Astros a heart, changed
the perception and complexion of the club in this city and gave it
a national identity. It also made the Astros a contender for the
National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Some eight years later, everything changed when Ryan had to pack
and leave for the Metroplex and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros suddenly became the team that couldn't. Houston was
outdone by its rival from the Metroplex. Disgruntled fans forgot
their way to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ryan still was firing rockets, so to speak, just
up the road.
</P>
<P>
   He added no-hitters to his unprecedented list. He broke his own
strikeout record every time he stepped onto the hill. He became an
icon for the rest of the baseball world and a cruel reminder of
what could have been for Astros fans.
</P>
<P>
   And now, here is Clemens. Nolan of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is looking for a way to get to a title contender while
also hoping to get a little closer to home. He'll take New York or
Los Angeles, if that is the deal the Blue Jays ultimately make. But
he wants the Astros or the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   McLane and Hunsicker must be sick over the pressure they now
will be under. That is, when they're not giddy over it. After all,
how many opportunities to legitimately deal for a player of
Clemens' caliber and aura ever come along?
</P>
<P>
   This is a player who not only is a notch above even Randy
Johnson but is a bona fide legend in this town and this state even
before he comes home. Nolan of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Astros surely will be among the teams vigorously
chasing this deal. This is Clemens, possibly coming home and
possibly completing the circle that was broken when the Rangers
swiped Ryan a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, no guarantees the Astros will be able to
find a way to make the deal, much less fit Clemens' salary into
their budget.
</P>
<P>
   So many things must go right if it is going to happen for the
Astros. There would be so many legitimate excuses if it doesn't.
But surely, today McLane and Hunsicker are trying to find a way,
because they know there's only one thing worse than losing this
kind of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And that's losing it to the Rangers.

BARON IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins danced and dunked their way to
victory Wednesday night at Pauley Pavilion, but the loudest ovation
was for a substitution.
</P>
<P>
   With 13:22 remaining in the first half, sophomore guard Baron
Davis checked in for the first time this season _ ending his
eight-month rehabilitation as the Bruins ended their two-game
losing streak, disposing of Delaware State 109-67.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been practicing for weeks and was cleared to play
Wednesday afternoon by UCLA surgeon Gerald Finerman. He played 16
minutes and will remain on a restricted-minutes program for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The rehabilitation) is about what I anticipated, but it's not
what Baron anticipated,'' Finerman said. ``My thought was to have
him pretty well back by January. That's seven or eight months (from
the injury). That's the appropriate time table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have liked to have played in the first game (Santa Clara)
and in Puerto Rico, but we didn't feel he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which Davis' reconstructed left knee responded to
exertion sped his recovery. Once he was cleared to practice _ first
for noncontact work, then full throttle _ there was little if any
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very important aspect of his recovery,'' Finerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The range of motion in Davis' left knee is virtually identical
to that of his right, Finerman said. But there's no way to measure
the strength of the repaired anterior cruciate ligament, which he
tore in the NCAA Tournament's second round against Michigan. He'll
wear a brace during practices and games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be hampered this year by the brace,'' Finerman said.
``We'll have a decision next year about whether to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis entered the game to a standing ovation, received a hug
from guard Earl Watson, then went about his business _ dashing
around the court at high speed, slashing to the basket and finding
open teammates.
</P>
<P>
   His first assist took all of 18 seconds: He hit Rico Hines in
the right corner for a 3-pointer on his first offensive series.
With 11:47 left, he made two free throws for his first points of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis moved well but has not regained the quickness and leaping
ability that defined his pre-injury style. More, his conditioning
and timing are months behind, and he played in spurts of three or
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll play in game conditions for limited periods,'' Finerman
said. ``It's a progression of the intensity he's been working at.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' return overshadowed several noteworthy performances.
Freshman forward Jerome Moiso scored 11 of UCLA's first 16 points
as it charged to an early double-digit lead. Hines, perhaps the
Bruins' most improved shooter, made three 3-pointers in the half as
they extended the lead to 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, UCLA (3-2) played as expected against an overmatched
opponent. (Delaware State lost to New Hampshire and Drake before
Thanksgiving.) The Bruins dominated the rebounding and scored at
will from close range. They substituted freely _ although without
the rapid-fire style of the Puerto Rico Shootout _ and used
pressure defense to force 15 Delaware State turnovers in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Despite UCLA's large early lead, the Hornets did not wilt _ at
least not immediately. The Bruins committed 15 fouls in the first
half, enabling Delaware State to make more free throws (15) than
field goals (nine) and pull within 24-15 with 12 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hornets would get no closer. Travis Reed's three-point
play pushed UCLA's lead to 12 and began a stretch of 23 points in
10 possessions. JaRon Rush, who did not start, scored from the
lane, then Ray Young tipped in a Davis miss for a 31-15 lead. The
surge ended with Rush's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: UCLA used its fourth different starting lineup, with
Watson, Moiso, Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes and Ryan Bailey. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins play Oklahoma State on Saturday in the Wooden Classic
in Anaheim, then take a week off before facing Nevada-Las Vegas on
Dec. 12 at Pauley Pavilion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   UCLA scored 100 points for the 150th time in school history.

UNLV HIRES ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former USC coach John Robinson has accepted the
head-coaching position at Nevada-Las Vegas and is expected to be
formally introduced as the Rebels' new coach today.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 63, accepted the job less than a year after he was
fired by USC, where he led the Trojans to four Rose Bowl titles and
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing twice with UNLV officials last week, Robinson
delayed taking the job after being approached by another school.
According to sources in Hawaii, Robinson was courted this week by
the University of Hawaii, which fired coach Fred vonAppen last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson decided to stick with UNLV, however, which offered a
multiyear deal believed to be worth at least $400,000 per year,
along with several promises to upgrade the football program.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who flew to Las Vegas on Wednesday, could not be
reached for comment. He has been busy the past few days putting
together a coaching staff, which is full of members from his
previous staffs at USC.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked Notre Dame quarterbacks coach Mike Sanford to be
his assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach. Sanford coached at USC for nine years before leaving for
Notre Dame in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has also offered former USC assistant Jeff McInerney
the defensive coordinator's position. McInerney is the defensive
line coach at Oregon State. Another former USC assistant, Doug
Smith, is expected to become the Rebels' offensive-line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Former USC linebacker Joe Barry, an assistant at Northern
Arizona, has also been offered a position on the staff. A current
UNLV assistant, former USC player and assistant DelVaughn
Alexander, is expected to retain his position.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Robinson might have been
interested in USC offensive coordinator Hue Jackson, but sources
said there is no chance of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV athletic director Charles Cavagnaro hired Robinson because
he wanted a high-profile coach, and several of the school's
boosters agreed to contribute money to help pay for Robinson's
salary and other improvements in the football program. The Rebels
will join the new Mountain West Conference next season. They plan
to expand their football stadium to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fired by USC last December after four seasons in
his second tenure at the university. He was 37-22-2 but just 12-11
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he left USC with a 104-35-4 record, four Rose Bowl
titles and the 1978 national championship. Robinson also coached
the Los Angeles Rams for nine seasons (1983-91) and went 79-74.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Robinson won his 100th game at USC last season with
a 35-21 victory over UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Cavagnaro also considered were Indianapolis Colts
assistant coach Rod Marinelli, a former assistant under Robinson at
USC, Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick and Missouri assistant Ricky
Hunley.

RHODE ISLAND'S ODOM GOOD FOR COLLEGE GAME, EVEN IF FOR ONE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Coaches want to create on-the-floor mismatches. They
want the opposition to be constantly adjusting. They want players
for whom the other team has no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom is the kind of player who makes coaches' daydreams
come true. He is a player who creates problems for the other coach
and solves problems for his.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can play the point,'' Harrick said. ``He can play the wing.
He can play inside, just like we thought. He could play any
position we need him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, by the way, is 6-foot-10. Offensively, he is an all-around
talent. Last night in the Great Eight Basketball Classic, Odom was
the key as the Rams (4-3) beat No. 21 Utah, 70-63.
</P>
<P>
   When Rhode Island, which trailed throughout the first half,
needed a basket, the lefty-shooting Odom scored. When it needed a
pass for a score, Odom made it. For the Rams, he was _ and will be
_ the X factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lamar gains more experience, we'll run our offense
entirely through him. He handled the ball very well. He had a nice
line,'' said Harrick, reciting Odom's 15 points, six rebounds, six
assists, one turnover and two blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Ask TCU about his all-around ability. In the Horned Frogs'
season opener Nov. 9, Odom had 19 points, 14 rebounds and nine
assists in the Rams' 87-85 victory. He leads the team in scoring,
rebounding and assists.
</P>
<P>
   When Odom plays well, the Rams win. In the team's first six
games, he shot 67 percent in the team's three victories, 24 percent
in the three losses. ``He's got to perform, or we'll get beat,''
Harrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Odom's journey to Rhode Island is a story that raises eyebrows
and red flags. In high school, the New York native attended three
high schools his junior and senior years. He wanted to attend
Nevada-Las Vegas, but left there after his standardized test score
was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up at Rhode Island, but spent last season going to
school to prove his academic ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing college ball was something I always wanted to do,''
said Odom, who is listed as a sophomore. ``I'm having a lot of fun
right now. I'm not in a rush. I'm looking forward to playing
another couple of years of college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Insert your sarcastic ``Yeah, right.'' Questions remain about
Odom's commitment to class. It was probably unintentional, but in
an ESPN feature on Odom, he was shown strolling across campus _ and
nary a book was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that these Great Eight games are being played in the
United Center, The House That Michael Built, wasn't lost on Odom.
Neither was the fact that a bunch of idled NBA guys _ Tim Floyd,
Wes Unseld, Danny Ainge, Kevin McHale _ were in the house.
</P>
<P>
   And Odom knows that last spring's lure of declaring for the NBA
draft was fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys sitting around with nothing to do,''
he said. ``And they're probably watching college basketball games.
I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the early departures of players such as Antawn Jamison and
Paul Pierce, the college game needs the influx of players like
Odom, even if he's a one-year wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You going to put a small guy on him? He'll post him up,''
Harrick said, barely containing his glee about coaching such a
talent. ``You put a big guy on him, he can go past him. He has some
skills that are beyond a guy his size. It
</P>
<P>
   makes us very versatile and hard to guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of saying ``mismatch.''

ANALYSIS: DEMOCRATS SAY SEX LIES DON'T WARRANT IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress careens toward a historic vote on
impeachment, Democrats have settled on a three-pronged defense of
their president _ his offense is not so serious; you can't prove he
did it; and the inquiry is grossly unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, the 16 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee
have returned to these points, whether their witness is independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who testified two weeks ago, or the former
coach of the University of South Carolina women's basketball team,
who testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense does not paint a handsome portrait of the 42nd
president of the United States. No one on the House Judiciary
Committee, even President Clinton's staunchest defenders, has
rebutted the specific facts contained in Starr's report, which
chronicled Clinton's sexual relationship with a young White House
intern and his subsequent efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Democratic case resonates with a large segment of the
public, which long ago tired of the scandal. And if the arguments
can be used to persuade even 15 of the House's 228 Republicans to
vote against impeachment, the matter will likely die on the House
floor in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question before us is not whether or not perjury is a
crime or whether it applies to sex or whether it applies in civil
cases,'' said Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., responding to a litany of
specific issues raised by GOP witnesses during the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question before us is whether or not we should vote to
impeach the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer for every Democratic member of the committee _ and
for all but perhaps three of the 206 Democrats in the House _ is
no.
</P>
<P>
   It would take ``a meteor to hit,'' said Rep. Ellen Tauscher,
D-Calif., when asked what it would compel her to change her
position against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, one of only 31 Democrats to vote in favor of the
impeachment inquiry this fall, described Clinton's behavior as
``indefensible and inappropriate,'' but said it is unworthy of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have struggled all year with how to condemn Clinton's
actions without handing Republicans a club with which to destroy
their party's leader. The impeachment inquiry has helped Democrats
coalesce around the same message offered by Tauscher _ Clinton's
behavior is wrong but does not warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that the president's actions are not impeachable
and that these proceedings should end,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has been saying publicly what nearly all Democrats
concede privately.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has repeatedly declared that he believes Clinton lied to
the American people, lied during a civil deposition and lied to a
criminal grand jury
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schumer contends impeachment is too drastic a punishment,
warning that ``we're hurdling headlong into a constitutional crisis
which the American people, in their wisdom, have begged us to rein
in and reject.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic defense rests on the proposition that some lies
are less egregious than others. Former federal Judge A. Leon
Higginbotham Jr., called to testify before the Judiciary Committee
this week by Democrats, argued that ``perjury has gradations,''
noting that nobody would impeach a president for lying about how
fast he was driving if he were disputing a speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many Democrats have argued that lying about sex under
oath does not warrant a penalty so severe that Congress has imposed
it against one president in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that the president's answers regarding his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky are great and dangerous
offenses,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who accused previous
GOP presidents of engaging in far more serious dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   People ``understand intuitively that the framers of the
Constitution reserved high crimes and misdemeanors for the abuses
practiced by Presidents Reagan and Bush and not for President
Clinton's misleading statements about an embarrassing affair,''
Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of going softer on ``sex lies'' is flatly rejected by
many Republicans, who find it particularly repugnant that the
nation's chief law enforcement officer would seek to deceive the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   They have portrayed their case against Clinton as one of simple
fairness, noting that thousands of other Americans have been
punished for perjury. That is why the GOP brought forth two
witnesses this week who had successfully been prosecuted for lying
under oath about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exploring whether there's one rule of law for the
powerful, for the rulers, and another one for the ruled,''
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., snapped at one point after
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., wondered aloud about the usefulness of
this week's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   As the Judiciary Committee approaches the end of its inquiry _
the committee is expected to finish its work next week _ Democrats
have begun to argue that the GOP has neglected its burden to
corroborate the evidence contained in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   No one has produced any evidence _ or even offered any
assertions _ to contradict Starr's findings. But Democrats are
aware that to confirm the information _ let along prove the case
beyond a reasonable doubt _ Republicans would need to call
witnesses to discuss highly personal matters, such as the intimate
details of Clinton and Lewinsky's sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   Without that evidence, Democrats maintain that there is no proof
Clinton lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen no proof that he committed perjury,'' Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., said at one point Tuesday, prompting an exasperated
Hyde to respond: ``Well, have lunch with Mr. Schumer, maybe he will
inform you.''
</P>
<P>
   As a final piece of their strategy, Democrats are embracing a
message put forth by the White House since the first days of the
scandal _ attack the investigation as unfair, overzealous and a
distraction from important matters.
</P>
<P>
   Every Democrat on the committee has taken a moment to criticize
the process employed by either Starr or the GOP-run impeachment
panel. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt wrote a letter to
outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., this week, in which he
expressed his ``deepest concern regarding the management of the
House investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was his turn to question witnesses this week, Rep.
Robert Wexler, D-Fla., demurred, looking into the television
cameras instead and complained: ``I am afraid that this committee
has become the theater of the absurd.''

ASTRONAUTS SET TO BEGIN BUILDING HISTORY'S BIGGEST PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    A last-minute halt to the scheduled launch of the Space Shuttle
Endeavor before dawn Thursday posptoned the start of construction
in orbit for the long-planned International Space Station.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut were prepared
as the first crew to begin assembling the most complex, most costly
and arguably the most dangerous single construction project in
history, but Space Agency officials said the launch could come at
any time during the next two days, and even later after if need be
after a two-day stand-down.
</P>
<P>
   The multibillion-dollar project _ which is dominated by American
initiatives but includes 15 other nations _ will require 45 space
missions over the next five years to assemble the huge structure as
it orbits nearly 250 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To NASA chief Daniel Goldin, the station is ``an unprecedented
undertaking in scientific, technological and international
experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   But many researchers fear that the station's rapidly mounting
costs may threaten budgets for future robotic exploration of the
solar system, its asteroids and the distant birthplace of comets _
ventures like the hugely successful Pathfinder mission to Mars and
the Galileo exploration of Jupiter and its moons.
</P>
<P>
   Those probes were tiny craft, but when completed in 2004, the
740-ton International Space Station will stretch longer than a
football field; deploy a half-acre span of solar power panels;
carry eight miles of electric wiring and 52 computers; and link six
laboratories to living quarters for seven scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the enterprise is to conduct at least a decade of
unique scientific research that is possible only in the weightless
environment of space. The hope is that such research will yield
everything from basic insights into the formation of the universe
to practical advances in human health and industrial materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a world community living and working together in
space, improving life on Earth and expanding humanity's horizons
for the 21st century,'' said Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   The main mission for the crew of the shuttle Endeavour after it
is launched is to link the first two modules of the space station
together _ the historic start of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   One module is the 20-ton Russian unmanned unit dubbed Zarya, or
Sunrise, which is already in orbit waiting to provide propulsion,
power and communications for construction crews during the early
stages of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour is to haul up the first American module, named Unity,
which will be mated in space with Zarya by two of the astronauts,
working six hours at a stretch, outside the shuttle. It will take
them three successive spacewalks while tethered for safety to the
shuttle to do the job. &QL; 
 &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A large-scale space station was first proposed by President
Ronald Reagan in 1984, and the European Space Agency signed on two
years later. At that time, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration budgeted $8.5 billion for its share of the project.
Russia joined in the project when the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Clinton, the U.S. share rose to $17.4 billion,
and NASA's most recent estimate says the price could reach $24.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning, for although the other 15 nations
are supposed to contribute up to $15 billion more, the Russian
space agency is virtually bankrupt and their program is in
disarray. Russian Proton rockets and Soyuz spacecraft, however, are
vital to the enterprise, and America may well have to pick up much
of the original Russian contribution, estimated at about $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   So construction and hardware alone will cost at least $40
billion between now and 2004, and with five years of shuttle
missions budgeted at $3 billion a year, the final space station
cost could well exceed $100 billion during its planned 10-year
operational lifetime. &QL; 
 &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The station's science and engineering missions are by no means
settled yet, but their extraordinarily ambitious and varied
experiments seem to promise something for almost everyone in
science _ at least as NASA officials describe them.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in the ``microgravity'' laboratories, for example,
could yield such results as ``better electronic devices, improved
telecommunications, and stronger, more durable artificial limbs,''
NASA says.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists and chemists aboard the station will study how to
attack earthly pollution and global warming, while other
experiments will be designed to improve the accuracy of
``noninvasive medical diagnostics,'' according to NASA mission
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term studies are expected to add greatly to knowledge about
the effects of weightlessness on the human body gained during past
shuttle flights and long-term stays by Russians and Americans
aboard Russia's 13-year-old Mir space station. That kind of
information is essential if humans are ever to venture for months,
or even years, to distant planets.
</P>
<P>
   And with an eight-foot centrifuge aboard the American laboratory
module in the International Space Station, scientists will study
the effects of varying artificial gravity on cultured cells and
tissues, plants, insects, rats, mice, fish and on the eggs of birds
and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the station is completed in 2004, a team of
Americans and Russians will mount Expedition 1, the first to take
up residence in the station and begin research in space in January
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Later will come other international teams with members from
Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Many
of the nations will be sending researchers qualified as astronauts,
while others will work only on the ground, using data gathered by
their equipment aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Although Goldin sees this international aspect as the opening of
a truly global commitment to research in space, others outside NASA
view it more as political.
</P>
<P>
   Says John Pike, director of the Space Policy Project of the
American Federation of Scientists: ``The space station is obviously
important, and we've never done anything like this before. But it's
not really a science project, and in no way are we doing it for its
scientific value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political project, a foreign policy project, a national
security project _ and a national prestige project, too.'' &QL; 
 &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Then there is the safety issue. All space flight is dangerous,
of course, and the death of seven astronauts when the Challenger
exploded minutes after launch on January 28, 1986, is testimony to
the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 45 flights needed to carry people plus nearly a
million pounds of hardware to the space station during
construction, 34 will be American and 11 will be Russian. Each
launch has its dangers, but beyond that lie the perils of outer
space _ from tiny micrometeoroids no larger than marbles bombarding
and perhaps puncturing vital space station components to
unanticipated explosive malfunctions of the station's complex
equipment and life-support systems.
</P>
<P>
   Studies at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston assume there
will be some damage from collisions with orbiting space debris or
meteors, while other studies by federal agencies calculate that
there is at least a 40 percent chance of fatal accidents during the
construction period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space flight is always dangerous,'' says John Pike. ``Even
building a skyscraper or a bridge on Earth takes lives, so you have
to assume that constructing this enormous project in space will be
even more dangerous. It's very likely that some life will be
lost.''

SWANN ROLLS DICE  
 SURGICAL PROCEDURE COULD EXTEND CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The surgical procedure that Cardinals defensive
tackle Eric Swann is scheduled to undergo Monday in Vail, Colo., is
far more than just another arthroscopic ``flush'' of his arthritic
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Richard Steadman, who will perform the surgery, is one of
the pioneers of a relatively new and revolutionary procedure called
``microfracture,'' which could potentially prolong the career of a
player with Swann's problem for years.
</P>
<P>
   Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, confirmed Wednesday that Swann will
undergo a full microfracture procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the procedure stimulates the patient's healing
systems to create new cartilage-like tissue to replace defective or
missing cartilage. Cartilage is the body's padding between bone
surfaces, and Swann has been playing, literally, with bone in
contact with bone.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon in professional athletes, but it is for a
player as young as Swann, 28. Already, Swann has undergone surgery
six times on his knees, twice on the left and four on the right,
including a arthroscopic flush that was performed Oct. 28 because
of continued pain and swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could go ahead and try to play the rest of the season on
it, but Dr. Steadman told him the knee is weaker now than it was
before the last procedure,'' Zucker said. ``He told Eric that his
career might be in danger if he doesn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is getting bashed in Phoenix, but when it's all over
with, this may allow him to go and play eight more years for the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric . . . wants to be out there playing with those guys.
They're in the playoff race, and he wants to be part of this. But
Dr. Steadman didn't give him much of a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Chick, the Cardinals orthopedic surgeon, would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since Swann made the decision to undergo another surgery, he has
been widely criticized, and his toughness has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the procedure he will undergo is not easy. It requires
extensive _ and painful _ rehabilitation, including what is known
as Continuous Passive Motion, in which the patient's leg is moved
constantly by a machine for up to eight hours a day for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires that the patient remain on crutches for six to
eight weeks. Total rehabilitation takes six to seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is really going to have to work hard at this,'' Zucker
said. ``They've told him there is a 70 percent chance for
improvement and a 30 percent chance that he'll end up the same as
when he started. The rehabilitation is the key, and he'll be
staying up there in Colorado for it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the procedure offers a lot of promise for an athlete
such as Swann, who has severe, localized arthritis in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two or three procedures employed for localized
arthritic defects,'' said Dr. Richard Emerson, the Suns orthopedic
surgeon who has performed the microfracture procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson emphasized that he is not familiar with Swann's
particular case and could only comment in general about treatment
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``One option is a cartilage transfer,'' Emerson said.
``Cartilage from a safe zone in the knee is transferred to the area
with the defect. It's like lawn plugs in your yard. The intention
is to cover the defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is a microfracture technique. Dr. Steadman is one
of the people who developed that technique.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartilage transfer and the microfracture procedures can be
done in unison, further improving the patient's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The third technique, Emerson said, is one developed in Sweden
that entails taking a biopsy of cartilage tissue and making a
culture from which new tissue is grown. It then is re-implanted in
the defective area of the knee. It is a more expensive procedure
and requires more time because it takes about three weeks to grow
the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Steadman said he will not be available for
comment until next week. But according to literature provided by
the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic, in the microfracture procedure small
holes, or ``microfractures,'' are drilled into the bone near the
defective cartilage. This releases bone marrow cells and ``growth
factors'' into the defect.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to stimulate the body's healing systems to form new
cartilage-like tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The joint first is cleared of any damaged tissue. In Swann's
case, there shouldn't be much because he just underwent the
cleaning Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   After the holes are drilled, allowing the rich growth material
into the defective area, a replacement surface of cartilage-like
cushion between bare bone surfaces is formed in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steadman's literature, he has performed the
procedure on more than 300 patients ranging in age from 13 to 69
over the past five years, and preliminary results show that many
patients experience improved function and decreased pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Eric talked with Dr. Steadman, he was both sad and
happy,'' Zucker said. ``He's sad that his season is over, but he's
happy that at least he knows it's going to be fixed.'' &QL;

D-BACKS, FINLEY NEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Randy Johnson and his family had no sooner pulled away
from Bank One Ballpark on Wednesday afternoon when managing general
partner Jerry Colangelo was back on the phone working yet another
blockbuster deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks appeared to be on the verge of landing center
fielder Steve Finley late Wednesday night after Colangelo basically
blew any other offer the one-time All-Star had away with his own
four-year $20 million proposal, several major league sources
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had his representative, Tommy Tanzer, attempt to work out
an 11th hour deal that would have kept Finley in San Diego, where
he has played the past four seasons. The Padres, however, were
unwilling to budge off their three-year offer that would have paid
Finley $12 million. Finley and the Padres said their goodbyes late
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very close to being an ex-Padre,'' Finley told the ``San
Diego'' ``Union-Tribune.'' ``We're as close to having a deal done
as you can be and not have a signed contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr.
were unsuccessful. Colangelo, who was en route to New York City for
another round of NBA bargaining sessions, also was unavailable.
With Garagiola, who will attend an owners meeting today in Chicago,
and Colangelo both out of town, the deal might not be final until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, or Diamondbucks as they're being called in
some baseball circles, decided to go after Finley, who has averaged
151 games over the past four seasons, to shore up their outfield,
which is generally considered their weak link.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal becomes official, the Diamondbacks will have signed
six free agents in the past three weeks, having guaranteed $116.9
million for the services of Johnson ($52.4 million), Todd
Stottlemyre ($32 million), Greg Swindell ($5.7 million), Armando
Reynoso ($5 million), Greg Colbrunn ($1.8 million) and Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Colangelo insisted the Diamondbacks were through pursuing
big-ticket free agents once they landed Johnson three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who turns 34 next March, has seen his batting average
and, more important, his on-base percentage slide in the wrong
direction in each of the past two seasons. After batting .298 with
with 30 home runs and 95 RBIs in 1996 and finishing 10th in the
Most Valuable Player balloting, Finley saw his average slip to .261
the next year and .249 this year.
</P>
<P>
   More startling, Finley's on-base percentages of .313 and .301
the past two seasons ranked last among the Padres eight regulars
each season. But Finley, who was hampered by a bunion that required
surgery leaving him on crutches most of last winter, recently
admitted he may have gotten too carried away with his phenomenal
1996 season and attempted to become more of a home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to force the issue, and my body wouldn't respond,''
Finley told the ``San Diego Union-Tribune'' two weeks ago. ``Last
year my swing got a little long because I was trying to force
things that were not there. It was more of a pride thing. I let my
pride get in the way. That is one thing we've always talked about
in our clubhouse: Check your pride at the door. That's one thing I
failed to do, as far as my hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's primary attribute, one which won him consecutive Gold
Gloves in 1995 and '96, is his ability to track down fly balls as
well as anyone in the game. With Bank One Ballpark's expansive and
quirky center field, this was definitely a concern for the
ballclub.

A TRANSATLANTIC LOVE AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letters to Nelson Algren
</P>
<P>
   By Simone de Beauvoir.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 559 pp. New York: The New Press. $27.50.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; HOT AND EPISTOLARY &QL; 
 &UR; By MIM UDOVITCH &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In April 1947, Jean-Paul Sartre changed his plans, and as a
result Simone de Beauvoir extended her stay in America, where she
had recently completed a lecture tour, long enough to begin the
affair with Nelson Algren chronicled in the letters to him
collected in ``A Transatlantic Love Affair.'' The Algren-Beauvoir
relationship, which lasted in one form or another for almost two
decades, began its long, episodic disintegration a little more than
a year after it began. Misled, perhaps, by her habit of addressing
him as ``beloved husband'' and describing herself as ``your loving
wife'' (and on one occasion, ``your naked moaning wife''), Algren
asked Beauvoir to marry him. And while it is only fair to note that
he was no more willing to move to France, or even to learn French,
than she was to move to Chicago, it is also clear that although in
the end she was technically the rejectee, she wanted only courtship
where he wanted marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Beauvoir's behavior, and her explanation for her
refusal of Algren's proposals, mimics (and makes as little logical
sense as) a married man's excuses to his mistress: Darling, I love
you more than anything, but my previous commitments make it
impossible for us to be together; nevertheless, you are the most
important thing in my life (except Sartre). After Beauvoir had
spent a year writing things like ``When I think of seeing you, of
feeling you, I become all dizzy in my head. . . . My throat becomes
so tight, and my mouth dry. It will come true, in less than a month
it will come true,'' she again changed her plans at the last minute
because Sartre changed his, reducing her time with Algren from
three months to two. (``I've often wondered what part his sudden
disappointment actually played in our affair,'' she writes,
cluelessly, in her roman a clef, ``The Mandarins.'')
</P>
<P>
   Beauvoir's relationship with Algren could be said to have
existed at some point midway between being and nothingness: in
touch from 1947 to 1964, they spent less than a year and a half in
each other's physical presence, mostly in holiday pursuits, with
much of that time, according to Beauvoir's other autobiographical
writings, filled with anxiety, frustration and petty
dissatisfaction. ``I wandered through the crowd of strangers
gulping down one drink after another,'' she writes in ``After the
War: Force of Circumstance,'' the first volume of her third memoir,
of one trip to Chicago. ``I literally didn't know what to do with
myself.'' In her letters to Algren, in a medium that is by
definition controlled by the mediator, she creates the epistolary
equivalent of a bodice-ripper: She is a protofeminist,
existentialist Frenchwoman trapped in a masochistic, asexual
relationship with a four-foot-ten, walleyed, amphetamine-addicted
genius. He is a lyrical, wry, urban-realist writer from Chicago, an
advocate for the downtrodden and a former member of the Communist
Party. Despite his underrecognized greater gift as a novelist and
eventual neurotic, alcoholic decline, and her superior, not to say
groundbreaking, contribution to the world of 20th-century arts and
letters, together they share an ardent anti-Gaullist love.
</P>
<P>
   Simone de Beauvoir may have loved Algren more than anyone
(except Sartre), but, as she would have been the first to tell you,
she was also better than practically anyone (except Sartre). ``I do
not respect many people,'' she says. In the course of these
letters, she also remarks that she does not care very much for her
woman friends; her sister; her sister's paintings; Sartre's mother
and her own mother; and, among many other things, the French
occupation of Algeria. She does not care for John F. Kennedy (``I
hate this grinning boy and his grinning wife''). She finds it too
tedious when newspaper people show up at train stations when she
and Sartre are traveling, boring her with their stupid questions
about existentialism. Following one dinner with the novelist
Violette Leduc, whom she invariably refers to as an ``ugly woman,''
she writes: ``She gave me the manuscript of a book she is writing
and it is a diary in which she tells everything about her love for
me. It is a wonderful book.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce Beauvoir to her personal-ad components, she likes
Giacometti, Charlie Chaplin, the picturesque poor, travel,
landscapes, Scotch and not much else (except Sartre). In general,
there is little in her correspondence with Algren to contradict the
impression made by earlier diaries and letters that she is a very,
very smart woman but also a more unpleasant person than practically
anyone (again, need I add, except Sartre). What little there is,
however, is very sweet. The relationship was passionate; Sartre was
no good in bed, Beauvoir informs Algren, while he has aroused in
her ``great new sexual longing and happiness.'' This does not say
much for her previous longtime man-on-the-side, the writer Jacques
Bost, or for Arthur Koestler, with whom she had a one-night stand.
``We were attracted by each other but in the same time there were
'political discrepancies,' '' she solemnly tells Algren. ``He
thought I was not anti-Communist enough.'' Nor does it speak well
for the lesbian affairs she conducted while carrying out the
seduction of her young lycee students in order to later pimp them
over to her partner in superiority. Nevertheless, she is, in the
letters, often surprisingly adorable, partly because of the
linguistic limitations imposed by writing in English (``I felt I
could not sleep before telling you I love you so much; it seemed
very urging''). In fact, at times she sounds positively like a
Gabor sister. ``I should like you to put him K.O.,'' she says of
Louis Bromfield, an enemy of existentialism with whom Algren was to
participate in a panel on writing.

   However, there is an unmistakable tone of condescension running
through these letters. Beauvoir's diary of the trip on which she
met Algren, AMERICA DAY BY DAY (forthcoming in translation in
January, University of California, $27.50), extends this attitude
to the entire country; she evidently felt that the United States
was a simple enough proposition to a thinker like herself that she
could see the true meaning of the place from Harlem to Hollywood
just by passing through. Beauvoir arranged to have Algren's writing
published in the journal she edited with Sartre, Les Temps
Modernes, but this comes across more as radical-chic territorial
scent-marking than an act of respect; she rarely makes any comment
on the work except that it is difficult to translate. She
periodically complains that Algren will not learn French, and
therefore cannot read most of her publications, but on some level
she must have known that his role as theoretical boy-toy would have
been compromised if he could. All too often she uses baby talk that
seems to proceed not only from fondness but from the belief that
she is actually addressing a small child: ``When you look at the
landscape . . . you feel on the moon rather than on earth,'' she
writes. ``Would you like to be on the moon with me, darling, or
would you be afraid?'' Her viewing Algren as an object -- and, not
being one to waste material, a subject -- is supported by his not
having been her first choice when Sartre told her to stay in
America so that he could spend more time with his passionate love
of the time, Dolores Vanetti. (What were these people thinking?)
She first called a married man in New York, but he turned her down.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point in terms of literary valuation, this
correspondence does not reflect any respect for Algren's
intellectual opinion. His letters are not included, but Beauvoir's
responses make clear his attempts at literary dialogue and her
dismissals. Yes, she has read Melville, or James or Dreiser. A long
while ago. When she was quite a young girl. ``Thank you for so much
more than a book,'' she writes, ``even by Edith Wharton.'' They
never like the same movies. During the period covered here, the
industrious and prolific Beauvoir wrote ``The Second Sex'' and
``Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter,'' and he wrote ``The Man With the
Golden Arm,'' which won the National Book Award. But the letters
contain little information on these undertakings beyond that they
were occurring: ``I work hard on the book about women. When it will
be written, darling, men will know everything about women and so
they will not be interested in them anymore. It will do a big
change in the world. But for crocodiles and frogs indeed,'' she
says, using their pet names, ``it will not make any difference at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters are also sometimes unintentionally comical in their
juxtaposition of pillow talk and events, in a way that boiled down
to its essence might produce a postcard reading, ``Beloved, how I
long and long to be in your arms. There was an article about Sartre
in the newspaper today, with pictures. We tried to stop fascism
again, but still no luck. Wish you were here!'' In the preface,
Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, who was Beauvoir's final companion and
adopted daughter, asserts that the letters are unique because the
cultural difference between the correspondents necessitated
explanation. This is true, but it's difficult to see how the record
is aided by an explanation like ``They were tremendously interested
by Sartre's 'Flies'; it was written during German occupation, and
the general meaning was: when you have put yourself in a bad mess,
don't have remorses about it, but try to act and make things
better.'' We also learn that one night everybody got drunk and
Koestler punched Camus.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Beauvoir expresses what Colette and Proust have
taught me to believe is a classically convoluted French literary
approach to love: she is sad that they are apart, and writing in
floods of tears, but she is happy in her sadness because they are
together in it. Or something like that. Her pain was probably none
the less real for it. Nor was her love for Algren likely to have
been any less real for the fact that what she writes has been also
said in a thousand Cole Porter lyrics. Nor, in fact, is the value
of her work diminished by her having such an annoying personality.
For her era, the way she lived and what she wrote, in ``The Second
Sex'' especially, was intellectually courageous almost beyond
overstatement. Her commitment to her work, and to the processing of
her life into her work, was the source of her final break with
Algren: he reacted publicly and bitterly to her portrayal of him in
``The Mandarins'' and ``Force of Circumstance.'' Given the
negligible role he is allotted and its opposition to the constant
assertion in Beauvoir's letters that he was the center of her
world, this is unsurprising. So is the fact that a woman who wrote,
in ``The Second Sex,'' that sex ``in effect puts woman into a state
of dependency on man'' opted for a union of the mind, as, in a
different way, she did with Sartre. In the end, the self-reflexive
romance of ``A Transatlantic Love Affair'' demonstrates a sadly
Cartesian proposition: I write love letters, therefore I love.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993.
</P>
<P>
   By Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 1,050 pp. New York: Random House. $39.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; TWO ON THE AISLE &QL; 
 &UR; By HARLOW ROBINSON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Critics _ especially theater critics _ must expect to be hated.
The wiser among them even enjoy the contempt, for they understand
their colorful and essential role as villains in the larger drama
of the theatrical enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Few drama critics have inspired more fear, loathing and
indignation, however, than Frank Rich, the legendary ``Butcher of
Broadway.'' From 1980 to 1993, Rich served as the chief drama
critic for The New York Times. Now, in the aptly titled ``Hot
Seat,'' he has assembled approximately one-quarter of the reviews
and essays he delivered from that bully pulpit, formerly occupied
by Alexander Woolcott, Brooks Atkinson and Walter Kerr. Equipped
with an introduction, some hindsight, some insider gossip and a few
amusing ``best'' and ``worst'' lists, the result is an exuberant,
enthralling and wistful volume no less valuable as
social-economic-political history than as a definitive chronicle of
the era's theatrical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Rich sooner or later incurred the wrath of almost everyone he
wrote about. He was denounced repeatedly from the stage at the Tony
Awards. Directors, producers and actors regularly accused him of
single-handedly closing their shows. The producer David Merrick
even called Rich ``a savage dog'' on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Exit the Critic,'' published as a valedictory in The New
York Times Magazine in early 1994 and anthologized here, Rich
expresses a wry amusement at the furious passions his reviews used
to unleash: ``Critics may not be, as is generally presumed,
frustrated actors or playwrights, but few of us mind playing our
assigned role in the timeless sideshows of the rialto.'' Elsewhere,
he muses that the virulence of the hatred directed at his strong
opinions was directly proportionate to the theater's growing
inability to compete with television and film for mainstream
American audiences, performers and writers. To blame Frank Rich was
far easier than to confront the unpleasant fact that many, if not
most, of the seats in the dwindling number of Broadway theaters
were being filled by foreign tourists barely fluent in English but
happy to pay the ever-increasing ticket prices for shows with
mountains of scenery and deafening miking.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hot Seat,'' Rich is eager to debunk the myth of his and The
Times's omnipotence. Obviously, the crowds didn't stay away because
of his lukewarm response to ``Cats'' (``If you blink, you'll miss
the plot'') and most of the other blockbusters by Andrew Lloyd
Webber. Nor did his praise of high-minded productions like ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' or ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' keep them open.
Rich cites further examples in lists like ``The Power of The Times
Revisited 1: Rave Reviews, Short Broadway Runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you think about Rich's opinions, there's no denying
that he's an impressive writer and thinker. Residing in New York
for much of the period, I turned eagerly each morning to his
artfully fashioned pieces, anticipating another good column and at
least a few laughs. Rereading them now, I have been happily
reliving the sights, smells, sounds and words of many wonderful,
and some god-awful, evenings in the theater and experiencing others
that I missed.
</P>
<P>
   Who was better at the lethal apercu than Frank Rich?
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the actor Philip Casnoff not been beaned by a falling slab
of scenery at a press preview last week, 'Shogun: The Musical'
might have been best remembered as the first Broadway musical
extravaganza to beguile an audience with a song about a dildo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Capped Teeth and Caesar Salad,'' a song from ``Song &AMP; Dance,''
starring Bernadette Peters, ``recycles Beverly Hills jokes that had
seen better days when Joan Rivers was still in college.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair, too, to remember the conditions under which Rich
labored. Writing on deadline with impatient editors breathing down
his neck, he still managed to construct apparently seamless
miniature essays. As an occasional critic myself, I tell you this
takes talent, discipline and nerves.
</P>
<P>
   There was much more to Rich's success than nasty quips and
one-liners. If anything, the sting of his reviews has faded with
time, and what remains behind are different, more enduring
qualities: a thorough historical and artistic knowledge of American
and British theatrical tradition; an encyclopedic familiarity with
the work of a wide variety of performers, directors and playwrights
currently active in the theater; and an infectious passion for this
evanescent and impossible medium.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the ``330-odd pieces'' collected here tend to
favor shows the critic enjoyed (almost anything by Stephen
Sondheim) or judged significant artistically (``House of Blue
Leaves,'' ``M. Butterfly,'' ``Cinders'') or commercially (``Cats,''
``Phantom of the Opera''). But Rich has also been careful to
include famous bombs. For him, nothing will top the notorious
``Moose Murders'': ``A visit to 'Moose Murders' is what will
separate the connoisseurs of Broadway disaster from mere
dilettantes for many moons to come.''
</P>
<P>
   As engrossing as the reviews themselves may be, the juiciest
parts of ``Hot Seat'' are the spicy italicized postscripts
sprinkled here and there. These include sobering ``Whatever
happened to . . .?'' vignettes, as well as dishy tales of backstage
intrigue. At the end of his largely favorable notice on the revival
of ``The King and I'' with Yul Brynner, Rich relates how the
imperious star (``not an easy guy'') demanded to be transported by
motorcade the few blocks from the theater to an appearance on
``Nightline.'' To the review of the revival of ``The Front Page,''
staged by Jerry Zaks, that finally brought the Vivian Beaumont
Theater at Lincoln Center back to life in 1986 he appends a
well-informed commentary on why thrust stages like the one at the
Beaumont proved so unsuccessful wherever they were built.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SEAT-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: were built.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While no one will mistake ``Hot Seat'' for a novel, it contains
numerous narrative strands. Probably the most important, and most
poignant, are the story of AIDS and the arrival of numerous gay
characters in plays and musicals both on and Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   News of the strange new epidemic hit the Times just as Rich
began his tenure there. One of the first AIDS play he saw was
William Hoffman's ``As Is'' in 1985. To his credit, Rich got out
front early on the issue, and reviewed (for the most part
favorably) the growing number of AIDS plays that appeared in the
coming years, from Larry Kramer's ``Normal Heart'' (which he admits
he at first undervalued) to Richard Greenberg's ``Eastern
Standard'' (an overlooked minor masterpiece, I agree) to Tony
Kushner's ``Angels in America: Millennium Approaches'' and ``Angels
in America: Perestroika.'' That Rich chooses to end the final
season in ``Hot Seat'' with his adoring, even transcendent, review
of ``Perestroika'' shows just how highly he rates Kushner's
emotional and artistic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Remembered here, too, are the numerous important theater people
lost to AIDS: among them, the playwrights Scott McPherson and Harry
Kondoleon; the choreographer Michael Bennett; and Charles Ludlam,
the wild and wildly gifted director of the Ridiculous Theatrical
Company. In a wise and humane 1992 Sunday essay, Rich describes how
he took his two sons (then aged 12 and 8) to see the gay musical
``Falsettos.'' ``I wanted to take my children to an entertainment,
a musical no less, that reinforces the notion that there are many
ways to be masculine.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, this essay (``Discovering Family Values at
'Falsettos' ``), not dissimilar to the pieces Rich now produces for
the Times Op-Ed page, marked the beginning of his transition to
another kind of writing. As he tells it in ``Exit the Critic,'' the
incessant attacks on his personal and professional integrity began
to wear him down. The disappearance of serious musicals and dramas
from Broadway, and the vastly changed economics of producing and
ticket prices, depressed him. But the last straw was the deaths of
his mother and the visionary New York producer Joseph Papp, founder
of the Public Theater. The joy had gone out of the work. ``I found
myself more interested in writing about the world itself rather
than just the theater's vision of that world.'' It was time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   When the playwright Herb Gardner received the Tony Award for
Best Play for ``I'm Not Rappaport'' more than 12 years ago, he
bragged to the audience that his success showed that ``there's life
after Frank Rich.'' Judging by this vibrant, eloquent and often
moving collection, the same can be said for Frank Rich himself.

 THE PHYSICS OF CHRISTMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aerodynamics of Reindeer to Thermodynamics of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   By Roger Highfield.
</P>
<P>
   293 pp. Boston: Little, Brown &AMP; Company. $20.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; YES, VIRGINIA, THERE IS A SPACE-TIME WAVE &QL; 
 &UR; By SIMON SINGH &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Each year the science journalist Roger Highfield searches for
stories with a Christmas angle _ the evolution of gift giving, the
mystery of the Star of Bethlehem, how reindeer fly, cloned
Christmas trees and anything else that might add flavor to his
column in The Daily Telegraph of London. He has now gathered them
in a delightful compendium of seasonal science, ``The Physics of
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many might feel that scientific analysis of festive phenomena
would destroy the spirit of Christmas. Indeed, this is possible, as
demonstrated by the British scientist Richard Dawkins. In his book
``Unweaving the Rainbow,'' he explains that Santa would have to
travel faster than the speed of sound to visit all the children in
the world in a single night. Hence, as he accelerates to and from
each house, his sleigh would break the sound barrier, thereby
generating a tremendous shock wave and a sonic boom. Because we
never hear this sonic boom, Dawkins claims that Santa does not
exist. In fact, he proudly admits to using this argument to
disprove the existence of Santa to a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   However, Highfield's approach to the science of Christmas is
quite the opposite. Relying on the research of an eminent list of
scholars from around the world, he endeavors to enrich our
understanding of everything associated with the holiday, providing
genuine insights as well as fanciful speculation. For example, the
reason we do not hear deafening sonic booms on Christmas Eve is
that Santa's sleigh is fitted with an antinoise mechanism. Sound
can be thought of as a series of peaks and troughs. The sleigh
emits a noise to accompany the sonic boom, such that a peak in the
boom is matched by a trough in the emitted noise, and vice versa.
The result is that the sonic boom is canceled, and we are left with
a silent night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title, the book covers a range of scientific topics,
including a detailed analysis of the hangover, the explanation
behind the strange taste of brussels sprouts and the hunt for the
perfect Christmas tree (a straight trunk that slips easily into the
stand, limbs angling upward at 45 degrees, a uniform conical shape
tapering downward at 40 degrees and good needle retention). There
are also chapters covering the sociological and psychological
aspects of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 the psychologist Richard Sterba drew some extraordinary
parallels between Christmas celebrations and the customs
surrounding childbirth: the preparatory excitement, secret
anticipation, the last-minute flurry of activity and delivery of a
gift, whether it is a baby or a pair of socks. Sterba stated: ``It
is not surprising that the presents come down the chimney since the
fireplace and chimney signify vulva and vagina in the unconscious.
. . . This casts some light on the figure of Santa Claus. He, no
doubt, is a father representative.'' According to Sterba, those
people who hate Christmas are reminded of their unconscious and
unresolved conflicts about childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   One hypothesis with slightly more evidence to back it up is the
theory that Christmas has a death-defying effect. It appears that
people on the verge of dying can strike a deal with God (or
exercise willpower) in order to live for a few extra days and
experience a final family gathering. The best evidence for this
theory comes from a study of Jewish men who died in the weeks on
either side of the Passover festival. The advantage of studying
Passover rather than Christmas is that its date is not fixed, and
so the effect of the festival can be distinguished from the impact
of seasonal factors. The results showed that deaths increased by 25
percent in the week after Passover. The effect rose to 61 percent
when Passover fell on a weekend, presumably because family
gatherings are larger and the desire to survive even greater. It is
interesting to note that John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on
July 4, 1826, summoning up the extra strength required to witness
the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the science, Highfield also examines the history
of the festival, from Christmas cards to the origin of Santa. The
inspiration for Santa seems to be the generous St. Nicholas, born
around A.D. 245 in the town of Patara in what is now Turkey. The
story of most relevance tells how Nicholas secretly deposited three
bags of gold in a house, so that a father could pay for the
marriages of his three daughters. Interestingly, legend says that
he sneaked the third bag into the house by dropping it down the
chimney, which may have given rise to the modern interpretation of
Santa's preferred method of delivering presents.
</P>
<P>
   If St. Nicholas is the original Santa, and his home is in Turkey
rather than Lapland, then Highfield suggests that perhaps sunburn
is the explanation for Rudolph's red nose. Alternatively, if
Rudolph does reside in the Arctic, then parasites may be the cause
of his inflamed proboscis. Reindeer noses contain an elaborate
concentration of folded membranes, which act as heat exchangers.
Inhaled cold air is rapidly warmed as it enters the body, and
exhaled air is cooled before leaving. This helps the animal to
retain heat, and also reduces moisture loss. In the journal
Parasitology Today, Odd Halvorsen of the University of Oslo pointed
out that the warm, humid respiratory system provides a comfortable
home to many parasites, including 20 that are unique to reindeer.
Hence, Halvorsen suggested that Rudolph's celebrated discoloration
is the result of parasitic infection.
</P>
<P>
   INEVITABLY, Highfield includes a few stories that will be
familiar to many, such as the mystery of Santa's incredible annual
present-giving escapade, but even this chestnut is spiced up with
the latest research. In 1994 I worked on a television program that
intimated that Santa's exploits were achieved by quantum
teleportation. Scientists had only just completed some very
tentative experiments, but it seemed that Santa's Arctic laboratory
had mastered the technology. Highfield describes this and other
similar theories, involving warp-drive sleighs, wormholes and
surfing on the crest of the space-time wave, and he adds another,
more believable theory.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematician Ian Stewart of Warwick University in England
says that ``reindeer have a curious arrangement of gadgetry on top
of their heads which we call antlers and naively assume exist for
the males to do battle to win females. This is absolute nonsense.
The antlers are actually fractal vortex-shedding devices. We are
talking not aerodynamics here, but antlaerodynamics.'' This
phenomenon arises on the wingtips of a Concorde, but it is only
apparent on antlers at very high velocity. However, in order to
deliver all the presents, the reindeer are forced to fly at speeds
of 6,000 times the speed of sound, far in excess of the speed
required for antlers to generate lift.
</P>
<P>
   As a final thought, it is worth noting that the American edition
of ``The Physics of Christmas'' omits two chapters included in the
British edition. One relates to a peculiarly British delicacy
(Christmas pudding), and its omission is understandable. The other
concerns the Virgin Birth. I presume the editors wanted to steer
clear of controversy, and therefore took the safe option. The
result is that they have lost a thought-provoking chapter, one that
would only have contributed further to an already enchanting
scientific celebration of Christmas.

TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL BRYSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel writing is the most accommodating _ one might almost say
promiscuous _ of genres. Write a book that might otherwise be
shelved under memoir, social commentary, humor or even popular
science, and as long as you leave the property at some point, you
can call it travel writing.
</P>
<P>
   You may not even have to do that. Certainly I think we can
assume that Michael Pauls and Dana Facaros did not leave the
terrestrial realm to write THE TRAVELLERS' GUIDE TO MARS
(Cadogan/Globe Pequot, paper, $6.95), a breezy and painlessly
informative survey of what you could expect to find on the red
planet if you had 13 months to travel there and back and $640,000
for the estimated cost of a round-trip ticket _ and if such an
enterprise were technically achievable. Since this is popular
science merely rendered in a novel way, the question is whether it
should be reviewed as a travel book. The answer, I suppose, is that
it just has been.
</P>
<P>
   Given the definitional uncertainties of travel writing, it's
hardly surprising that the field has begun to attract the attention
of academics like Patrick Holland and Graham Huggan. Never mind the
zippy alliteration of their title. TOURISTS WITH TYPEWRITERS:
Critical Reflections on Contemporary Travel Writing (University of
Michigan, $32.50) is heavyweight stuff, what the authors themselves
might call (indeed, do call) a ``metacommentary.'' An introductory
passage setting out the book's goals asks eight suitably hefty
questions _ ``What might a taxonomy of contemporary travel
narratives look like, and how might it tally with travel writing's
inventory of spatialized cultural myths?'' is a fair example _ then
concludes, ``All of these questions are essayed, if hardly
answered, in this study.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can't argue with that. What Holland and Huggan offer is
an ambitious trawl through the immense and busy world of the modern
travel narrative. Alas, they don't like much of what they see.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chatwin often resorts to ``camp affectations,'' Tim Cahill
and Redmond O'Hanlon to clownish buffoonery. Mary Morris is given
to ``trancelike reveries redolent of New Age psychobabble.''
National Geographic, meanwhile, gets it in the neck for its ''
'soft primitivist' photographs . . . which so often focus on the
erogenous zones of the female (native) body,'' an assertion that's
at least a generation out of date and was decidedly arguable even
then.
</P>
<P>
   And on it goes. Although they generally approve of him, they
find that Pico Iyer is guilty of being ``too knowing, too
up-to-the-minute.'' Diane Ackerman's language ``lapses at times
into the precious,'' and Robert D. Kaplan writes prose that
``entraps itself in a kind of apocalyptic banality'' _ rather rich,
I would submit, from a pair who routinely produce sentences like
``Travel has recently emerged as a crucial epistemological category
for the displacement of normative values and homogenizing,
essentialist views.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does that mean exactly? It means: Put this volume aside
and go find yourself a real book _ perhaps Rick Ridgeway's latest,
THE SHADOW OF KILIMANJARO: On Foot Across East Africa (Holt,
$27.50). In 1996, Ridgeway, a celebrated mountaineer and
adventurer, decided to hike across south-central Kenya from the
summit of Mount Kilimanjaro at the Tanzanian border to the Indian
Ocean at Malindi, a distance of about 300 miles. This is classic
territory, the part of the mythical Dark Continent that gave us
``Out of Africa,'' ``White Mischief,'' Mau Mau uprisings, Masai
warriors and big-game hunters, among much else.
</P>
<P>
   Promising stuff. So when I read in the early pages that Ridgeway
needed just three weeks to accomplish the trek, that he was to be
accompanied and protected by a corps of heavily armed guides and
that each night they would arrive at a luxuriously appointed camp
(folding chairs, hot showers, dining tent) set up by an advance
party, this seemed, even by my forgiving standards, a trifle tame.
A memorable vacation perhaps, but hardly the stuff of gripping
adventure narrative.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy to report that I was quite wrong. To begin with,
Ridgeway is a graceful and engaging companion, and East Africa _
specifically the vast Tsavo National Park, through which he and his
guides ventured _ teems with danger, challenge and excitement.
Lions, elephants, hippos, crocodiles, Cape buffaloes and leopards
are just some of the megafauna that might _ and often do _ come
charging through the brush.
</P>
<P>
   Into all this, Ridgeway deftly weaves compact and absorbing
interludes about the history of conservation in East Africa, the
fate of displaced tribes, the rise and fall of big-game hunting and
the uneasy relationship between European interlopers and local
people. He also tells a good story _ for example, this account of
the time his guide, Iain Allan, took a party of tourists on a trek
into the bush and hired Masai tribesmen with spears to protect the
camps at night:
</P>
<P>
   ``One evening when everyone was gathered around the fire, a
lioness suddenly stepped out of the bush not more than 20 feet
away. Iain told the clients not to move while he stood and turned
to wave the Masai into position. To his chagrin all of them had
dropped their spears and were climbing a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan drove the lioness off by shouting at it, to the immense
delight of the tourists. Then he fired all the Masai warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure of a more indirect sort abounds in James C. Simmons's
CASTAWAY IN PARADISE: The Incredible Adventures of True-Life
Robinson Crusoes (Sheridan House, paper, $14.95). Originally
published in hardcover in 1993, this is more a popular history than
a travel book. No matter. Simmons's scrupulously researched tales
of people led by misfortune or choice to take up hermit existences
on lonely atolls and surf-fringed isles is, at every turn,
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-TRAVEL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: irresistible.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He begins with the man who started it all, the Scottish mariner
Alexander Selkirk, whose experiences as a castaway on Mas a Tierra
Island, 400 miles off the Chilean coast, from 1704 to 1709 provided
the rough material for Daniel Defoe's classic novel 10 years later.
Selkirk, it's worth noting, went ashore voluntarily _ he didn't get
along with the captain of his ship _ and was better provisioned
than his fictional counterpart. He also had the considerable
advantage of being in a lush, well-watered tropical paradise that
abounded with fruit, fish and game. (Even so, the experience quite
unhinged him. After being rescued, he returned to Scotland but
failed to adjust to society and passed his days in a cave above his
hometown. He returned to sea and died of a fever off the African
coast.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather less lucky _ certainly less willing _ was Charles H.
Barnard, whose ordeal a century later is all but forgotten now. By
all accounts a kindly and unassuming fellow, Barnard was an
American ship captain who was on a sealing expedition in the South
Atlantic in 1813 when he came across a group of shipwrecked,
half-starved British sailors and their passengers _ some 45 people
in all _ on an uninhabited island in the Falklands archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard unhesitatingly took the castaways aboard, even though
Britain and America were at war, and agreed to convey them to a
neutral port in South America. He then went ashore with a party of
four men to shoot and gather game to feed the extra mouths. Upon
returning, he discovered that the British had stolen away with his
ship and left him and his companions stranded on a featureless,
barren waste at the edge of winter with nothing but their rowboat,
a few knives, a blanket, a dog named Cent and the clothes they
stood up in.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, the men survived the winter _ but worse was to
come for poor old Captain Barnard. Six months after his abandonment
by the British, Barnard returned from a day's hunting to find that
the four other men were rowing away in the boat, leaving him with
nothing at all. (The others would eventually return, begging
forgiveness, which Barnard characteristically granted.) Altogether,
Barnard and his hapless mates were stranded for 18 months before a
passing ship rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard returned to New York and wrote a book about his ordeal,
which sold a few hundred copies before it (and he) vanished from
the scene. ``Nothing about his later life is known,'' Simmons
notes, though I think we can safely assume that Barnard offered no
more assistance to British sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Against such tales of privation, it comes as something of a
relief to turn to the bright, cheerful prose of Heinrich Boll's
IRISH JOURNAL (Marlboro/Northwestern University, paper, $12.95).
First published in Germany in 1957 but not translated into English
(by Leila Vennewitz) until a decade later, ``Irish Journal''
recounts a trip made by the future Nobel laureate and his family in
the mid-1950's to look at and admire ``the only people in Europe
that never set out to conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now reissued in paperback, ``Irish Journal'' has a beguiling, if
inevitably dated, charm that perfectly suits the landscape and
temperament of its subject. True to its title, it is much more
journal than book, with chapters that are often little more than
disconnected sketches and jottings. The main strand of plot,
insofar as there is one, concerns Boll's increasingly hilarious and
futile attempts to change German marks into Irish pounds, and the
almost infinite credit he is offered at every turn by merchants and
officials who assume that he will one day settle up.
</P>
<P>
   More contemporary, but equally relaxed and amiable in tone, is
Bruce Berger's lyrical ALMOST AN ISLAND: Travels in Baja California
(University of Arizona, cloth, $39.95; paper, $17.95). A poet and
musician, Berger first ventured into the Baja peninsula _ a barren
but beautiful ``800-mile dead end'' _ in 1968 and has been
returning ever since, often for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Physically and geologically distinct from the rest of Mexico,
the Baja peninsula has always been a place apart. The original
inhabitants, Berger notes, were a people who ``lacked the least
fumblings of agriculture or the simplest storage devices of pottery
or woven baskets'' but were accomplished artists, covering canyon
walls with intricate paintings up to 150 feet long and 30 feet high
_ ``the greatest primitive murals in the Western Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of this region have always evinced a certain
streak of engaging eccentricity. When an early Spanish missionary
named Father Ugarte ``threatened one tribe with the flames of hell,
they were enchanted to learn of a place where they would never be
cold and asked him how to get there.'' Members of another tribe
amused themselves by teaching him obscenities when he asked for
translations of terms in the Roman Catholic litany.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the innocence and remoteness that once characterized
Baja California has long since vanished. Thirty years ago, the
peninsula was practically unpaved and just as practically unknown.
Now a modern highway gives it a paved spine and access to the
outside world, and resort hotels stand on once pristine beaches.
Berger writes about the changes with both dismay and understanding.
Discussing with a Mexican acquaintance the sweeping transformation
of the community of San Ignacio, he observes:
</P>
<P>
   ``The man asked me to put myself in the place of an Ignaciano
trying to get his wife as quickly as possible to the hospital in
Santa Rosalia over hours of primitive road. . . . I, in turn,
argued that the accelerated pace would provoke new ills, encourage
the young to leave and aggravate the need for hospitals. It is a
classic argument that neither side ever wins, and it left me
certain that the highway would go through because highways simply
did.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not normally much of one for anthologies _ too much like
snacking _ but I am happy to make an exception for THE BEST OF
OUTSIDE: The First 20 Years (Vintage Departures, paper, $14),
assembled by the editors of the popular magazine. There has never
been a magazine quite like it. What could easily have been a
tedious monthly paean to running shoes, rock scrambling and the
like became instead, quite unexpectedly, a repository of some truly
exceptional writing. Gathered here are 31 pieces from the
magazine's first two decades. Among the particular pleasures are
Jonathan Raban on messing about in boats, Tim Cahill on a trip to
cannibal country in the Indonesian half of New Guinea, and David
Quammen on the famous and forbidding lizards known as Komodo
dragons, also in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the implied commitment to exertion in its title, Outside
has never felt entirely bound to the idea of vigorous activity.
Here, for instance, are the unimprovable opening lines of an Ian
Frazier essay on a persistent but decidedly unadventurous aspect of
modern life: ``In New York City, where I live, plastic bags get
stuck in trees. Especially in the winter, the wind lifts them and
fixes them by their handles in high upper branches, where they
become, compared to ordinary litter, immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not travel writing, either. Perhaps that's why I like it
so much.

 &UR; EAST OF SUEZ &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL KENNEDY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 or more years, anyone really interested in the
naval and maritime history of the Western world has been rejoicing
at the output of the supreme artist of the era of the armored
warships, Ian Marshall, a soft-spoken former architect, very
British but now resident in Maine. In marine art terms, Marshall's
work is coming close to the reputation achieved by the fabulous
Patrick O'Brian novels about naval warfare during Napoleonic times.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was trained as an architect in South Africa and the
United States and practiced that calling for many years. Somewhere
along the way, he began to sketch watercolors of ``armored ships''
-- that is, of naval vessels built after the Industrial Revolution,
craft that were of iron or steel construction, propelled by steam
power, carrying guns far larger than any that could be handled
easily on land, and therefore quite the most formidable instruments
of war of their day. At a certain time in the history of
great-power politics -- shall we say, 1860 to 1941 -- the fate of
world affairs much depended on how these mastodons performed in
battle. All this is wonderfully captured in Marshall's earlier
books, especially ``Armored Ships'' and ``Ironclads and Paddlers,''
in which each warship he presents is placed in a historic setting,
like H.M.S. Warspite blowing up German destroyers in Narvik fjord
in 1940 or the U.S.S. New Jersey steaming through the Panama Canal
after its intervention in Lebanon in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to Marshall than the extraordinary knowledge
he has acquired of these large battle vessels, or his elegiac and
often Turneresque paintings of them. Happily, it is also the case
that Marshall in his youth was taken by his parents on the famous
maritime route from Britain to the East -- that is, from London or
southern France to Suez, Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Madras, Calcutta
and then further east to Penang, Singapore and Hong Kong. This
passage he now seeks to recapture in his new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage East'' is, therefore, both an artistic and a
historical tribute to one of the most remarkable sea voyages of the
past century -- the outward passage of large numbers of Britons
(aristocrats, civil servants, merchants, soldiers, maids) from
London to India, and return of the same, perhaps years later. The
very journey became so romanticized for Britons that apocryphal
stories gained credible circulation, like the word ``posh'' having
been coined from an acronym used by a steamship line for the most
expensive cabins, ``port out, starboard home'' (and thus shaded
from the blistering sun as the vessels plied to India and back).
This was one of the great cultural interchanges of the time, albeit
one-sided since so many fewer Indians (apart from nabobs and
Brahmins) traveled in turn to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   What Marshall is so good and expert at is capturing the cultural
and social life on board these elegant, well-furnished liners,
perhaps a little more understandable to us now that we have seen
the movie ``Titanic.'' The sense and purpose of this portrayal
evokes and stimulates an appreciation of a more regulated, socially
exclusive time when ``West'' went to ``East'' in a self-satisfied
mood. By 1947, the Raj was finished but hardly any of the earnest
passengers on a P &AMP; O (Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company) liner would have guessed that a mere 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs and Marshall's own sketches are carefully and
intelligently mixed with the text of this entertaining work. Also
important is the substantive essay contributed by the famous marine
historian John Maxtone-Graham, who has written much about the
Atlantic crossing but now offers his own reflections on the
``passage east.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this is a worthy work. It is simultaneously a
coffee-table book that we would all like to receive from a rich
uncle, and a work of superb artistry and scholarship that
illuminates one of the fascinating aspects of intercultural traffic
during the past century. One hundred years ago, Kipling wrote,
``Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall
meet.'' Reading ``Passage East,'' even from its primarily maritime
perspective, but with Marshall's portrayal of the swarms of
bumboats surrounding a newly arrived Royal India liner in, say,
Calcutta, it is hard not to disagree. This is not just a nostalgic
essay in imperial, Western history; it is a beautifully captured
commentary on part of our disappearing century.

 MAGICAL MUSHROOMS, MISCHIEVOUS MOLDS

<P>
   By George W. Hudler.

 &UR; AIN'T WE GOT FUNGI &QL; 
 &UR; By ALLEN LACY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, when George W. Hudler got his first glimpse of
fungus spores through a microscope in a laboratory section of a
course in forest pathology at the University of Minnesota, he
underwent a conversion experience. ``At that moment,'' he writes in
the preface to his highly engaging book on the transactions between
fungi and human beings, ``my life took on new meaning.'' He had a
fresh enthusiasm that ``propelled me through two graduate degrees
and into my present position as professor of plant pathology at
Cornell University.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell, Hudler has openly preached the good news -- and the
not so good news -- about the kingdom of the fungi. Over the past
decade, a couple of thousand students have enrolled in Magical
Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds (otherwise known as Plant Pathology
201). The course now serves as the basis for an utterly delightful
book that can be read by anyone who can hardly tell a shiitake from
a morel.
</P>
<P>
   After two lucid introductory chapters on the taxonomy,
physiology, anatomy and reproductive behavior of fungi, Hudler gets
down to his main task, dividing these forms of life into those that
are inimical to our interests and those that benefit us beyond any
possibility of doubt. The villains come first, starting with those
fungi that affect the plant life of special significance to
humankind. In Europe in 1845, Phytophthora infestans, an organism
that causes a fatal blight of potatoes, made its first appearance.
The following year in Ireland, where these tubers were an almost
exclusive dietary staple, the potato famine ran its tragic course.
Within a decade, hundreds of thousands died from starvation, a
million more from associated diseases like typhus and cholera. It
hardly needs mentioning that the resulting immigration from Ireland
to the United States significantly changed American culture,
religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds'' also explores other
plant diseases: rusts of wheat and other grains; the powdery mildew
and the downy mildew that afflicted European vineyards in the last
century; and the chestnut blight, Dutch elm disease and dogwood
anthracnose that more recently have altered the ecology of American
forests and destroyed untold numbers of handsome trees in our
communities. Other, more sinister fungi attack us not indirectly,
by affecting plant life, but head on, by harming us. Ringworm, jock
itch and athlete's foot are all fungal diseases, but they are mere
discomforts. Candidiasis (yeast infections and thrush) can be more
serious. Worst of all are several respiratory diseases that can be
fatal, particularly for people whose immune systems have been
compromised by other diseases. These include histoplasmosis (caused
by an organism common in bird dung), aspergillosis (from several
species of a mold of grain and hay) and coccidioidomycosis (from a
fungus of desert soils whose spores are released into the
atmosphere by farming and even earthquakes).
</P>
<P>
   SO far, it seems, Hudler hasn't been very encouraging about the
fungi among us. Perhaps, he says, he has led us to conclude that
they are ``rotten, disgusting, vile creations, hellbent on mucking
up what is otherwise a pretty good life on Planet Earth.'' But this
is by no means the burden of his book: rather, ``for all the
problems the fungi have caused, they have also extended our lives
and made them far more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise anyone that the first item in Hudler's
catalogue of beneficial fungi is Penicillium notatum, a mold whose
antibiotic properties were discovered accidentally by Alexander
Fleming in 1928. Penicillin, the drug derived from it in large
quantities right at the end of World War II, saved great numbers of
lives. Because many microbes eventually developed resistance to its
antibiotic properties, it has been more or less superseded by other
drugs of fungal origin, such as cephalosporin. (But penicillin
still has its uses. Were it not for massive injec-tions of it to
treat a particularly nasty kind of pneumonia I came down with last
February in the aftermath of surgery, it's a good guess that
someone else would be reviewing ``Magical Mushrooms.'')
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Hudler makes an excellent brief on behalf of the fungi.
They provide us with many blessings and benefits. Some of them give
us wine, beer and leavened bread. The omnivores among us have a
keen appreciation for broiled portobellos atop our filet mignon;
vegetarians for the portobellos in themselves, not as
accompaniments. Other fungi help us fight against diseases that
might weaken or destroy us without their assistance. Still others
-- and not the least important among them -- are responsible for
tidying up our planet by digesting plant debris. Without their
help, we and everything else would be smothered in biomass.

<P>
   Every holiday is marked with a new batch of picture books
straining to say something original. This is not an easy task,
especially at Christmas, when writers often feel compelled to
deliver yet another rendition of that estimable message, ``Peace on
earth, good will toward men.'' The offerings this season include
the exotic ``Wolf Christmas'' and the amiable ``Santa Mouse and the
Ratdeer,'' and in both, on the night before you-know-what, all is
(sooner or later) calm and bright. But the naughty team of Bonny
Becker and David Small have opted for mayhem over tranquillity in
their outrageous and hilarious book ``The Christmas Crocodile,'' in
which Alice Jayne finds an irrepressible crocodile under the tree
on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas Crocodile didn't mean to be bad, not really,''
we are told right up front and several times thereafter, but by the
second page the animal has already devoured a couple of presents _
Father's shoe, the wreath in the hall _ and he's working on the
roast. Uncle Theodore, who used to hunt wild game and still dresses
in high boots and full uniform, wants to send the Christmas
Crocodile to Africa, or maybe turn him into a pair of shoes. Aunt
Figgy thinks he ought to be put in an orphanage. Alice Jayne, on
the other hand, would very much like to keep him, and as the night
wears on, other members of the family come to believe that maybe
he's learned to behave himself after all.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. By the time Christmas arrives, he has consumed _
among many, many, many other items _ 29 crumpets, 5 golden oranges,
the left stove-top burner, Aunt Figgy's hot water bottle, Uncle
Theodore's Zulu robe, Father's red earmuffs, Mother's comforter,
the tree and all _ well, almost all _ of the presents.
</P>
<P>
   Becker's zany tale is wonderfully complemented by Small's witty
drawings of a grand, old-fashioned house inhabited by Alice Jayne,
her dotty relatives and one house-wrecking crocodile with a very
expressive face. As already noted, the Christmas Crocodile didn't
mean to be bad, but I am happy to report that at the end of this
captivating book he is just as voracious as ever, having learned
absolutely nothing about good manners or self-control.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, everyone in ``Santa Mouse and the Ratdeer'' ends up
behaving quite nicely, although Christmas Eve doesn't start off all
that promisingly. It is a dark and stormy night. Santa is late,
disorganized and in a rotten mood. His ratdeer _ Blunder, Basher,
Lousy, Loopy, Bugsy and Twizzlebum _ are also grumpy, perhaps
because of their excessively adorable names. And then disaster
strikes: Santa's sleigh malfunctions and plunges into a snowbank,
scattering presents everywhere and dumping Santa and his ratdeer
into the snows of the North Woods.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much grace under pressure. Santa shivers on a rock
while his fed-up ratdeer, ditching him, head off in search of a
beach. Is Christmas done for? Not to worry. Fortunately for the
morals and morale of this crowd, the ratdeer find, instead of a
beach, a sweet little mouse girl called Rosie, whose warm cookies,
hot chocolate and blazing fire restore good will to their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Thacher Hurd accompanies his text with serviceable drawings,
heavy on the traditional reds and greens of Christmas. He makes
Christmas Eve by the fire look cozy indeed. I suppose it is
reassuring to see Santa _ his belly full, his sleigh repaired, his
ratdeer smiling _ riding smoothly into the starry night to complete
his appointed rounds. But having just laughed my way through ``The
Christmas Crocodile,'' I guess I was hoping for something a bit
more irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing irreverent about ``Wolf Christmas,'' but Daniel
Pinkwater's particular perspective and Jill Pinkwater's haunting
drawings take us far from the realm of the ordinary. This is a
Christmas Eve story told from the point of view of a young wolf,
who, with the other pups in the family, is scampering about in the
moonlit snowy woods while the older wolves watch over them. Then
Uncle Louis _ a funny wolf who always has interesting things to
show and tell _ invites them all on a very unusual journey, leading
them to a hillside below which dwells a community of humans. Aren't
they dangerous? one of the adult wolves wonders. But Uncle Louis
explains that this is a special night for humans, and that on this
special night they are quite peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves, looking down at the cluster of homes bedecked with
colored lights and exuding ``hot smoky smells, and strange meat
smells and sweet smells,'' don't see any humans but hear them
singing inside. They like what they hear. And celebrating that
moment of peace on earth and their shared _ not humanity but
animality _ the wolves throw back their heads, and they sing too.
</P>
<P>
   This simple and beautifu1 book, which steps into the souls of
the wolves, offers a fresh take on a fine old theme. And much as I
adore ``The Christmas Crocodile,'' I was glad he was not on that
hillside, disrupting the singing.

 HOW SANTA GOT HIS JOB
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Stephen Krensky.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated by S. D. Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. (Ages 4 to 6) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ---- &QL; 
 &UR; CHILDREN'S BOOKS &QL; 
 &UR; By WILL JOYNER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Who says Santa doesn't have a resume? In this quick, quirky
tale, Stephen Krensky imagines a frenetic occupational past for the
jolly fellow. Bluntly put, the young Santa can't hold a job _ or at
least is too much of a perfectionist to hold a job for very long.
Along the way, though, as he skips from cleaning chimneys to
cooking in a diner to caring for the residents of a zoo, he picks
up the skills, attitudes and extra pounds that will let him
eventually realize his potential amid a bunch of very understanding
elves. (In the zoo, for example, the animals teach him how to know
who's sleeping and who's awake.) At first, the message here _ that
no job is ideal and that all jobs require patience and training _
seems oddly placed in a holiday-season picture book. But, come to
think of it, the secular world's Christmas, with its garish display
of consumer expectations, is a fine time for young children to
think about the work that precedes all those fruits of labor. Each
episode of Santa's early job history is a little too short on
dramatic content; no other character is even given a name. In his
straightforward sentences, however, Krensky maintains the kind of
unpatronizing, faintly ironic tone that 5-year-olds appreciate
because it allows them to assume they're being let in on adult
observations. And the simplicity of the words is nicely balanced by
the busy sophistication of S. D. Schindler's illustrations, which
are full of clues that set the story in the 1950's, in a city a lot
like New York. Every drawing is so intricately composed that child
and parent alike will want to linger before turning a page _ to try
to figure out why that woman in the swank hat is leering at young
Santa as he races down a sidewalk, for instance, or, after the tale
shifts to a snowy spot way out of town, what exactly those elves
are thinking as their new colleague signs a contract to deliver
toys in such a radically new way.

</P>
<P>
   Because I am a part-time resident of Italy, my four
grandchildren, aged 4 to 12, have traveled widely there during
their summer vacations. There is nothing like seeing the ``real
thing'' to make culture come alive to a young CD-ROM-TV generation,
but picture books have a special capacity to inspire imagination as
well as prompt memories.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Michelangelo's Surprise,'' set in a Medici palace in
Florence, and ``Bravo, Zan Angelo!,'' a tale that takes place in an
18th-century version of Venice, can only help to reinforce the
anticipation and memories of the lucky children who travel or those
who just dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelangelo's Surprise'' is a supposedly true story of a day
in 1494 when, after a rare snowfall, Michelangelo's benefactor
Piero de' Medici summoned the young artist (he was just 19) to
build a snow sculpture in his palace courtyard. Though Michelangelo
was arguably the finest artist of the Renaissance, Tony Parillo, an
American teacher and artist, has offered a story that is slight,
and has only three short paragraphs to tell readers something about
the artist's career. Still, the surprise _ that Michelangelo
created from snow not a jolly fellow with a corncob pipe but a
colossal human form with a fierce face _ may forever change a
child's idea of a snowman. Unfortunately, the illustrations fail to
capture the line and color of the 15th century and may actually be
disturbing to small children.
</P>
<P>
   Niki Daly is a South African artist and children's book
illustrator, and his watercolors of Venice are another thing
altogether. For any child (or adult) who has walked the little
squares and narrow streets of that magical city, Daly's paintings
will evoke many an ``Oh, I remember that building!'' Again the
story is spare; a little boy wants to join his crotchety
grandfather's commedia del-l'arte street theater troupe and
succeeds in scoring a small acting triumph as a rooster. But here
the illustrations, exquisitely drawn and illuminated with Venetian
light, carry the story farther than words can.

 A COBTOWN CHRISTMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Diaries of Lucky Hart
</P>
<P>
   By Julia Van Nutt, illustrated by Robert Van Nutt.

<P>
   Doubleday, $15.99. (Ages 5 and up) &QL;

 &UR; GOOD WILL TOWARD COBTOWN, 1845 &QL; 
 &UR; By CYNTHIA ZARIN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Only Scrooge could resist this elaborately packaged plum pudding
of a picture book. It purports to be an 1845 diary written by one
Lucky Hart (there's also a character called Fliberty Jibbert),
which details the exciting revels and events that lead up to
Christmas Day in the little hamlet of Cobtown. Will the gift Lucky
has ordered from Ploomajiggy for her Mama arrive in time? Will the
townspeople discover the identity of the lost blind man who keeps
on muttering about ``nine donkeys''? Will the dog with the hurt paw
-- bound up by Lucky's Aunt Heddy, who keeps a wild pig as a pet --
find a good home? Luckily for the reader, Lucky herself, who's all
set to sing for the whole town on Christmas (if the busted organ is
fixed), is funny and dear. ``There are other things I'd rather do
than memorize the new hymn,'' she confides to her diary, and then
supplies a list, which includes ``eating Christmas cookies'' and
``baking more Christmas cookies (I ate all the first ones).'' A
rustic Mrs. Beeton, Lucky also supplies a recipe for Snow Cream
(``be sure to use only clean snow'') and an illustrated lesson in
how to make pomander balls.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hearty, happy tale, but in addition to its helpings of
cheer (and despite occasional lapses into just-folks corn) its
gentler theme is that things can be tricky: people do get lost; the
church organ sometimes fails; cloves can break, Lucky notes, when
you make pomanders. The lesson of unpredictability -- that things
don't always work out as planned -- is perhaps as good as any to
take into Christmas; in Cobtown it's in the company of patience,
hope, perseverance and good will toward creatures great and small
that festivities abound. The good fare and the dollhouse
illustrations, all lighted by Christmas firelight, are just right.

 &UR; WITHOUT PEER &QL; 
 &UR; By BROOKE ALLEN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A biography of Lord Berners, published earlier this year in
England, has called him ``the last eccentric.'' The adjective seems
a little millennial; one hopes that even Cool Britannia will be
able to produce the occasional oddball here and there. But if not
the last eccentric, Gerald Tyrwhitt, who succeeded his uncle as
14th Baron Berners in 1918, was certainly among the more colorful
ones of his generation, memorably portrayed in Nancy Mitford's
``Pursuit of Love'' as the fey and whimsical Lord Merlin, whose
whippets wear diamond necklaces and who dyes his flock of pet
pigeons every color of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   A man of many talents but, perhaps, no real genius, Lord Berners
was known as ``the English Satie.'' (Erik Satie took exception to
the comparison, referring to Berners scoffingly as ``a professional
amateur.'') Berners wrote ballet music for Diaghilev and opera with
Gertrude Stein; he painted capably in the manner of Corot; he was
the author of several pleasantly campy novels, including ``Far From
the Madding War,'' ``The Camel'' and ``The Girls of Radcliffe
Hall,'' in which he represented his young male circle of homosexual
friends as naughty schoolgirls and himself as their repressed
headmistress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Berners published a brief volume of autobiography,
``First Childhood,'' for which he produced a sequel, ``A Distant
Prospect,'' 11 years later. Funny, unsparing, sharp yet
fundamentally good-spirited, the two books carry him from his birth
in 1883 to his departure from school at the age of 16. Out of print
for many years, they have now been made available in handsome
paperback editions.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially at least, Berners's account of his boyhood follows
the standard pattern of patrician reminiscence: a childhood
surrounded by old retainers in a grand country house, and the
evocation, in its description, of a vanished world; the shock of
transition from this paradise to a Spartan prep school full of
grubby boys and sadistic masters; pleasure and romantic friendship
at Eton. And Lord Berners, being the quintessential esthete,
follows another standard pattern as well, that of the artistic
child born into a philistine aristocracy in which blood sports were
thought to be man's highest calling and ``the word 'imagination'
was always used in a depreciative sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But although he covers familiar territory, Berners writes in an
engagingly fresh and amusing voice. Better still, there is nothing
even remotely sentimental about his re-creation of the Victorian
past. It seems clear that he was far happier as an adult consorting
with the likes of Cecil Beaton, Frederick Ashton and Igor
Stravinsky than he ever was among the dull, fox-hunting gentry, the
solidly respectable furniture and the mounted antlers, warthog
tusks and fox masks of his childhood home.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to heredity,'' Berners claims, ``I am unable to
discover any very evident genealogy for my own character.'' He is
especially funny on his paternal grandmother, Lady Berners, whom he
calls Lady Bourchier. (For some reason, he has chosen to disguise
his family members behind absurdly transparent pseudonyms.) Lady
Bourchier was a baroness in her own right but ``everything else in
her own wrong,'' as Berners's father quipped. In appearance, she
was ``not unlike Holbein's portrait of Bloody Mary with just a
touch of Charley's Aunt.'' Extremely religious and ``violently
low-church,'' she described herself in Who's Who as ``distinctly
low'' and held household prayer services for her domestics,
``declaiming scriptural exhortations in a voice that seemed to hold
out very little hope of salvation for the lower classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners's parents lived semi-detached lives almost from the
beginning: his father was a worldly, cynical naval officer, his
mother a pleasant but exceedingly conventional countrywoman, almost
comically defined by the prejudices of her caste. Consider, for
example, a conversation Berners recalls between his mother and his
tutor, Mr. Prout:
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother hardly ever discussed politics, or she might have
discovered that Mr. Prout was a 'horrid radical.' Once when he
spoke of the 'idle rich' she said, 'Oh, but, Mr. Prout, all the
rich people I know are always very busy. They always have a lot to
do.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'I don't count hunting or shooting,' Mr. Prout replied, 'or
going to parties.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Why not?' my mother asked, and the subject was dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual pursuits were not encouraged at home and neither
was young Gerald's enthusiasm for Chopin. Instead, his mother
sought to inculcate manliness -- a virtue, Berners writes, ``in
which one had to be laboriously instructed. Like so many other
virtues, it did not seem to correspond with the natural instincts
of the human being.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 9 or so, Gerald devised a booby trap by which a
plank flew up and smacked his Swiss governess on the bottom as she
eased herself onto the toilet seat; he was smartly packed off to
boarding school. Elmley (in reality, Cheam) was a highly respected
institution, but Berners makes it as sound as lurid and raffish a
place as Llanabba Castle in Evelyn Waugh's ``Decline and Fall.''
The headmaster immediately strikes an ominous note by promising, on
Gerald's first day, to ``make a man of him''; the boy's years there
are predictably unpleasant, culminating in Gerald's ruining a
budding romance with an older boy by throwing up all over him.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald's Elmley career ends on a sour note as he is caught
hurling a Bible across the room by the headmaster. (``The Bible! .
. . The Bible, sir! You have thrown the Bible -- and on Sunday too!
Stand up on the form!'') He then moves on to Eton. Berners writes
of Eton with a deep appreciation for its beauty, but his
recollections are blessedly free of the haze of romantic nostalgia
that makes so many memoirs of the place a little ridiculous. He
enjoyed himself thoroughly, made two significant friends (an
unwashed intellectual and a vapid dandy) and conceived a passion
for Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on Eton, however, Berners was unimpressed by the
education he received there. It was not just the relentless
obsession with organized games or the fact that any and all
artistic endeavor was regarded with deep suspicion. The teachers
themselves (two of whom were nicknamed Jumping Jesus and Creeping
Christ) were mediocre, with the notable exception of the revered A.
C. Benson. Eton's philosophy, Berners claims, was to nurture
``character'' at the expense of intellect. At Eton, he concludes,
``I had learned nothing, less than nothing, a minus quantity. I had
lost what little knowledge I had of foreign languages. In history,
geography and science I had been confused rather than instructed. I
left Eton with a distaste for the Classics and, what was more
serious, a distaste for work itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, sadly, Berners's autobiographical writings come to an end.
He lived on until 1950, but for an account of his adult life, so
full of bizarre incident and odd characters, one must turn to Mark
Amory's recent ``Lord Berners: The Last Eccentric,'' published in
England but not, as yet, in this country.

   AFRICAN PAINTED HOUSES: Basotho Dwellings of Southern Africa. By
Gary N. van Wyk. (Abrams, $39.95.) Every few generations, Western
architects wake up to the fact that our civilization's habitual
fear of strong color and bold pattern on the exteriors of buildings
causes us to lose out on a powerful form of architectural
expression. Fortunately, no such inhibitions restrict the Basotho
women of Lesotho. After each rainy season they redecorate the outer
walls of their single-story mud-brick houses with pulsating
polychrome designs of such potent graphic impact that the tradition
constitutes one of the continuing glories of African culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gary N. van Wyk, a South African artist and art historian,
places these remarkable schemes -- votive symbols invoking tribal
peace, agricultural plenty and divine protection -- fully within
the complex social order of the Basotho people. In these vibrant
patterns, at once contemporary and timeless, Western eyes will find
reflections of the painted architecture of the German
Expressionists, as well as the art of Klee, Matisse and Malevich.
Yet such affinities are more correctly seen as evidence of the
first world's expanded visual horizons in this century. For where
would modernism have been without the reinvigoration it found in
Africa's vital art, inextricably enmeshed in its makers' experience
of everyday life?
</P>

   NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS. By Alain Erlande-Brandenburg. Photographs
by Caroline Rose. Translated by John Goodman. (Abrams, $75.) With
everything else to see and do in Paris, visitors often pay little
close attention to the city's majestic early Gothic centerpiece,
the Cathedral of Our Lady of Paris, more familiarly known as Notre
Dame. Yet this sumptuous volume, written by the French medievalist
Alain Erlande-Brandenburg and illustrated with photographs by
Caroline Rose, reminds us that this iconic structure bears as much
close scrutiny as a more viscerally compelling cathedral, Notre
Dame de Chartres.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of Notre Dame -- begun shortly after 1160 under
the direction of the highly ambitious peasant-born Bishop Maurice
de Sully -- was not just an act of religious devotion but also an
assertion of the primacy of Paris above all other French dioceses.
To make that more evident, the sanctuary was designed to be taller
than any preceding church, with the nave rising to 108 feet. That
impressive feat of engineering was made possible by the first true
flying buttresses, those deceptively delicate-looking exterior
supports that keep the towering walls of the nave and apse from
collapsing beneath the weight of so much load-bearing masonry.
</P>
<P>
   The author documents Notre Dame's lengthy construction process
as well as depredations the building suffered during the French
Revolution and in the 19th century. It is debatable who did more
harm. Was it the iconoclastic revolutionaries who vandalized images
of royal authority like the sculptural Gallery of Kings above the
main portals? Or were the worse culprits the architects
Jean-Baptiste Lassus and Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, whose fanciful,
historically misconceived ``restorations'' of 1844-64 did a
different kind of violence to the intentions of the original
builders?
</P>

   BUILDING THE GEORGIAN CITY. By James Ayres. (Paul Mellon Center
for Studies in British Art/Yale University, $65.) The classical
proportions and aristocratic aura of Britain's urban architecture
of the 18th and early 19th centuries mask the fact that the
period's construction techniques took full advantage of the new
materials and manufacturing methods of the dawning Industrial
Revolution. This absorbing survey by James Ayres, director of the
John Judkyn Memorial near Bath, delves instructively into the
ingenious technologies that Georgian carpenters, masons, glaziers,
plumbers and other master craftsmen devised, taking the world's
first industrialized nation from medieval means of construction and
into the modern age. Many of the architectural and interior design
amenities we now take for granted first became prevalent during the
reigns of the four Georges, when Britain's growing prosperity,
artisanal know-how and mass production allowed great numbers of
consumers to enjoy such domestic pleasures as window glass,
wallpaper, paint and ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres unearths many forgotten originators and entrepreneurs,
none more fascinating than the matriarchy of the two Eleanor
Coades. The older Coade's eponymous invention, Coade stone, was a
terra-cotta-like compound that withstood the cold, damp British
climate as effectively as natural masonry and could be molded into
architectural details of every description. Her namesake daughter
and successor brilliantly exploited the design and marketing of the
versatile substance but took its secret recipe to her grave, and
the family company closed in 1840.

   CAST-IRON ARCHITECTURE IN AMERICA: The Significance of James
Bogardus. By Margot Gayle and Carol Gayle. (Norton, $39.50.) In the
annals of architectural loss, innumerable landmark buildings have
been demolished, but how many have been stolen? The latter was the
bizarre fate of one of the earliest milestones of modernism, the
Laing Stores of 1849 in New York, designed by the mechanical
engineer and inventor James Bogardus. Though this four-story
structure near City Hall employed conventional wood and brick
framing, Bogardus's ingenious wraparound curtain-wall facade of
modular cast-iron panels was as innovative (if not as celebrated)
as London's iron-and-glass Crystal Palace, completed two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's inexorable march northward, and decades of benign
neglect, helped this modestly scaled but extraordinarily
significant relic survive intact until 1971. Its facade was then
carefully disassembled for re-erection elsewhere, proving the
``portability'' its designer expounded as a benefit of his new
construction system. Alas, those easily movable metal parts proved
all too tempting to thieves, who in 1974 and 1977 made off with the
components and presumably sold them for scrap.
</P>
<P>
   This long-awaited book, the first ever on Bogardus, is the
culmination of the lifework of Margot Gayle, the 90-year-old
doyenne of the cast-iron preservation movement -- written with her
daughter Carol Gayle, who teaches history at Lake Forest College in
Illinois. Their thorough study is likely to remain the definitive
work on the enterprising inventor whose seminal architectural
concept helped set the stage for the astounding advances in
construction during the century after his death in 1874.

   THE HOUSES OF McKIM, MEAD &AMP; WHITE. By Samuel G. White.
Photographs by Jonathan Wallen. (Rizzoli/The Museums at Stony
Brook, $70.) America's leading Establishment architectural practice
at the turn of the century, the New York-based collaboration of
Charles Follen McKim, William Rutherford Mead and Stanford White,
was an unusual hybrid of the corporate, the social and the
artistic. Their large office could do everything from train
stations and clubs to commercial buildings and churches. But it was
in domestic design that the virtuoso talents of White, a
self-conscious esthete and usual partner-in-charge of house
commissions, were at their most dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   A great-grandson of Stanford White and himself a New York
architect, Samuel G. White selects more than 30 of McKim, Mead &AMP;
White's extant houses, about a tenth of those built and a third of
those that survive. He offers a fond but perceptive portrait of a
team that gave their patrons -- fellow patricians -- exactly what
they wanted. Against a backdrop of privilege that Edith Wharton
would recognize, the author picks up on the seismic shift in
attitudes toward wealth and status that divided the firm's houses
into two distinct phases.
</P>
<P>
   As the Gilded Age grew more unabashedly ostentatious, McKim,
Mead &AMP; White's upper-crust clientele rejected the democratic image
inherent in the firm's porch-and-gable Shingle Style designs and
prompted the imperial classicism and pretentious historicism of its
later palatial schemes. Jonathan Wallen's excellent color
photographs confirm that a chill hand gradually fell over White's
vivid sense of color, texture, light and shadow. The telling
contrast between two of his mansions in Newport, R.I. -- the
tawny-shingled Ochre Point of 1882-84 and the white
terra-cotta-clad Rosecliff of 1897-1902, modeled after the Grand
Trianon -- is not so much a matter of material or money (both were
very costly ``cottages'') as one of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   GREENE &AMP; GREENE: Masterworks. By Bruce Smith. Photographs by
Alexander Vertikoff. (Archetype/Chronicle, $40.) The architect
brothers who took the Arts and Crafts movement in America to
unsurpassed heights of refinement -- Charles Sumner Greene
(1868-1957) and Henry Mather Greene (1870-1954) -- were in several
respects the equals of their greatest contemporary, the similarly
long-lived Frank Lloyd Wright. The Greenes' reverence for the
classical culture of Japan, belief in the complete integration of
architecture and interior design, disdain for historical styles and
profound understanding of natural materials were all values they
held in common with their more famous colleague. Regrettably, the
fraternal partners did not share Wright's indomitable resilience or
genius for late-life transformation.
</P>
<P>
   All three men went into a precipitous professional decline by
the outbreak of World War I, when the Arts and Crafts style fell
out of fashion, but only Wright's fortunes ultimately revived. The
Greenes, who worked in the idyllic Los Angeles suburb of Pasadena,
where they built most of their houses, dissolved their joint
practice in 1922 and struggled on separately until the Depression
finally ended their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, despite the beauty of Alexander Vertikoff's color
photographs of the Greenes' sophisticated bungalows, their autumnal
tonalities also project a certain poignancy. In his intelligent
text, Bruce Smith, a specialist in Arts and Crafts design, recounts
the personal histories of the architects' enlightened upper-class
clients. Their wealth and taste afforded them houses that whispered
luxury through humble materials handled like precious treasure and
set off by details of breathtaking inventiveness and exquisite
artistry. Small wonder that Greene &AMP; Greene's masterpiece, the
Gamble house of 1908 in Pasadena, is now almost as beloved by the
American public as Wright's Fallingwater.

philosopher, sociologist, literary critic, religious theorist,
biographer, art historian, poet, playwright and watercolorist --
that he tended to play down the one role for which he is now most
justly remembered: architecture critic. Mumford, who died in 1990
at the age of 94, had long been urged to issue an anthology of his
essays that appeared in The New Yorker from 1931 to 1963 under the
heading ``The Sky Line.'' But he resisted doing so because of his
growing anxiety that his best-known specialty would overshadow the
larger reputation he cherished as an interdisciplinary savant.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of Mumford's 1930s articles on New York,
selected by Robert Wojtowicz, a professor of art history at Old
Dominion University in Virginia and the author's literary executor,
belies any hesitation in exposing these topical reviews to the more
demanding standards of history. Mumford, an incomparable analyst of
urban design and planning, was at his best evaluating the public
housing that stood among the proudest accomplishments of the New
Deal decade. Discussing an award-winning luxury apartment house
erected by a real-estate heir at 120 East End Ave. in Manhattan,
the outspoken critic compared it in terms of light and air with new
low-cost, union-sponsored housing on the Lower East Side, dryly
noting that ``Mr. Vincent Astor's standards would not do for the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers.''

   THE ARCHITECTURE OF ADDITIONS: Design and Regulation. By Paul
Spencer Byard. (Norton, $40.) The civic-minded New York architect
and lawyer Paul Spencer Byard brings hard-won insights from his
dual professions into sharp focus in this superlative overview of
the issues inherent in designing new buildings in concert with
older ones. With concision and clarity that laymen will appreciate,
Byard covers virtually every scenario likely to be faced by
practitioners, patrons and preservationists, including adding on to
landmarks, retaining the character of historic districts and
dealing with the tricky notion of architectural ``context.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair-minded and soundly informed, Byard judges each scheme
(ranging from St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to Sir Norman Foster's
Law Faculty building at Cambridge University, completed last year)
with keen understanding of the realities that affect extensions to
individual structures and expansion of building ensembles. Though
receptive to a wide spectrum of stylistic solutions, he is always
on the side of design values that promote a more humane public
environment. The author's pithy evaluations (accompanied by
unusually informative illustrations and easy-to-read plans) make
for provocative reading. His memorable coinage for saving only the
fronts of historic buildings is ``facadomy.''

   A FIELD GUIDE TO CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE. By Carole
Rifkind. (Dutton, $45.) Even those who think they know all about
architecture in the United States since World War II will find
Carole Rifkind's bracingly idiosyncratic and admirably accessible
new survey an eye-opening experience. Although Rifkind, the author
of ``A Field Guide to American Architecture'' (1980), includes
built work by acknowledged masters of the past six decades, this is
no usual-suspects lineup. With complete self-confidence and blithe
disregard for the accepted canon, she casts a far more inclusive
eye over the man-made landscape than most current critics and comes
up with a number of structures seen in no other recent compendium.
There is something irresistible about a book that highlights
Langdon &AMP; Wilson's replica Roman villa for the Getty Museum of
1970-74 in Malibu, Calif., but ignores Richard Meier's overblown,
billion-dollar Getty Center of 1984-97 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind resurrects several once-admired buildings of
considerable merit, including Paul Rudolph's moody, inward-turning
Tuskegee Chapel of 1968-69 in Alabama and the playful, villagelike
Kresge College of 1972-74 at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, by Charles W. Moore and William Turnbull. With her
unconditional love for architecture in all its forms, she refuses
to overlook a particular style or movement on purely esthetic
grounds or merely because it has become unfashionable. Thus, if
readers will be astonished by some of her more deservedly obscure
examples, few will doubt her passion or immense skill in digesting
and summarizing the most perplexing half-century in American
architectural history.

   FRANK O. GEHRY: Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. By Coosje van Bruggen.
(Abrams/Guggenheim Museum, $55.) No other building of the 1990's
has received (or merited) the universal praise that welcomed Frank
Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain's Basque country when it
opened late last year. Indeed, several critics have already placed
this stunningly unconventional structure among the greatest of all
20th-century buildings. So startlingly animated are Gehry's
voluptuous, organic forms that analogies to the natural world are
required to describe them. But it remains an open question whether
the titanium-clad art gallery more closely resembles a gigantic
silver blossom unfolding in a gritty industrial landscape or a
colossal aquatic creature writhing and gleaming on the banks of the
Nervion River.
</P>
<P>
   This handsomely illustrated account, written by Coosje van
Bruggen (wife and collaborator of the artist Claes Oldenburg, and a
longtime friend of Gehry's), recounts the execution of this
historic commission. It also celebrates the most successful attempt
yet by Thomas Krens, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
in New York, to turn his institution into a worldwide franchise.
Though hiring the already-acclaimed Gehry, 62 when the project
began in 1991, did not amount to the discovery of an unknown
architect, Krens was canny enough to realize that the architect had
yet to do his finest work. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is not only
Gehry's masterpiece but also a delicious rebuke to the
short-sighted West Coast museum patrons who earlier rejected the
Santa Monica-based architect because they feared his maverick
esthetic and were apprehensive about being deemed provincial if
they chose a Californian to design their buildings. Like Frank
Lloyd Wright's original Guggenheim, Gehry's Basque branch is its
own most stupendous work of art.

   FROM VAN EYCK TO BRUEGEL: Early Netherlandish Painting in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Edited by Maryan W. Ainsworth and Keith
Christiansen. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $75.) If there
were a first prize in this column for beauty of statement and
probity of elucidation, this catalogue would run away with it. The
exhibition it describes is not a loan show. It has no catchpenny
title. Everything pictured in it belongs to the Metropolitan
Museum. Quite a few of the works come tagged as ``Workshop of,''
``Style of,'' ``Copy after,'' ``Follower of'' or ``Attributed to.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is this show so crowded? Why do people come away so
palpably awed and enriched? It is because early Netherlandish
painting is, apart from everything else, a school of truth. Its
truth is perennial, moreover. Its people are our people. Its vision
is our own. Its way of summing things up is still remarkably close
to ours, though the society with which we have to deal is so
different.
</P>
<P>
   The goldsmith whom Petrus Christus painted in his shop in 1449
could be the master craftsman whose shop we would love to walk
into. The ``Man in Prayer'' (workshop of Robert Campin) is a man
whom we would entrust with our troubles. As for Pieter Bruegel the
Elder's ``Harvesters,'' we can only echo the catalogue entry: ``No
more satisfying image of a wheat field, the labor of harvesting or
the atmosphere of late summer has ever been painted.'' And all
this, without a hint of puff or evasion! The show runs through Jan.
3, 1999, after which the paintings will be redistributed in the
parts of the museum (including the Cloisters) where they are
normally found.

   DELACROIX. By Barthelemy Jobert. (Princeton University, $65.)
DELACROIX: The Late Work. By Arlette Serullaz, Vincent Pomarede,
Joseph J. Rishel, Lee Johnson, Louis-Antoine Prat and David Liot.
(Thames and Hudson, $65). There is not, and quite probably there
never will be, a definitive book about Eugene Delacroix, the great
French painter who was born just 200 years ago. There is simply too
much of him, and his work was too extensive and too various, and
there was in his nature a sovereign aloofness that remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that he hid from our view. His output as a painter
has been covered in a six-volume critical catalogue by Lee Johnson,
published from 1981 to 1989, that will not soon be superseded. The
900 pages of his diary can be read over and over again. So can his
letters, though they are overdue for a more complete edition. He
had wonderful friends and wonderful admirers, along with one or two
enemies, so the word of mouth is abundant. As recently as 1989
Maurice Serullaz crowned a lifetime of work on Delacroix with a
biography that is as shapely as accessible.
</P>
<P>
   But every generation has its take on Delacroix, and the newest
entrant is Barthelemy Jobert, who teaches art history at the
Sorbonne. His is the view of a civilized and highly informed
Parisian who has had comprehensive access to Delacroix: his
illustrations include many minor but telling examples of work on
paper from the Louvre, and he has managed to give the reader an
idea of Delacroix's major decorative achievements in Parisian
public buildings that are not normally open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   His book is thoughtful, well paced and generous with insights
that (as Delacroix would have wished) stop just short of intimacy.
Those who come new to the subject could not have a better guide in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delacroix: The Late Work'' is the title of an exhibition that
can be seen in Philadelphia till Jan. 3. As its title suggests, it
begins when Delacroix was turning 50 and had only another 13 years
to live. This means that readers of the catalogue will not find the
famous ``Liberty Leading the People'' of 1830, or ``The Death of
Sardanapalus'' or ``Women of Algiers in Their Apartment.'' But this
does not mean that Delacroix in the 1850's and early 60's was
quietly shutting up shop. On the contrary. There are moments in the
show when his ambition peaked and every motif was attacked with an
unprecedented ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   This was the case with ``Lion Hunt.'' Delacroix had always been
obsessed by the lion as predator and, no less, by the lion as prey.
In the climactic period of 1855 and thereabouts, he gave symphonic
outlet to the theme of the lion being attacked by a group of men.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an unequal combat, and quite often some of the men
got the worst of it. As it was quite some time since he had been in
Africa he didn't at all mind setting the lion hunt in a landscape
not far from Paris. And if he had studied some of the lions quite
recently in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, he didn't mind that,
either. What mattered was the frenzy of the imagined struggle,
which he was very well able to simulate. And if a dealer asked,
``Couldn't you just give us another one?'' he generally complied.
</P>
<P>
   The masterpiece of this period was the enormous ``Lion Hunt'' of
1855. It measured 102 by 141 inches, and he gave it all he had.
Lions, horses and men erupt in a tumult of savagery. It is a
picture that scared people at the Salon in Paris. (``The critics
completely missed the mark,'' Delacroix said.)
</P>
<P>
   At the museum in Bordeaux, whither it was sent forthwith, it
rhymed very well with a painting of the same subject by Rubens. It
was a favorite with two rather unlikely painters, Odilon Redon and
the landscapist Charles-Francois Daubigny; both copied it. But in
1870 it was partly destroyed by fire. What survived is missing a
wide strip of canvas, 34 inches wide, at the top of the painting.
It may now look like a wounded giant, but it still inspires pity,
terror and awe.
</P>
<P>
   The catalogue has quite other things to show -- flower
paintings, in which Delacroix delighted in his mid-50's; subject
pictures powered by Shakespeare, Byron and the New Testament; and
four very large decorative panels (normally in Sao Paulo) on the
theme of ``The Four Seasons.'' Delacroix in these panels was
attentive not so much to the weatherman as to the opportunity to
paint ``Orpheus and Eurydice,'' ``Diana and Actaeon,'' ``Bacchus
and Ariadne'' and ``Juno and Aeolus.'' They were not quite finished
when he died in August 1863. But how he enjoyed doing them, and how
good they look in this very handsome catalogue!

   THE SCHOLAR AND HIS STUDY: Ownership and Experience in
Renaissance Italy. By Dora Thornton. (Yale University, $50.) This
is not an ``art book,'' though many amazing works of art can be
found in it. It is about the role in the Italian Renaissance of the
``studiolo'' -- a private place set aside for study and allotted to
one person only. The owner would eventually be judged by what that
study looked like, and by what came out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It could be rather grand, as it was when St. Augustine or St.
Jerome were portrayed by Botticelli or Ghirlandaio. Or it could be
a tumbledown affair like the one portrayed in this book by Lorenzo
Lotto. It could be a workplace, a think place or a place of prayer.
It could even be all three together.
</P>
<P>
   But, in any case, every study had to have a desk, even if it was
only a simple table supported by walnut trestles. (The up-market
version looked like a Ferris wheel, and was operated by a kind of
treadmill, bringing shelf after shelf within reach.) Whatever it
was, it had to have a place for books, and it had to have all the
apparatus for writing. These instruments could be complex and
beautiful, or they could have been bought for pennies. Among visual
aids, rock crystal lenses ranked high. Inkwells could be miracles
of contrivance. Others came paired with a container for the sand
that was needed to dry the ink. A steel hand mirror was sometimes
used for reading, placed to focus light on the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Musical instruments were welcome in the study, as were
instruments for the pursuit of geometry or the casting of
horoscopes. Showing off was bad form, but there were ways of
establishing oneself as a person of taste. There were Florentine
humanists who even invited their friends to dance in their studies,
to music laid on for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   If this consistently entertaining book sounds to be a world away
from the mainline monograph on Renaissance art, it isn't. On every
page we are drawn into the society in which great art was made,
nowhere more so than we see Albrecht Durer's plan and elevation
(studio included) of the house in which he stayed in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   MARK ROTHKO: The Works on Canvas. A Catalogue Raisonne. By David
Anfam. (Yale University, $125.) Quietly, and almost without our
knowing, we are close to the age of the 1,000-page art book.
Christmas is the time to let these mammoths loose. But ``Mark
Rothko'' is a book for all seasons, and in spite of its size and
weight, it looks right and feels right. Somewhere in this volume
you can find just about everything you will want to know about what
Rothko painted between 1924 and his death in 1970. In all, 854
paintings are catalogued, and David Anfam follows up clue after
clue that may or may not yield a new truth. If Rothko was
interested in 1960 in the movies of Michelangelo Antonioni, there
is a still from ``L'Avventura'' on the relevant page.
</P>
<P>
   And the paintings? They look gorgeous, as everyone knows. But
even on these hefty pages many of them look like miniatures.
Something of the ruminatory spread of the originals is lost in such
cases. And instead of the poignant hesitation that marks so many of
Rothko's paintings, these tiny images come toward us with every
problem solved (or smoothed away). But this is a noble book, and a
bargain in today's terms.
</P>
<P>
   GOYA AND THE DUCHESS OF ALBA. By Susann Waldmann. (Prestel,
$25.) BOTTICELLI: Images of Love and Spring. By Frank Zollner.
(Prestel, $25.) As is borne out by these new volumes in Prestel's
``Pegasus Series,'' small mercies can be great blessings. The books
have great subjects -- some of the most famous images in all
European art -- and they have something new to say about them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Botticelli: Images of Love and Spring,'' Frank Zollner, a
professor of art history in Leipzig, comes straight out and says,
``The best known paintings are the least understood.'' It is his
contention that what we have always known as Botticelli's ``Birth
of Venus'' is in reality a portrayal of the arrival of the goddess
of love on Cyprus. ``Thus far,'' he goes on, ``few details of the
picture have been interpreted either coherently or convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a pleasure to hear him put his case -- and all the more so
since the Pegasus Series volumes are a delight to have and to hold,
with their tall narrow format, their stalwart binding, their fine
paper and their ingenious choice of accessory illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Goya and the Duchess of Alba,'' Susann Waldmann wastes some
of her time (and ours) with a rubbishy novel by Lion Feuchtwanger
about Goya. But that is soon forgotten as we scrutinize Goya's
great portraits of the 13th Duchess of Alba -- the most attractive
woman of her day in Europe -- and go on to look at the highly
libidinous drawings Goya made while staying (so it is thought) at
one of her country houses. As to that, Waldmann allows the two of
them to keep their privacy. But most readers of her narrative will
decide that the jury is still out, or perhaps was never convened.
In any case, these two books would make delicious presents.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY OF MODERN ART: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture,
Photograph. By H. H. Arnason and Marla F. Prather. (Abrams, $75.)
This is the third occasion on which H. H. Arnason's ``History of
Modern Art'' has been mulled over, revised and (in this case) very
substantially enlarged. It still stands in awe before Piero della
Francesca and Jan van Eyck before taking the plunge. But thereafter
it pursues a remarkably steady, levelheaded and ecumenical course
until it ends with Mark Tansey, Raymond Pettibon, Tony Oursler and
Jeff Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Marla F. Prather, the ``revising editor'' here, is curator of
20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. As a
curator, she has star quality. As editor, she has clearly rethought
and comprehensively updated the entire ``History of Modern Art''
and the chapter on Cubism -- for which she was personally
responsible -- has both crispness and cogency. The individual
summaries of living artists are fuller and more evidently
fair-minded than is usual in books of this sort. With close on
1,500 color plates and plenty of space for short but never flabby
biographies, this book makes an ideal introduction to a hugely
complicated subject.
</P>
<P>
   Readers should note a shaft of wit, which is exceptional in
art-book publishing. The images on both the front and the back of
the jacket are made with bedclothes long subject to heavy use. On
the front is ``Blanket,'' pieced together by Sonya Delaunay with
scraps of material after the birth of her son in 1911. On the back
is Robert Rauschenberg's famous ``Bed,'' hung up and painted over
in 1955.

COOKING
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM GRIMES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the other arts, cooking goes through stylistic phases.
Baroque curlicues give way to a clean classical line, which
eventually sharpens the appetite for adornment and fascinating
complications. At the moment, after several years of tricky fusion
cooking by high-strung superchefs, a purifying wind seems to be
blowing across the culinary landscape. A new simplicity is in the
air, and it can be seen in the latest crop of cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Batali's SIMPLE ITALIAN FOOD: Recipes From My Two Villages
(Clarkson Potter, $30) makes the less-is-more case persuasively.
The first of the two villages in question is Borgo Capanne, on the
border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, where Batali spent
several years cooking in a mountainside trattoria and developing a
passion for straightforward, robust cooking. The second is
Greenwich Village, where he runs two enormously popular
restaurants, Po and Babbo. ``Simple Italian Food'' offers the best
of both these worlds.
</P>
<P>
   In true Italian fashion, Batali blends rigor and insouciance. He
describes his food as ``Italian in sensibility, but made of local
ingredients -- some never used in classical Italian cooking.'' He
likes big flavors. He dislikes fuss and bother. If he can get away
with using three ingredients, he won't tack on a fourth. This
pared-down, workmanlike approach to Italian food -- viewers of
Batali's shows on the Food Network, ``Molto Mario'' and
``Mediterranean Mario,'' know him as the Bob Vila of chefs -- makes
``Simple Italian Food'' immensely appealing and endlessly useful.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Batali lavishes attention on bruschetta,
that humblest of dishes. It can be a bore, nothing more than
chopped tomatoes and basil on a slice of grilled garlic bread, but
Batali comes up with a smooth, spicy topping of cannellini beans,
red pepper flakes, garlic and basil that's ridiculously easy to
make and almost impossible to stop eating.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it goes throughout the book. A warm terrine of
sausage, bell peppers, polenta and mozzarella could hardly be more
satisfying, and, as Batali suggests, it's the kind of dish that
cooks can sneak little surprises into, like Gaeta olives or bits of
fresh thyme. In another recipe, figs take a flying leap into the
sublime when they are stuffed with Gorgonzola and walnuts, then
baked until the cheese begins to bubble and the sugary liquid in
the figs oozes out, creating a sweet crust, the perfect
counterpoint to a paper-thin wrapping of prosciutto. No tricks
here, just brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO COOK EVERYTHING: Simple Recipes for Great Food
(Macmillan, $25) is a title with some swagger to it, but Mark
Bittman, a cookbook writer who contributes the Minimalist column to
the Dining section of The New York Times, delivers the goods. The
book, which runs to nearly 1,000 pages and contains about 1,500
recipes, strides the world of food in seven-league boots. The
familiar American classics are here, usually brought up to date
with new ingredients or techniques, but the book is a multicultural
feast, embracing ethnic foods that have become as American as apple
pie. A recipe for kimchi rubs shoulders with a recipe for kosher
dill pickles. Plain rice pilaf is followed by an international
pilaf delegation: pilaf with Indian spices, a Mediterranean-style
pilaf with wine and tomatoes, Mexican rice and a Caribbean-inspired
coconut rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to Cook Everything'' is a one-volume encyclopedia, with
clearly presented information on cooking equipment and basic
techniques, valuable mini-essays on the ins and outs of basic
ingredients and illustrations showing how to shape a baguette, cut
a chicken into pieces or peel and segment an orange. At the same
time, the book has a point of view. ``Anyone can cook, and most
everyone should,'' Bittman writes in his introduction. He hates
fast food. He hates the very idea of ``gourmet'' food. His mission
is to preach the gospel of everyday cooking -- a gift, he writes,
``to which all humans are entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   By definition, ``How to Cook Everything'' is not flashy. There
is no way to put a glamorous spin on cabbage braised with onions or
a sandwich of sauteed chicken breast and spinach. Even the more
exotic offerings, like pheasant stewed with dried fruits and
vinegar
</P>
<P>
   or grilled squab Vietnamese-style, follow Bittman's quick and
easy approach. One of the book's most attractive features is its
pink-tinted boxes offering helpful hints or variations on basic
recipes, with titles like ``Twenty-six Vegetable Dishes That Will
Make Converts'' and ``Twelve Ideas for Filling Omelets.'' This is a
cookbook whose pages are destined to become stuck together from
constant use.
</P>
<P>
   The gospel of simplicity finds a genuine prophet in Christopher
Kimball, author of THE YELLOW FARMHOUSE COOKBOOK (Little, Brown,
$27.95). The book is as much about a vanishing way of life as it is
about food, and Kimball, the editor of Cook's Illustrated magazine
and the author of the aptly titled ``Cook's Bible,'' devotes a good
many pages to conjuring up the plain country pleasures of his life
in a small town in Vermont, where he and his wife do, in fact,
dwell in a yellow farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will probably have different tolerance levels for
Kimball's heartfelt effusions and colorful country anecdotes. The
verb ``hunker'' shows up a lot. No one actually sits by the cracker
barrel, whittling and emitting the occasional ``Uh-yup,'' but it's
a close call. Tractors loom large as a cultural totem. You feel
certain that Kimball voted for Fred Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   As Kimball repeats on several occasions, ``The Yellow Farmhouse
Cookbook'' is a country cookbook. It has recipes for macaroni and
cheese, noodle casserole, baked beans, ``cheap biscuits'' and
skillet potatoes. The list is a little deceptive because the author
has done some subtle modernizing, lightening and reworking some of
the heavier old recipes and throwing in a little wiggle here and
there, while remaining true to the farmhouse spirit. The recipes
are solid. The meatloaf is firm, juicy and flavorful. The master
recipe for baked beans (``the one I bring to the annual ox roast or
to potluck suppers around town'') comes out thick and pungent, just
sweet enough to make the herbs and spices count for something.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-ARCHITECTURE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: for something.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What sets ``The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook'' apart, however, is
Kimball's experimental streak. His baked bean recipe comes with two
charts, one showing how the beans turn out when subjected to eight
different cooking methods, another showing what happens when nine
different kinds of beans are cooked with or without a presoaking.
Even when he doesn't print a chart, Kimball usually clues the
reader in on his efforts to find, say, the perfect filling for a
lemon meringue pie. The charts and commentary on kitchen equipment
are easily worth the price of the book, even if it means spending a
few hours too many around the cider press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplicity'' may not be the first word that comes to mind in
connection with Le Bernardin, the renowned, very expensive
Manhattan seafood restaurant, but it applies. Rare is the recipe
title in LE BERNARDIN COOKBOOK: Four-Star Simplicity (Doubleday,
$35) that's longer than six words. Sole with artichokes and pink
peppercorns. Pistou vegetable soup with mussels. Roast cod nicoise.
Spiced skate in sage broth. Recipe after recipe reflects the severe
philosophy that Gilbert Le Coze and his sister, Maguy Le Coze,
brought to Le Bernardin in Paris and later New York.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a work interrupted. Gilbert Le Coze had been working
on it for years when he died suddenly in 1994 at the age of 48,
leaving his sister to complete the cookbook and carry on with the
restaurant. She has written a touching introduction about their
childhood in Brittany, where they helped run the family hotel, and
of their struggles to establish Le Bernardin. Eric Ripert, who took
over the kitchen without missing a beat, has added many of his own
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Great restaurants do not easily produce great cookbooks. The
food at Le Bernardin is deceptively simple. It is subtle and
difficult to pull off unless the chef has access to the freshest
seafood and cooks with a very fine hand. There is nothing to hide
behind. The roast monkfish on a bed of bacon and savoy cabbage
clearly demonstrates that all it takes is one good idea to make a
dish sing. Gilbert Le Coze, an untrained, idiosyncratic chef, saw
that the smoke and salt in slab bacon and the earthy crunch of
cabbage would work beautifully with the meaty flesh of monkfish.
The dish is one of the restaurant's signatures. The home chef will
probably wonder what all the fuss is about. The poached bass with a
fragrant, tangy nage (an herb-infused broth), perked up with fresh
ginger, coriander and scallions, makes a pleasing spa dish, but
again, it all depends on the bass. The recipes work. Any home cook
can manage them. But for some kinds of cooking, you have to go to
the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, sometimes you don't. Against all rational
prediction, DESSERTS BY PIERRE HERME (Little, Brown, $35), by
Pierre Herme and the American cookbook writer Dorie Greenspan,
manages to translate the work of France's most celebrated pastry
chef onto the printed page and make it accessible to home cooks of
only average ability. Herme, not yet 40, is already a legend. The
son of a pastry chef, he apprenticed as a teen-ager with Gaston
Lenotre, went on to assume command of the pastry kitchen at Fauchon
in Paris and at 35 shifted operations to Laduree, Paris's oldest
pastry shop and tea salon. He is the only pastry chef to be
decorated as a Chevalier of Arts and Letters.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain, then, the perfectly simple lemon loaf cake? An
8-year-old child could make it. In fact, an 8-year-old child could
teach a 5-year-old child to make it, and both of them would kill to
eat it. The loaf is springy and moist, aglow with tart lemon flavor
and the richness of creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   The book abounds in easy-to-make pleasers like the lemon cake,
some of them with unexpected twists, like the coriander in the
coconut loaf cake or the apple tea that infuses a creme brulee.
Herme has a silly side too -- evident in his Rice Krispies treats
(the main ingredients are caramelized Rice Krispies and Nestle's
Crunch).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the book includes a full lineup of showstoppers, like
the Chocolate Dome, a triple-threat chocolate dessert in which two
layers of chocolate cake are buried under an avalanche of chocolate
mousse, then smothered with a shiny chocolate glaze. For dieters, a
visit to the Dome will be a shameless joy ride through the very
heart of Sin City. Home hobbyists will find it a thrilling
architectural project, requiring patience but no great skill. The
instructions in the book are a model of clarity and precision, and
when Greenspan asserts in her introduction that ``none of the
recipes is beyond the capabilities of an average home baker,'' she
means it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegant simplicity,'' Paula Wolfert writes, is the common bond
that unites the disparate recipes in her MEDITERRANEAN GRAINS AND
GREENS: A Book of Savory, Sun-Drenched Recipes (HarperCollins,
$27.50), a strenuously researched work that can be seen as a
travelogue, a culinary swashbuckler -- or the world's most
unbeatable collection of stories on the theme ``What I Did on My
Summer Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert, the author of ``The Cooking of the Eastern
Mediterranean'' and ``Paula Wolfert's World of Food,'' is the
foremost practitioner of extreme cookbook writing. Her endless
search for the old ways of cooking, and the old wisdom that goes
along with them, takes her across deserts, up twisting mountain
trails and into a thousand and one home kitchens from Spain to
Morocco to Turkey. If it involves grain or greens and it's in the
Mediterranean, Wolfert has been there and got the complete story.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipes really are simple. Polenta slices topped
with caramelized onions and grated Asiago cheese make a flavorful
first course, and who knew that a spicy paste of beet greens and
Swiss chard could achieve such heft and density? It's billed as a
dip, but it throws real weight around, and Wolfert's clever recipe
for seven-day preserved lemon means that you don't have to wait the
usual six weeks to try it out.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert's insistence on absolute authenticity doesn't always
work in the reader's favor. Again and again, recipes seem to
include one ingredient that requires a quick trip to Tunis or
Istanbul. The description of Black Sea corn bread approaches
self-parody. Seeking to reproduce the recipe, which she encountered
in Turkey, Wolfert tried sweet corn from a local market. No good.
She tried toasted dried corn ordered by mail from Pennsylvania.
Ditto. She huddled with Zarela Martinez, the owner of the
restaurant Zarela in Manhattan, and hit on chacales, a dried corn
from Mexico. Closer, but still no good. ``All I can do is suggest
that, if you visit the fabulous Black Sea coast of Turkey, you stop
at the restaurant Kerasus in Giresun and try it for yourself,''
Wolfert writes.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion noted. That seems simple enough

 &UR; By CALEB CRAIN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``As I am you despise me,'' Charles Brockden Brown wrote to a
friend and ex-roommate on New Year's Day 1798. ``How can I remove
the burthen of your scorn but by transforming myself into a new
being? . . . I shall die, as I have lived, a victim of perverse &AMP;
incurable habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's friends were used to his high-strung self-reproaches.
The playwright William Dunlap called them ``mysterious &AMP;
unintelligible.'' Another friend, Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, heard
them so often he lost patience. ``What, my friend, is the meaning
of all this?'' Smith once demanded of Brown. ``If you meant that we
should understand you, why were you not explicit?'' But it does not
pay to be explicit -- not even to your friends -- when you are
trying to get away with something. Brown was trying to get away
with writing novels. And in the American Gothic style that he would
pioneer, an air of mysterious criminality was a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Brockden Brown was born to a family of Philadelphia
Quakers in 1771. Modern literary critics harp on the ``Brockden,''
probably because three names sound grander than two, and because,
at cocktail parties, it helps to distinguish him from Snoopy's
friend. But Brown himself may not have been so fond of his middle
name. He got it from his great-uncle Charles Brockden, whom
Benjamin Franklin once described as ``an eminent Scrivener or
Conveyancer.'' The original Charles Brockden was a paralegal --
like Melville's Bartleby, though not as lowly. Brockden researched
property titles and copied legal documents. Brown's father, too,
worked as a conveyancer, after he had failed as a merchant. The
family gave young Charles B. Brown an education so that he could
become something better -- a lawyer proper. But inadvertently, that
education introduced him to the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau
and Samuel Richardson, who sowed in Brown a wish to use words even
more freely and imperiously than lawyers do.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the critic Leslie Fiedler, Brown became ``the
inventor of the American writer.'' Brown was the first to live a
myth that is still familiar, despite the Federalist-era particulars
of his case. A young man with delicate health (consumption) and a
strangely overkeen conscience (see the self-reproaches above)
shirks a responsible career (law) to run off to New York City,
where he camps out in the apartments of his radical friends
(deists, vegetarians and anarchists) and risks his life (during a
yellow fever epidemic) for no very good reason. After years of
unemployed vagrancy, when everyone has given up on him, he writes
masterly novels that earn him little money. He then gives up on
art, marries, takes a steady job, and dies in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a Library of America edition compacts into one
volume a career that spanned decades. But to publish three of
Brown's novels at once approximates the pace at which he wrote
them. In 1798, the year he burst forth, Brown wrote two and a half
novels. By 1801, when he gave up fiction, he had written seven (one
has been lost), as well as novel fragments and short stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1846, the transcendentalist Margaret Fuller called Brown one
of ``the dark masters,'' because it was Brown's genius to descend,
precipitously, into the twisty maze of a lonely mind that was
trying to think its way back to the light. Fuller also noted that
Brown was something of a feminist, since he ``usually placed this
thinking royal mind in the body of a woman.'' Brown's ``Alcuin''
imagined a gender-neutral utopia and a critique of marriage based
on William Godwin's anarchist philosophy. Unfortunately, this
Library of America edition omits ``Alcuin,'' as well as Brown's
most woman-centered novel, ``Ormond,'' whose heroine not only
resists but stabs to death her would-be seducer, just moments
before her girlfriend breaks down the door to save her. But the
reader does get to meet Clara Wieland, the fierce protagonist of
Brown's first published novel. As Kevin Williamson, the
scriptwriter of ``Scream,'' could tell you, as a rule horror
heroines should be sturdy. If you think a character is braver than
you are, it is easier to let your guard down and sympathize with
her fear. Appropriately, the Clara of ``Wieland'' is strong, and
she protects her boundaries. She lives alone, rather than with her
brother's family, because she is ``an economist of pleasure.'' To
danger she is ``habitually indifferent.'' The first time the
Wieland family hear a voice they can't explain (they learn, much
later, it's a ventriloquist's), her brother Theodore feels dread,
but Clara feels only ``a thrilling and not unpleasing solemnity.''
Clara obeys another law of horror scripts, too: she is so out of
touch with her feelings that she has no idea whom she can trust --
and therefore, neither do we. Love, in Clara's narrowed eyes, is
``a passion that will never rank me in the number of its
eulogists.'' She also has the obligatory traumatic past: one night
while praying, her father spontaneously combusted.
</P>
<P>
   Clara is thoroughly modern. Ventriloquists, however, are no
longer scary, which makes it hard to read ``Wieland'' today with
the terror it deserves. When Clara addresses the villain Carwin, a
young man who knows how to throw his voice, as ``O most fatal and
potent of mankind,'' 20th-century grown-ups may giggle. For an
analogous modern threat, you would have to imagine someone who
knows your credit card numbers, has broken into your E-mail account
and has pocketed your cell phone. In the late 18th century,
selfhood was not digitized, and the human voice had the burden of
representing political agency, sexual reputation and financial
integrity. You were only as good as your word, and words were
supposed to give order to the world. It makes sense that an
18th-century set of words, the Constitution, should have balanced
power so exquisitely as not to have toppled in 200 years. Corrupted
by Godwin and Rousseau, Brown was experimenting with words that
failed to give order, or words that called up the disorder of
violent feelings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GOTHIC-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: violent feelings) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Clara unmasks Carwin, she shrieks that ``he is able to
speak where he is not.'' She could be accusing her villainous
author and the suspect potential of his art. If voices can be split
from their subjects, if stories can be made up, then it becomes
impossible to know any social fact for sure. And so, in obedience
to another rule of the horror genre, Clara blames the wrong person.
Carwin the ventriloquist is no mastermind killer. He is just a
piece of news: in the future, the media will be unreliable,
striving for sensation rather than accuracy. Carwin is a geek. The
real monster is someone else, whom this new contingency pushes over
the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's writing can be clunky, almost as if he wants to call
attention to the inadequacy of words to experience. For example,
when Clara hears two voices in her closet debating whether to shoot
or strangle her, she explains that ``flight instantly suggested
itself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous.'' A sentence
like that is meant to take a little too long to read. It's the
literary equivalent of the movie actor pausing to tie his shoes
while the audience screams and the spree killer raises his ax.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ventriloquism, the peril in ``Arthur Mervyn'' is
accessible to modern readers -- eerily so. A plague of yellow fever
has descended on Philadelphia, poisoning society with distrust and
fear, just as young Arthur arrives in the city to find his fortune.
Arthur hires himself out as a scrivener, but in a plot twist that
hints at Brown's distaste for the family business, the man Arthur
copies for turns out to be a forger -- as well as an impostor,
adulterer, thief and murderer. In an odd congruence, Arthur's
panics, vigilance about secrets, imprudent idealizations and
doubtful moral choices foreshadow uncannily the modern experiences
of gay men who came to the metropolis in search of community, only
to find an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur Mervyn'' may have the messiest plot that the Library of
America has ever published. In Part 1, Chapter 23, for example,
Arthur discovers in his master's attic something that ``furnished
matter which my curiosity devoured with unspeakable eagerness,''
but it is apparently too awful to share with the reader, who is
hurried on to the next shock, a house of prostitution. Brown does
not unravel his mysteries so much as distract you with new ones.
Brown's first biographer complained of ``this perpetual intrusion
of novelty to explain a novelty.'' However, these disruptions in
Brown's style -- the ``ambiguities, abruptnesses and dark
transitions,'' as he called them -- are Gothic effects. They are
designed to unnerve and compel. Brown's plots have loose ends, but
so do most nightmares. (The narrative logic of David Lynch's ``Lost
Highway'' was not exactly airtight, either.) When Brown writes that
all the men in the Mervyn family die before the age of 21, it may
irk a close reader that Brown ends his novel, happy marriage and
all, without either firing or unloading this Chekhovian rifle. But
an omen would not be quite so frightening if you knew for sure it
would come true.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar logic of distraction and dislocation at work
in ``Edgar Huntly.'' The book starts as a whodunit. Edgar wants to
know who killed his friend Waldegrave. He spies on a man named
Clithero, who has the guilty habit of digging up and reburying a
box while he sleepwalks. Soon Edgar is chasing Clithero through a
jagged and confusing limestone landscape in Pennsylvania, then
sleepwalking himself, then slaughtering cougars, then slaughtering
Native Americans -- and we never find out who killed Waldegrave.
Brown's fugue feels genuine, nonetheless. There is nothing aimless
about Edgar's path from mourning to obsession to violence. It may
have been the path of Brown's own mind, as he tried to mourn his
friend Elihu Hubbard Smith. A sort of junior Ben Franklin, Smith
had provided the intellectual spark that ignited Brown's fit of
creativity. He supported Brown through his fallow years,
spiritually and financially, but then died of yellow fever halfway
through the writing of ``Arthur Mervyn.'' Like Waldegrave in
``Edgar Huntly,'' Smith left behind a cache of letters full of his
troubling, radical ideas. In Federalist America, that was not an
easy legacy to inherit, and Brown, like Edgar Huntly, survived it
by making a violent break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar Huntly'' was Brown's last Gothic novel. One of his
brothers suggested that readers disliked his books' gloom. Since
Brown was impatient to earn a living as a writer, he decided that
this was ``a sufficient reason for dropping the doleful tone and
assuming a cheerful one.'' Unintentionally, Brown's cheerful tone
was even more gruesome, and he soon dropped fiction altogether. He
should have persisted in gloom, which would eventually earn a
commercial reward that outran the avarice of his most flagitious
villains. Though he did not realize it, during his brief, doleful
career Brown succeeded in infecting America with his perverse and
incurable taste. The nation has been horrified ever since.

THE BEST BOOKS OF 1998
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best books of 1998, chosen by the eight editors of the Book
Review from 25 initial nominees, are three novels, two collections
of stories, three biographies, a scientific tour d'horizon and two
books about slaughter -- one concerning diplomacy to end it in the
Balkans and another asking why it happened and no one tried to stop
it in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it might seem the editors are habit-bound. There
were also 11 books on the 1997 list, by four women and seven men --
and this year's 11 are by four women and seven men. Last year,
however, six of the writers had appeared on these lists previously.
This year only two are repeaters, a biographer of Victor Hugo and a
Canadian fiction writer making the list for the sixth time in 15
years. And one of the books here is its author's first -- a fairly
rare occurrence. All the fiction writers are North Americans; the
nonfiction authors are three Americans and three Britons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no history in the lot. That is unusual. But the
biographies contain a great deal of it, our reviewer called one
novel a personalizing of history, and the volume of science is a
biological history recounting four billion years. One biographer
has a passion for his subject's warts and poetry, but the two
others exhibit tendencies that may signal a sea change in our
mores: the life of a robber baron is eminently evenhanded and does
not try to incite mobs against him, and the life of a painter does
not peek once into the artist's bedroom. What is going on? Do these
writers not know this is the year of the Starr report?
</P>
<P>
   The boss's 1997 decree that editors' discussions must be civil
held this year, with a vengeance: everyone found flattering things
to say about every book nominated. The result was that the boss
expressed surprise that the majority did not make the cut when we
voted. Is that remark the first sound of the crumbling of civility?
Sweeter than a nightingale's song it was.
</P>
<P>
   Certain types of books, like letters and diaries, are not
eligible for nomination. It was not a remarkable year for them in
any case, although last month did see publication of ``I Will Bear
Witness,'' the disturbing diary of Victor Klemperer, a Jewish-born
German academician during the Nazi years.
</P>
<P>
   The best books are chosen from among those reviewed here since
last year's Holiday Books issue, and the summaries below are
generally drawn from the reviews. They are not included among
Notable Books of 1998, the list of which begins on page 65.
</P>
<P>
   BIRDS OF AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By Lorrie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   The two epigraphs of Lorrie Moore's third volume of short
stories are taken from poems on birds -- one by Amy Clampitt
questioning whether their songs mean anything and another by
Charlie Smith musing that grief cannot be translated into any
comprehensible language. Moore bypasses translating emotions. She
uses her fluid, colloquial sentences and her mordant wit to pry the
feelings of her characters loose inside the readers, where they
resist articulation and make us sense the depth of the predicaments
that most of her protagonists, usually women, fail to extricate
themselves from. The story is Moore's natural scale, and the best
in this collection, especially the last three, are stellar
performances. They all concern cancer -- the whole book is a
probing of mortality -- but even the most overpowering of them, the
already famous ``People Like That Are the Only People Here,'' has a
kind of steady hilarity amid its sublime darkness. Moore, like
Samuel Beckett, sees that nothing is funnier than unhappiness. Her
precise observation of characters' horror, or suffering, is often
delivered in prose that extorts laughter, and the mirth is a jolt
when it bursts out. Here is a measure of her mastery: in a reverie,
a mother discovers that despair over her baby's cancer has deprived
her of once formidable gifts of expression, and her search for
words to define her grief becomes a satire of Moore's own writing.
Now that is confidence, and it is fully justified.
</P>
<P>
   CLOUDSPLITTER
</P>
<P>
   By Russell Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Harper Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   How do you survive upbringing by a fanatical prophet? You don't.
That is the story in Russell Banks's huge novel about the
abolitionist John Brown, whose 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry was one
of the fuses that detonated the Civil War. Banks seems to take his
cue from the assertion by some modern historians that history is
not an account of what happened but of what people think happened.
This domestic drama is told early in this century, nearly 50 years
after Harpers Ferry, by Brown's son Owen, a spiritual tag-along to
his father. Slowly, deliberately -- the storytelling often assumes
the leisure of timelessness -- Owen draws a magnificent picture of
the older Brown as an unmoved mover, a man of giant ambitions whose
biblical learning makes him eerily worldly; his absolute
righteousness is a religious mystery, not a neurosis, but a mystery
that still brings madness and death to his children and pain to
some escaped slaves for whom he is ready to kill if need be. Next
to him Owen appears emptier page by page; he knows he died with his
father on the scaffold. Banks's analysis is moral, not
psychological. The result is that the closer John Brown gets, the
more he too appears a ruin -- drawn by Piranesi, to be sure --
scorched and gutted by the purity of his vision. Fittingly, Banks
brings the whole world to witness Brown's fate: revolutions, the
fall of empires, the grandeur of the earth; indeed, the American
landscape is virtually a character, heralded by the book's title,
the name of a mountain.

   LIFE
</P>
<P>
   A Natural History of the First
</P>
<P>
   Four Billion Years of Life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Fortey.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   At last a book that puts dinosaurs in their place -- and it
turns out to be a niche. Dinomania has nearly blinded the public to
the reality of evolution. But Richard Fortey, a British
paleontologist with an extensive range of humane learning and a
gift for arresting language, gives a coherent account of the
biological history of earth for four billion years, surprisingly
the first popular but authoritative one written by a professional.
This is no boring slog, but an adventure -- one comes away with a
reverence for the courage of the students of fossils -- in which we
meet weird creatures like rats as big as bears, dragonflies as big
as people, carnivorous kangaroos, poisonous sea octopods and
shell-crushing clams. Fortey does not present evolution as warfare,
but at times the development of species does look like an arms
race. In his words the evolution of whales from land animals is as
dramatic as some paleontological expeditions he describes. He
decries the mutation of natural history museums into entertainment
palaces, but his book has plenty of entertainment in the form of
digressions, literary excursions and surprising analogies -- enough
to irritate some readers. However, it is a survey of the facts of
life that reliably summarizes state-of-the-art knowledge from many
sciences, and it is written for readers with no science. It will
help them understand the specialized and often technical books on
evolution that make headlines but leave most people wondering why.

   THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN
</P>
<P>
   Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By Alice Munro.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Munro is, in Virginia Woolf's phrase, one of the few
writers ``for grown-up people.'' Retrospection has always been
important in her work, but never has she been quite this autumnal,
acting as the mediator between the way people lived around 1960,
when all but one of these eight stories begin, and the way we live
now. She has an uncanny ability to make a reader realize that
people really think differently in different eras and that morals
may shift more quickly than customs. The price can be, as she puts
it in a story about a woman who leaves her family to be with her
new lover, a pain she will have to get used to until it is ``only
the past she's grieving for and not any possible present.'' Her
stories were always long, and now they grow longer. The title story
-- an extraordinary accomplishment even by Munro's soaring
standards -- is really a novella. Also, her conclusions have become
ever more open, without being inconclusive. A woman who thinks she
knows a quiet man's secret about a drowning death suddenly sees
that she faces ``an entirely different possibility'' from the one
that had grounded her until now -- her life will harden into a form
unimagined before. The large, enigmatic quality of this ending is
reflected in the other stories; they never end where we expect them
to and never take a turn without pain. They are like life, but
trying to detect their shifts in time or point of view is as
difficult as trying to remember where a change came in one's own
life that put one in another world altogether.

   THE POISONWOOD BIBLE
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Kingsolver.
</P>
<P>
   Harper Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   Zeal is mere termite food in Barbara Kingsolver's novel about a
white American clergyman's religious mission to the Congo in 1959.
At least ostensibly, this is Nathan Price's story. But it is told
by his wife, Orleanna, recollecting years later on an island in
Georgia, and her daughters, writing in Africa -- an epistolary
novel from places so remote the letters might have been sent to sea
in bottles. The picture of Price is merciless; Kingsolver implies
that his story is only the one men always tell. There is a load of
political message here, but ultimately this is a novel of
character; the women discover themselves as they lose faith in
Price and find another one, each according to her kind. The tone of
Orleanna's reminiscences is ironic, and Kingsolver's use of her
unconscious dissembling to reveal her pain is masterly; the mother
confides in Ruth May, her baby, the catalyst for breaking up the
family, and there is wisdom in every sentence. Rachel, the first
daughter, is the brainless soul of American materialism. A younger
sister, Adah, is hemiplegic, limping and nearly speechless, but a
verbal gymnast whose wit sets fire to her diary and lights up the
true nature of anyone she notices. Her twin, Leah, is the
conscience of the novel, always measuring the distance she has to
go before she is worthy of Africa. Perhaps the greatest character
is collective, the Congolese, whose perfect adaptation to the
harshness of their lives amid drought, hunger, pests and diseases
is simply beautiful. Their rejection of American salvation feels
triumphant.

   PRESTON FALLS
</P>
<P>
   By David Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers go bust in this scary novel, the whole generation of
them. Doug Willis is a New York public relations executive, and his
wife, Jean, a successful designer; they live in Westchester County
and own an old getaway house upstate. He is a maelstrom of male
vanity whose obsessive irony has left him with little but a
withering reflexive consciousness and the cynicism he hopes will
prevent him from going missing in the middle of life. Jean's form
of denial is keeping up an illusion of normality no matter what
happens; she is no wiser than he is, but she is nicer. She's also
nicer than their two children. When Willis takes two months off to
work on the old house, a family fight on the first weekend lands
him in jail, and the lawyer who springs him turns out to be a drug
trafficker who brings Willis into the trade. Briefly the dope is a
whiff of youth, but then Willis, in a panic about what he is doing,
flees the country life without telling Jean where he's going. From
there till the end of the novel the suspense about his fate is
brilliantly maintained. David Gates has a superb reporter's
precision, an analyst's ear, a teen-ager's glee in exposing
deception and a moralist's eye that is as unforgiving as Evelyn
Waugh's. Here the entire culture is deception, and as these
characters betray themselves ever deeper into it, the very
possibility of trust, of reliable understanding, is worn away. A
reader ends up wary of looking at the book again once he's finished
-- because anything could happen and whatever does is likely to be
irremediable.

   The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
</P>
<P>
   By Ron Chernow.
</P>
<P>
   Random House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, John D., we hardly knew ye.'' Sorry. It is not that Ron
Chernow unearths so much new information about John D. Rockefeller
in this biography, but his dispassionate portrait places the man in
so rich a context that we understand how he gathered more economic
power into his hands than anyone before or since, and, to a large
extent, we know why he did it. As we recognize the intelligence,
courage and vision of the man, his rapacity and cunning become more
alarming, not less. Chernow catches the early Rockefeller better
than anyone has -- the quick-witted young man who had developed by
the time he was 30 all the principles and techniques of his
business life. With mischievous humor Chernow points out that his
analysis of the American economy was Marxist, and he chose to solve
its problems with monopoly. The Government finally broke the
monopoly, but Rockefeller's organization of Standard Oil has been
the model of global business ever since, and the company's reach
and power taught the Government the vulnerability of the economy to
manipulation and the need for regulation. Finally, we see that
underlying all his achievements and philanthropies was a deep
religious commitment that was shared by his wife. It shaped them,
their family and, through the philanthropies, many religious,
educational and social institutions.

   TO END A WAR
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is the grungiest job, if one judges from Richard
Holbrooke's account of the negotiations he led in 1995 to end years
of war in Bosnia. But it must be satisfying, because this
enthralling book is also a heartfelt call to America to use its
power when societies break down and to become a steady global force
resisting human rights abuses everywhere. It is filled with
anecdotes and sharp pictures of the wily Balkan leaders Holbrooke
had to deal with, as well as with shrewd and seldom flattering
analyses of the personalities and motivations of timid American and
NATO military commanders. Foreign diplomats who complain that
Holbrooke is a bulldozer in the polite corridors of international
politics may be right, but few could complain that he is gutless.
His re-creations of battles over principle and tactics with Western
generals and State Department and White House officials are
dramatic, and his description of a rudderless Administration during
the early days of his efforts is astonishingly candid, and
convincing. It is telling that the decision to use heavy air
strikes to bring the Serbs to the bargaining table was not a
careful calculation but an act of desperation. His combativeness
may offend the pinstripe set, but it is wonderfully refreshing on
the page; it is a very rare book on diplomacy that makes you feel
you were in the midst of it, and excited to be there.

   THE UNKNOWN MATISSE
</P>
<P>
   A Life of Henri Matisse:
</P>
<P>
   The Early Years, 1869-1908.
</P>
<P>
   By Hilary Spurling.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Can this be a biography? It says next to nothing about Matisse's
sex life. More than half the population has lived its adult life
thinking biography means sex, but here if there's a mistress, well,
she's glimpsed in our passing among canvases, but we look at them,
not her. In fact, it is a smashing good biography, this first
volume taking us up to the painter's 40th year -- Matisse before he
was Matisse. Hilary Spurling's role is advocate, and she is a
formidable one. Her heroic research pays off; her sense of the time
and place, of Matisse's family and friends and competitors, of the
old teachers and Young Turks in the French art world, is admirable.
We are swept into all-night arguments among aspiring artists about
what art is, and into their dreams and prospects. We even fear for
Matisse -- will he ever find his style? The tentativeness of his
career is pointed up by the deaths or despair of contemporaries who
were his equals in art and by his failure into middle age to gain a
public. A painter's development is both an intimate and an open
transaction, and Spurling makes us feel its peril. By the end of
this volume, although Matisse is still largely unknown as an
artist, it is clear that having nothing to lose is increasingly a
spur to his creativity, and one begins to sense that the next door
he opens may be the last he has to.

   VICTOR HUGO
</P>
<P>
   By Graham Robb.
</P>
<P>
   W. W. Norton &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   What a life! By the time he was 30, Victor Hugo had witnessed
Napoleon's Iberian campaigns and seen his fall; his poetry had made
him the lion of Paris, and his drama had touched off street
battles. He was elected to the French Academy and the Senate before
he started a steady march to the left that made him a political
force in the revolutionary period from 1848 to 1851, and he became
a national hero when, in exile, he led opposition to Napoleon III
for two decades. When he died in 1885, at 83, his funeral drew two
million people. His huge body of work in every genre has saturated
the French language with his expression. Even in life he
disappeared in a cloud of myths he created -- tribune of the
republic, the arch-romantic, the lifelong womanizer. Graham Robb
penetrates the myths and exposes the hidden impulses and hurts that
gave rise to them, and he has deep sympathy for the women, many of
them victims, who flocked around Hugo. His enthusiasm for Hugo's
writing is infectious, and we share his annoyance that there is no
good modern English translation of any of it. He tells us to put
down his book and read ``Les Miserables.'' Read both. Hugo lifts
spirits. Robb will open your mind and heart. His is the best
biography of Hugo in English and probably the best single-volume
one in any language.

   Stories From Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Gourevitch.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the Government of Rwanda called on everyone in the Hutu
majority of the country to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority.
In 100 days 800,000 people were killed, most of them individually
cut down with knives. The daily killing rate exceeded that of the
Nazi Holocaust, and the deed was done mostly not by trained cadres
but by neighbors, co-workers, even family members. In the years
since, Philip Gourevitch, a New Yorker writer, has talked to
survivors, witnesses and participants to discover the origins and
personal motives for this collective crime. His grim book -- it is
his first -- lays a burden on the world's conscience. This
genocidal crime now has faces, names, personal psychologies. As we
encounter people involved in the massacre, we cannot pull back from
looking into their souls, and our own. As the title -- taken from a
letter by seven Christian pastors to their religious leader --
indicates, there were warnings. Those given to international
agencies, especially the United Nations, make dismal reading. And
American policy, which encouraged the United Nations to stay out of
internal conflicts, is sickening in retrospect. The history of
Belgian, French and British racism in colonial times bears on the
massacres too. Gourevitch withholds judgments, but his restraint
gives his book a subtle, subterranean power.

GARDENING 
 BY VERLYN KLINKENBORG
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from the pile of gardening books at my feet, this is the
season, or so publishers believe, when gardeners throw off the
petty restraints of practicality -- considerations like time, money
and space -- and unstay their imaginations. A gardener is always
trying to steep himself in the moment and to read the year ahead as
well. But the snowdrops are still very distant this month, too far
away to anticipate, and the midwinter moment is dark and
uninspiring. So instead of pretending to find salvation in seed
catalogues, instead of staring at the iced-over brush pile that
will neither compost nor burn, instead of refining the pencil
scratchings that pass for garden plans, why not open a book and
transport yourself to a softer hardiness zone, where gardens are as
extensive as the mind and labor is as cheap as thought?
</P>
<P>
   Some garden writers let you smell the earth in their prose.
Their paragraphs are damp at the knees from weeding. But if you're
going to set aside practicality, for now at least, you should do it
with an air about you. Take the tone from Beverley Nichols, whose
MERRY HALL, first published in 1951 and reissued this year by the
redoubtable Timber Press ($24.95), is the very model of gardening
insouciance. Nichols, an Englishman who wrote at least once about
everything and died in 1983 at 85, is nearly the Bertie Wooster of
gardening, and I say nearly only because some would consider it an
insult to be called the Bertie Wooster of anything. But about
Wooster, the creation of P. G. Wodehouse and the employer of
Jeeves, there was a carefree quality that resulted from the fact of
employing Jeeves and that sometimes chafed against it. The same is
true of Nichols, who purchased a small estate -- Merry Hall --
complete with a brilliant gardener named Oldfield, who was haunted
by memories of his previous employers. Nichols is a master of
hyperbolic understatement, an invaluable asset in the English
garden. ``I once owned a house with a 999 years lease,'' he writes,
``and it gave me an unbearable sense of being a sort of weekend
guest; it hardly seemed worthwhile planting the hyacinths.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a season of books that defy the reader to ignore the
labor that went into the gardens they depict, which is a thing no
actual human can do. Nature happens but gardens don't, and the
pleasure of large illustrated garden books is greatly increased if
you can adopt a Bourbon indifference to the matter of labor and
gaze over your demesne, like Louis XIV while Versailles was still a
construction site, without noticing the little people at work upon
it. And, of course, the invariable convention of large illustrated
garden books is to show completely uninhabited gardens, as if the
camera were king and everyone had suddenly ducked out of its regal
path. Three very different but worthwhile examples of this genre
are THE AGNELLI GARDENS AT VILLAR PEROSA: Two Centuries of a Family
Retreat (Abrams, $75), by Marella Agnelli; GARDEN ORNAMENT: Five
Hundred Years of History and Practice (Thames and Hudson, $29.95),
by George Plumptre; and AMERICAN DESIGNED LANDSCAPES: A
Photographic Interpretation (Spacemaker Press, $49.95), by Alan
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Villar Perosa lies north of Turin and has belonged for nearly a
century and a half to the family that founded Fiat. ``The Agnelli
Gardens at Villar Perosa'' portrays both gardens and family, and it
is surprisingly effective at creating in the reader a sense of the
esthetic power of this place. I say surprising because at first the
photographs are more than a little irritating -- purposely blurred,
grainy, almost out of register. What succeeds in this book is not
the photographs per se but their cumulative arrangement, enfolding
the reader, by the end, in the grandness of these 25 Italian acres,
which are punctuated by hornbeams and at least one remarkable
araucaria.
</P>
<P>
   Grandness is the solitary note in Plumptre's ``Garden
Ornament,'' published in England several years ago and just
reissued in this country in paperback. By garden, Plumptre means
Vaux-le-Vicomte or Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, and by ornament he
means a colossal, artfully concealed cruciform canal with a stone
Pomona oxidizing somewhere near. Luckily, he also means urns,
seats, pergolas and gates -- the sort of things a mortal might try
to incorporate in a garden plan. This book is a useful and visually
instructive history of architecture and ornament in gardens that
are the horticultural equivalent of the tower of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking of these three books is ``American Designed
Landscapes.'' Above all, it's a reminder of how powerful
black-and-white photography can be, even of gardens, and how well
it captures rhythmic effects in the landscape. This book contains
suites of photographs of places like Biltmore, Dumbarton Oaks,
Solana, Naumkeag and the Blue Ridge Parkway. The boundary between
garden and landscape is not a clear one, and Ward exploits the
ambiguity, especially in his photos of the Blue Ridge Parkway,
where a ribbon of asphalt gives the illusion that the surrounding
hills were laid in place solely to accentuate the beauty of the
highway's curves. These are eloquent photographs, and they are
excelled this season only by the work of Lynn Geesaman, a wonderful
photographer who has learned to use a ghostly saturation in her
black-and-white pictures of European gardens and landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Geesaman has just published her first book, called POETICS OF
PLACE (Umbrage Editions, $45), which is not to be missed by
gardeners or photographers. From such celestial terraces it is just
a short descent into the realm of gardens where one's personal
labor might actually be exploited from time to time, where you
might be required to tie up a wayward spray of this or disentangle
a stem of the other. No heavy lifting or spading yet, for this is
still a realm, as it was for Adam and Eve, demanding ``no more toil
/
</P>
<P>
   Of their sweet Gardening labour than suffic'd /
</P>
<P>
   To recommend cool Zephyr.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK--GARDENING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: cool Zephyr.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this shelf I would place ARTS AND CRAFTS GARDENS (Rizzoli,
$35), by Wendy Hitchmough, and REFLECTING NATURE: Garden Designs
From Wild Landscapes (Timber Press, $39.95), by Jerome and Seth
Malitz. The subject of ``Arts and Crafts Gardens'' is the several
late-19th- and early-20th-century gardeners, designers and
architects -- notably Gertrude Jekyll, William Robinson, Sir Edward
Lutyens and Philip Webb -- who, in places like Munstead Wood, Great
Tangley Manor and Hidcote, laid a new foundation under the English
and American sense of what a garden might do. There are passages in
these gardens that suggest intimacy -- domesticity, even -- but
horticultural opulence is what strikes the reader here, rather than
an imperial expanse of space, as at Tivoli, or a merely regal
profusion of statuary and squirting water, as at Versailles. This
is the kind of book in which you can simply luxuriate if you like
but which will also cause you to begin taking notes or to scratch
emendations into your garden plan.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of ``Reflecting Nature,'' an extended photo
essay, with text, by a father-and-son team from Colorado. The
conceit here -- and it is a good one -- is to show garden scenes
from unaided nature, like a seaweed pool in Acadia National Park or
a stand of aspen in Rocky Mountain National Park. In this beautiful
book, gardening is as much a trick of the eye -- a matter of
framing the composition -- as it is of design, construction, plant
selection and husbandry. ``Reflecting Nature'' is a study in visual
literacy for the experienced and inexperienced, the diligent and
the lazy alike.
</P>
<P>
   Nature -- or rather naturalness -- is also the dominant concern
in Penelope Hobhouse's NATURAL PLANTING (Holt, $45) and Ann
Lovejoy's NATURALISTIC GARDENING: Reflecting the Planting Patterns
of Nature (Sasquatch Books, $21.95). These books presume that
readers will get dirt under all their nails and perhaps sore backs
from working with garden forks. The emphasis in both these fine
books is the same: to help create gardens with a natural feel,
where the idea of ``natural'' pays homage to Jekyll and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Any work by Hobhouse, a recent recipient of the Victoria Medal
of Honor from the Royal Horticultural Society, leads naturally to a
mention of works by two extraordinary plantsmen who also received
that medal: MY GARDEN IN AUTUMN AND WINTER (Timber Press, $24.95),
by E. A. Bowles -- a facsimile of the 1915 edition -- and CUTTINGS
FROM MY GARDEN NOTEBOOKS (Sagapress, $39.95), by Graham Stuart
Thomas. These are the kinds of books in which the ordinary gardener
peers over the horizon, so to speak, and begins to glimpse what it
means to devote one's being to plants. Few of us have friends of
whom we can speak as knowingly or affectionately as Bowles speaks
of crocuses. As for Thomas, he reminds you that there is no pursuit
where emotion and intellect are quite so entwined as gardening. I
can't avoid recommending the 1997 reprint of Thomas's TREES IN THE
LANDSCAPE (Sagapress, $35). There, the meaning of a lordly eye,
with dominion over all it sees, is perfectly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   From naturalness it is a mere step to wildness, and that is the
subject of Philip Keenan's WILD ORCHIDS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA: A
Botanical Travelogue (Timber Press, $39.95). This is a fascinating
book, both as a study of wild orchids and as a study of enthusiasm
itself. The author has traveled all over this continent in search
of wild orchids, to which he devotes a gaze that is unwavering.
This book is likely to make mildly skeptical readers feel as though
they had been born with no eyes, and no passion either.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other fine books this season, of course,
including Patrick Taylor's MAKING GARDENS (Timber, $29.95) and
Jennifer Potter's SECRET GARDENS (Trafalgar Square, $29.95), but I
want to close with gardening in literature, as represented by two
fine anthologies: Jamaica Kincaid's MY FAVORITE PLANT: Writers and
Gardeners on the Plants They Love (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $18)
and Jane Garmey's WRITER IN THE GARDEN (forthcoming from Algonquin,
$18.95). But the work I have particularly in mind is Henry
Mitchell's ON GARDENING (Houghton Mifflin, $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``On Gardening'' is the final collection of Mitchell's gardening
essays, which were published in The Washington Post until he died
in 1993. (The first two collections are called ``The Essential
Earthman'' and ``One Man's Garden.'') Every gardener has a folly,
an imponderable affection, and the prose of Henry Mitchell is mine,
if loving prose this well made is foolish at all. Some writers
spend their whole lives searching for subjects, and some writers,
like Mitchell, make of one subject a whole life, though to call
gardening one subject is a little unfair. The literature of
gardening is filled with towering figures -- towering and, at
times, a little austere, a little too ready to sack the countryside
and frighten the peasants. But whatever Mitchell knew about plants
and gardens -- and he knew plenty -- he had to bring to bear in the
columns of a newspaper and in a small backyard garden in
Washington. He alludes to this garden in a remarkable variety of
tones. Some days it was everything a reasonable man could expect in
life -- a place where plants would grow. Some days it was nothing
but a hot catwalk and a dry brick patch. Even at its worst, it was
better, in Mitchell's opinion, than trying to garden in England's
miserable climate. To him, gray clashes with everything.
</P>
<P>
   It's always tempting to quote Mitchell, but once you start it's
hard to know where to stop. He is the gardener for all of us who
know better but do worse, and a quotation from him on that topic
will bring us full circle. ``Hyacinths,'' he wrote in a December
column, ``should be planted in October, in friable, rich, well-dug
earth that crumbles easily when rubbed in the fist. So sue me.''

NOTABLE SCIENCE FICTION OF 1998
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This list has been selected from books reviewed since the
Holiday Books issue of December 1997. It is meant to suggest some
of the high points in this year's science fiction. The books are
arranged alphabetically under genre headings. The complete reviews
of these books may be found at The New York Times on the Web:
www.nytimes.com/books.
</P>
<P>
   ANTARCTICA. By Kim Stanley Robinson. (Spectra/
</P>
<P>
   Bantam, $24.95). Robinson is at the top of his form in this
near-future novel about the men and women who fall in love with the
ice-bound continent and fight over its development. Like John
McPhee, Robinson finds drama and poetry in the raw facts of
geography and geology.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOM. By Wil McCarthy. (Del Rey, $23.95). A journalist named
John Strasheim finds himself on a journey to the heart of a
``technogenic'' organism that threatens to eat the solar system.
Life's determination to survive, no matter what the consequences,
is the theme of this rousing yet thoughtful adventure story.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHILDREN STAR. By Joan Slonczewski. (Tor/Tom Doherty,
$24.95). Are our conventional notions of intelligent life too
narrow? To the well-meaning human colonists on the planet
Prokaryon, the answer is a matter of life and death. The author, a
biology professor with a strong feminist bent, has written a puzzle
story that begins slowly but moves toward a climax filled with
intellectual and emotional fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   CIRCUIT OF HEAVEN. By Dennis Danvers. (Eos/Avon, $14.) ``Romeo
and Juliet in Cyberspace'' might be the subtitle of this moving
love story, in which technological barriers threaten to separate an
appealing pair of ``star-cross'd lovers'' as painfully as the more
traditional barriers of class and clan.
</P>
<P>
   MOCKINGBIRD. By Sean Stewart. (Ace, $21.95). As in his previous
``Resurrection Man,'' Stewart writes about magic as if it were an
everyday occurrence, with its own rules and reasons. Antoinette
Beau-champ is an actuary with a sense of humor, an indispensable
survival trait for the daughter of a witch who inherits powers she
cannot control -- without a little help from her friends.
</P>
<P>
   THIS ALIEN SHORE. By C. S. Friedman. (DAW, $23.95). Traveling
faster than light warps the mind yet allows humans to fill the
galaxy with new kinds of societies that tap the long-buried
potential of the genome. Jamisia, a young girl on the run from
interstellar plotters, turns out to be a key player in this
breathlessly plotted, emotionally savvy space opera.

  By ANDY GRUNDBERG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This season's bounty of photography books has an international
flavor in both subject matter and source. Volumes surveying places
far and near -- Algeria, India, Jerusalem, South Africa, New York
City -- abound. That's par for the course, though; what's
interesting is that American trade publishers are increasingly
relying on offshore imprints for their titles. Art houses like
Editions du Seuil in Paris, Phaidon in London and Scalo and Edition
Stemmle in Zurich are the source of many of the most beautiful and
interesting books this year, but you often have to look carefully
to tell. The trend has a downside: for all the virtues of the
photographs, the texts in these books can be stiffly translated and
negligible in terms of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   As for American specialized publishers, Arena Editions, now in
its second year, continues to take chances with a volume on the
emerging photo artist Vik Muniz, and Distributed Art Publishers
adds to its publishing record a new and different Lee Friedlander
book. Fans of more classic modern photography have to be content
with the recycled images of some of their favorites -- books on the
work of Margaret Bourke-White, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Man Ray and
W. Eugene Smith are new this year but not especially novel. The
nominees for the most interesting faded reputations to be brought
back to light are Ellen Auerbach and Lottie Jacobi, two Bauhaus-era
women whose careers are more interesting than the books devoted to
them. Landscape photography also takes a new turn that is less
skeptical than in recent years. But the expanding universe of
photography books is a great deal larger than this suggests, as
readers will discover soon enough on their holiday bookstore
rounds.

   AMERICAN MUSICIANS: Photographs. By Lee Friedlander. Preface by
Joel Dorn. (D.A.P., $49.95.) If the sight of Tammy Wynette wearing
a red dress and standing all alone in a thick green wood spells
</P>
<P>
   D-I-V-O-R-C-E to you, or if an image of Aretha Franklin belting
out a song with her eyes pinched shut spells R-E-S-P-E-C-T, this
new collection of Lee Friedlander's photographs will prove to have
charms beyond the usual appeal of his artful, snapshot-indebted
style. Chalk it up to our cultural nostalgia for the 1960's and
70's, or to the photographer's obvious affection for the people who
make American music unique, but the book's more than 500 pictures,
in color and black and white, have an irresistible appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Musicians'' breaks a mold established by a dozen or
so previous Friedlander books. It consists largely of pictures the
artist made in the course of commercial assignments for record
companies, not as part of a purely personal artistic effort. As a
book it has a commercial appeal as well. The design, by Katy
Homans, puts as many as 10 pictures on the page and forgoes the
conventional and pretentious coffee-table look in favor of a
practical, lap-size square format. The result conveys a new and
exciting understanding of Friedlander, one of our most important
contemporary photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look here for any pictures of Yo-Yo Ma or Kiri Te Kanawa,
or of Jimi Hendrix or Jerry Garcia. Friedlander's idea of
indigenous American music extends only as far as bluegrass, rhythm
and blues, country and western, gospel, and jazz in all its
variations. Still, the cast of characters is beyond reproach: Eddie
Arnold, Count Basie, Solomon Burke, Ray Charles, Miles Davis,
Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday, Hank Jones, Wilson Pickett and a
hundred-odd others. The portraits are arranged by musical genre,
the thickest section being devoted to jazz, which -- no surprise --
is Friedlander's favorite. His fondness for jazz (and for a son who
plays jazz cello) also explains a lot about his photographs, which
often are rhythmically and tonally complex in composition.
</P>
<P>
   Vik Muniz: Seeing Is Believing. (Arena Editions, $65.) Vik Muniz
is arguably this year's hottest photo artist, and this elegant
survey of his work of the past 10 years offers evidence that he is
no flash in the pan. The earliest pictures in the book, from a
series called ``The Best of Life,'' are exemplary of his witty,
conceptual approach: Muniz began by making drawings from memory of
famous historical images, including Alfred Eisenstaedt's V-J Day
embrace, Eddie Adams's picture of a Vietcong suspect being shot at
point blank range and NASA's picture of an astronaut walking on the
moon. These fractured but evocative renditions were then
photographed and converted to halftones, giving them the same
qualities (if not the same features) as the originals. In other
series, Muniz's prodigious drawing skills are highlighted:
landscapes after Corot done with thread, portraits of Jamaican
children made from sugar, a remake of Harold Edgerton's milk-drop
photograph drawn in Bosco syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz, who also draws with dirt and sculpts with wire, is heir
to the rebellious, conceptual tradition of older artists like
William Wegman and Robert Cumming, and like them he works to
confuse the existing boundaries between art mediums, converting
photographs into drawings and drawings back into photographs. His
labor-intensive procedures are aligned with much recent art, like
the installations of Ann Hamilton. Unfortunately, the
transformation of his work into reproductions in a book takes away
some of its sting; photographs of drawings, when reproduced, look
like drawings unless you are told otherwise. Still, the
reproductions and essays suffice to explain Muniz's intentions and
his popularity.

   JULIA MARGARET CAMERON'S WOMEN. By Sylvia Wolf. (Yale
University, $49.95.) This is the book that Julia Margaret Cameron,
the premier photographer of the Victorian era, has long deserved.
Not only are the 63 full-page plates well chosen and superbly
printed, but the texts -- which include contributions by Stephanie
Lipscomb, Debra N. Mancoff and Phyllis Rose -- place Cameron's work
in arresting contexts. Wolf, a curator at the Art Institute of
Chicago who organized the exhibition on which this book is based
(appearing through Jan. 10 in Chicago, it opens on Jan. 27 at the
Museum of Modern Art), justifies the concentration on women by
arguing that these pictures, much more than Cameron's well-known
portraits of men, constitute her greatest achievement. In separate
essays Rose considers Cameron's penchant for basing her personae on
tragic figures; Mancoff relates the importance of Arthurian legend
to Cameron and to Victorian artists in general, and Lipscomb
provides information about how Cameron sold her pictures as art --
and for how much.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-PHOTOGRAPHY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: for how much.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the pictures: Mary Hillier, a maid, cast as a
regal Madonna; May Prinsep, the photographer's niece, staying at
Cameron's estate on the Isle of Wight, posing as the condemned
Beatrice Cenci; Julia Jackson, another niece, portrayed as herself;
and the wonderful Alice Liddell, at 20, taking no prisoners as the
goddess Pomona. Each is a jewel of surprisingly provocative
expression. All that keeps this from being a definitive work is the
absence of Cameron's cast of heroic Victorian males, but here they
seem irrelevant.

   ALBERT RENGER-PATZSCH: Photographer of Objectivity. Edited by
Ann and Jurgen Wilde and Thomas Weski. Introductory text by Thomas
Janzen. (MIT, $60.) Originally published in Germany by Schirmer
Mosel, this collection of 113 black-and-white images from the
1920's to the 60's makes clear just what the movement called New
Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) in photography was all about.
Renger-Patzsch, who was the movement's leading practitioner,
embraced modern industrialism with all his heart, photographing
trains, machines, quarries and slag heaps with the same admiring
precision that he applied to cathedrals, snow-covered landscapes
and medieval castles. Besides epitomizing the hopes of Weimar-era
Germany for a rational, ordered existence, Renger-Patzsch also
provided a stylistic model for Bernd and Hilla Becher, postwar
artists whose photographs portray the decline and fall of the very
industrial order he glorified. To see his picture ``Katharina Mine
in Essen, 1956,'' with its blank sky and exact attention to
structure, is to see the Bechers' work in embryonic form --
suggesting that objectivity, new or old, is not a dead issue in
contemporary photography.
</P>
<P>
   RIVER OF COLOUR: The India of Raghubir Singh. (Phaidon, $49.95.)
It is a rare year that does not bring us another book of Raghubir
Singh's color photographs of India, usually in the form of a
specific precinct of that country's varied geography -- Calcutta,
Rajasthan, Kashmir, Bombay. But here, in a lush coffee-table book
guaranteed not to fit a standard bookshelf, is both a summary and
the essence of Singh's photographic record of his native land.
Relying on the ability of modern color film to convey bold color
and extremes of light and shadow, he fashions a stirring
celebration of life amid extremes of heat, poverty, overcrowding
and desolation. At their best his pictures are filled with
narrative incident and visual surprise, in a manner that is based
in the decisive-moment approach of Henri Cartier-Bresson but that
also is indebted to the more radical framing of Garry Winogrand. Of
all of Singh's books to date, this is the most essential and
stirring.

<P>
   HUTTERITE: A World of Grace. By Kristin Capp. Texts by Kristin
Capp, Sieglinde Geisel and Rod Slemmons. (Edition Stemmle. $75.) In
1994, at the age of 30, Kristin Capp ventured into a Hutterite
community in eastern Washington State and began a series of
pictures that describe a group of farm people living at one remove
from the culture that she, and we, take for granted. Today's
Hutterites, like the Amish and Mennonites, are descended from
16th-century Anabaptists and, as Capp's pictures show, they retain
many of their ``old ways,'' like making their own clothes and
farming their land communally. But Capp also shows a fair share of
new ways, including Hutterite big rigs and gleaming food-processing
equipment. All of this would add up only to a good National
Geographic article were it not for the tender and mysterious
quality of Capp's square black-and-white portraits of young
Hutterite women, which suggest the existence of an interior
complexity within their beautifully plain exteriors.

   LIFE PHOTOGRAPHERS: What They Saw. By John Loengard.
(Bulfinch/Little, Brown. $35.) Ever wonder how Life photographers
like Alfred Eisenstaedt, Carl Mydans, George Silk, Co Rentmeester
and John Olson managed to make those memorable photographs that
remain lodged in the popular imagination 25 to 50 years after the
fact? John Loengard, himself a Life veteran, has done us all a
service by interviewing 43 of Life's best-known photojournalists
(and including a CBS interview with himself) about the how, who,
what, where and when of their most famous pictures. Some of the
stories are deliciously wicked -- Gordon Parks telling how Roy
Stryker of the Farm Security Administration photo project needled
him into taking his most famous picture -- and some are run of the
mill, but all are fascinating footnotes to the still images that
once had more of an impact than television or the Internet.

   HART ISLAND. By Melinda Hunt and Joel Sternfeld. (Scalo. $45.)
DISARMING THE PRAIRIE. By Terry Evans. Introductory essay by Tony
Hiss. (Johns Hopkins University. Cloth, $55; paper, $29.95.) Both
of these slim, earnest books attempt something important: to
relocate landscape photography from its recent role as a critic of
human presence in nature toward a more balanced viewpoint that sees
mankind as part of nature. Both books focus on territory where
nature seems to be in the ascendant and man on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Hart Island,'' which was photographed by Joel
Sternfeld in conjunction with an art project by Melinda Hunt, the
territory is the traditional potter's field of New York City, which
for more than a century has held the graves of the indigent and
friendless. It has served other purposes as well, including housing
delinquent children and recovering drug addicts, but judging from
Sternfeld's pictures it retains a wild, untamable demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the prairie of Terry Evans's book is the former site
of the Joliet Army Arsenal in Illinois, where TNT and other
munitions were made in bunkerlike buildings since World War II.
Although the now-abandoned buildings remain, as they do on Hart
Island, they are being reclaimed by the forces of nature. In both
books, the visible signs of decay are given pride of place, lending
an elegiac air to what otherwise might seem purely documentary
images.

   The Patrician Malady.
</P>
<P>
   By Roy Porter and G. S. Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 393 pp. New Haven: Yale Press. $35.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; BIGFOOT &QL; 
 &UR; By CLAUDE RAWSON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Things you should know about gout: One in a hundred white males
are at risk. Women seldom get it before menopause. Executives are
more likely to get it than blue-collar workers. In 1952 it was
unknown in Asia, in the tropics and among blacks, but it is now
common in Japan and spreading in the third world, Roy Porter and G.
S. Rousseau tell us in ``Gout.'' Like many illnesses, gout has a
cultural history and an image. The image is of dyspeptic
aristocrats, port-swilling neurasthenics, Dickensian fireside
tipplers -- a ``patrician malady'' or ``monarch's disease'' (the
Emperor Charles V and several kings were victims), or else quaintly
``olde worlde.'' But it is modern and democratic, or at least
meritocratic or upwardly mobile, a disease open to the talents.
</P>
<P>
   Like consumption, gout has sometimes been regarded as a badge of
genius, so much so that the uncertainly diagnosed diseases of great
writers (Coleridge, Tennyson, Carlyle, Darwin) were automatically
assumed, by themselves and others, to be gout. Unlike consumption,
gout doesn't evoke the frail pallor of the ailing artist, a Keats
or a D. H. Lawrence. Often unromantically sited in the big toe,
gout is gross, not refined. The 18th-century physician George
Cheyne specifically said it was a disease for well-fed and hearty
types. Sensitive or refined persons suffered from ``nervous''
disorders instead. If genius nevertheless claims gout, the fact may
go back to ``patrician'' pretensions: geniuses like to think they
are spiritual aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gout comes from Latin gutta, ``drop'' (French goutte), and
describes a flow ``of matter from the body's vitals to the
extremities.'' It was known in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome
(where it spread under the Empire and was associated with luxury
and decadence). It was often identified with rheumatoid arthritis.
The two were uncoupled, but not definitively, in the 17th century,
by the English physician Thomas Sydenham. It was also associated
with sexual virility, a macho martyrdom (``those who have nothing
to do with women'' were thought to be exempt), though Greek
physicians and others opined that when luxury reached a certain
point, even eunuchs and premenopausal women were at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise, and abstinence from wine and sex, were thought to
prevent it. Cures included bleeding and purgatives, as well as a
repellent diet of ``easily digested food.'' Sea voyages were
recommended because seasickness made one vomit. It was said that
the swollen-footed Oedipus (among other heroes of Greek story) was
a sufferer. But Freud, our greatest Oedipal thinker, seems to have
mentioned gout only once, in another connection, evidently thinking
that gout was sometimes just gout.
</P>
<P>
   There was a snobbery of gout. The great 18th-century arbiter of
social caste, the Earl of Chesterfield, announced that rheumatism
was for hackney coachmen but ``gout is the distemper of a
gentleman.'' Gout was even thought to be hereditary. It ``ran in
good families.'' It is one of the illnesses that, at certain
moments in history, acquire cultural glamour, while rheumatism, its
Cinderella cousin, never made it as a fashionable disease. If you
believe Jane Austen, giddy romantic girls would sooner fall in love
with a consumptive scoundrel than a good man with mild rheumatic
symptoms. Sydenham, himself a victim of gout, liked to think he
shared it with ``kings, princes, generals, admirals,
philosophers.'' It had class, as well as a classless grace or
predemocratic cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Sydenham and others also thought gout a medical blessing,
protecting victims from more serious diseases by acting as an
``overflow pipe, Nature's means of evacuating poisons.'' One author
said it was an antidote to ``murdering Maladies'' and dangerous
fevers. It was incurable but not fatal, and sufferers tended to be
long-lived. During plagues, war and famine, the gout-ridden were a
disproportionately small minority among fatal casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Gout has an 18th-century aura. Bewigged grandees boastfully
nursed their big toes. Men of letters -- Voltaire, the novelist
Smollett, the poet Cowper -- and the scientist Sir Joseph Banks
were victims. Some were fat, like Dr. Johnson, others thin, like
Horace Walpole. They wishfully consoled themselves that the gout
would protect them from other diseases, but Walpole also developed
rheumatism. Johnson concluded that gout ``is only a dog that drives
the wolf away and eats the Sheep himself,'' and insisted on having
his gout ``evicted.'' His friends thought he ``died of repelled
Gout.'' Benjamin Franklin debated whether gout was his friend or
his enemy. The best advice was thought to be to hold on to your
gout, and make sure it stayed in the foot. This did not help Edward
Gibbon, whose gout didn't protect him from a hydrocele, or swollen
testicle, the size of a melon, which went septic after surgery and
killed him. The worst fate was imagined by Swift, as usual: ``As if
the gout should seize the head, /
</P>
<P>
   Doctors pronounce the patient dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1679, the Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek observed that
the chalky deposits of a gouty relative were crystalline. This
discovery was not followed up. It was only in 1848 that the English
physician Alfred Garrod identified the crystals with uric acid, of
which gout was a ``defective'' excretion. Gout thus differed from
other rheumatic disorders, which, he said, showed no sign of uric
acid. In 1892, Alexander Haig argued that uric acid was a cause of
both illnesses, defining rheumatism as affecting ``a large number
of joints'' and gout ``one particular joint.'' But then, the
authors say, Haig thought ``all diseases were caused by excess uric
acid!'' Unlike Garrod, Haig held that gout was not hereditary.
There continued to be to-ing and fro-ing on that issue, to which
this book seems not to suggest a clear resolution. But it assures
us we now know gout's chemistry and have drugs to control it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GOUT-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: control it.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gout has always been associated with high living. Its growth in
the 18th century seems to have been due to increasing affluence,
exposing more people to protein-rich diets. In 1703, the Methuen
Treaty with Portugal brought large quantities of port into Britain,
and the use of lead in wine casks was thought to be an additional
risk. But Porter and Rousseau think there was also a ``gout wave''
factor, which made doctors attribute undiagnosed symptoms to gout,
as they did to hysteria in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, gout became a cultural icon. It made you
interesting. Not being a killer disease, like the plague or
consumption or cancer or AIDS, it never came to be seen as
tragically emblematic of its time. It belongs instead with
``hysteria,'' ``neurasthenia,'' ``neurosis,'' differing oddly from
these lesser aura-conferring maladies in its gross physical
visibility. I doubt if there was any other period in which social
distinction and moral complacency could be derived from a
grotesquely enlarged toe. If anyone still believes in the myth of
an Age of Reason, this should lay it to rest.
</P>
<P>
   This book is as much a cultural as a medical history. The
authors take up the ancient analogy between the body natural and
the body public, noting that gout was thought of ``as a
constitutional disease.'' The pull of the pun seems more evident
here than the tang of truth, but medical denials that gout was
hereditary were apparently regarded as a leveling challenge to the
British Constitution. ``As the constitutional diseases are often
hereditary,'' the Scotsman William Grant said in 1779, ``so the
hereditary diseases are always constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other illnesses, gout was often described as a war within
the body. War language was full of gout insults. A royalist writer
in the English Civil War referred to ``a Gouty Army of Cut-throats
(called by some Saints).'' One writer complained that ``Old Bishop
Gout, that lordly proud disease, /
</P>
<P>
   took my fat body for his diocese.'' An exuberant literature of
swelling, excess, bodily effluvia, jovial fatness and exploding
decrepitude grew up around gout images. There was a visual
tradition to match, especially rich in phallic grotesqueries
mushrooming out of a large gouty foot. Painters and cartoonists
have thrived on gout, from Hogarth to the present, and are well
represented in the illustrations. This abundant, generous, somewhat
repetitious and disorganized book is very good reading

   Fairies and Victorian Consciousness.

   Illustrated. 272 pp. New York: Oxford Press. $29.95.

 &UR; O.K., SO DON'T CLAP &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES R. KINCAID &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   DO you believe in fairies? I don't know about you, but I am not
prepared to give that question the time of day. If it's a matter of
saving Tinker Bell in the play, I'll clap; but a scholarly book,
equipped with citations, up-to-the-minute jargon and a thesis to
ride ought to spare us. Carole G. Silver's ``Strange and Secret
Peoples'' does not, it is true, insist that we ourselves hold what
she calls ``the fairy-faith''; but it wants us to believe that this
faith gripped the Victorians, or most of them, and not just
fisherfolk and crackpot rural antiquarians either.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to embrace the proposition that the revival of
fairy lore during the 19th century was not simply decorative, but a
haunting of the imagination and spirit of the time that drained
large measures of the nation's capacity to ``believe.'' The
Victorians were not just charmed or fascinated or willing to put up
with elf dogma; they swallowed it whole, most of them. Silver wants
us to believe they believed. The problem is that what she brings
forth as evidence counts only for those who are already true
believers: it's all Bigfoot tracks and circles in the cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   I am not persuaded that most Victorians took it for granted that
there were flitting things among them, invisible or hiding in the
leaves, things like elves, sylphs, banshees, undines, bogles,
brownies, cluricanes, pixies and Ihiannon-shees. I think only a few
bedazzled people -- cuckoos, fakes, half-wits and loonies --
imagined any such thing. I am sure the Victorians liked having
access to the sentimental and horrifying possibilities of fairy
lore; they found the figurative language useful. We still do. My
own father-in-law, for instance, is best described as a troll in
his fondness for lurking under bridges, his warts and his
willingness to eat about anything. But that doesn't mean he is a
troll in any literal way, I expect.
</P>
<P>
   The annoying issue of belief aside, this is an entertaining and
informative study of Victorian culture, seen through the colorful
lore of those fairies who are ugly, vicious and murderous. Silver
has no interest in flower-folk and cute stuff generally; she wants
to get at such hard-nosed issues as Victorian racism, colonialism,
patriarchal oppression and class anxieties. She needs the nastier
fairies for that.
</P>
<P>
   Silver is a relentlessly enthusiastic and thorough scholar (she
teaches English atYeshiva University), and she has found many
references to fairies in libraries and at conferences. She has
found so many that she has taught herself to believe that they were
everywhere, that Victorians thought of little else, that every
Victorian was as interested by fairies as she. After all,
everywhere she went in her focused research there were fairies, and
it is an easy matter to forget how many minutes there were in a
century occupying how many millions of Victorian minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorian study of fairy lore acts as an excellent
reflection of both the dominant ideas and the concealed anxieties
of the era,'' she says. Her zeal gets the better of her: Victorian
``social and cultural concerns'' are ``perhaps shown elsewhere, but
never in such sharp relief.'' Not only is an examination of
Victorian fairy-study a way to get at the culture; it is the very
best. Want an example? Victorian fears about an increase in the
number of changelings (defective infants swapped by the fairies for
good ones) ``came to be located in the nexus of Victorian anxieties
about difference, race and class.'' This is new historicism run
amok. I might as well say that American interest in ``The X-Files''
or ``Teletubbies'' exists at the very marrow of all our really big
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once we get past the hyperbolic claims and the
evangelical zeal, ``Strange and Secret Peoples'' provides some of
the most original reading on the subject we have. Silver's spirited
and clever analysis of the Victorian fairy revival shows how it
found strength in literature, in the growing development of
folklore and cultural anthropology, in Darwinism, in the discourse
of ``otherness'' generated by new ideas of race and in the need to
find some narrative, even a cruel and anarchic one, that would
offer relief from the mechanistic and empty story the Victorian
industrial world seemed to be telling. She gives very lucid
summaries of the development of a specifically nationalistic fairy
world and of the competing, unfailingly ingenious accounts of where
fairy stories came from: remnants of tales about an aboriginal
pygmy race or about Druids hiding underground from Roman and
Christian persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her special-topics chapters are very rewarding and a
blessed break from the special pleading. Halfway through the
chapter on changelings, she stops trying to convince us that
Victorians were, every last one of them, ``obsessed'' with
changelings, stops citing Weekly World News stories (``The
Tipperary Horror: Michael Cleary, Convinced Wife Is a Fairy
Changeling, Burns Her Alive'') as if they constituted evidence and
gets to sober and smart analysis. Changelings, she suggests, embody
ideas of savagery, of ``lower races,'' and, sadly, form a shadow
folk explanation for childhood diseases that resisted explanation
and cure: spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy and failure
to thrive. Silver movingly shows how the horror of little deaths
might find outlets in the alien and strange, not as explanation but
as a way of giving some form to the inexpressible.
</P>
<P>
   When Silver is content to demonstrate how figures like these
merely reflect ``sociocultural signs of British racism and
xenophobia,'' she is terrific. The discussion of powerful fairy
brides (swan maidens) in legend and popular culture is convincingly
linked to cultural fears of female sexual power and to attitudes
about divorce, suffrage and women's rights generally. Even finer is
the discussion of dwarf-goblin figures as displays of social
Darwinism in its crudest forms. Silver touches on well-known
literary figures from Mr. Hyde to Wells's Morlocks to show how the
dwarf embodied imperialist racism and a variety of disguised forms
of fascinated horror.
</P>

 &UR; UNDATED: fascinated horror.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians were fond of the lore of the terrible woman --
the sidhe, lamia, vampire or Ihiannon-shee. In these stories, the
face of evil was female and that evil was aggressive and violent.
The extraordinary violence could be excused by the claim that it
was, after all, lore: it was ``permitted to be 'crude' because it
was authentic.'' Silver is just as acute and surprising in dealing
with the decline in fairy popularity. It became too cutesy, she
says, too settled in the nursery (largely because of Lewis Carroll
and J. M. Barrie, neither of whom are her favorites). Also, fairies
became too much the subject of crude positivism, attempts to
``prove'' their existence by, for instance, photographing them. The
famous Cottingley photographs of 1917 hurt serious fairy thinking
by the very intensity of the media glare and the dubious stamp of
``authenticity'' awarded to the photos by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
It wasn't so much that the butterfly cut-outs in the photos are
fakes as that fairies can hardly thrive if they need ocular proof,
Silver says. Once fairy lore was an aid to cultural survival; now
it was a media circus, alive in our time only in ravings about
aliens and U.F.O.'s coming here with their rectal probes. Quite a
falling-off from tales of sidhes leading unwary travelers into
bogs.
</P>
<P>
   My recommendation is to blot out all the talk about belief,
which is much like enjoying the choir and snoozing through the
sermon. This clever and entertaining book need not only be
appreciated by the true believers. And anyhow, some beliefs (not
many) may be nourishing. I have heard that only 92 percent of
Americans believe professional wrestling is fixed. That leaves 8
percent who must hold fast to the belief that pro wrestling is
straight-from-the-shoulder authentic. Many wrestling believers,
clearly, live in Minnesota; but not all. Eight percent of the
population amounts to, let's say, 20 million people. That's a fair
number; and if we can't say that the wrestling-faith has quite yet
``gripped the imagination'' of our culture and exists as the nexus
of our darkest and most perplexing anxieties, we can say that the
faith is ``growing'' (why not?) and that it will soon become our
very heart. Wrestlers are not the same as fairies, perhaps, but I
think there is a considerable overlap in the charm exerted by both
and in the quality of faith required. If that's true, there's hope
for the fairy-faith. Honest wrestlers and fairies haunt my dreams
and yours too. I don't just suspect that; I believe it. And that
belief is about to sweep the nation.

HOW COMPUTERS CONNECT FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
  By BRONWYN FRYER

<TEXT>
<P>
   When 6-year-old Derek Fearon, who lives in a New York City
suburb, lost his first tooth, he longed to show his stubby white
prize to his grandmother, ``Bubbe.'' It hardly mattered that she
lived in Boca Raton, Fla. His mother simply turned on the computer
and clicked on an icon. In seconds, Derek could see and hear his
grandma as if she were in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed it to me and said, 'Look, Bubbe!''' recalls Derek's
grandmother, Judith Levy. 'What's better than seeing the face of my
grandchild?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a century ago, the telephone began to alter forever the
way human beings communicate. Today, the Internet is retracing the
telephone's path, not only changing the way we go about our
business but also transforming the way we keep in touch with our
loved ones. Electronic mail, videophones and family web pages are
allowing us to maintain close contact at a minimal cost, regardless
of distance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Videophones: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Levy's thrice-weekly conversations with grandson Derek are
hardly the stuff of science fiction. They come courtesy of
videophone technology _ in this case, Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera
Pack. The camera pack, which ranges in price from $149 to $300
(each party must have one), provides everything a computer-equipped
family needs for those virtual family get-togethers. Kodak's DVC
323 ($169) is another good choice.
</P>
<P>
   For Marcy Fearon, mother of Derek and 3-year-old Dylan, the
videophone has already transformed the family. ``Grandmother is no
longer someone the children hear about once in a while,'' she says.
``It's like she's actually in the house. It's a real blessing for
the children, who don't get to be with their grandparents very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Videophone technology typically consists of a camera that mounts
on a computer monitor, a video capture card that is inserted in a
slot inside the computer, and software that places calls and
transmits video images over a regular telephone fine.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the quality of the sound and picture can be
iffy. Also, the person on the other end has to be compatibly
equipped, and the telephone line must be working well. Some
technical novices find the installation and setup daunting. (Levy
had a technician install hers.) And the technical requirements are
generally too stiff for anything less than a fully equipped
multimedia computer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Family websites: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Steve and Leslie C. brought their new baby boy to their San
Francisco home, Steve's coworkers gave him a gift that keeps on
giving: a family website. ``I got the baby shower, and Steve got
the site,'' Leslie says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Steve and Leslie's site boasts regularly updated pictures
of their son, Sam, who now 1 1/2. As the child has grown from
infancy to toddlerhood, Leslie's brother in Massachusetts and
sister in Southern California have been able to see how he's
filling out and to share milestones _ like Sam's finally surpassing
the size of the family cat!
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to set up a website. With software like IBM's
deluxe version of the 1999 World Book Multimedia Encyclopedia
($70), families can employ easy-to-use templates to create their
own individual, group, or newsletter-style pages. The software also
helps families research information from the World Book to include
on their sites, like facts about the breed of the family dog, and
create links to other, related sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scanners: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To get your snapshots up on a site, the best way to go would be
to use a desktop scanner; these are now priced at $200 or less and
produce crisp color reproductions of ordinary photos. Just plug the
scanner into your computer and load the companion software. Place a
photo on the scanner, close the lid, click a button on your
computer screen, and voila: Your photo is digitized, suitable for
electronic use.
</P>
<P>
   Good scanners include the HP ScanJet 5100C ($299) and the AGFA
SnapScan EZ ($129). Once you have your digital pictures, you can
post them to your site.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet service providers offer free website service.
America Online, for one, gives its members free space for a site
and a simple, easy-to-use tool with which to build it. The effort
is worth it. Compared with the cost of developing, copying and
mailing photos, posting to a site is a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; E-mail: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most families with home computers have discovered that
electronic mail is an inexpensive alternative to the telephone.
Kelly and Kevin Jones of West Jordan, Utah, have discovered that
it's also a great way to send quick pictures of their three small
children _ Bryson, 3, Addisen, 2, and Corbin, 7 months _ without
having to pay for film, processing and postage.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses, who use a free e-mail service called theglobe.com,
regularly send text messages to the children's great-grandmother in
Springfield, Ore., and to their maternal grandparents in Portland.
``Today I sent my in-laws a message telling them how Bryson was
putting Addisen to bed,'' says their father. When he's finished
with his own message, he places Bryson on his lap and allows the
little boy to add a few lines of keyboard gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   When the text message is complete, Jones can attach a picture to
it. For this purpose he uses a tool from Play Inc. called Snappy
Video Snapshot, a $99 video grabber that plugs into the computer's
printer port. Jones plugs the family's video camera into a jack on
the computer; then he and his wife pose with the kids in front of
the camera. When they see an image they like, ``we just click the
mouse and the frame gets saved on the computer,'' he explains. Then
he selects the ``attach file'' option in his e-mail software,
clicks on the ``send'' button, and the photo arrives on
grandmother's desktop in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones notes that e-mail is an ideal communication tool for
young, budget-conscious families like his. ``It's a quick, easy,
inexpensive way to keep up with our family,'' he says. ``And that's
really been wonderful.''

FOREVER MISS PICKLES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of the author and her potbellied pig, Presten.
Also a sidebar with address of L'il Orphan Hammies. 
 By LISA TRYTKO 
 c.1998 WE magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Lisa Trytko, and I am 18 years old and live in Mount
Morris, Mich. I was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Not long
after potbellied pigs were introduced into the United States, I
knew that this was the pet for me. My father, however, was not so
easily convinced, and as time passed I gave up all hope of ever
receiving my wish.
</P>
<P>
   Then while I was away at summer camp, I received a letter from
my mother that said she was caring for the cutest baby girl. I
thought it strange my mother would take up baby-sitting. As I read
further, she elaborated: She was, in fact, caring for a 6-month-old
potbellied piglet. Best of all, she said it was my piglet. I was
overjoyed!
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after I arrived home, I had the privilege of the
very first visit with Miss Pickles, named by my mother, who had
noticed that her body formed the shape of a marinated cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Pickles grew fond of me and I of her, and we became the
best of friends. One of her favorite pastimes, naturally, was
eating, during which her unique personality came into play. When
she got her dinner, she made such a careful effort not to make a
mess, and she especially loved when I dropped spare watermelons and
cucumbers into her pen.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, her all-time favorite treat was mine as well. I
visited the pen of Miss Pickles as often as I could, bringing along
an enormous bag of marshmallows. As I offered them to her, she
would take them tenderly from my hands. Then, she gently licked off
the little sticky bits remaining on my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   She also had one odd trait: She despised getting her trotters
muddy. Whenever she did, her face twisted into an expression of
disgust. Then she carefully picked up a foot as she attempted to
clean it. Every time my mother cleaned her pen, she ran around it
oinking, as if to say, ``You missed this spot. And that one!''
</P>
<P>
   At about this time, I was in junior high school and my grades
were slipping because of kids who saw nothing in me but my
disability. They would tease me relentlessly and I would become
extremely stressed, which, in turn, caused me to go into seizures.
My constant comfort throughout the seventh and eighth grades was
Miss Pickles. I would confess my crisis of the day while she and I
munched on marshmallows. As I poured my heart out, her tall swished
and she oinked, as if attempting to give me counsel.
</P>
<P>
   I thought my guiding light would be with me all my life, but
life had other things in store.
</P>
<P>
   One day my mother had the vet come out for Miss Pickles' first
health examination and shots. The vet had to sedate her in order to
complete the examination, then gave her a clean bill of health. The
forecast was cold for the night, so the vet recommended we bring
her inside until the anesthetic wore off and then return her to her
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was opening my eyes the next morning, I heard mumbling
voices, then a cry, and, slowly, my mother entered my room to tell
me Miss Pickles had died in the night. As I heard those words, the
walls of security and happiness that had surrounded me shattered.
Grief entered my world.
</P>
<P>
   Mom had bookmarked a website where owners of potbellied pigs
from around the world share stories about their pets. She posted my
story, and then e-mails of condolence poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the generous offers of new pigs was one from Sue
Parkinson of L'il Orphan Hammies, a nonprofit, potbellied pig
sanctuary in Solvang, Calif., where her lifework is caring for
abandoned and disabled potbellied pigs. She said her own beloved
PJ, short for Pete junior, had died recently, and I could have not
one but two piglets!
</P>
<P>
   Once again, after many months of being pigless, I arrived home
from camp, this time to two special bundles, Presten and Westen.
Presten, on hearing the word ``circle'' as he's handed a treat, is
a downright showoff, spinning in circles like a tornado. Westen is
endearing but shy. The Boys, as we call them, recently learned to
swim in a kiddy pool in their pen.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for Presten and Westen brings me joy now and enables most
of the void within my heart to be filled. Part of it will never be,
and it is there that my cherished memories of Miss Pickles will
always rest in peace.

TIMELESS ADVICE ON AGING
</HEADLINE>
  With Internet address of Cicero website) 
 By HERBERT STEIN 
 c.1998 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old age is the new rage. That was apparent even before John
Glenn, aged 77, went up into space. There are more old people than
ever. Many of them have word processors. Many of those pass their
free time writing. And, following the advice of all teachers of
writing, they write about what they know, which is old age. So
there is a lot of writing on that subject. Even Jimmy Carter has
written a book about old age.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to keep up with this trend, I have just reread the
classic on the subject, Marcus Tullius Cicero's ``De Senectute.''
The last time I read it was 68 years ago. I read it then in Latin.
Today I read it in the wonderful Loeb Classic Library edition, with
the Latin on the left page and the English on the right. I read the
right page.
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly believe that I read it in Latin when I was a junior
in high school. And I can't imagine what I learned about old age,
reading it in my teens. We didn't read ``De Senectute'' to learn
about old age. My Latin teacher believed that reading Latin _ any
Latin _ made tiny grooves in your brain that increased your general
intelligence _ not just your capacity to read Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero wrote the essay in 44 B.C., when he was 62 years old. One
might think that was pretty old for a Roman of that time, but
Cicero evidently didn't think it was old enough to qualify him to
discourse on the subject. He wrote in the voice of Cato the Elder
in the year 150 B.C., when Cato was 84 years old. In fact, Cicero
did not live to experience much old age. The year after writing the
essay he was executed for being on the wrong side of a political
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The essay consists of a long answer by Cato to questions posed
by two younger men, one 35 and one 36. They ask him ``on what
principles we may most easily support the weight of increasing
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato breaks down the question. He identifies four reasons why
old age appears to be an unhappy time: First, it withdraws us from
active pursuits. Second, it makes the body weaker. Third, it
deprives us of all physical pleasures. And fourth, it is not far
removed from death.
</P>
<P>
   He then discusses these four concerns. Translating the answers
into the English of 1998, they almost all consist of saying that
the quality of one's old age depends on the investments one made in
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   I don't refer, and Cicero didn't either, to financial
investments that assure one a comfortable income in old age.
(Cicero came from a wealthy family.) I am sure that financial
investments are important, and I don't suppose Cicero would have
denied that. But there are other kinds of investments implicit in
Cicero's discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is investment in one's health and bodily
strength. I don't think the Romans of Cicero's time had a cigarette
problem. But it seems clear from the examples he gives that having
a satisfactory old age depends on adequacy of physical exercise and
moderation of eating and drinking in the years before.
</P>
<P>
   Another investment important for old age is friendships. Cicero
has Cato say, ``I have always had my club companions.'' Cato takes
pride in having been instrumental, when he was 30 years old, in
establishing certain clubs in Rome, ``and therefore I used to dine
with these companions _ in an altogether moderate way, yet with a
certain ardor appropriate to my age, which, as time goes on, daily
mitigates my zest for every pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Stoic, Cicero-Cato does not regret but rather welcomes
the decline of appetite for what he calls ``sensual'' pleasure. He
praises the value of the intellectual and aesthetic pleasures in
which an old man can still indulge. But to fully appreciate art,
science and nature in old age requires some prior investment in
cultivating them.
</P>
<P>
   An even older source reminds me of an investment for old age at
which Cicero only hints. Genesis 24:1 says, ``And Abraham was old,
well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all
things.'' According to my rabbi (I don't want to pretend to be a
student of such things), later commentators said that meant that
Abraham was blessed with the recognition that he had passed the
trials of his life with valor and devotion and could now enjoy a
peaceful retirement, content in his own eyes and in the eyes of
God.
</P>
<P>
   He had, in today's parlance, paid his dues. That is another
investment one can make for old age: so to conduct oneself in prior
years that one can feel one has paid one's dues.
</P>
<P>
   On the final question of how to invest to prepare for the
proximity of death in old age, Cicero is not very helpful. (Who
is?) He offers his ``philosophical'' view. Death brings at least an
end to those troublesome appetites and may open the way to
something better _ he doesn't say what.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one could indoctrinate oneself in that attitude in youth
and so prepare for old age. But obviously Cicero did not find that
philosophy sufficient. As the introduction to the Loeb edition
says, ``In February 45 (a year before he wrote ``De Senectute'')
the death of his adored and only daughter drove him into a frenzy
of writing in an effort to forget his grief.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not accept the fact of his daughter Tullia's death with
the thought that she had at least escaped all appetites. His
philosophy might have prepared him for his own death; it did not
prepare him for the death of one he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Later he wrote an essay titled ``Consolatio,'' which probably
dealt with this subject and which I have not read. If he was
rescued from his grief, it was apparently time and work, not
philosophy, that rescued him.

AMERICAN AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By NORMA BLAIR 
 c.1998 Ann Normansell 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the problems with moving to a foreign country is learning
the language. After nearly 30 years in the U.S. I still find myself
using expressions that produce blank stares from my listeners.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example of this came when I pronounced myself
``a little peckish,'' and saw the familiar glazed expression
appear. When I appealed to a bystander he was able to provide a
translation, but the experience brought home to me the fact that
the English and the Americans are more divided than united by their
common language.
</P>
<P>
   In self-defense one has to adopt certain terms for use in
everyday life. Thus I wash my windshield, not my windscreen, and
stash stuff in the trunk rather than the boot. I also check my
``skedule'' rather than my ``shed-yule'' if asked to do something,
which may be the reason that I am accused of ``talking American''
when I visit England, even though I am immediately tabbed as a
foreigner over here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I have yet to understand, though, is why I am
sometimes called ``veddy British.'' Is that really how the English
``very'' is heard? Shortly after we came to Virginia, I was
chatting with the mailman (not the postman!) and happened to
mention that we were from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's where you're from, is it?'' he replied. ``I thought
you were from one of those Northern states.''
</P>
<P>
   In England I had similar problems. While in college I got a
summer job at the seaside with a family who had a 12-year-old boy
and a 6-year-old girl. Being from the north of England, I build
sand castles (short ``a'') rather than cahstles.
</P>
<P>
   One day we were discussing home towns and, when the fact of my
northern origin emerged, the 6-year-old said, ``Oh, is that why you
don't speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   My acclimatization began on the day that we arrived in
Charlottesville, when we were welcomed into a colleague's home and
our children were offered ``peanut butter and jelly.'' Since jelly
is a gelatine dessert in England, and no mention was made of
``sandwich,'' I had a very strange vision of what was being
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterwards I realized that my English might be more
archaic than the local norm. I told one of the children in that
same household not to ``tread'' on something (not a snake!) and got
the soon-to-be-familiar blank stare. Her mother, a Tennessean who
became a good friend, recommended that I use ``step'' or ``walk''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   She was the person who said ``You have to be kidding!'' when I
said ``aluminium'' instead of ``aluminum.'' Yes, there really is an
extra ``i'' in the word in England, and it is one of the few words
I have learned to pronounce differently. Others, like ``tomayto,''
``vite-amin,'' and the Greek letters ``bayta,'' ``thayta,'' etc.
have been more difficult to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise slurring ``t's'' into ``d's.'' When our daughter went
to nursery school, she brought home tales of a child named
``Doddy,'' which seemed an unusual name for a girl. I knew it as
the nickname of the English comedian Ken Dodd, he of the buck teeth
and electric shock hair, who was popular then. It was not until I
met ``Marty,'' pronounced ``Mardy,'' that I made the connection and
realized that I had been hearing about ``Dottie.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, I was totally confounded when I met another ``Marty''
whose name turned out to be ``Mardie.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping can also be an interesting experience. When I asked
where I might find a ``Thermos flask'' in K-Mart, I got a very odd
look until the assistant divined that I might be looking for a
``Thermos bottle.'' And I would love to have been there when a
fellow alien asked for batteries for her ``torch'' _ it wasn't even
Olympic season!
</P>
<P>
   I have learned to avoid the obvious pitfalls, like abbreviating
pussycat, but I still goof at times when talking about waking
people up in the mornings. Long before alarm clocks and telephone
wake-up calls, there was a person in the north of England who
walked the streets in the predawn hours, carrying a long pole with
which he tapped on upper storey windows. His official title was
``the Knocker-up.''

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ This rough-and-tumble democracy has drawn
millions of Taiwanese into a furious 10-day election campaign
revolving around the unspoken issue of how to avoid mainland
China's smothering embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-colored campaign flags festoon every street. Trucks blare
music and rhetoric day and night. Staccato blasts of firecrackers
signal a candidate's arrival to yet another neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Fist-fights break out. Newspapers bemoan ``vote-buying''
estimated at $50 a voter or more.
</P>
<P>
   And doctors, teachers, old folks, laborers -- people of all ages
and pursuits -- walk away from giant political rallies hoarse and
exhilarated from participating in one of the world's most exuberant
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Taiwanese will go to the polls on Saturday(Dec.
5) to decide the makeup of the 225-member national legislature, as
well as elect mayors and city council members in their two biggest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But voters also are defining a course for this demi-nation that
will have world ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Taiwan there is only one issue: Taiwan's national
identity,'' said John Hsieh, political science professor at
National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
   This issue has crystallized in the Taipei mayoral race and
expanded the contest far beyond the bounds of traffic jams and
urban renewal. Its outcome is expected to thrust either the ruling
Nationalist Party or the upstart Progressive Party into the
forefront of Taiwan's presidential election in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is sharp: Nationalists support a status quo
looking toward reunification with China if it becomes more
democratic, while the Progressive Party was founded on a call for
eventual Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between Nationalist candidate Ma Ying-jeou, 48, and
the Progressives' incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian, 47, is the race
most tracked by Beijing's communist leaders, who as recently as
last week threatened to respond with armed force to any steps
toward Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly they (in mainland China) are very much
worried about Mr. Chen's popularity in Taiwan,'' Deputy Foreign
Minister David Lee said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
``They are very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Nationalist, predicted that a failure to win re-election
would be a major setback for Mayor Chen's Progressives, who remain
a minority party on this island of 21 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome in civil war by Chinese communists, the Nationalists
fled here from the mainland in 1949, setting up a dictatorship they
contended was China's real government. The United States withdrew
recognition from Taiwan in 1979 in favor of the communist
government on the mainland, and now Taiwan exists in a nether-world
of lively ``unofficial relations'' with
</P>
<P>
   America that include Washington-approved weapons sales.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost four decades for the Nationalists to finally
relax their grip on Taiwanese politics, giving some voice to more
than two-thirds of the population made up of Malay -descended
Taiwanese natives and other islanders whose families lived here
more than four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Voters with deep Taiwanese roots such as Chen Di-chou, a wiry
61-year-old, charge the Nationalists are still ``mainlanders'' at
heart. He stood cheering for hours at a Progressive Party rally
last weekend that drew an estimated 100,000 raucous supporters to a
muddy soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election in Taipei, but the ideology is national,''
said the retired accountant. Over blasts of music and shouts, he
said he is sure the Nationalist candidate Ma ``won't care about
Taiwan'' but will do the bidding of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Fears run as strong on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have war between the two nations across the
strait, said Chao Ching Lo, 35, a cabbie who had plastered
pro-Nationalist flags and stickers on his yellow taxi. ``If
mainland China ever gives up its communist leaders, then we can
reunite.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wants to yield the prosperity and democracy setting
this West Virginia-sized island apart from the mainland that looms
only 100 miles away. Yet each side fears the other may lose both.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be an important indication of whether a
true opposition party has emerged in Taiwan,'' said longtime
China-watcher Steven Goldstein, professor of government at Smith
College. ``You can't have a solid democratic system unless you have
an opposition party with enough strength to 'throw the rascals out'
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A fickle turn of democracy has left Taiwan's Nationalists
fearful of losing power. The heirs of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
are even accused of being tools of the mainland communists he so
bitterly resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The iron-fisted Chiang, father of the Nationalists and as
autocratic as his mainland communist foe Mao Tse-tung, did not
countenance democracy from the time he took over Taiwan until his
death in 1975. His son Chiang Ching-kuo eventually introduced a
more relaxed atmosphere, and under growing demands for political
rights lifted emergency rule in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy exploded, culminating in a multi-party presidential
election in 1996. The Nationalists have kept control of the
legislature and presidency, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists at times sound worried about the democracy they
unleashed. ``It is awesome. If you have this too heatedly
conducted, then there is the fear that it might lead to something
like anarchy,'' said Fredrick Chien, speaker of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every (election) time in the last 10 years I had that fear,''
Chien said. ``But when the voting day comes, people line up, the
voting percentage is very high, and after casting votes, they just
go home or go out to play.''

 &HT;    WOULD-BE COUP LEADER POISED TO WIN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN
VENEZUELA
 &HT;    With VENEZUELA-BOX-$ADV05.

   MIAMI _ His critics paint him as a cross between a terrorist and
the devil, someone who opposes trade, supports rebellion, and
hasn't been able to get a U.S. visa since he came close to toppling
his country's democratic government in 1992 with a would-be coup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet retired Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, a controversial but
charismatic populist, is the front-runner in Sunday's(Dec. 6)
much-anticipated presidential election in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``El Comandante,'' he's won widespread appeal by vowing
to shake up the state oil industry, which he says has failed to
benefit the poorest in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is a big supplier of oil so the United States is
frightened of this left-leaning candidate who brings a lot of
uncertainty to the country's future,'' said Larry Birns, head of
the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
</P>
<P>
   His allure lies in pledges to fight corruption and dissolve
congress in order to create a ``new democracy'' that would improve
the lots of rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, 44, also has hinted that he might introduce price
controls, stop payments on Venezuela's foreign debt, and use more
protectionist policies to close the country's borders to most
trade.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked uneasiness among those in the middle and upper
classes, who fear he might impose a dictatorship and roll back
free-market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chavez has some so concerned that current President
Rafael Caldera's army chief recently implied that the armed forces
might even try to block Chavez's ascent to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With so much uncertainty, the candidates have asked the
Atlanta-based Carter Center to monitor the election, which could
prove to be a turning point in the nation's 40 years of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Cox News Service, former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter said Chavez had previously indicated that he
may not accept the election results unless he wins.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after a lengthy conversation with Carter, Chavez
apparently indicated that he will accept the election results, even
if he loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is in danger, at least in the opinion of many
Venezuelans, if the election is not successful,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter will head up a 26-person delegation to monitor the
elections, a team that will include former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Venezuelan people want, almost unanimously, dramatic
change in their government, and they want peaceful change,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, made up of 14 minor
parties, won a stunning victory in legislative and gubernatorial
elections on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chavez stands a good chance of being elected president,
riding high on a tide of discontent with traditional parties over
government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show Chavez with about 50 percent of the vote
and his closest challenger, Henrique Salas, 62, with 38 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both have run independently, although the Yale-educated Salas is
believed to be more mainstream and is more favored by the business
community.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Venezuela's largest political party, Democratic
Action, decided to dump its candidate and support Salas in a final,
last-ditch move to keep Chavez from winning.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's other main party, the Social Christian COPEI,
followed suit on Wednesday, dropping its candidate, former Miss
Universe Irene Saez, to back Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Saez, even though her popularity has plummeted in recent months,
plans to remain as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuelans have been going through bad economic times and are
demanding political change,'' said Jennifer McCoy, director of the
Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. ``The rise of
all these independent candidates is the manifestation of the
political change.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chavez helped plot an attempted coup against former
President Carlos Andres Perez, claiming he was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was impeached and removed from office a year later after
being found guilty of misusing public money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Caldera pardoned Chavez, who has has spent the last
four years building grassroots support among the more than 70
percent of the country's population that are considered poor.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not been so forgiving. It still deems
Chavez ``ineligible'' for a U.S. visa because of his role in the
failed coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   With 23 million people and the largest oil reserves outside the
Middle East, Venezuela is the main supplier of oil to the U.S.
market and is Latin America's fourth-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, many Venezuelans have accused the government of
frittering away their oil-rich country's vast wealth, hence the
dissatisfaction with traditional parties has grown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, more than half the country's
wealth goes to the richest 20 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire is an economy that's been hammered this
year by soaring inflation, a jumpy stock market, a sharply
overvalued currency, and oil prices that are at their lowest point
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, especially those in the oil industry, are becoming
increasingly unnerved by the possibility of a Chavez win and some
have already fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst scenario is that anyone who has any resources will
get out of the country, turning Venezuela into a gigantic ghetto,''
said Jerry Haar, a Latin American expert at the University of
Miami's North-South Center. ``The business community and Chavez are
going to have to find a way to work together even if that community
doesn't support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also has pledged to dismiss the president of the state
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., Luis Giusti, a
highly-regarded oil executive who helped open the nationalized oil
sector up to outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., and
Atlantic Richfield Co. recently returned to Venezuela for the first
time in decades under Venezuela's plan to double oil production
within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chavez has backed away from some of his earlier,
more-controversial threats including one to take dictatorial
powers.
</P>
<P>
   He's even lobbied the U.S. government for official recognition
and has, recently, pledged to improve ties with Washington if
elected despite being denied a U.S. visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is certainly considered to be a radical, but he will
make concessions,'' Birns said. ``Everybody has to when they are
confronted by the realities of being a leader.''

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

   They came into the emergency room within days of each other.
Each patient was young, well dressed and employed. The first was a
44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving that morning, his
right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't speak.
Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 9-1-1. Three days later, a stocky
40-year-old woman, outfitted in the latest take-no-prisoners Wall
Street fashion, came howling into the emergency room. ``My chest,''
she screamed. Their malady? Cocaine addiction. ``In 1996, we
`imported' 240 tons of the stuff,'' reports Tony Dajer, who treated
the aforementioned patients. Dajer, formerly associate director of
the emergency room at New York Downtown Hospital, now lives in

   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail. The long list of ancestral
traits that were lost or reduced in the course of human evolution
includes tails, body hair and the bony browridges over our eyes.
Snakes lost their legs, and whales lost most of their sense of
smell. Why would any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won
victories? What evolutionary force drove their loss? Jared Diamond,
a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences, reports.

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

   They came into the emergency room within days of each other.
Each patient was young, well dressed and employed. The first was a
44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving that morning, his
right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't speak.
Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 9-1-1. Three days later, a stocky
40-year-old woman, outfitted in the latest take-no-prisoners Wall
Street fashion, came howling into the emergency room. ``My chest,''
she screamed. Their malady? Cocaine addiction. ``In 1996, we
`imported' 240 tons of the stuff,'' reports Tony Dajer, who treated
the aforementioned patients. Dajer, formerly associate director of
the emergency room at New York Downtown Hospital, now lives in
Paris.

   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail. The long list of ancestral
traits that were lost or reduced in the course of human evolution
includes tails, body hair and the bony browridges over our eyes.
Snakes lost their legs, and whales lost most of their sense of
smell. Why would any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won
victories? What evolutionary force drove their loss? Jared Diamond,
a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences, reports.

   Once upon a time, U.S. government officials worried about
counterfeiters manufacturing money with photocopiers. Now desktop
digital printing has appeared on the counterfeiting horizon. At
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. In 1995 there weren't many $9,000
Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color ink-jet
printers can be bought for under $100. Welcome to the Digital Age!
Will Hively, a contributing editor of Discover magazine, reports on
how counterfeiting has gotten easier _ and cheaper.

   They came into the emergency room within days of each other.
Each patient was young, well dressed and employed. The first was a
44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving that morning, his
right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't speak.
Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 9-1-1. Three days later, a stocky
40-year-old woman, outfitted in the latest take-no-prisoners Wall
Street fashion, came howling into the emergency room. ``My chest,''
she screamed. Their malady? Cocaine addiction. ``In 1996, we
`imported' 240 tons of the stuff,'' reports Tony Dajer, who treated
the aforementioned patients. Dajer, formerly associate director of
the emergency room at New York Downtown Hospital, now lives in
Paris.

   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail. The long list of ancestral
traits that were lost or reduced in the course of human evolution
includes tails, body hair and the bony browridges over our eyes.
Snakes lost their legs, and whales lost most of their sense of
smell. Why would any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won
victories? What evolutionary force drove their loss? Jared Diamond,
a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences, reports.

   They came in within days of each other. Each patient was young,
well dressed and employed. The malady they shared was simple, in a
sense, but not straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving
that morning, his right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't
speak. Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods, can you understand me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Yuh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeeze my hands.'' His right hand gripped my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I said. ``Does it feel stronger than it did a
little while ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he strained to speak. ``Yuh.'' Then he shook his head,
sad and disgusted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods,'' I continued, ``I need to ask you some questions.
Have you ever used cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for a 44-year-old to have a stroke, but with no
history of hypertension or smoking, it's decidedly unusual. Unless
cocaine is involved. Mr. Woods's head trembled a bit, then he
looked me in the eye. ``Uh, hm,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time?'' I asked. ``Th-this m-morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wife walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning?'' she cried. ``John ... you said you were
clean!''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to me. ``He did the program and said he was clean.
For six months.'' She spun back to face him. ``Oh, God, you
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woods felt duped, but she is by no means alone. Doctors,
especially we emergency room doctors, pride ourselves on squeezing
the truth out of rocks. But I work in New York City; it's boom time
here, and drugs chase money.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine was such an emblem of the go-go '80s that in 1985 the
United States reported 5.7 million users. In the dozen years since,
that number has dropped by more than two-thirds, but ominous signs
of a comeback are in the wind. In 1996 we ``imported'' 240 tons of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room cares for half a dozen young professionals a
day who rush in with all the symptoms of a panic attack. But
cocaine can trigger an identical sense of choking doom. We always
ask, and they always deny. And then I meet a Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, it looked as if his stroke would be transient,
as happens when the body's own system dissolves the clot in a brain
artery before permanent damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a stocky 40-year-old woman, outfitted in the
latest take-no-prisoners Wall Street fashion, came howling into the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The medics filled us in on what had happened. ``She's at her
office. Suddenly clutches her chest and keels over. She has no
heart problems, and as far as they know, doesn't smoke, drink, or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sims was out of control. It took six ER staff members to
undress her, start an iv and run an electrocardiogram, a recording
of the heart's electrical activity. A heart attack in a woman her
age _ with no other risk factors _ would be very unusual. Her ECG
wasn't giving us a clear answer, and there are many conditions that
can cause severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   My partner that day, Susan Woo, parked herself at the bedside
and shouted above the din, ``Ms. Sims, do you use cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' her patient shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important. You may be having a heart attack. To
treat you properly, we must know anything that might put you at
risk. Have you used cocaine recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I told you. No! Oh, God, the pain. Make it stop. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan ordered high doses of nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm treating her as if it's real,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``Beats me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should a healthy, young, nonsmoking woman have a heart
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, as everyone knows, is a stimulant. It achieves its
euphoric effects by prolonging chemical interactions in the tiny
gaps between nerves, or neurons, in the brain. The drug is
especially seductive because it heightens the response of the same
neurons that allow us to experience sensual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But while cocaine is best known for its mental effects, the
blood vessels take the hardest beating. Fill your system with
cocaine and you might as well drip acid in your arteries. Susan
found me a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ms. Sims?'' she smiled ruefully. ``She ruled in for a
heart attack. It was real. And her drug screen was positive for _
guess what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Megan. Blond, plump and 22, she looked like a
rosy-cheeked poster girl for the Dutch Dairy Farmers' Guild. She
sat on a chair, eyes darting about and chest heaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan Sutherland?'' I asked, reading off the chart. ``What's
the matter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I-can't-breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chest pain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's squeezing, like a tight _ Oh, Jesus, I can't breathe _
band around my ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick exam, my concern grew. She was on the pill and had
recently had an abortion _ two predisposing factors for a pulmonary
embolus, a blood clot to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're sure,'' I repeated for the fifth time, ``no
drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana. Over a year ago. Am I going to be OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I soothed. ``But I need to take blood from your
wrist artery and see how well your lungs are getting air.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan's blood gas, the measure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in
arterial blood, was borderline normal, as was her chest X-ray.
Still, not all pulmonary emboli show up on these tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen.'' All kidding and sympathy drained from my voice.
``I'm about to send you for some very expensive, invasive, and
possibly dangerous tests. Please tell me if you use cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan eyed the distance between us. ``A couple of lines. This
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' I pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couple more after I got to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then your heart started racing? And your chest got
tight?''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your symptoms are due to the cocaine,'' I said. ``They'll wear
off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about my insurance? I just started this job. What if
they find out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is confidential. But you've got to promise me
one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she sighed, expecting the usual ``just say no''
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever, ever lie to a doctor again.''

   ``On or about April 6, 1995, the defendant James Taftsiou
purchased a Tektronix Model Phaser 540,'' says the District of New
Jersey federal grand jury indictment. This top-quality laser
printer cost him $9,000. Taftsiou also paid $6,000 for a computer
and $600 for a paper cutter. In October he bought a second paper
cutter because, he said, he'd worn out the blade on the first one.
By then he was a self-made millionaire. He was also being watched
by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   The chase began on Memorial Day weekend, when a prostitute
walked into the Atlantic City police station complaining that a man
at a local Quality Inn had paid her with phony $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Secret Service agents raided the hotel and arrested
seven limousine-riding high rollers who had arrived from New York
City. They also confiscated more than $20,000 in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Agents traced the source to Bardul Taftsiou, James' father, who
lived in Brooklyn. They began watching his house in October. On
November 18, agents followed five family members to Atlantic City.
Inside the Tropworld Casino, the Taftsious inserted fake $50 bills
into slot machines, played a few times, cashed out, and exchanged
the tokens for genuine money. Agents let the family play for more
than an hour, then arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Taftsious printed and passed an estimated $1.2
million in counterfeit bills. Their case was the largest in
Atlantic City's history to date. It also raised eyebrows over the
method used to manufacture such quantities of money. Desktop
digital printing had already shown up on the counterfeiting
horizon, but it was not yet the medium of choice for large
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, officials worried mainly about photocopiers.
Tom Ferguson, acting director for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the agency that makes U.S. currency, remembers how
``everybody in this business, in the late '70s and '80s, was seeing
huge color-copying machines. Currency people were saying, `Uh-oh,
how can we defeat them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Copiers became smaller and more widely available. And sure
enough, in 1993 the National Academy of Sciences put out a
disturbing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total value of counterfeits produced by color copiers and
printers ... has been doubling every year,'' it said. In 1990
counterfeiters produced $1 million in fake banknotes on ``office
machines''-copiers, laser printers, and ink-jet systems. ``In 1991
this doubled to $2 million, and in 1992 the amount increased to
between $6 million and $8 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of growth marks the early stages of disease
epidemics. Projecting it into the future, the report concluded that
office-machine counterfeits might cause ``severe problems for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off this threat, the Treasury Department approved the
first noticeable changes to U.S. currency in 70 years. In this
``next-generation'' design, new features that are difficult to
reproduce, such as bigger portraits and watermarks in the paper,
will appear on all large notes. The redesigned $100 bill came out
in 1996 and the $50 in 1997, but consumers don't see many of those.
The greatest shock to eyes numbed by the familiar greenback is just
arriving now, with the new $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the new look, wait a few years. Currency
experts are already thinking about the next next-generation design,
which Ferguson expects will be needed in seven to ten years.
``There's now a need for rapid change,'' he says. If you were just
starting a career in currency manufacture, ``you couldn't pick a
more exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason his business has become so lively is that more and
more ordinary citizens now have an opportunity to share the thrill
of printing money. So far this year, according to the Secret
Service, the amount of counterfeit currency successfully passed
into domestic circulation has jumped 25 percent over last year's
rate. If the trend continues, $40 million in bogus bills will be
culled from the money supply, versus $32 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fake note that anyone reports, anywhere in the
world, eventually makes its way to the Secret Service-charged since
its formation in 1865 with protecting the integrity of U.S.
currency. At Secret Service headquarters, a block from the White
House, Dennis Lynch, special agent in charge of the Counterfeit
Division, coolly interprets the 25 percent jump in counterfeits
being passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting has not been, and is not now, a significant
economic problem,'' Lynch insists. Look at it this way: the 32
million counterfeit dollars pulled out of circulation last year, if
printed in twenties, would be 1.6 million notes, or an average of
4,400 per day. Meanwhile, during an average day the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing churns out 38 million legal-tender Federal
Reserve notes. Stacked straight up, they would stand 2.6 miles
high. Counterfeiters chimed in with 19 more inches. That's
practically nothing. This year they've raised their daily share a
few more inches-a mere blip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looked at more closely, the recent rise in counterfeiting
seems ominous. That's because it represents not more of the same
but a new technology coming into play. While other office-machine
methods hold fairly steady, the rate of ink-jet counterfeiting
skyrockets. Of counterfeit notes that entered domestic circulation,
the ink-jet proportion rose from 0.5 percent in 1995 to 3 percent
in 1996 to 19 percent in 1997, and so far this year it's running 44
percent. From that perspective, the blip looks explosive.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an ink-jet printer and you can't believe it's capable
of imitating the currency you have in your wallet, your printer is
outdated. For a few hundred dollars these days, you can buy a good
color ink-jet printer that does ``nice work,'' as Ferguson admits.
``Not perfect by any means, but certainly deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   For most purposes, ``deceptive'' is good enough. Lynch guesses
that 98 percent of all phony bills that get passed fail to
reproduce key security features-no watermark, no security thread,
no color-shifting ink in the lower right corner. Usually the
counterfeiters don't even try. And such uncraftsmanlike
nonchalance, he says, highlights the most important reason these
bills get passed: ``The American public is not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts a heavy burden on police to take up the slack. In the
good old days Secret Service agents could handle the challenge,
because counterfeiters belonged to an identifiable breed. They
spent many hours making plates, ran off huge numbers of fake
hundreds, fifties, or twenties to cover their considerable time and
expense, and then had to pass all those bills without raising
suspicions. Inevitably they left a trail-purchasing or gaining
inside access to specialized equipment; recruiting others to help
pass the bills; or selling trunkloads of bogus cash at a discount
to criminals. The Secret Service could catch those guys with
standard gumshoe work.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, desktop counterfeiters don't need a bill-passing
network. Instead they print cash as needed. And they certainly
don't need specialized equipment. As Lynch knows all too well, at
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. ``The nightmare,'' he says, ``is
when the system changes from 500 counterfeit printers passing
$100,000 each to 100,000 passing $500 each. We can't be everywhere.
We can't be in everybody's basement and den.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is happening now. In 1995 there weren't many
$9,000 Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color
ink-jet printers can be bought for under $100. What's more, there
are stand-alone scanners that don't need a computer; they plug
right into an ink-jet or laser printer. Hook them together, and you
have a color copier-all for as little as $200, compared with
$40,000 in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the digital revolution, why shouldn't
policing go digital, too? Indeed, several manufacturers of color
copiers have installed chips that recognize the world's major
currency notes and block attempts to copy them. Unfortunately, such
a chip might raise costs. Another suggestion is to modify printers
to add a unique, covert mark to every piece of paper, allowing
counterfeits to be traced to particular machines. The Secret
Service is looking into all these possibilities and more. ``The
technical issue,'' Lynch says, ``is really the linchpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is also eyeing new
technical fixes. Many promising countermeasures have already been
adopted in other countries. Australia, for example, is spearheading
a push to plastic money. Printing on plastic allows designers to
add translucent effects to foil counterfeiting. And plastic would
make a suitable base for holograms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. currency experts are following those experiments with keen
interest. ``There are advantages but also disadvantages in security
with plastics,'' Ferguson says. ``We're years away from making that
decision.'' Tests show that the bureau's huge, high-speed intaglio
presses can print money on plastic stock. But then, so can ink-jet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Over its long history, counterfeiting has
continually leapfrogged preventive measures, behaving like certain
diseases-like the flu, say. Yet all epidemics eventually run their
course. New variants spread explosively at first, but finally new
defenses kick in and the rate of infection levels off.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the idea is to deter the new breed of counterfeiters
with enough technical barriers and currency changes to restore
equilibrium. Yet the printing techniques used for both
counterfeiting and genuine currency are mutating faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson says, ``It's a very interesting period.''

 By JARED DIAMOND 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of biological evolution concern the acquisition
of useful traits. But evolution is also about losing traits.
</P>
<P>
   The long list of ancestral traits that were lost or reduced in
the course of human evolution includes tails, body hair and the
bony browridges over our eyes. Snakes lost their legs, and whales
lost most of their sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   The process is common enough to be unsurprising. But why would
any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won victories? What
evolutionary force drove their loss?
</P>
<P>
   Those turn out to be difficult questions. Darwin proposed two
alternative solutions but was unable to decide between them. One of
the explanations invokes normal wear and tear, which goes
unrepaired when a gene for a biological trait falls into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once ancestral apes were spending much of their time on the
ground, for instance, mutants with shrunken tails were at no
disadvantage, and eventually mutants whose tails were shrunk to
nothing became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The other explanation can be described as motivated wrecking for
profit. Any physiological structure occupies space in an animal's
body and costs energy to make and maintain. A mutant proto-ape that
lost its tail could have devoted the freed-up energy, protoplasm
and space to a larger brain. Hypothetically, the proto-ape got more
benefits from its newly enlarged brain than from its old lost tail.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's two competing theories would be nothing more than good
cocktail party conversation if we couldn't figure out how to test
them. To resolve this debate, we'll examine the story of a
remarkable Israeli animal that has nearly lost its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Spalax ehrenbergi resembles a muddy-colored, furry, fat sausage
about eight inches long. Once you have figured out which end is the
head (the end on which a mouth opens to show teeth that bite you),
you realize that all the rest of the head except for the mouth has
an uninterrupted covering of fur.
</P>
<P>
   But that strange appearance makes perfect sense functionally
because blind mole rats spend most of their lives in underground
tunnels, where eyes would be of even less use to them than a tail
would be to us.
</P>
<P>
   Blind mole rats are not entirely eyeless. Eyes the size of
pinheads lie concealed beneath the fur and skin of their heads.
Each eye is embedded in a thick gland; its lens is shriveled; and
it has no pupil, nor eye muscles to move or focus it. Not
surprisingly, if you flash a light at Spalax, it exhibits no
reaction whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spalax's eyes have not evolved completely out of
existence. What, if anything, is that tiny eye doing?
</P>
<P>
   Spalax exhibits photoperiodic responses _ daily and seasonal
cycles of sleep, activity, reproduction and other physiological
functions. Those responses disappear in Spalax from which the tiny
eyes have been surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently Spalax's eyes are still being used to recognize the
difference between light and dark whenever Spalax sticks its head
out of its tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   How has such drastic yet precise reduction of Spalax's eyes been
accomplished? The answer came from Israeli evolutionary biologist
Eviatar Nevo's collaborations with French scientists Howard Cooper
and Marc Herbin, who studied the microanatomy of Spalax's eyes and
brain, and his work with German scientists Reinhold Necker and Gerd
Rehkdmper, who studied brain electrophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of Spalax evolution, the original eye inherited
from sighted rodent ancestors was reconfigured very selectively.
The eye and brain structures that sighted animals use for forming
images are smaller by 90 percent to 99 percent in Spalax compared
with those of sighted rodents of the same body size.
</P>
<P>
   But the brain structure involved in controlling the
photoperiodic response is as large in Spalax as in sighted rodents.
The part of the brain cortex that in humans or sighted rats would
be devoted to vision and image formation is devoted to the body's
sense of touch in Spalax and has thereby expanded to be almost
twice as large as that of a similar-size sighted rat.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, Herbin and Nevo did some calculations to understand why
natural selection led to such a selective dismantling of the Spalax
eye. They estimated that by getting rid of most of the
image-forming part of the visual system, Spalax saves over 2
percent of its whole energy budget. This is a fantastic windfall
for Spalax: energy to convert into milk for rearing pups, into
searching for food or into tunnel construction to locate a mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason that the reduction of Spalax's
visual system produced a huge advantage: Spalax has better uses for
its brain space. Consider what other senses it needs for a life
spent in a labyrinth of unlit tunnels: an exquisite sense of touch,
a good sense of hearing and a keen sense of smell. It also has a
remarkable system of magnetic compass orientation.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple sensory modalities place a big burden on
underground rodents. Getting rid of the visual cortex and turning
its space over to the sense of touch is one way Spalax copes with
the problem of how to navigate blind without its brain becoming
even larger.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when spalax entered a dark world, its visual system
didn't just rust away. Natural selection favored mutants that
jettisoned the visual system piece by piece, depending on how
useful each part was.
</P>
<P>
   This message extracted from mole rats may resolve Darwin's
puzzle about how natural selection destroys as well as creates.
Let's take just one specific example: Why did our ancestors lose
their tails?
</P>
<P>
   The way to think of your hypothetical tails is as a
lost-opportunity cost. Ask yourself about the sacrifices that you
would have to make elsewhere in your body to free up protoplasm for
a tail. Fewer pounds of brain? Then you would revert to being a big
speechless monkey. Fewer pounds of muscle? Then you would be a
wimp, easy prey for lions. Fewer pounds of kidney? Then how do you
propose to make enough urine? No, tails are fortunately gone
forever, as far as we humans are concerned. Our ancestors didn't
use them, they did lose them, and we profited.

<P>
   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of biological evolution concern the acquisition
of useful traits. But evolution is also about losing traits.
</P>
<P>
   The long list of ancestral traits that were lost or reduced in
the course of human evolution includes tails, body hair and the
bony browridges over our eyes. Snakes lost their legs, and whales
lost most of their sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   The process is common enough to be unsurprising. But why would
any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won victories? What
evolutionary force drove their loss?
</P>
<P>
   Those turn out to be difficult questions. Darwin proposed two
alternative solutions but was unable to decide between them. One of
the explanations invokes normal wear and tear, which goes
unrepaired when a gene for a biological trait falls into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once ancestral apes were spending much of their time on the
ground, for instance, mutants with shrunken tails were at no
disadvantage, and eventually mutants whose tails were shrunk to
nothing became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The other explanation can be described as motivated wrecking for
profit. Any physiological structure occupies space in an animal's
body and costs energy to make and maintain. A mutant proto-ape that
lost its tail could have devoted the freed-up energy, protoplasm
and space to a larger brain. Hypothetically, the proto-ape got more
benefits from its newly enlarged brain than from its old lost tail.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's two competing theories would be nothing more than good
cocktail party conversation if we couldn't figure out how to test
them. To resolve this debate, we'll examine the story of a
remarkable Israeli animal that has nearly lost its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Spalax ehrenbergi resembles a muddy-colored, furry, fat sausage
about eight inches long. Once you have figured out which end is the
head (the end on which a mouth opens to show teeth that bite you),
you realize that all the rest of the head except for the mouth has
an uninterrupted covering of fur.
</P>
<P>
   But that strange appearance makes perfect sense functionally
because blind mole rats spend most of their lives in underground
tunnels, where eyes would be of even less use to them than a tail
would be to us.
</P>
<P>
   Blind mole rats are not entirely eyeless. Eyes the size of
pinheads lie concealed beneath the fur and skin of their heads.
Each eye is embedded in a thick gland; its lens is shriveled; and
it has no pupil, nor eye muscles to move or focus it. Not
surprisingly, if you flash a light at Spalax, it exhibits no
reaction whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spalax's eyes have not evolved completely out of
existence. What, if anything, is that tiny eye doing?
</P>
<P>
   Spalax exhibits photoperiodic responses _ daily and seasonal
cycles of sleep, activity, reproduction and other physiological
functions. Those responses disappear in Spalax from which the tiny
eyes have been surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently Spalax's eyes are still being used to recognize the
difference between light and dark whenever Spalax sticks its head
out of its tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   How has such drastic yet precise reduction of Spalax's eyes been
accomplished? The answer came from Israeli evolutionary biologist
Eviatar Nevo's collaborations with French scientists Howard Cooper
and Marc Herbin, who studied the microanatomy of Spalax's eyes and
brain, and his work with German scientists Reinhold Necker and Gerd
Rehkdmper, who studied brain electrophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of Spalax evolution, the original eye inherited
from sighted rodent ancestors was reconfigured very selectively.
The eye and brain structures that sighted animals use for forming
images are smaller by 90 percent to 99 percent in Spalax compared
with those of sighted rodents of the same body size.
</P>
<P>
   But the brain structure involved in controlling the
photoperiodic response is as large in Spalax as in sighted rodents.
The part of the brain cortex that in humans or sighted rats would
be devoted to vision and image formation is devoted to the body's
sense of touch in Spalax and has thereby expanded to be almost
twice as large as that of a similar-size sighted rat.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, Herbin and Nevo did some calculations to understand why
natural selection led to such a selective dismantling of the Spalax
eye. They estimated that by getting rid of most of the
image-forming part of the visual system, Spalax saves over 2
percent of its whole energy budget. This is a fantastic windfall
for Spalax: energy to convert into milk for rearing pups, into
searching for food or into tunnel construction to locate a mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason that the reduction of Spalax's

its brain space. Consider what other senses it needs for a life
spent in a labyrinth of unlit tunnels: an exquisite sense of touch,
a good sense of hearing and a keen sense of smell. It also has a

   These multiple sensory modalities place a big burden on
underground rodents. Getting rid of the visual cortex and turning
its space over to the sense of touch is one way Spalax copes with
the problem of how to navigate blind without its brain becoming

   The volunteers in Mark Prausnitz's experiment probably didn't
believe him when he told them they wouldn't feel a thing. After
all, he was proposing to jab 400 tiny needles into their skin. But
indeed the subjects reported feeling no pain, even though they
weren't anesthetized.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz, a chemical engineer, and Mark Allen, an electrical
engineer, both from the Georgia Institute of Technology, have
developed what they believe is a replacement, at least for some
uses, for conventional hypodermic needles: a small patch covered
with hundreds of microscopic needles that penetrate the skin
without causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   The skin's outer layer _ the stratum corneum _ is an excellent
barrier to the outside world, hence the need to poke a large needle
through it to get to the bloodstream. But Prausnitz and Allen
figured that very small needles could deliver vaccines and
medication to the tissue just below the stratum corneum. The
medications would then diffuse from the tissue into capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outer skin doesn't contain any nerve endings _ the
first extensive nerve layer is below the outermost capillaries _
the small needles wouldn't cause any pain.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz and Allen made their microneedles out of silicon, with
the same etching process used to manufacture computer chips. Their
400-needle array is a tenth of an inch on a side, and each needle
is just six-thousandths of an inch long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel something, as if you were wearing a Band-Aid,''
Prausnitz says. ``So you're aware that it's there, but it's not at
all bothersome or painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The holes left by the microneedles are much smaller than the
punctures left by conventional needles, thus lowering the risk of
infection. And since the patch is so easy to use, it could be a
boon for people, like diabetics, who have to give themselves
frequent injections.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz thinks it wouldn't be too hard to add a microprocessor
and a pump, making a watch-size device that could release drugs
over time or even monitor blood levels of various medications and
automatically keep them stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might actually make it a watch,'' Prausnitz says. ``It
would keep track of time and keep track of the amounts that were
delivered at different times.''

   The San hunter-gatherers of southern Africa establish social
networks by exchanging gifts, often glass or ostrich-eggshell
beads, strung into a necklace or sewn onto a bag or hat.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts help secure future favors, says anthropologist Stanley
Ambrose of the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. As one
San man told a researcher to whom he gave a gift, ``It's free! It's
yours! And don't you forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, such gift giving may have been established
more than 40,000 years ago. He has found ostrich-eggshell beads of
that age in Kenya, which rank among the world's oldest ornaments
and may have given early humans in Africa an edge over their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose has been working at a rock shelter called Enkapune Ya
Muto, or Twilight Cave, in Kenya's Rift Valley. There, among
thousands of stone tools, he discovered the remains of an
ostrich-eggshell bead workshop.
</P>
<P>
   He found nearly 600 shell fragments, as well as 13 complete
beads. The finished beads have a hole drilled in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, early Africans may have used beads the way
the San do now, as a social survival mechanism in a difficult
environment. Though the climate in East Africa was generally cooler
and drier 40,000 years ago than it is now, the period was also
marked by dramatic fluctuations in climate. Social ties,
established by gift giving, would have helped people in tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a drought and you have to move, the place you're
most likely not to get turned away from is the place where you have
stored obligations and relationships,'' Ambrose says. ``It's the
original social security system.''
</P>
<P>
   Support from neighbors would have helped early humans survive
while others failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave the African people an advantage over Neanderthals, who
may not have had a symbolic mechanism for social solidarity,''
Ambrose says. ``The bottom line is, in competition between species
in an unpredictable environment, the gift is mightier than the
spear.''

   While some physicists strive to understand the subatomic
building blocks of matter, Elisha Moses occasionally pursues less
grandiose mysteries. A student recently asked Moses, who teaches at
the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, the following question:
What makes a sheet of paper flutter back and forth as it falls,
while a business card tumbles end over end?
</P>
<P>
   To tackle the problem, Moses and Andrew Belmonte of Penn State
built a quarter-inch-wide aquarium and dropped thin strips of
plastic of various weights and lengths into the water to see how
they fell. The unusual thinness of the tank reduced the falling to
essentially two dimensions, making the subtle motions of the
tumbling plastic strips much easier to study.
</P>
<P>
   Using small aluminum particles in the water to illuminate the
water currents, Moses and Belmonte were able to observe tiny
vortices that curled around the edges of the strips as they fell.
These vortices provide lift to the falling sheets, much the way air
passing over an airplane wing creates lift.
</P>
<P>
   The vortices do this by slightly decreasing the water pressure
above the sheet. The higher pressure below supports the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is small, but it's enough to lightly support a broad,
flat sheet of paper or a large dried leaf. As one side of the sheet
rises above the other, a vortex begins to form at the rising edge.
This vortex soon breaks away; another vortex then forms on the
opposite end of the sheet. This shifting of vortices may contribute
to the characteristic seesaw motion of fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   With increasingly dense or shorter strips, the rising end tips
up farther and farther. Eventually the strips begin to fall end
over end.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of sharp transition exists in all sorts of periodic
motion, even walking. There's a maximum speed a person can walk. To
go any faster, you need to start running. Walking is like
fluttering, Moses notes, and running is like tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a pendulum that swings higher and higher,'' he says.
``If you have enough momentum, it will go over the top and down the
other side.''

 &HT;    Sharing DNA evidence with other states solves cases faster, nabs
more criminals
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Server
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DNA, the genetic material scientists call the building
block of life, is rapidly becoming the stumbling block of violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Major advances in the forensic analysis of DNA have culminated
in the linking of databases in about 20 states containing thousands
of DNA samples from criminals and criminal investigations, all
under the administration of the FBI. Georgia, an early participant,
was one of the first states to get results.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Georgia section of the Combined DNA Index System, or
CODIS, went on line, investigators in four cities have been handed
incontrovertible evidence linking separate rape cases. DNA matches,
made using small amounts of blood or other body fluids from victims
or crime scenes and compared with samples from suspects, have taken
on the virtual certainty of fingerprints in court.
</P>
<P>
   More important, authorities say, as the CODIS database grows and
expands to more states, it will allow the tracking of transient
serial killers and rapists, traditionally the toughest criminals to
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Behind CODIS is an equally significant development in DNA
forensics pioneered at the GBI Crime Lab in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   George Herrin, who was the DNA Section manager at the lab and is
now a deputy director, said analysts last fall switched to a new,
much quicker and less demanding testing method, the Short Tandem
Repeat, or STR, system.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI was the first crime lab in the country to switch
entirely to STR, which has two enormous advantages over older
systems, Herrin said. A much smaller sample is required for
complete matching and analysis, and the analysis itself requires
only a few weeks instead of six to seven months. The change has
helped the GBI make a dent in backlogged cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When STR came on line in November (1997), we had about 50
cases backed up,'' Herrin said. ``That's down to about 25 now. We
can analyze about 60 cases a month now, depending on how often our
people have to go to court. We get about 65 to 70 new cases every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer database, he said, immediately identified two rapes
in Atlanta as the work of one man; tied two rapes in Macon to
another man; two in Valdosta to one offender; and two in Gwinnett
to one man.
</P>
<P>
   CODIS, even more than the GBI's massive Automated Fingerprint
Identification System, will be a major factor in bridging the lack
of information exchange between distant law enforcement agencies,
which has allowed serial killers and sex offenders to escape
detection by simply moving on. There is still no method in sight
for linking the various state AFIS systems.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgia was approved to join the national DNA network, GBI
CODIS administrator Ted Staples said, he spent three hours
uploading Georgia's roughly 2,500 sex offender samples and another
1,000 unidentified samples from crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following week, I was in an FBI software class in Virginia
when some agents came in and got me and said we had matches at the
national level, which of course was very exciting,'' Staples said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the matches concerned a suspect already convicted in
several rapes in Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The other, he said, was a match between a semen stain that
helped to convict a man in a Tatnall County break-in and rape and a
blood sample collected by Broward County, Fla., authorities at a
breaking-and-entering scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't earth-shattering,'' Staples said, ``but it's good
to know the system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the DNA analysis of every convicted sex offender in
Georgia is entered into the state's CODIS database every week, and
loaded into the national database every month or so.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI is limited now, by legislation of its own design, to
entering the profiles of sex offenders. ``When we asked for the
legislation, we figured that was all we could handle,'' Herrin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But during the next legislative session, he said, the agency
will ask for the funds and new laws to allow the entry of DNA
profiles from all assaults, which will automatically take in
homicides, and home invasion burglaries. Corrections authorities
estimate that would add another 3,500 samples a year to the crime
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's CODIS efforts are also impeded by current state law
mandating that all DNA taken from convicted offenders be in the
form of blood samples, which requires qualified personnel to take,
Herrin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is having a lot of success with getting the samples
through simple mouth swabs,'' Herrin said, a technique that
requires no special qualification. He said the GBI plans to ask to
be permitted to take DNA samples by whatever proper means
investigators think best.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE PINOCHET PINCH
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What would have happened if Augusto Pinochet had
chosen to have his back surgery done in New York instead of London?
How would President Clinton have fielded a request from the Spanish
court that wants the former Chilean dictator to face charges of
murder, torture and genocide?
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the waffling tones heard from top U.S. diplomats, the
general would have been allowed to board the next flight home to
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   When the authorities in London privately asked for American help
in making a call in the Spanish case, the State Department
announced that ``we will declassify and make public as much
information as possible,'' in line with U.S. laws and national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a ``clarification.'' The commitment, it seems, is
merely to ``review'' any papers at hand that may shed light on
abuses during Pinochet's nasty rule.
</P>
<P>
   Prior statements said Chile should ``wrestle with'' justice for
Pinochet on its own. But as a ``senator for life,'' he enjoys
immunity from prosecution _ his reward for having handed over power
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's vivid compassion for the
victims of the Nazi Holocaust apparently does not extend to
Pinochet's prey. Albright allows that ``significant respect''
should be afforded to Chile's demand that the charges be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's not at all easy to sort out the competing
interests. As Britain's Economist has noted: ``Plenty of dictators
have enjoyed comfortable retirements, no matter what bloody deeds
they committed or ordered while in power. They had little to fear
from judges or lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Adolf Hitler had been found hiding in, say, Bolivia, a
decade after World War II, the international community would
promptly have had him seized, tried and executed. But what if Henry
Kissinger were arrested by a prosecutor in, say, Bolivia, and
charged with the deaths of thousands of innocent Cambodians while
he served in the U.S. government during the Vietnam War? How many
nanoseconds would it take the Bolivians to accede to an Albright
protest?
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton and Albright believe that the Pinochet case rests
on shaky ground, they might favor the creation of a permanent
international criminal court that would deal with all such matters
under defined legal rules.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, nearly every democratic government supports the
formation of this tribunal, save the United States. Last July, at a
conclave in Rome, the administration spurned a treaty to set up the
court, aligning itself with the likes of Iraq and Cuba on a
120-to-7 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Over five weeks, however, U.S. negotiators did succeed in
greatly watering down the text they finally rejected. What they
wanted (but, of course, could not get) was a guarantee that no
American citizen would ever be charged with a war crime. They saw
North Carolina's Sen. Jesse Helms as having a fit if a U.S. soldier
were to become a prosecutorial target.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, such a thing in this world as right and
wrong, whether or not Clinton and Albright have the guts to stand
up to the likes of Helms or to the Chilean government.

 &HT;    Mail theft, `washed' checks emptying coffers of Florida
businesses
 &HT;    By Matt Mossman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Four small businesses in Delray Beach
and Boca Raton have been victimized by a mail theft and
check-washing scheme that's robbed them of $19,473.85, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in both cities are investigating 15 check alterations
reported since Oct. 12. In March, federal authorities arrested 23
people in South Florida for similar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents highlight two dangers: mail theft that could
affect anyone who sends checks from home, an office or street
mailboxes; and check washing, a literal type of money laundering
that's difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: thieves ``wash'' the stolen checks in a
timed process using household chemicals, erasing all handwriting.
Then they re-write the checks for any dollar amount. Thirteen of
the washed checks were used at an Office Max in Boca Raton,
according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Office Max spokesman Michael Weisbarth said the store's
check-cashing policy requires clerks to inspect two pieces of
identification, one with a photo; to get a phone number for the
buyer; and to make sure the signature on the check matches the name
printed in the top-left corner. Also, the bank account is checked
for fraud through a computerized system.
</P>
<P>
   The checks were stolen from mail collection boxes outside of
post offices in Boca Raton or Delray Beach, according to police
reports. Postal Investigator Rafael Rivera confirmed thefts at two
Delray Beach post offices, but said postal investigators have no
knowledge of any check-washing schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton and Delray Beach detectives said they were
investigating the cases themselves. Boca Raton Detective Barry
Zeeuw said he may ask the postal service to help.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread in all four cases is that the victims were
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   They're ideal targets because they tend to be small enough to
handwrite their checks _ rather than print them by computer _ but
busy enough to overlook a few forged checks, Delray Beach Officer
Vinny Mintus said.
</P>
<P>
   He took a report of six forgeries on a Delray Beach dentist
office's account after a bookkeeper there noticed the washed
checks. That office lost $9,140, according to a police report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for an alert bookkeeper, some of these things go by the
wayside,'' Mintus said.
</P>
<P>
   The other victims were a painting contractor, a doll accessory
shop and a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Breckenridge, a postal service spokesman in Atlanta,
recommends that all mail containing checks be dropped off inside
the post office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to be more alert about strangers in the
neighborhood messing with the mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecile Sasso, a postal service spokeswoman in West Palm Beach,
said there have been ``one or two'' mail thefts in the city in the
past year.

 &HT;    Large number of child deaths were preventable, report says
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ More than 75 percent of the child deaths
studied by Palm Beach County's multi-agency review team were
preventable, according to a report released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Child Fatality Review and Prevention Project analyzed 25
local deaths that have occurred since January and found that 19 may
have been prevented if people had taken better precautions. If
parents had provided better supervision or youngsters had learned
to swim, for example, children may not have died, project members
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows we have our work cut out for us,'' said Dr.
Jean Malecki, the project's chairwoman and the county's health
department director.
</P>
<P>
   Causes of homicides involving children were not studied because
they are still under police investigation. The number of deaths
since January were not available, but state figures show anywhere
from five to 15 children have died of abuse in the county annually.
</P>
<P>
   The local group made prevention a priority rather than targeting
child abuse cases. That approach caused State Attorney Barry
Krischer and other law enforcement officials to abandon the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were concerned that the group might be reluctant to
report any suspected abuse problems from their investigation to
authorities. But during the research for their report, project
staff members found such a case and reported the family to the
Department of Children and Families.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Bennett, the Health Care District's chief executive
officer, said results from the report suggest that some nonprofit
and governmental agencies will have to rethink their prevention
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the county's drowning prevention effort has been
on having homeowners enclose pools to keep kids out. But the report
showed that drownings did not happen in pools and that there is a
need to start teaching children to swim, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Cobb, the project's director, said the two in-line skating
deaths indicate a need for laws to make skaters wear helmets.
Currently, Florida law only requires kids to wear helmets when
riding bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Research also found that a child died in the front seat of a car
crash when the air bag deployed, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a rash of similar child deaths nationwide caused by
air bags prompted federal officials to issue warnings about the
risks to children. The auto industry responded by installing
switches to disable air bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not endorsing every car be given a switch that turns off
the air bag,'' Cobb said. ``We think people need to be educated
about who should not sit in the front seat.''

 &HT;    Overhaul planned for state insurance policy
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state insurance plan that pays for the
health care of more than 100,000 retired public school employees is
about to go belly up, according to a legislative report released
recently.
</P>
<P>
   A joint House committee says it will take a major overhaul and
major bucks to keep the Teachers Retirement System's TRS-Care
program afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, insolvency is scheduled for September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state could pay the initial deficit of $64-plus million,
but this would only be a temporary solution,'' says the report from
a special joint House committee. ``Due to the increasing number of
retirees, the system is projected to need more than $2 billion to
be solvent by fiscal year 2008.''
</P>
<P>
   TRS-Care was created by lawmakers in 1985 to plug a major gap in
health-care coverage for retired public school employees, most of
whom are not covered by the Medicare programs that most Americans
rely on later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Of Texas' 1,043 school districts, only about 20 contribute to
Social Security for employees. Without Social Security
contributions, retirees are not eligible for Medicare coverage. The
Austin Independent School District is among the few that provides
Social Security coverage for employees.
</P>
<P>
   About the only option not on the table for bailing out TRS-Care
is maintaining the status quo _ a system based on state funds,
limited contributions from public school employees and premiums
from retirees, the committee decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the policy issue facing the state is to offer
catastrophic care only or build an affordable system of health care
with the current systems provided,'' the committee concluded.
</P>
<P>
   House Public Education Chairman Paul Sadler, who co-chaired the
special panel that looked at TRS-Care, said not finding a solution
is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the retired teachers out there, we have no choice. We have
to address it,'' said Sadler, who, like many lawmakers, has now
found a new place to spend part of the state's projected $3
billion-$6 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expenditure Sadler did not see coming,
</P>
<P>
   ``I was floored,'' he said. ``I had no idea the teachers were
not eligible for Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Moore of Amarillo, chairman of the Teachers Retirement
System board that oversees TRS-Care, said everyone could have seen
this coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that claims would outstrip the money over a period of
time,'' he said. ``Legislators began inquiring about it two years
ago, but it was not a high priority because it had some years
remaining before the funds were expended.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, insolvency in sight, Simms is convinced TRS-Care will be a
top priority when lawmakers convene next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt for a moment that it will be reworked,'' he
said. ``What avenue they will use, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is confident the fix will be in before the money runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, TRS-Care serves 101,853 retirees and 17,252
dependents. The number of participants has tripled since the
program was created. Claims also have skyrocketed, from $62 million
in the first full year to $211 million in 1997. Contributions to
the plan have not kept pace with the increase in claims, putting
the plan on course for fiscal meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current setup, the state contributes a half-percent of
the statewide school district payroll. Full-time employees
contribute a quarter percent of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees pay premiums based on the type of coverage they choose,
ranging from a low-end payment for catastrophic coverage that
carries a $4,500 deductible to a comprehensive plan that carries a
$240 deductible and monthly premiums ranging from $47 to $142.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, it would cost school districts almost
$2 billion a year to get all employees into the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely critical,'' Annette Cootes, spokeswoman for
the Texas State Teachers Association, said of TRS-Care. ``For many
of them, you are talking life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee laid out several ``alternative funding
scenarios,'' including increased contributions from the state,
active employees and/or retirees; and setting up a permanent fund
to support the program.
</P>
<P>
   TSTA Vice President Donna Haschke said any solution that dips
into the pockets of teachers or retirees is not really a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think teachers already take too many hits to their paycheck
as it is,'' she said. ``This is a major concern for us and we
certainly think our retired teachers, after working so hard for the
students, should be able to count on TRS-Care in their golden
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Texas Professional Educators is counting on
lawmakers to head off insolvency. ATPE wants to scrap TRS-Care in
favor of a combined system of health insurance coverage for active
educators and retirees, perhaps in conjunction with similar
programs for state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McLamore, the group's director of governmental affairs,
said a close look at health insurance for educators is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are asking people on fixed incomes to pay more and more
for health coverage in their sunset years,'' he said, noting
increased premiums. ``It is time to take a look at the system as a
whole.''

 &HT;    Erxleben losses another battle in court
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorneys for Austin Forex International Inc.
chief executive Russell Erxleben were unsuccessful recently in
their battle to keep correspondence between attorneys and Erxleben
privileged.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of Texas football star, through his
attorneys, had tried to keep from turning over legal records
requested by the temporary receiver for Austin Forex, the foreign
currency trading company that closed Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   One of Erxleben's attorneys argued before state District Judge
Paul Davis that Erxleben and Austin Forex had entered into an
agreement in February for several law firms to represent him and
Austin Forex regarding an investigation by the Texas State
Securities board. The board put the company into receivership days
after it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Steve Orr said that under agreement the communications
between Austin Forex and its attorneys should be considered
privileged and remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   However, after a three-hour hearing, Davis ordered the law firms
to turn over the corporate legal records to receiver Janet
Mortenson and ruled that Mortenson could continue to decide what
documents she should release to state and federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing Orr sought to keep private a critical letter
written by Roy Mouer, a former state securities commissioner hired
as a special counsel to Austin Forex. Orr argued that Erxleben had
not waived his personal attorney-client privilege and that Mouer's
letter should be considered confidential. The letter was the
subject of a Nov. 19 story in the American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was part of the evidence presented at a Nov. 18
federal bankruptcy court hearing, in which a federal bankruptcy
judge ruled against Erxleben's attempts to put Austin Forex and its
affiliate, International Foreign Exchange Corp. into Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-page letter, Mouer urges Erxleben to stop misleading
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting new investors to satisfy old investors while the
problem grows bigger and bigger is the essence of a classic Ponzi
or pyramid scheme. It is fraudulent beyond any doubt, and may very
well subject you to both civil and criminal liability,'' Mouer
wrote in the June 22 letter.
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben and his attorneys have denied any wrongdoing, saying
the company had trading losses and money was lost because of the
actions of unidentified third parties. Erxleben has claimed through
his attorney that he never saw the letter from Mouer.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Mortenson testified Wednesday that she had handed over
Mouer's letter and other legal records to a federal grand jury and
the U.S. Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   After silently reading the letter, Judge Davis ruled that it
could not be considered privileged correspondence, especially since
it was already entered as evidence in a federal bankruptcy court
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hunter, an assistant State Attorney General, questioned why
Erxleben hired attorneys in late February to jointly represent him
and Austin Forex. Seven months later the company closed, leaving an
estimated 600 investors to wonder what had happened to the $40
million to $60 million they had given Austin Forex to invest in
foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously early in the game they thought there was a (legal)
problem,'' Hunter said after Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 24 agreement was signed by Erxleben as president of
Austin Forex and attorneys at four law firms in Austin and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Wednesday, Davis ordered Erxleben to turn over by
Dec. 11 a list of the tangible assets of Austin Forex International
and its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The state district judge also granted a motion by the receiver
to put into the same receivership two other entities affiliated
with Austin Forex _ Austin Forex International L.L.C. and Ausforex
International L.L.C. Another Austin Forex affiliate, International
Foreign Exchange Corp., was already part of the receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators wanted the other entities in the receivership
because there was evidence that money flowed freely between them,
Hunter testified.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit that put Austin Forex into receivership, state
securities investigators say at least one instance shows that $5.28
million of Austin Forex investor checks were deposited into an
account of Austin Forex International L.L.C. Later, $4.46 million
of the funds were wired to an International Foreign Exchange Corp.
account.
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben's attorneys did not object to the move to put the
assets of the two companies under the control of the temporary
receiver.

 &HT;    Don't dunk those sneakers in the trash _ they could be worth
cash
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ That old pair of basketball shoes that's been
sitting at the back of your closet for 10 years may fetch some
extra cash just in time for holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not aware they are of collector value,'' said
Chuck Vander Hoek who, with partner Andrew Drasiewski, will set up
shop at the Holiday Inn South this weekend. The pair will pay up to
$400 for some styles of Nike and Adidas basketball shoes from the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``One gentleman brought in a pair of Nike North Carolinas in
baby blue and white, a first-edition Air Jordan that he got as a
birthday gift from his wife,'' said Vander Hoek. ``He got $400.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoes are resold in Japan, where early Nike and Adidas
basketball shoes are status symbols among teen-agers and young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Small Earth Inc., Vander Hoek's company, sells the shoes to
Japanese businesses at double the price. By the time they're sold
in Japan, the price doubles again. (If you're counting, that's
$1,600 for a pair of used sneakers.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese buyers pay even more _ up to tens of thousands of
dollars for rare promotional colors, such as the 1985
black-and-gold Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Hoek has found Midwest cities like Dayton to be the best
markets for purchasing the shoes ``because basketball is big
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami Valley, he's on the lookout for Nike's Dunk and
Terminator styles in Ohio State University colors.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Hoek and his partner, who own vintage clothing stores in
Michigan, stumbled into the shoe business about three years ago
when Japanese buyers began asking for the old athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he'll consider larger sizes, Vander Hoek is primarily
looking for shoes in men's sizes 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Before you head for the closet or attic, know that most of the
shoes purchased bring $30 to $50 and many will have no value at
all. However, the original shoebox will increase a collectible
shoe's value by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And control the urge to clean up that pair of golden oldies
before taking them to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse thing someone can do is try to improve the
condition,'' Vander Hoek said. ``I've seen more people hurt the
value than help it. Anytime you alter the original vintage
condition, it does affect the value.''
</P>
<P>
   One Milwaukee woman, whose ex-husband left a pair of shoes
behind when he moved out, saw Vander Hoek's ad and swapped the
shoes for $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked her if she was going to split the money with her
ex,'' Vander Hoek chuckled. ``She said she was going to use it to
take a trip to Chicago and she'd mail him a postcard.''

 &HT;    HEALTH: Patient is footloose and almost pain-free
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For more than seven years, Rick Waits, 47, watched his
world shrink. Struggling with a painful foot condition, he could no
longer play golf or even take weekend strolls with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't complain, the couple realized that his
problem was getting worse over time, limiting their activities and
creating a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But after having an experimental treatment that uses shock waves
to mend minor bone and tendon problems, Waits is walking again,
able to play golf and, most importantly, take weekend strolls with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not completely well; I've probably got about a third of
the pain left,'' he said. ``But the beauty of it now is all I have
to do is get off my feet for 15 or 30 minutes and I start to get
relief. That was never the case before.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment that turned Waits' life around and healed his heel
involves a machine called an OssaTron, which uses high-energy shock
waves to blast away calcifications and re-tear injured tendons in
heel spurs and tennis elbows. By doing this, doctors can dissipate
old scars and cause tendons to heal correctly, thus alleviating
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, called extracorporeal shock wave therapy, has
been around since the mid-1980s, when it was first used to
disintegrate kidney stones. Researchers suspected that the process
had a number of orthopedic applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Atlanta is one of five cities in the United States
conducting clinical trials of the machine's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three months, Georgia Baptist Medical Center has
been testing the machine for the treatment of heel spurs, and soon
the hospital will be evaluating the machine's effectiveness with
tennis elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good news for the state's weekend warriors. Serious
injuries, often from spurts of sports and exercise, aggravate and
sometimes cause bone and joint conditions suffered by one in four
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a real solution to a lot of people's problems,''
said Dr. John A. Ogden, director of Georgia Baptist Hospital's
orthopedic division. Most doctors can now only offer basically
three types of treatment: anti-inflammatory drugs, devices such as
splints or casts, and physical therapy or surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But drugs don't fix the ailment, they merely mask the symptoms.
Devices and therapy often don't alleviate the pain. Surgery
requires more time healing and is more expensive _ costing between
$2,500 and $3,000 per procedure.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the shock wave procedure is done on an outpatient
basis and is expected to cost about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Anice Pearson, 62, of Peachtree City said she was still sore
about a week after the procedure, but it didn't hurt at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel it hitting against my heel, but nothing beyond
that,'' said Pearson, who had suffered from foot problems for at
least two years. Pearson had already tried ultrasound and
cortisone, but they did nothing to ease the pain. Pearson decided
to seek treatment after the ailment stopped her from walking
</P>
<P>
   and playing golf. ``And I didn't want to take any more pain
pills,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told her _ like all patients _ that it will take about
two weeks before she feels better.
</P>
<P>
   Waits said the procedure took about 45 minutes. Local anesthesia
was used, with the machine's arm placed against the heel. Waits
then received 1,500 jolts to the injured area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment was intense, but not scary,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't say it was a totally pain-free experience,
</P>
<P>
   but it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other options, such as a cast and physical therapy, Waits
said he actually felt better the same day. A few weeks after the
treatment, he played golf. Ogden
</P>
<P>
   said the hospital has used the machine on about 30 patients. By
the end of one to two months, about 80 percent of the patients
showed marked improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine _ like any shock wave device _ works by sending an
electrical impulse to an electrode submerged within a brass or
steel ellipsoid lens immersed in water. When a charge of up to
30,000 volts is fired, a small amount of water is vaporized and a
shock wave results. The wave then ricochets from the
</P>
<P>
   side of the lens and reconverges at a focal point aimed at the
injured tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment risks are relatively low. Ogden said, however,
physicians need to take special care when treating the elbow
because it's so close to the shoulder and sensitive lung tissue.
The OssaTron was developed in Switzerland and is distributed in the
United States by a Marietta company, HealthTronics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides treating heel spurs and tennis elbow, HealthTronics' Roy
Brown said, the machine is also being evaluated for its ability to
correct fractures that fail to heal or heal badly. It is also
scheduled to be tested for fixing loose hip prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   And applications might not be limited to humans. The machine and
technique are showing promising results in curing lame horses,
Brown said. In the United States, clinical trials for veterinarian
use should start within the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Waits is thrilled he was able to participate in the new
therapy. For years, he said he was frustrated with the pain and the
slow erosion of his quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got help because my wife said, 'You're too young and
life's too short' to be so debilitated,'' Waits said. ``She was
right.''

 &HT;    Going home for the holidays can reap stressful harvest
 &HT;    WITH HOLIDAY-ROLES-TIPS, PHOTOS, ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Truth is, you can go home again. Question is, do you
really want to?
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with her mother's ``terrible cooking,'' Christine Ronn,
41, a mother of three from suburban Atlanta, decided a few years
ago that phoning home would be easier on her stomach, not to
mention her nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get nauseous just seeing the Toledo city limits sign,''
says Ronn. ``At some point as you get older, it's just not worth it
_ unless you get off on going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   For millions, going home for the holidays has become an arduous,
stress-filled ordeal in which grown men and women unconsciously
revert to childish roles, elderly parents bark orders like tyrants,
and somebody else _ anybody but you _ makes all the decisions,
including when, where and what to eat, when to open gifts, how to
decorate the tree or even whether it's OK to leave for a while
without hurting anyone's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday stress, brought on in part by such visits, is one reason
America's suicide rate starts rising in January from a low in
December. And why January is the busiest month for therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Wheeler, an Atlanta psychologist, says her patients
can't seem to wait to get holiday hell stories off their chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are confrontations over tinsel or icicles on the tree,
or turkey with corn bread or roasted chestnuts. People worry, 'Are
my gifts good enough? Did I spend enough money? Is Aunt Sara gonna
be as horrible as last year? Is Dad gonna get drunk?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It can all make you feel empty, depressed, alienated. It's now
a tradition to feel guilty for not feeling happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta stockbroker Pierce Hammond, 54, is a case in point. He's
trekked to Mobile, Ala., for longer than he can remember to spend
the holidays with his wife's folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chaotic, is what it is,'' says Hammond. ``God,
everybody's there. All my wife's sisters and brothers and their
kids, a whole bunch of people floating around. It's kind of a haze.
I'm ready to leave when it's done, even before.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then grins: ``But I'm supposed to say it's great,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes we are, say the headshrinkers. And, when the reality
doesn't measure up to the ``supposed to,'' stress snowballs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rick Winer, a Roswell, Ga., psychiatrist, says his patients
often are full of guilt in January.
</P>
<P>
   We've been programmed to think we should head home for
Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas or New Year's, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're under pressure not to offend anyone, which you can do
simply in your decision about who to stay with,'' says Winer. ``And
it's supposed to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, heading home is healthful, even relaxing, Winer
says. ``In some instances, you don't have to think because
everything's scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, difficulties loom. ``With your parents, there's always
that feeling, `Do I need to let them know where I'm going and when
I'll get back?''' Winer says. ``Parents will assert their authority
more: `You are under my roof, you are under my rules.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Roper Organization at the University of
Connecticut, most Americans say they look forward to going home to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet going home for the holidays is one of the most stressful
events of the year. Senior analyst David Wilber says polls show 49
percent of adults who visit their parents report significant
stress.
</P>
<P>
   Adults report stress over being treated like kids, over how to
trim the tree and how much to spend on gifts, the trip itself _
even lingering sibling rivalries. ``Who got the biggest raise? Who
has the best car? The best house? It's like comparing curriculum
vitae,'' Wilber says.
</P>
<P>
   Ronn decided home for the holidays was where her ``real house''
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be my mom and dad were the big kahunas,'' she says.
But holidays in Marietta turn out to be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is better. In Toledo, the sexiest thing we had to eat
was beef stew. Mom's idea of cooking was to get a can of vegetables
and boil them until they are so limp they scream to get out of the
water,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is the queen of criticism. I'll be damned if I'm
going to fall back into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Celente, head of the Trends Research Institute in
Rhinebeck, N.Y., says it's not just bad cooking and carping that
dampen a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of us, it's no longer over the river and through the
woods. It's over the road to hell or to a hellish airport or
freeway,'' says Celente. ``And for those who still head out, it's a
hassle they'd rather avoid, even if they don't want to admit it.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``People are burned out. It's an hour to the airport, then
getting tangled up in a sea of people and confusion, then going
halfway across the country, then coming back really knowing why you
live so far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, we go. About 45 percent of us will head to faraway
relatives, according to the American Automobile Association. The
numbers may be even higher in metro Atlanta, where fully 42 percent
of the people aren't native Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Thompson, 22, a salesman for Pugmire Izusu in Marietta,
is weighing whether to drive home to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's comforting,'' he says. ``I think I like it
because nothing ever changes. They try to fix my plate. They tell
me to wear my coat.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bramham, 51, an executive at CNN, enjoys his family visits
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change, and in a lot of ways, it's really nice,'' he
says.

   ``Mom always reverts,'' he laughs. ``I had asthma as a child,
and she always says, 'Put on a sweater, you'll get cold. Close the
window.' Her favorite comment is 'Now listen to your mother.' We
still have a great time, and I still look forward to the
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and adds, ``But I'm really, really thankful for Jan.
2.''

 &HT;    Tips on coping with stress from family visits during the
holidays
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ Temper your expectations. The notion of the ``perfect''
reunion can set you up for frustration and depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call a friend if the family setting becomes unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take heed of alcohol consumption. It may seem relaxing in the
short term, but its physiological effect can compound stress and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set comfortable limits. Determine how involved and
accommodating your plans should be well in advance, and make your
limits known to others involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reach out to those with whom you have healthy, nurturing
relationships. Get together with friends if a family setting is not
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change gift-giving procedures. Consider putting a limit of one
gift per person.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Holiday Songs and Lullabies'' Shawn Colvin
(Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   This stocking stuffer is an understated seasonal offering,
recorded last summer while Colvin was pregnant with her first
child, Caledonia. Nimbly dodging a potential case of the cutes, the
acoustic-flavored package meanders gracefully from ``Love Came Down
at Christmas,'' ``Silent Night'' and a ballad from ``Merry
Christmas, Charlie Brown'' to traditional lullabies such ``All the
Pretty Li'l Horses'' and ``The Christ Child's Lullaby.''
</P>
<P>
   Conjured up in part by Maurice Sendak's illustrations from
``Lullabies and Night Songs,'' which Colvin loved as a child, and
by her impending motherhood, ``Holiday Songs and Lullabies'' stands
as an elegant counterpoint to all the plummy and overstuffed
yuletide schmaltz of the season. It also offers a serene and lovely
soundtrack by which children of all ages may sleep and, perchance,
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kings of African Music'' Various artists (Music Club)
</P>
<P>
   Your friend (or you) is intrigued by the excitement of African
music but overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices available.
There is, after all, a whole musical continent to explore, and
without a native and/or knowledgeable guide it's easy to get lost.
``Kings of African Music,'' a budget-priced compilation mixing
contemporary African hit-makers with the legendary pioneers of the
music might well be the best gateway on the market.
</P>
<P>
   By including songs by such African music legends as Franco and
Thomas Mapfumo, artists as important to the evolution of worldbeat
as the better-known King Sunny Ade and Fela Kuti, the collection
provides an enlightening historical context for the more
contemporary selections. The newer material, by modern artists such
as Youssou N'Dour and Baaba Maal, resonates with tradition but
expresses itself in considerably more contemporary terms. Both
approaches meld to create an educational overview of the music's
possibilities, but most listeners will be having too much fun to
care as the music's inherent rhythmic wonders hit the body first,
leaving the mind to fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the names will be new to fledgling fans of the music but
some, such as Kanda Bongo Man, whose percolating rhythms glow with
sheer pleasure, blues man Ali Farka Toure, known as the John Lee
Hooker of Africa, and the irrepressible Papa Wemba, will soon
become familiar as listeners search out their recordings. The 13
tracks obviously don't cover all aspects of African music, but they
do get you through the door of a brave, new musical world you can
spend the rest of your life enjoyably exploring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live on Two Legs'' Pearl Jam (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   The equation is pretty cut-and-dried: Capable live band plus
thick song catalog equals great concert album. Pearl Jam adds up
its strengths remarkably well, though, on its first (authorized)
live album, ``Live on Two Legs.'' Recorded on two legs of this
year's ``Yield'' tour, this 16-track, 72-minute collection picks
rather evenly between P.J.'s five studio albums. Starting with the
ferocious ``Corduroy'' and climaxing with a crunching version of
Neil Young's ``(expletive) Up,'' the order of the day here is
aggressive hard rock, the kind people forgot Eddie Vedder and Co.
could manhandle so well. Chest-beaters like ``Go,'' ``Do the
Evolution'' and ``MFC'' find the Seattle boys strutting their stuff
with thoroughly satisfying bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Except for ``Evenflow'' and ``Black,'' the band lets its
overplayed first album rest, choosing instead to dust off such
``Vs.'' classics as ``Daughter'' and ``Elderly Woman Behind the
Counter in a Small Town'' while adding fuel to the fire of the
``Yield'' track ``Given To Fly.'' One thing this album makes clear
is that the band's two ``experimental'' albums, ``Vitalogy'' and
``No Code,'' did offer some rather straightforward crowd-pleasers.
``Nothingman,'' ``Hail Hail'' and ``Red Mosquito'' all make this
collection complete for Pearl Jam diehards and doubters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Metallica's ``Garage Inc.,'' also released 1 1/2
weeks ago, ``Live on Two Legs'' provides a sort of catharsis for
'80s hard-rock fans who were supposed to feel guilty because they
once paid to see Van Halen. It also allows younger fans a chance to
claim a great rock band for themselves. Go ahead and try to tell a
P.J. fan this stuff is passe(accent). Chances are, they won't hear
you anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wide Open Spaces'' Dixie Chicks (Mercury)
</P>
<P>
   The freshest breeze to blow through Nashville in the past year
comes in the form of a platinum-tressed trio from Texas (two from
Dallas, one from Lubbock, if you're counting). Sister
instrumentalists Martie Seidel and Emily Erwin, along with vocalist
Natalie Maines, were playing the Broken Spoke within recent memory;
the last time they came to town, they had graduated to the Erwin
Center. As for their debut major-label album, it has pole-vaulted
past the platinum level, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   None of which would matter if the music therein weren't so
fresh, vibrant and engaging. The Chicks are a ray of light in the
gloom of commercial sludge and pre-processed dross that represents
so much of Music City's cynical output. If Nashville is smart, it
will stand out of the way and let these Texas girls inject some
unalloyed delight back into country music.
</P>
<P>
   From the sexy, self-assured opener, ``I Can Love You Better,''
to the back-porch breakdown of Bonnie Raitt's ``Give It Up or Let
Me Go,'' which closes the album, the Dixie Chicks give blondage a
good name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Boy's Greatest Beats, Vol. 1-4'' Various artists (Tommy
Boy) ``The Perfect Beats, Vol. 1-4'' Various artists (Timber!/Tommy
Boy)
</P>
<P>
   New York's famed hip-hop and dance label Tommy Boy Records came
up with two stocking-stuffer CD packages _ for extra-large
stockings, that is _ which are surprisingly fun, if not thoroughly
enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatest Beats'' and ``The Perfect Beats'' are both four-disc
box sets that are also conveniently available in single-disc
format. The cornerstone track in both sets is Afrika Bambaataa's
``Planet Rock,'' but each takes a wildly divergent turn from there.
``Greatest Beats'' is basically a greatest-hits package from the
label's roster, including everything from Naughty by Nature and De
La Soul (yeah!) to RuPaul and Information Society (boo!). ``The
Perfect Beats'' is a compilation of vintage dance tracks pulled
together from various other labels, most of which have since folded
or been long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Meant for DJs and hardcore electronic music fans, ``The Perfect
Beats'' may seem a little over the top to casual listeners.
Subtitled ``New York Electro Hip-Hop + Underground Classics
1980-1985,'' it's really the geek's bible to this sort of music.
Many of the tracks featured on ``Perfect Beats'' are terribly hard
to find, which is great _ if you were looking for them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the names heard on ``Perfect Beats'' are Planet Patrol,
Jonzun Crew, Peech Boys, Yello, B Beat Girls, Shannon, Jellybean,
Jay Novell, Dominatrix and many more you'd be hard-pressed to know
anything about. More mainstream tracks by Kraftwerk (``Trans Europe
Express''), New Order (``Confusion''), Chaka Khan (``My Love Is
Alive''), Yaz (``Don't Go'') and Level 42 (``Starchild'') serve as
North Stars to help the listeners find their way. For campy, quirky
and classic dance music, though, this collection is hard to beat.
Single-disc shoppers may want to check out volumes 1 and 3 for the
best samplings.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Boy's other collection, ``Greatest Beats,'' is mostly
hip-hop with a few odds and ends that probably shouldn't have even
been thrown in. It's among the first hip-hop box sets out there, as
few labels and artists have amassed or own complete catalogs. Tommy
Boy's discs include everything from pre-heyday tracks by Afrika
Bambaataa and G.L.O.B.E. to recent hits by Coolio and Apache. The
best tracks, though, are the ones in between, including De La
Soul's ``Me, Myself and I,'' Naughty by Nature's ``O.P.P.,'' Queen
Latifah and Monie Love's ``Ladies First,'' Stetsasonic's ``Talkin'
All That Jazz'' and House of Pain's ``Shamrocks and Shenanigans.''
Again, anyone wanting just one or two discs should choose volumes 1
and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forgotten Angel'' Clyde McPhatter (32 R&AMP;B)
</P>
<P>
   Few singers, past or present, ever achieved such sublime
transcendency with their vocal acrobatics as the late Clyde
McPhatter, the sweetly soaring voice that transformed R&AMP;B hits like
``A Lover's Question,'' ``Money Honey'' and ``Treasure of Love''
into timeless classics. McPhatter's voice, pure and piercing, was a
natural wonder but the singer improved upon nature, perfecting his
instrument until it was capable of sending delicious shivers up the
spine with just a twist of a phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Neville, a kindred vocal spirit and stone cold McPhatter
fan, co-produced this collection and provides a heartfelt
testimonial in the liner notes, stating ``as singers go, on a scale
of 1 to 10, he was a 15.'' If that's not endorsement enough,
consider that McPhatter's replacements in his first hit groups were
Jackie Wilson and Ben E. King, certifiable vocal virtuosos in their
own right. The perfectly titled ``The Forgotten Angel'' offers
three dozen McPhatter songs on two discs and each is a treasure.
The heartbreakingly sincere love ballads are too perfect for words,
while other songs, such as the salacious mambo ``Honey Love,''
originally banned from Memphis jukeboxes more because of its
suggestive rhythms than its lyrics, provide a more physical
expression of his romantic nature. All the songs benefit from
McPhatter's supporting cast, whether it's the vocal textures of The
Drifters or the funky sax work of Texas legend King Curtis, but the
stunning vocal gymnastics carry the show. And it's a real live
show, via a selection of live performances from the Apollo Theater,
featuring the venue's crack house band, that concludes the
collection and proves McPhatter could also rock with primal R&AMP;B
energy when he wasn't soaring with angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teatro'' Willie Nelson (Island Records) ``Me and the Drummer''
Willie Nelson (Luck Records) ``VH-1 Storytellers'' Willie Nelson
(with Johnny Cash) (Columbia Records)
</P>
<P>
   Or, a crash course on Why Willie Still Matters. ``Teatro,'' an
atmospheric follow-up to his acoustic-flavored ``Spirit'' album,
teams Willie with producer Daniel Lanois and uber-harmonizer
Emmylou Harris. From jazzy Django Reinhardt instrumentals to
atmospheric nouvelle versions of Nelson classics such as ``Three
Days'' and ``Darkness on the Face of the Earth,'' ``Teatro''
reveals Nelson's adventurous imagination is running on all
cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and the Drummer,'' on Willie's independent label named
after his Western movie set, reincarnates one of Nelson's classic
bar band lineups, dubbed the Offenders. The group offers a low-key
but intense honky-tonk set that includes ``I Let My Mind Wander,''
``You Wouldn't Cross the Street To Say Goodbye,'' ``No Tomorrow in
Sight '' and more. It's whiskey-drinking music par excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson sitting around a
campfire swapping war stories and you have some idea of the
comfortable and classic flavor of ``VH-1 Storytellers,'' a live
recording taken from the television show of the same name. It ain't
much on the surface, just Nelson and Johnny Cash and two guitars.
Some songs, some stories _ but what songs: ``Ring of Fire,''
``Family Bible,'' ``I Still Miss Someone,'' ``Funny How Time Slips
Away.'' You don't get much closer to a pure distillation of country
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Progress &AMP; in Motion'' Taj Mahal (Columbia/Legacy)
</P>
<P>
   International blues man Taj Mahal's music is so endlessly and
aggressively eclectic that even a three-disc retrospective only
scratches the surface of his musical incarnations. But ``In
Progress &AMP; In Motion'' does an excellent job of covering the basics
while also providing 15 never-before-available recordings for Taj
Mahal fans who think they've heard it all.
</P>
<P>
   The compilation offers three tunes, including ``Fishin' Blues,''
from his ``Austin City Limits'' performance, a half-dozen songs
(including a rambunctious live take on ``Sweet Home Chicago'') in
collaboration with the sassy Pointer Sisters and even a few
exceedingly rare tracks from ``The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll
Circus'' television special. Throw in a live number with Boz Scaggs
and Elvin Bishop and add a couple of tunes, including a sizzling
``Statesboro Blues,'' from his first band, the Rising Sons, a group
also featuring Ry Cooder, and you've got a first-class collection
of Taj Mahal rarities, complete with star-studded accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   But Taj is at his most effective and evocative without guest
stars to get in the way, and the compilation supplies literally
dozens of enjoyable examples of his ability to personalize the
music in his own image. Such classics as ``Take a Giant Step,''
``Going Up to the Country '' and ``Dust My Broom'' allow the singer
to creatively reconfigure traditional style material while
remaining true to its original intent. It's the artist at his
easy-rolling, storytelling best, and few artists are more
comfortable to curl up with on a holiday night than Taj.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing It!'' Marcia Ball, Irma Thomas, Tracy Nelson (Rounder)
</P>
<P>
   Three distaff veterans _ Austin keyboardist Marcia Ball, New
Orleans soul diva Irma Thomas and blues belter Tracy Nelson _ unite
for an all-star ``girl group'' like they don't hardly make any
more. Taking turns at center stage (and uniting triumphantly,
especially on the rousing title track), each woman stamps out her
own turf while aiding and abetting her partners. Friends for years,
while constantly crossing paths on the Crawfish Circuit of clubs
and festivals, Ball, Thomas and Nelson know how to play to one
another's strengths and, moreover, how to cajole great performances
out of one another.
</P>
<P>
   This is rib-sticking stuff, backed by a cast of musicians from
Memphis and Louisiana. The songs range from the syncopated ``I Want
To Do Everything for You'' to a wailing update of Bobby ``Blue''
Bland's ``Yield Not to Temptation'' and the soaring ballad
``Shouldn't I Love Him,'' and all over the musical terrain of the
South. But the best line on the album may be an ad-lib by Ball,
who, toward the conclusion of ``Love Maker'' (as in, ``I'm a love
maker, not a home maker . . .''), says, ``You say, what are you
makin' for supper? And I say _ reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues in Bebop'' Kenny Dorham (Savoy)
</P>
<P>
   The late trumpet legend Kenny Dorham is, along with native sons
Teddy Wilson, Oscar Moore and Gene Ramey, Austin's most direct and
significant connection to jazz history. Dorham, who began playing
trumpet in high school in Austin, was a legitimate jazz genius _
and that's not just hometown pride talking. He replaced Miles Davis
in Charlie Parker's band, was a co-founder of the legendary Jazz
Messengers and recorded classic tunes with everyone from John
Coltrane and Max Roach to Thelonius Monk and Sonny Rollins, to name
only a few.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorham's career was cut short by kidney disease, and he died
decades before his time, leaving a legacy of work whose quality was
enormous but whose quantity was limited. ``Blues in Bebop,'' taken
from a 10-year period ending in 1956, showcases Dorham's early work
in excellent fashion, reprising his recordings, many still
difficult to obtain, with Parker, Bud Powell, Billy Eckstine, Milt
Jackson and others in chronological order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues in Bebop'' is not necessarily the pinnacle of Dorham's
jazz creativity _ his Blue Note albums from the years following are
uniformly superlative _ but the collection is nevertheless filled
with moments of miraculous music-making. That's not too surprising
considering the phenomenal musicians on the sessions, but the
freshness and vitality of the music is consistently amazing.
``Blues in Bebop,'' eminently accessible to both neophyte and
veteran jazz fans, offers gift-givers a perfect opportunity to fly
the flag of Austin music while paying tribute to a world-class
talent and elevating the artistic and enjoyment level of the CD
collection of its recipient.

 &HT;    Good news, Texas; you can strike stupidest law from books
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The folks at Texas A&AMP;M have done their best at
wiping out boll weevils and grubs. They've made headway against
fire ants and web worms. But only now can they confirm an outright
bio-eradication.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough was announced to a bonfire rally last week, not
by an entomologist but by a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Football player Dan Campbell said he was glad to attend a school
where ``men like women and women like men.'' Scientists no doubt
are catching planes this week to find out how A&AMP;M has cured
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation is a stunner, and certainly a relief. Whatever
A&AMP;M has done it must share with lawmakers in Austin. With
homosexuality cured, as its first item of business, the 76th Texas
Legislature can revoke Texas' stupidest law.
</P>
<P>
   Is the cure for homosexuality a serum? If so, vials can be
rushed to the University of Texas. Some took the Aggie's comments
to imply that UT is sorely blighted. Campbell and A&AMP;M officials
have apologized to all offended by the comments, but wait.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know you can take a sampling of 34,000 average
collegians, do whatever A&AMP;M did with them, and have every one march
straight, well ...
</P>
<P>
   That means we don't need Texas' sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   Court dockets spared?
</P>
<P>
   That means two Houston men shouldn't have to go on trial for
touching each other in ways outlawed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   That means a Houston lawman wouldn't have to testify exactly how
not-OK the touching was, there among consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Texas Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court
wouldn't have to sit down to review the touching, as opponents of
this ridiculous law want to force the justices to do.
</P>
<P>
   Our courts and our police ought to deal with crimes that have
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of 19 states with anti-sodomy laws. There's one
fewer as of last week. The Georgia Supreme Court struck down that
state's law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot think of any other activity that reasonable persons
would rank as more private and more deserving of protection from
governmental interference than consensual, private, adult sexual
activity,'' said Georgia's chief justice. The Georgia case, but the
way, did not involve homosexual conduct. It involved a male and a
female. Texas is one of five states whose anti-sodomy laws apply
only to homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Their privacy obliterated
</P>
<P>
   What were John Lawrence and Tyrone Garner doing in Lawrence's
Houston apartment the night of Sept. 17? None of Texas' business.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris County deputy responding on an unrelated matter entered
the unlocked apartment and saw what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Showing uncommon courage, these two men decided to face the
music and then step out into the national light challenging the
law.
</P>
<P>
   They pleaded no contest, were fined $125 each by a justice of
the peace, and then filed their appeal. Good luck to them.
</P>
<P>
   No one should have to face this. Texas lawmakers should see to
it. They should stand up for the right of privacy. But they won't.
Some will be spineless. Some will be beholden to pious forces that
put them there.
</P>
<P>
   A serum for homosexuality? Don't be ridiculous. It's not a
disease spread through the air.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of life's mysteries. It bothers many sensibilities.
Many would like to wish it didn't exist or that advisories of
righteous damnation would make us all the same.
</P>
<P>
   People's emotions can no more be controlled by vaccine than by
nonsensical laws.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we run a dragnet at A&AMP;M to check on who's pairing up with
whom? Of course not. It's none of our business. However, I imagine
a census would surprise.
</P>

 &HT;    When good critics say bad things
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The job of music critic has long been a
thankless task, but in recent months it's become an increasingly
dangerous gig as well, as artists are fighting back in more direct
arenas than the letters page.
</P>
<P>
   Last week after a show in New York City, for instance, Spin
editor Craig Marks was roughed up by Marilyn Manson's bodyguards,
allegedly under orders from the schlock-rocker, who looked on as
Marks was lifted by his neck, pinned to the wall and dropped like
an '80s hair band after a label purge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get for disrespecting me,'' Manson said,
according to a report Marks filed with New York police. It seems
Manson was miffed that Spin, noting the chart-plummeting of the
recent ``Mechanical Animals'' LP, changed its plans to put the man
with the plastic ``Barbarella'' breasts on the cover of the January
issue in some sort of ``Artist of the Year'' salute. Knowing that
his career has the shelf life of a carton of milk, Manson
apparently felt he had nothing to lose with an assault on the
editor, and could maybe even gain fans amongst the legion of
freelancers to whom Spin rarely returns phone calls or letters.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the hip-hop Spin-off magazine Blaze, meanwhile, editor
Jesse Washington said he was beat up last week by four men,
including rapper Derek ``D-Dot'' Angellettie, who was angered
because Blaze was planning to unmask his identity as the phantom
``Madd Rapper'' in an upcoming issue. Washington is the same music
scribe who claims to have had a pistol pointed at him by Wyclef
Jean of the Fugees about three months ago after hearing that Blaze
planned to run a negative review of a Jean-produced LP by Canibus.
Then there was the incident in England during the summer when
Tricky and one of his men pummeled a British critic who had panned
the last Tricky snore-fest ``Angels With Dirty Faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting closer to home we have A.J. Vallejo writing a letter to
the Austin Chronicle after a writer unmercifully slagged the new
``Storyville'' LP and saying, basically, that if the critic had
written that kind of review about Vallejo, he'd be chugging his
free beers through a straw for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters are becoming the hunted, but what's most shocking
about this recent turn of events is that it hasn't been happening
all along. Every musician worth anything has, at one time or
another, probably wanted to play ``Wipeout'' with their fists on
some smart-mouth critic's cranium, but the most violent kind of
reaction critics could expect in the good ol' days was an
eight-page fax from Don Henley's manager. After a year of hearing
how Ronnie Dunn of Brooks &AMP; Dunn was going to tear me up if our
paths crossed, the worst he did when that day happened was to tell
me that those that can't do, criticize (``and those that can't
criticize write for the Dallas Morning News'' I offered as a
punchline). In these times, though, members of the crit clique are
starting to see stars if they don't give records more than a
couple. This new era of intimidation makes me glad I live in the
laid-back metropolis of Austin, where the worst fate that can
befall a critic is to see a truly boring act's manager guarding the
exit when you're ready to leave two songs into the set.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I've taken a couple of half-smacks in the course of my work,
but it was always from fans who didn't like what I wrote about
bands like KISS and Motley Crue, not musicians or their goons. I
also had a guy take a swing at me during a Pantera show in Dallas a
few years back, but he was just basically punching everyone who
didn't look like him (burr-head, sideburns, Doc Martens, tattoos,
animal blood dripping from his chin) and I happened to stroll by in
my Dockers and golf shirt. (I've never been a fan of security
guards quite as much as when they physically removed the thug that
night, using his face to feel their way through the poles and
railings of the darkened amphitheater).
</P>
<P>
   I've been choosed off at clubs a few times by band members who
didn't like what I wrote, but they invariably called the next day
with a wordhangover and an apology. The thing is, I'm a big guy
with tattoos and even though I've had to file a restraining order
against an ex-girlfriend, who wants to run the risk of losing a
fight with ``Corky''? Let's face it, you lose a fight with a
music/gossip columnist and your friends will show up carrying a
pillow with a gun on top, urging you to go into the next room and
do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't say that I miss Joe Mac's Whistle Stop in Dallas'
``Thin Blue Line'' country _ that would be like pining for a bad
LSD trip _ but it's great to remember the monument to seedy kitsch
that closed in '93 from the distance provided by Homer Henderson's
new compilation ``Greatest Flops &AMP; Golden Filler,'' which just came
out on Honey Records. With his warped country songs ``Pickin' Up
Beer Cans On the Highway'' and ``Lee Harvey Was a Friend of Mine''
always playing on the jukebox, Henderson was the musical spirit
(along with slashabilly cohort Tex Edwards) of the ``five-star
toilet tavern.'' Homer lived in Austin in '96, helping start the
Nortons and doing his one-man-band at the Continental on occasion,
but his failure to catch on here (except via a cover of ``Lee
Harvey'' by the Asylum Street Spankers) says a lot about Austin's
avoidance of true sickoid culture in favor of nimble jambabies.
</P>
<P>
   Ample proof that Austin is moving closer to ``Tinseltown,
Texas'' and away from ``Live Music Capital of the World'' as a
slogan came Saturday night at Stubb's when Won Santo Condo's mix of
classic rock vocals and alternative aggression was being met with
stares from a crowd that came to see headliner Soulhat. Suddenly,
actor Matthew McConaughey, still apparently celebrating the
Longhorns victory over A&AMP;M 36 hours earlier (in the shirt he wore
at the game), started dancing with abandon in front of the band, so
the audience finally started moving closer and getting involved in
the set. There's your cure for clubland complacency: movie stars
dancing like the Funky Chicken with an inner ear infection.

 &HT;    WITH TEENYSIDE
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Caitlin Greene doesn't know how accurately she
puts it when I ask her how the Backstreet Boys compare to '80s teen
sensations New Kids on the Block and Debbie Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to classic rock,'' the goldilocked 12-year-old
says with a huff, trying her best to ignore me as she turns another
poster in the wall rack at Camelot Music in Highland Mall. Flip,
there's one of the Backstreet Boys. She pauses, and examines. Flip,
then comes the Spice Girls. Flip, Hanson. Flip, the Backstreet Boys
again. Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that one,'' she says, pointing to her favorite
Backstreet Boy and showing a little more interest now that we're on
her turf, talking again about her group. Not knowing which of the
Boys she points to, and not knowing their names anyway, I teasingly
tell her that Zac is my favorite one, but I also like Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zac and Taylor are in Hanson!'' she throttles at me, raising
her head and clenching her teeth like she literally wants to bite
my head off.
</P>
<P>
   Flip, the Spice Girls. Flip, Korn. Flip, Brandy. Flip,
conversation over.
</P>
<P>
   You're out of touch. You try to keep up, but as quick as the
flip of a poster, the names and the songs change while the smiles
and the gimmicks stay pretty much the same. Oh sure, it was easy
enough _ 1 1/2 years ago when the Spice Girls and Hanson hit the
scene all by themselves, cashing in on the teeny-bopper music
market that was dormant for most of the dreary '90s. But the
Backstreet Boys are in now, and so is 'N Sync, 98, All Saints and
many more, which may mean Hanson and the Spice Girls are out. Or
not. Nobody knows for sure because, well, kids have a tendency to
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that teeny-bopper music is back with a
vengeance. The Recording Industry Association of America estimates
that teen-geared acts now account for 10 percent of all pop albums
sold in the country. That's up from a fraction of a percent in the
early '90s, and it doesn't include the plethora of major acts with
teen crossover appeal, including Alanis Morissette, Mariah Carey
and the Beastie Boys. Not since the early and mid-'80s have so many
pre- and early-teen fans (roughly ages 9-14) been buying and asking
for records, er, CDs.
</P>
<P>
   A scan of the Billboard charts last week found kiddie acts all
over the place. On the album chart, the Backstreet Boys were at No.
10 while fellow Orlando, Fla.-reared boy group 'N Sync had not one
but two albums ranked even higher. (That explains why the
Backstreeters, who used to share management companies with 'N Sync,
are seeking new representation. Jealousy perhaps?). Meanwhile, on
the singles chart, upstart hunk act 98 was in the Top 10 along with
Brandy's younger
</P>
<P>
   prote(accent)ge(accent), Monica. Girlie acts All Saints and
Britney Spears also had Top 40 singles.
</P>
<P>
   See, what happened was in the late '80s and early '90s, grunge
became the thing, then punk. Disenchanted rock bands dressed in
jeans and T-shirts and singing about how much the world sucks had
zero appeal to most happy, carefree youngsters, particularly girls.
But record companies were so excited about finding the next Nirvana
or Green Day, that they didn't seem to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame it on the New Kids on the Block,'' said Matthew
Rettenmund, editor of Pop Star! magazine, a pinup publication that
started up this year on the shoulders of the teen pop movement.
``The New Kids saturated the concept of the boy band. When they
finally burned out, boy groups and teen acts in general were very
passe(accent). Nobody (with a record company) wanted to sign
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, record companies just can't seem to get enough of them.
Michael Jackson's new, Sony-operated label MJJ Music is launching a
hunky boy group called No Authority. The similarly named and
manicured No Mercy is being heavily touted by Arista Records, which
is already knee-deep in teen mania with Monica. And Mercury
Records, which can be thanked for kicking off this trend with
Hanson, is getting back in the ring with the newly signed Boyzone _
already a hit in Europe, where the Backstreet Boys and many other
teen acts were first launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious we were leaving the kids out,'' Mercury Records
artist-and-repertoire executive and Hanson champion Steve Greenberg
told me this spring. ``Record companies have hit stagnant times,
and they're seeing teen acts as a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost feel the rejuvenation when you walk into the
mall. Where once it seemed the mall record shops would permanently
close _ and many did, including Musiclands nationwide _ things are
hopping once again. Kids are there, taking soda and ice cream
breaks in the food court between trips to the magazine racks at B.
Dalton Bookseller, the whoopee cushion aisle at Spencer Gifts and,
of course, the CD bins at Camelot or Sam Goody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year for us,'' said Mario Sifuentes,
assistant manager at Camelot in Highland Mall. ``We've got people
asking for everything Backstreet Boys- or Hanson-related: T-shirts,
buttons, key chains.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those sure signs of teen mania, stores are once
again stocked with posters, pinup magazines, stickers and home
videos. There are plenty of new twists on the phenomenon, too. Some
of the groups have online fan clubs. Some also have CD-ROMs with
pictures and quizzes and lots of other fun stuff. An Austin-based
computer software company called Girl Games Inc. is even selling a
CD-ROM called Digital Diva that lets girls create their own teen
magazine at home, so they can cut and paste pictures of themselves
alongside those of the Backstreet Boys or Brandy or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll have any trouble coming up with a
Christmas list this year,'' said Nancy Molina, who has three kids,
two of them _ a boy and a girl _ at ripe teeny-bopper ages. ``She
likes the Spice Girls. He hates them. It never ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are the backbone of the teeny-bopper music industry. Girls
buy all the posters, the pinups and the CD singles. Girls are the
ones whose smiles and sighs make it all bearable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because they mature faster than the boys, but young
ladies worship boy bands when boys their age don't even look at the
girl groups. You don't see too many boys drooling over the Spice
Girls, for instance, and you certainly don't see many that are into
the Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync. Girls, however, are into both sides
of the teen phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger girls like to pretend that they're older than they
are,'' said Pop Star's Rettenmund. ``Along with that, comes the
idea that they want to be married to the Backstreet Boy of their
choice, and they want to be strong and independent and glamorous
like the Spice Girls or Brandy. It's really quite sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys are different. Boys are cool. Boys don't cry. Somewhere
around the age of 10 or so, boys usually begin shunning fluffy
music for a completely new breed of, ahem, crap. They want tough.
They want rough. They want the kind of music that goes with their
new set of muscles and speaks to their inner-most fists. Like video
games where you can rip people's heads off.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may fear such aggressions, but at least it's not
directed toward them (that comes later). In my preteen days, an
obsession with the schlocky, makeup-wearing rock band Kiss led to a
fanaticism for all things heavy metal. Like older girls who thought
the Spice Girls movie was kid stuff, I lost my interest in Kiss
around age 9 when I saw their TV movie, ``Kiss Meets the Phantom.''
That led me to Twisted Sister. And Mtley Cr e. And Iron Maiden.
And, though I now wonder if I didn't just make them up in my head,
Keel.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that the music industry has once again picked up on teen
selling power, as well as a sure sign that the younger generation
is more spoiled than we were, boys nowadays have two musics to
choose from to meet the demands of their hardening images: metal
(still) and rap. In the former category, Marilyn Manson leads the
pack. There's also Korn, Limp Bizkit and Rob Zombie. As far as
rappers go, everyone from Puff Daddy to the members of Wu-Tang Clan
to Jay-Z have earned an early-teen, mostly male following, despite
the parental advisory warnings on the covers of their CDs. Most of
the metal CDs also have these stickers, or at least should have
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever!'' said 14-year-old Frederick Hearn, when presented
with the idea that he shouldn't be shopping for CDs with parental
warnings. He was looking at Korn's CDs. ``It's just cool music, and
I like it. I don't need anybody telling me what I can or can't
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed as put off as the girl with the Backstreet Boys
posters.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, judging from the reactions Hearn and other teens gave me,
we should just let the kids be. We shouldn't tell them about the
New Kids on the Block or Kiss, or David Cassidy and Alice Cooper,
or whoever the yin-and-yang teen acts were from our childhoods, the
ones that wound up being as substantive as cotton candy. We grew
up, and the acts grew old. They'll grow up, and Lord willing, the
Backstreet Boys and Marilyn Manson will grow old, too. There's no
need to spoil the party in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the difference now is that teen mania may be a
permanent fixture in the pop music world, more so than it has ever
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be teen-agers,'' said Mercury Records' Steve
Greenberg. ``Trends come and go, but I think record companies now
know there always has to be something out there to give to the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As sure as the gleaming white smiles on the Backstreet Boys, as
perfectly crafted as the haircuts on those 'N Sync guys, as
carefree as the choruses in all the Hanson songs, young music fans
have united and left us adults out in the cold. We could always try
to warm up to the stuff, but it's doubtful that will do us any
good, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped listening to the Spice Girls,'' said Page
McAllister, 13. Her reason for exiting Spice World? ``My mom
started listening to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it hurts.

 &HT;    Major stars among minor fans

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   THE HUNKS
</P>
<P>
   Backstreet Boys
</P>
<P>
   Five all-American boys between the ages of 18 and 26, A.J.,
Brian, Kevin, Howie and Nick met about four years ago at various TV
and Disney World auditions in Orlando, Fla. After some two years of
massive overseas success, the Boys finally stormed U.S. shores this
year with the single ``Everybody (Backstreet's Back)'' and its
``Thriller''-like music video that, well, you have to see to
believe. ``All I Have To Give'' is their latest single, and lead
throb Nick just put out his book, ``The Heart and Soul of Nick
Carter.'' No doubt, it's a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: Nick, nicknamed Chaos, has a tendency to break
into Journey's ``Open Arms.'' Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync
</P>
<P>
   Formed almost two years ago in Orlando, Fla., by members Justin
Timberlake and JC Chasez, who were part of the new ``Mickey Mouse
Club'' cast, the five 17- to 26-year-olds were managed by Justin's
mom until the Backstreet Boys' guru team took over and launched
them in Germany. They hit it big in the United States a couple of
months ago with the single ``I Want You Back'' and are currently
all over the Top 10 charts. Did you know the letters in 'N Sync are
taken from the last letters in each member's first name? Hmmm. The
boys have a new Christmas CD out, a TV special airing on the Disney
Channel on Saturday and a concert at the Bronco Bowl in Dallas on
Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: Chris, the oldest, has earrings, dreads and
facial hair. Justin, the youngest, admits in the group's press kit,
``I'm a real party animal.''
</P>
<P>
   98(degrees)
</P>
<P>
   Signed to Motown, which has produced a few lasting teeny-bopper
acts (Jackson 5, Boyz II Men), this smiling quartet is the latest
entry in hunkdom. Hit singles include ``Invisible Man'' and
``Because of You,'' from their album ``98 &AMP; Rising,'' as well as
``True to Your Heart,'' a pairing with Stevie Wonder for the
``Mulan'' soundtrack. There's really nothing else interesting here.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: Jeff has tattoos. One tattoo reads, ``98.'' Lucky
for him, tattoo removal is cheaper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging in there, despite some calls that their 15 minutes
were ticking, the three Oklahoma brothers were discovered in Austin
at the South by Southwest Conference and debuted early last year
with the album ``Middle of Nowhere'' and the single ``MMMBop.'' In
addition to a recent ``early years'' compilation (``Three Car
Garage''), a Christmas CD (``Snowed In'') and a concert album
(``Live From Albertane'') the Hanson Inc. machine has turned out
not one but two home videos. Cha-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: Isaac is almost old enough to buy cigarettes.
Hunks on the horizon: No Authority, No Mercy, Boyzone, 5ive.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIRLS
</P>
<P>
   Brandy
</P>
<P>
   Her big-screen debut in ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer'' was a stinker, but Brandy still knows what she did four
years ago to become a superstar: sing. The 19-year-old's sophomore
album, ``Never Say Never,'' and her hit duet with Monica, ``The Boy
Is Mine,'' have made her a lasting favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: ``Sassy'' is Brandy's middle name. Don't get
sassy with me, young lady.
</P>
<P>
   All Saints
</P>
<P>
   A cheap imitation of the Spice Girls, right down to their London
home base, questionable ages and multi-ethnic look (hey, it beats
the Ozzie and Harriet quota of the boy groups), All Saints hasn't
exploded in America the way it has in Europe. Save your sighs of
relief, though, because the group is still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: The quartet recently auctioned off its knickers
on a London radio show.
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blue, along with her frequent onstage cohort Bryan White,
has brought teen mania to country music. Having recently endured
her parents' divorce and a decision to live in Texas instead of
Nashville, though, the 16-year-old is growing up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: She just played a runaway on her favorite soap,
``Days of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Spice Girls
</P>
<P>
   Downed by pregnancy, marriage and other pesky adult things, the
Girls may be out for the count. Ginger/Geri's departure certainly
didn't help, and rumored attempts to replace her sound like Power
Ranger maneuvering. The question now is whether they can stretch
out their appeal to growing/older crowds, la Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Danger factor: Yes, that was a baby popping out through Scary's
wedding dress recently.
</P>
<P>
   Girls on the horizon: Monica, Britney Spears, Mya, Jennifer Love
Hewitt (she's big in Japan), Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMONS: Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rob Zombie Remember when?: New
Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Bay City Rollers, The
Osmonds, Boyz II Men, New Edition, David Cassidy, Jackson 5, Davy
Jones, Fabian, Pat Boone.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   They came in within days of each other. Each patient was young,
well dressed and employed. The malady they shared was simple, in a
sense, but not straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving
that morning, his right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't
speak. Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods, can you understand me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Yuh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeeze my hands.'' His right hand gripped my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I said. ``Does it feel stronger than it did a
little while ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he strained to speak. ``Yuh.'' Then he shook his head,
sad and disgusted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods,'' I continued, ``I need to ask you some questions.
Have you ever used cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for a 44-year-old to have a stroke, but with no
history of hypertension or smoking, it's decidedly unusual. Unless
cocaine is involved. Mr. Woods's head trembled a bit, then he
looked me in the eye. ``Uh, hm,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time?'' I asked. ``Th-this m-morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wife walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning?'' she cried. ``John ... you said you were
clean!''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to me. ``He did the program and said he was clean.
For six months.'' She spun back to face him. ``Oh, God, you
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woods felt duped, but she is by no means alone. Doctors,
especially we emergency room doctors, pride ourselves on squeezing
the truth out of rocks. But I work in New York City; it's boom time
here, and drugs chase money.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine was such an emblem of the go-go '80s that in 1985 the
United States reported 5.7 million users. In the dozen years since,
that number has dropped by more than two-thirds, but ominous signs
of a comeback are in the wind. In 1996 we ``imported'' 240 tons of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room cares for half a dozen young professionals a
day who rush in with all the symptoms of a panic attack. But
cocaine can trigger an identical sense of choking doom. We always
ask, and they always deny. And then I meet a Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, it looked as if his stroke would be transient,
as happens when the body's own system dissolves the clot in a brain
artery before permanent damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a stocky 40-year-old woman, outfitted in the
latest take-no-prisoners Wall Street fashion, came howling into the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The medics filled us in on what had happened. ``She's at her
office. Suddenly clutches her chest and keels over. She has no
heart problems, and as far as they know, doesn't smoke, drink, or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sims was out of control. It took six ER staff members to
undress her, start an iv and run an electrocardiogram, a recording
of the heart's electrical activity. A heart attack in a woman her
age _ with no other risk factors _ would be very unusual. Her ECG
wasn't giving us a clear answer, and there are many conditions that
can cause severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   My partner that day, Susan Woo, parked herself at the bedside
and shouted above the din, ``Ms. Sims, do you use cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' her patient shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important. You may be having a heart attack. To
treat you properly, we must know anything that might put you at
risk. Have you used cocaine recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I told you. No! Oh, God, the pain. Make it stop. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan ordered high doses of nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm treating her as if it's real,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``Beats me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should a healthy, young, nonsmoking woman have a heart
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, as everyone knows, is a stimulant. It achieves its
euphoric effects by prolonging chemical interactions in the tiny
gaps between nerves, or neurons, in the brain. The drug is
especially seductive because it heightens the response of the same
neurons that allow us to experience sensual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But while cocaine is best known for its mental effects, the
blood vessels take the hardest beating. Fill your system with
cocaine and you might as well drip acid in your arteries. Susan
found me a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Ms. Sims?'' she smiled ruefully. ``She ruled in for a
heart attack. It was real. And her drug screen was positive for _
guess what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Megan. Blond, plump and 22, she looked like a
rosy-cheeked poster girl for the Dutch Dairy Farmers' Guild. She
sat on a chair, eyes darting about and chest heaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan Sutherland?'' I asked, reading off the chart. ``What's
the matter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I-can't-breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chest pain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's squeezing, like a tight _ Oh, Jesus, I can't breathe _
band around my ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick exam, my concern grew. She was on the pill and had
recently had an abortion _ two predisposing factors for a pulmonary
embolus, a blood clot to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're sure,'' I repeated for the fifth time, ``no
drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana. Over a year ago. Am I going to be OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I soothed. ``But I need to take blood from your
wrist artery and see how well your lungs are getting air.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan's blood gas, the measure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in
arterial blood, was borderline normal, as was her chest X-ray.
Still, not all pulmonary emboli show up on these tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen.'' All kidding and sympathy drained from my voice.
``I'm about to send you for some very expensive, invasive, and
possibly dangerous tests. Please tell me if you use cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan eyed the distance between us. ``A couple of lines. This
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' I pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couple more after I got to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then your heart started racing? And your chest got
tight?''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your symptoms are due to the cocaine,'' I said. ``They'll wear
off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about my insurance? I just started this job. What if
they find out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is confidential. But you've got to promise me
one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she sighed, expecting the usual ``just say no''
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever, ever lie to a doctor again.''

   They came in within days of each other. Each patient was young,
well dressed and employed. The malady they shared was simple, in a
sense, but not straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 44-year-old executive. While he'd stood shaving
that morning, his right arm had gone limp, and he suddenly couldn't
speak. Panic-stricken, his wife dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods, can you understand me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Yuh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeeze my hands.'' His right hand gripped my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I said. ``Does it feel stronger than it did a
little while ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he strained to speak. ``Yuh.'' Then he shook his head,
sad and disgusted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods,'' I continued, ``I need to ask you some questions.
Have you ever used cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for a 44-year-old to have a stroke, but with no
history of hypertension or smoking, it's decidedly unusual. Unless
cocaine is involved. Mr. Woods's head trembled a bit, then he
looked me in the eye. ``Uh, hm,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time?'' I asked. ``Th-this m-morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wife walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning?'' she cried. ``John ... you said you were
clean!''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to me. ``He did the program and said he was clean.
For six months.'' She spun back to face him. ``Oh, God, you
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woods felt duped, but she is by no means alone. Doctors,
especially we emergency room doctors, pride ourselves on squeezing
the truth out of rocks. But I work in New York City; it's boom time
here, and drugs chase money.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine was such an emblem of the go-go '80s that in 1985 the
United States reported 5.7 million users. In the dozen years since,
that number has dropped by more than two-thirds, but ominous signs
of a comeback are in the wind. In 1996 we ``imported'' 240 tons of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room cares for half a dozen young professionals a
day who rush in with all the symptoms of a panic attack. But
cocaine can trigger an identical sense of choking doom. We always
ask, and they always deny. And then I meet a Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, it looked as if his stroke would be transient,
as happens when the body's own system dissolves the clot in a brain
artery before permanent damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a stocky 40-year-old woman, outfitted in the
latest take-no-prisoners Wall Street fashion, came howling into the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The medics filled us in on what had happened. ``She's at her
office. Suddenly clutches her chest and keels over. She has no
heart problems, and as far as they know, doesn't smoke, drink, or
do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sims was out of control. It took six ER staff members to
undress her, start an iv and run an electrocardiogram, a recording
of the heart's electrical activity. A heart attack in a woman her
age _ with no other risk factors _ would be very unusual. Her ECG
wasn't giving us a clear answer, and there are many conditions that
can cause severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   My partner that day, Susan Woo, parked herself at the bedside
and shouted above the din, ``Ms. Sims, do you use cocaine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' her patient shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important. You may be having a heart attack. To
treat you properly, we must know anything that might put you at
risk. Have you used cocaine recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I told you. No! Oh, God, the pain. Make it stop. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan ordered high doses of nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm treating her as if it's real,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``Beats me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should a healthy, young, nonsmoking woman have a heart
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, as everyone knows, is a stimulant. It achieves its
euphoric effects by prolonging chemical interactions in the tiny

<P>
   ``On or about April 6, 1995, the defendant James Taftsiou
purchased a Tektronix Model Phaser 540,'' says the District of New
Jersey federal grand jury indictment. This top-quality laser
printer cost him $9,000. Taftsiou also paid $6,000 for a computer
and $600 for a paper cutter. In October he bought a second paper
cutter because, he said, he'd worn out the blade on the first one.
By then he was a self-made millionaire. He was also being watched
by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   The chase began on Memorial Day weekend, when a prostitute
walked into the Atlantic City police station complaining that a man
at a local Quality Inn had paid her with phony $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Secret Service agents raided the hotel and arrested
seven limousine-riding high rollers who had arrived from New York
City. They also confiscated more than $20,000 in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Agents traced the source to Bardul Taftsiou, James' father, who
lived in Brooklyn. They began watching his house in October. On
November 18, agents followed five family members to Atlantic City.
Inside the Tropworld Casino, the Taftsious inserted fake $50 bills
into slot machines, played a few times, cashed out, and exchanged
the tokens for genuine money. Agents let the family play for more
than an hour, then arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Taftsious printed and passed an estimated $1.2
million in counterfeit bills. Their case was the largest in
Atlantic City's history to date. It also raised eyebrows over the
method used to manufacture such quantities of money. Desktop
digital printing had already shown up on the counterfeiting
horizon, but it was not yet the medium of choice for large
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, officials worried mainly about photocopiers.
Tom Ferguson, acting director for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the agency that makes U.S. currency, remembers how
``everybody in this business, in the late '70s and '80s, was seeing
huge color-copying machines. Currency people were saying, `Uh-oh,
how can we defeat them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Copiers became smaller and more widely available. And sure
enough, in 1993 the National Academy of Sciences put out a
disturbing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total value of counterfeits produced by color copiers and
printers ... has been doubling every year,'' it said. In 1990
counterfeiters produced $1 million in fake banknotes on ``office
machines''-copiers, laser printers, and ink-jet systems. ``In 1991
this doubled to $2 million, and in 1992 the amount increased to
between $6 million and $8 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of growth marks the early stages of disease
epidemics. Projecting it into the future, the report concluded that
office-machine counterfeits might cause ``severe problems for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off this threat, the Treasury Department approved the
first noticeable changes to U.S. currency in 70 years. In this
``next-generation'' design, new features that are difficult to
reproduce, such as bigger portraits and watermarks in the paper,
will appear on all large notes. The redesigned $100 bill came out
in 1996 and the $50 in 1997, but consumers don't see many of those.
The greatest shock to eyes numbed by the familiar greenback is just
arriving now, with the new $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the new look, wait a few years. Currency
experts are already thinking about the next next-generation design,
which Ferguson expects will be needed in seven to ten years.
``There's now a need for rapid change,'' he says. If you were just
starting a career in currency manufacture, ``you couldn't pick a
more exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason his business has become so lively is that more and
more ordinary citizens now have an opportunity to share the thrill
of printing money. So far this year, according to the Secret
Service, the amount of counterfeit currency successfully passed
into domestic circulation has jumped 25 percent over last year's
rate. If the trend continues, $40 million in bogus bills will be
culled from the money supply, versus $32 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fake note that anyone reports, anywhere in the
world, eventually makes its way to the Secret Service-charged since
its formation in 1865 with protecting the integrity of U.S.
currency. At Secret Service headquarters, a block from the White
House, Dennis Lynch, special agent in charge of the Counterfeit
Division, coolly interprets the 25 percent jump in counterfeits
being passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting has not been, and is not now, a significant
economic problem,'' Lynch insists. Look at it this way: the 32
million counterfeit dollars pulled out of circulation last year, if
printed in twenties, would be 1.6 million notes, or an average of
4,400 per day. Meanwhile, during an average day the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing churns out 38 million legal-tender Federal
Reserve notes. Stacked straight up, they would stand 2.6 miles
high. Counterfeiters chimed in with 19 more inches. That's
practically nothing. This year they've raised their daily share a
few more inches-a mere blip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looked at more closely, the recent rise in counterfeiting
seems ominous. That's because it represents not more of the same
but a new technology coming into play. While other office-machine
methods hold fairly steady, the rate of ink-jet counterfeiting
skyrockets. Of counterfeit notes that entered domestic circulation,
the ink-jet proportion rose from 0.5 percent in 1995 to 3 percent
in 1996 to 19 percent in 1997, and so far this year it's running 44
percent. From that perspective, the blip looks explosive.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an ink-jet printer and you can't believe it's capable
of imitating the currency you have in your wallet, your printer is
outdated. For a few hundred dollars these days, you can buy a good
color ink-jet printer that does ``nice work,'' as Ferguson admits.
``Not perfect by any means, but certainly deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   For most purposes, ``deceptive'' is good enough. Lynch guesses
that 98 percent of all phony bills that get passed fail to
reproduce key security features-no watermark, no security thread,
no color-shifting ink in the lower right corner. Usually the
counterfeiters don't even try. And such uncraftsmanlike
nonchalance, he says, highlights the most important reason these
bills get passed: ``The American public is not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts a heavy burden on police to take up the slack. In the
good old days Secret Service agents could handle the challenge,
because counterfeiters belonged to an identifiable breed. They
spent many hours making plates, ran off huge numbers of fake
hundreds, fifties, or twenties to cover their considerable time and
expense, and then had to pass all those bills without raising
suspicions. Inevitably they left a trail-purchasing or gaining
inside access to specialized equipment; recruiting others to help
pass the bills; or selling trunkloads of bogus cash at a discount
to criminals. The Secret Service could catch those guys with
standard gumshoe work.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, desktop counterfeiters don't need a bill-passing
network. Instead they print cash as needed. And they certainly
don't need specialized equipment. As Lynch knows all too well, at
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. ``The nightmare,'' he says, ``is
when the system changes from 500 counterfeit printers passing
$100,000 each to 100,000 passing $500 each. We can't be everywhere.
We can't be in everybody's basement and den.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is happening now. In 1995 there weren't many
$9,000 Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color
ink-jet printers can be bought for under $100. What's more, there
are stand-alone scanners that don't need a computer; they plug
right into an ink-jet or laser printer. Hook them together, and you
have a color copier-all for as little as $200, compared with
$40,000 in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the digital revolution, why shouldn't
policing go digital, too? Indeed, several manufacturers of color
copiers have installed chips that recognize the world's major
currency notes and block attempts to copy them. Unfortunately, such
a chip might raise costs. Another suggestion is to modify printers
to add a unique, covert mark to every piece of paper, allowing
counterfeits to be traced to particular machines. The Secret
Service is looking into all these possibilities and more. ``The
technical issue,'' Lynch says, ``is really the linchpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is also eyeing new
technical fixes. Many promising countermeasures have already been
adopted in other countries. Australia, for example, is spearheading
a push to plastic money. Printing on plastic allows designers to
add translucent effects to foil counterfeiting. And plastic would
make a suitable base for holograms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. currency experts are following those experiments with keen
interest. ``There are advantages but also disadvantages in security
with plastics,'' Ferguson says. ``We're years away from making that
decision.'' Tests show that the bureau's huge, high-speed intaglio
presses can print money on plastic stock. But then, so can ink-jet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Over its long history, counterfeiting has
continually leapfrogged preventive measures, behaving like certain
diseases-like the flu, say. Yet all epidemics eventually run their
course. New variants spread explosively at first, but finally new
defenses kick in and the rate of infection levels off.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the idea is to deter the new breed of counterfeiters
with enough technical barriers and currency changes to restore
equilibrium. Yet the printing techniques used for both
counterfeiting and genuine currency are mutating faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson says, ``It's a very interesting period.''

   ``On or about April 6, 1995, the defendant James Taftsiou
purchased a Tektronix Model Phaser 540,'' says the District of New
Jersey federal grand jury indictment. This top-quality laser
printer cost him $9,000. Taftsiou also paid $6,000 for a computer
and $600 for a paper cutter. In October he bought a second paper
cutter because, he said, he'd worn out the blade on the first one.
By then he was a self-made millionaire. He was also being watched
by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   The chase began on Memorial Day weekend, when a prostitute
walked into the Atlantic City police station complaining that a man
at a local Quality Inn had paid her with phony $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Secret Service agents raided the hotel and arrested
seven limousine-riding high rollers who had arrived from New York
City. They also confiscated more than $20,000 in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   Agents traced the source to Bardul Taftsiou, James' father, who
lived in Brooklyn. They began watching his house in October. On
November 18, agents followed five family members to Atlantic City.
Inside the Tropworld Casino, the Taftsious inserted fake $50 bills
into slot machines, played a few times, cashed out, and exchanged
the tokens for genuine money. Agents let the family play for more
than an hour, then arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Taftsious printed and passed an estimated $1.2
million in counterfeit bills. Their case was the largest in
Atlantic City's history to date. It also raised eyebrows over the
method used to manufacture such quantities of money. Desktop
digital printing had already shown up on the counterfeiting
horizon, but it was not yet the medium of choice for large
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, officials worried mainly about photocopiers.
Tom Ferguson, acting director for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the agency that makes U.S. currency, remembers how
``everybody in this business, in the late '70s and '80s, was seeing
huge color-copying machines. Currency people were saying, `Uh-oh,
how can we defeat them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Copiers became smaller and more widely available. And sure
enough, in 1993 the National Academy of Sciences put out a
disturbing report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total value of counterfeits produced by color copiers and
printers ... has been doubling every year,'' it said. In 1990
counterfeiters produced $1 million in fake banknotes on ``office
machines''-copiers, laser printers, and ink-jet systems. ``In 1991
this doubled to $2 million, and in 1992 the amount increased to
between $6 million and $8 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of growth marks the early stages of disease
epidemics. Projecting it into the future, the report concluded that
office-machine counterfeits might cause ``severe problems for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off this threat, the Treasury Department approved the
first noticeable changes to U.S. currency in 70 years. In this
``next-generation'' design, new features that are difficult to
reproduce, such as bigger portraits and watermarks in the paper,
will appear on all large notes. The redesigned $100 bill came out
in 1996 and the $50 in 1997, but consumers don't see many of those.
The greatest shock to eyes numbed by the familiar greenback is just
arriving now, with the new $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the new look, wait a few years. Currency
experts are already thinking about the next next-generation design,
which Ferguson expects will be needed in seven to ten years.
``There's now a need for rapid change,'' he says. If you were just
starting a career in currency manufacture, ``you couldn't pick a
more exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason his business has become so lively is that more and
more ordinary citizens now have an opportunity to share the thrill
of printing money. So far this year, according to the Secret
Service, the amount of counterfeit currency successfully passed
into domestic circulation has jumped 25 percent over last year's
rate. If the trend continues, $40 million in bogus bills will be
culled from the money supply, versus $32 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fake note that anyone reports, anywhere in the
world, eventually makes its way to the Secret Service-charged since
its formation in 1865 with protecting the integrity of U.S.
currency. At Secret Service headquarters, a block from the White
House, Dennis Lynch, special agent in charge of the Counterfeit
Division, coolly interprets the 25 percent jump in counterfeits
being passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting has not been, and is not now, a significant
economic problem,'' Lynch insists. Look at it this way: the 32
million counterfeit dollars pulled out of circulation last year, if
printed in twenties, would be 1.6 million notes, or an average of
4,400 per day. Meanwhile, during an average day the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing churns out 38 million legal-tender Federal
Reserve notes. Stacked straight up, they would stand 2.6 miles
high. Counterfeiters chimed in with 19 more inches. That's
practically nothing. This year they've raised their daily share a
few more inches-a mere blip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looked at more closely, the recent rise in counterfeiting
seems ominous. That's because it represents not more of the same
but a new technology coming into play. While other office-machine
methods hold fairly steady, the rate of ink-jet counterfeiting
skyrockets. Of counterfeit notes that entered domestic circulation,
the ink-jet proportion rose from 0.5 percent in 1995 to 3 percent
in 1996 to 19 percent in 1997, and so far this year it's running 44
percent. From that perspective, the blip looks explosive.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an ink-jet printer and you can't believe it's capable
of imitating the currency you have in your wallet, your printer is
outdated. For a few hundred dollars these days, you can buy a good
color ink-jet printer that does ``nice work,'' as Ferguson admits.
``Not perfect by any means, but certainly deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   For most purposes, ``deceptive'' is good enough. Lynch guesses
that 98 percent of all phony bills that get passed fail to
reproduce key security features-no watermark, no security thread,
no color-shifting ink in the lower right corner. Usually the
counterfeiters don't even try. And such uncraftsmanlike
nonchalance, he says, highlights the most important reason these
bills get passed: ``The American public is not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts a heavy burden on police to take up the slack. In the
good old days Secret Service agents could handle the challenge,
because counterfeiters belonged to an identifiable breed. They
spent many hours making plates, ran off huge numbers of fake
hundreds, fifties, or twenties to cover their considerable time and
expense, and then had to pass all those bills without raising
suspicions. Inevitably they left a trail-purchasing or gaining
inside access to specialized equipment; recruiting others to help
pass the bills; or selling trunkloads of bogus cash at a discount
to criminals. The Secret Service could catch those guys with
standard gumshoe work.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, desktop counterfeiters don't need a bill-passing
network. Instead they print cash as needed. And they certainly
don't need specialized equipment. As Lynch knows all too well, at
least 25 million ink-jet printers have been sold worldwide, and
sales show signs of accelerating. ``The nightmare,'' he says, ``is
when the system changes from 500 counterfeit printers passing
$100,000 each to 100,000 passing $500 each. We can't be everywhere.
We can't be in everybody's basement and den.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is happening now. In 1995 there weren't many
$9,000 Tektronix printers in basements and dens. Today, color
ink-jet printers can be bought for under $100. What's more, there
are stand-alone scanners that don't need a computer; they plug
right into an ink-jet or laser printer. Hook them together, and you
have a color copier-all for as little as $200, compared with
$40,000 in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no stopping the digital revolution, why shouldn't
policing go digital, too? Indeed, several manufacturers of color
copiers have installed chips that recognize the world's major
currency notes and block attempts to copy them. Unfortunately, such
a chip might raise costs. Another suggestion is to modify printers
to add a unique, covert mark to every piece of paper, allowing
counterfeits to be traced to particular machines. The Secret
Service is looking into all these possibilities and more. ``The
technical issue,'' Lynch says, ``is really the linchpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is also eyeing new
technical fixes. Many promising countermeasures have already been
adopted in other countries. Australia, for example, is spearheading
a push to plastic money. Printing on plastic allows designers to
add translucent effects to foil counterfeiting. And plastic would
make a suitable base for holograms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. currency experts are following those experiments with keen
interest. ``There are advantages but also disadvantages in security
with plastics,'' Ferguson says. ``We're years away from making that
decision.'' Tests show that the bureau's huge, high-speed intaglio
presses can print money on plastic stock. But then, so can ink-jet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Over its long history, counterfeiting has
continually leapfrogged preventive measures, behaving like certain
diseases-like the flu, say. Yet all epidemics eventually run their
course. New variants spread explosively at first, but finally new
defenses kick in and the rate of infection levels off.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the idea is to deter the new breed of counterfeiters
with enough technical barriers and currency changes to restore
equilibrium. Yet the printing techniques used for both
counterfeiting and genuine currency are mutating faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson says, ``It's a very interesting period.''

<P>
   The blind mole rat _ a fat, furry sausage of a rodent with tiny
legs and no eyes visible _ is helping evolutionary biologists
figure out how the human lost his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of biological evolution concern the acquisition
of useful traits. But evolution is also about losing traits.
</P>
<P>
   The long list of ancestral traits that were lost or reduced in
the course of human evolution includes tails, body hair and the
bony browridges over our eyes. Snakes lost their legs, and whales
lost most of their sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   The process is common enough to be unsurprising. But why would
any animal cavalierly dispense with such hard-won victories? What
evolutionary force drove their loss?
</P>
<P>
   Those turn out to be difficult questions. Darwin proposed two
alternative solutions but was unable to decide between them. One of
the explanations invokes normal wear and tear, which goes
unrepaired when a gene for a biological trait falls into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once ancestral apes were spending much of their time on the
ground, for instance, mutants with shrunken tails were at no
disadvantage, and eventually mutants whose tails were shrunk to
nothing became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The other explanation can be described as motivated wrecking for
profit. Any physiological structure occupies space in an animal's
body and costs energy to make and maintain. A mutant proto-ape that
lost its tail could have devoted the freed-up energy, protoplasm
and space to a larger brain. Hypothetically, the proto-ape got more
benefits from its newly enlarged brain than from its old lost tail.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's two competing theories would be nothing more than good
cocktail party conversation if we couldn't figure out how to test
them. To resolve this debate, we'll examine the story of a
remarkable Israeli animal that has nearly lost its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Spalax ehrenbergi resembles a muddy-colored, furry, fat sausage
about eight inches long. Once you have figured out which end is the
head (the end on which a mouth opens to show teeth that bite you),
you realize that all the rest of the head except for the mouth has
an uninterrupted covering of fur.
</P>
<P>
   But that strange appearance makes perfect sense functionally
because blind mole rats spend most of their lives in underground
tunnels, where eyes would be of even less use to them than a tail
would be to us.
</P>
<P>
   Blind mole rats are not entirely eyeless. Eyes the size of
pinheads lie concealed beneath the fur and skin of their heads.
Each eye is embedded in a thick gland; its lens is shriveled; and
it has no pupil, nor eye muscles to move or focus it. Not
surprisingly, if you flash a light at Spalax, it exhibits no
reaction whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spalax's eyes have not evolved completely out of
existence. What, if anything, is that tiny eye doing?
</P>
<P>
   Spalax exhibits photoperiodic responses _ daily and seasonal
cycles of sleep, activity, reproduction and other physiological
functions. Those responses disappear in Spalax from which the tiny
eyes have been surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently Spalax's eyes are still being used to recognize the
difference between light and dark whenever Spalax sticks its head
out of its tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   How has such drastic yet precise reduction of Spalax's eyes been
accomplished? The answer came from Israeli evolutionary biologist
Eviatar Nevo's collaborations with French scientists Howard Cooper
and Marc Herbin, who studied the microanatomy of Spalax's eyes and
brain, and his work with German scientists Reinhold Necker and Gerd
Rehkdmper, who studied brain electrophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of Spalax evolution, the original eye inherited
from sighted rodent ancestors was reconfigured very selectively.
The eye and brain structures that sighted animals use for forming
images are smaller by 90 percent to 99 percent in Spalax compared
with those of sighted rodents of the same body size.
</P>
<P>
   But the brain structure involved in controlling the
photoperiodic response is as large in Spalax as in sighted rodents.
The part of the brain cortex that in humans or sighted rats would
be devoted to vision and image formation is devoted to the body's
sense of touch in Spalax and has thereby expanded to be almost
twice as large as that of a similar-size sighted rat.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, Herbin and Nevo did some calculations to understand why
natural selection led to such a selective dismantling of the Spalax
eye. They estimated that by getting rid of most of the
image-forming part of the visual system, Spalax saves over 2
percent of its whole energy budget. This is a fantastic windfall
for Spalax: energy to convert into milk for rearing pups, into
searching for food or into tunnel construction to locate a mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason that the reduction of Spalax's
visual system produced a huge advantage: Spalax has better uses for
its brain space. Consider what other senses it needs for a life
spent in a labyrinth of unlit tunnels: an exquisite sense of touch,
a good sense of hearing and a keen sense of smell. It also has a
remarkable system of magnetic compass orientation.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple sensory modalities place a big burden on
underground rodents. Getting rid of the visual cortex and turning
its space over to the sense of touch is one way Spalax copes with
the problem of how to navigate blind without its brain becoming
even larger.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when spalax entered a dark world, its visual system
didn't just rust away. Natural selection favored mutants that
jettisoned the visual system piece by piece, depending on how
useful each part was.
</P>
<P>
   This message extracted from mole rats may resolve Darwin's
puzzle about how natural selection destroys as well as creates.
Let's take just one specific example: Why did our ancestors lose
their tails?
</P>
<P>
   The way to think of your hypothetical tails is as a
lost-opportunity cost. Ask yourself about the sacrifices that you
would have to make elsewhere in your body to free up protoplasm for
a tail. Fewer pounds of brain? Then you would revert to being a big
speechless monkey. Fewer pounds of muscle? Then you would be a
wimp, easy prey for lions. Fewer pounds of kidney? Then how do you
propose to make enough urine? No, tails are fortunately gone
forever, as far as we humans are concerned. Our ancestors didn't
use them, they did lose them, and we profited.

   The volunteers in Mark Prausnitz's experiment probably didn't
believe him when he told them they wouldn't feel a thing. After
all, he was proposing to jab 400 tiny needles into their skin. But
indeed the subjects reported feeling no pain, even though they
weren't anesthetized.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz, a chemical engineer, and Mark Allen, an electrical
engineer, both from the Georgia Institute of Technology, have
developed what they believe is a replacement, at least for some
uses, for conventional hypodermic needles: a small patch covered
with hundreds of microscopic needles that penetrate the skin
without causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   The skin's outer layer _ the stratum corneum _ is an excellent
barrier to the outside world, hence the need to poke a large needle
through it to get to the bloodstream. But Prausnitz and Allen
figured that very small needles could deliver vaccines and
medication to the tissue just below the stratum corneum. The
medications would then diffuse from the tissue into capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outer skin doesn't contain any nerve endings _ the
first extensive nerve layer is below the outermost capillaries _
the small needles wouldn't cause any pain.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz and Allen made their microneedles out of silicon, with
the same etching process used to manufacture computer chips. Their
400-needle array is a tenth of an inch on a side, and each needle
is just six-thousandths of an inch long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel something, as if you were wearing a Band-Aid,''
Prausnitz says. ``So you're aware that it's there, but it's not at
all bothersome or painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The holes left by the microneedles are much smaller than the
punctures left by conventional needles, thus lowering the risk of
infection. And since the patch is so easy to use, it could be a
boon for people, like diabetics, who have to give themselves
frequent injections.
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz thinks it wouldn't be too hard to add a microprocessor
and a pump, making a watch-size device that could release drugs
over time or even monitor blood levels of various medications and
automatically keep them stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might actually make it a watch,'' Prausnitz says. ``It
would keep track of time and keep track of the amounts that were
delivered at different times.''

   The San hunter-gatherers of southern Africa establish social
networks by exchanging gifts, often glass or ostrich-eggshell
beads, strung into a necklace or sewn onto a bag or hat.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts help secure future favors, says anthropologist Stanley
Ambrose of the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. As one
San man told a researcher to whom he gave a gift, ``It's free! It's
yours! And don't you forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, such gift giving may have been established
more than 40,000 years ago. He has found ostrich-eggshell beads of
that age in Kenya, which rank among the world's oldest ornaments
and may have given early humans in Africa an edge over their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose has been working at a rock shelter called Enkapune Ya
Muto, or Twilight Cave, in Kenya's Rift Valley. There, among
thousands of stone tools, he discovered the remains of an
ostrich-eggshell bead workshop.
</P>
<P>
   He found nearly 600 shell fragments, as well as 13 complete
beads. The finished beads have a hole drilled in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ambrose, early Africans may have used beads the way
the San do now, as a social survival mechanism in a difficult
environment. Though the climate in East Africa was generally cooler
and drier 40,000 years ago than it is now, the period was also
marked by dramatic fluctuations in climate. Social ties,
established by gift giving, would have helped people in tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a drought and you have to move, the place you're
most likely not to get turned away from is the place where you have
stored obligations and relationships,'' Ambrose says. ``It's the
original social security system.''
</P>
<P>
   Support from neighbors would have helped early humans survive
while others failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave the African people an advantage over Neanderthals, who
may not have had a symbolic mechanism for social solidarity,''
Ambrose says. ``The bottom line is, in competition between species
in an unpredictable environment, the gift is mightier than the
spear.''

   While some physicists strive to understand the subatomic
building blocks of matter, Elisha Moses occasionally pursues less
grandiose mysteries. A student recently asked Moses, who teaches at
the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, the following question:
What makes a sheet of paper flutter back and forth as it falls,
while a business card tumbles end over end?
</P>
<P>
   To tackle the problem, Moses and Andrew Belmonte of Penn State
built a quarter-inch-wide aquarium and dropped thin strips of
plastic of various weights and lengths into the water to see how
they fell. The unusual thinness of the tank reduced the falling to
essentially two dimensions, making the subtle motions of the
tumbling plastic strips much easier to study.
</P>
<P>
   Using small aluminum particles in the water to illuminate the
water currents, Moses and Belmonte were able to observe tiny
vortices that curled around the edges of the strips as they fell.
These vortices provide lift to the falling sheets, much the way air
passing over an airplane wing creates lift.
</P>
<P>
   The vortices do this by slightly decreasing the water pressure
above the sheet. The higher pressure below supports the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is small, but it's enough to lightly support a broad,
flat sheet of paper or a large dried leaf. As one side of the sheet
rises above the other, a vortex begins to form at the rising edge.
This vortex soon breaks away; another vortex then forms on the
opposite end of the sheet. This shifting of vortices may contribute
to the characteristic seesaw motion of fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   With increasingly dense or shorter strips, the rising end tips
up farther and farther. Eventually the strips begin to fall end
over end.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of sharp transition exists in all sorts of periodic
motion, even walking. There's a maximum speed a person can walk. To
go any faster, you need to start running. Walking is like
fluttering, Moses notes, and running is like tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a pendulum that swings higher and higher,'' he says.
``If you have enough momentum, it will go over the top and down the
other side.''

 &HT;    Peak International CEO Brook fired
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin's Peak International Ltd. fired its chief
executive recently, two weeks after reporting that it was the
target of a possible acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brook had been promoted to CEO in September after
serving as president and chief operating officer since 1995. He
joined the company in 1991. Jerry Mo, Peak's chief financial
officer, was named acting CEO. Mo joined Peak in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment on reasons for Brooks'
termination, citing possible litigation between the company and
Brook.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, we felt it would beneficial to terminate his
contract,'' Mo said. ``There will be a search (for a new CEO).''
</P>
<P>
   Brook could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mo said he will be on the list of candidates for the position.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Peak fell $1.25 in Nasdaq trading Wednesday to $9.50 a
share. The share price is up from its 52-week low of $6.25 on Sept.
25, but is still below the 52-week high of $25.87 1/2 reached March
30.
</P>
<P>
   Peak manufactures products to store, transport and handle
semiconductors and electronic devices. Its products dominate its
business with a 35 percent to 40 percent share of the market.
Customers include Texas Instruments Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Peak told shareholders it had received interest from
a possible buyer. Mo declined to name the company or reveal details
of a possible acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Peak, like many companies that service the semiconductor
industry, has been hit hard this year by a worldwide slump in
semiconductor sales. Sales for Peak's second quarter ended Oct. 31
dropped 15 percent to $15.3 million from $18 million in the second
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share fell to 23 cents from 37 cents per diluted
share from a year before.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who follows the
company, said that despite the slump, the offer made to buy the
company undervalued Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the fundamentals getting much worse,'' for next
year, Kumar said. ``I think (the offer) doesn't reflect the true
value of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify the company proposing to buy Peak, but
said the offer was below the company's market value. Peak's market
capitalization on Wednesday was $128.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said the acquisition offer caused friction between Brook
and Chairman T.L. Li, who has a majority voting share on the
company's board. Kumar said Brook was opposed to the deal and may
not leave the company quietly. ``It's my take that he was
instrumental in building the company,'' Kumar said. If legal action
is taken, the analyst said, ``this is gonna be like a soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Peak's corporate offices are located in Austin and Hong Kong.

 THE STORY OF `FURBY,' the MOODY FURBALL

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By SCOTT KIRSNER  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Long before NASA's robotic Pathfinder rumbled across the rocky
soil of Mars, Ray Bradbury owned the Red Planet in the popular
imagination, courtesy of ``The Martian Chronicles'' (1950).
 &HT;    His 600-plus short stories have laid claim to other worlds as
well. For example, ``The Veldt'' (1950) inspired a generation of
smart-home and virtual-reality pioneers. ``A Sound of Thunder''
(1952) illustrated chaos theory's butterfly effect years before the
theory existed.
 &HT;    And the character fireman Montag's dash for freedom, televised
by pursuing helicopters in ``Fahrenheit 451'' (1953), could easily
be on Fox-TV's fall schedule. In fact, cameras are ready to roll on
Mel Gibson's version of ``Fahrenheit 451,'' and Avon Books is
reissuing many of the 78-year-old author's titles.
 &HT;    The man who once said ``Give me an ounce of fact and I will
produce you a ton of theory by tea this afternoon'' is today also
an urban design consultant. His ideas have contributed to Disney's
Epcot and the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Here Bradbury talks about how far we've come from the future he
envisioned in the '50s.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    JOHN GEIRLAND: Describe the city of the future.
 &HT;    RAY BRADBURY: Disneyland! They've done everything right. It has
hundreds of trees and thousands of flowers we don't need, but which
they put in anyway. It has fountains and places to sit. I've
visited Disneyland 30 or 40 times over the years, and there's very
little I would change. Of course, Paris is where Walt Disney
learned all of his lessons.
 &HT;    I once called John Hench at Disney Imagineering: ``John, for
God's sake, I just noticed Viollet-le-Duc's Notre-Dame spire on the
side of Sleeping Beauty's castle.''
 &HT;    ``That's right,'' he said. ``Walt put it there.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What other lessons can we take from the City of Light?
 &HT;    A: The secret of cities is the conviviality of food. Paris has
20,000 restaurants _ if you build a city with 20,000 restaurants,
you have a social city. The United States, and especially Los
Angeles, has forgotten how to eat, how to dine. We need cities
where people can meet, shop and enjoy themselves. That's all cities
are, and all they ever will be.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You want to shut down LA's freeways. Is that practical?
 &HT;    A: We can eliminate cars and get back to public transit. I've
lived in Los Angeles 64 years and I don't have a driver's license.
Cars have destroyed cities. And the reason there's traffic on the
freeway is because the freeway is there. Freeway driving has
nothing to do with real business needs. It's an excuse for getting
out of the office.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Once the freeways are gone, you propose to build 80 plazas
throughout the LA area. What do you have in mind?
 &HT;    A: I created a blueprint for an ideal plaza _ 400 tables, a
thousand chairs in the open, all kinds of restaurants surrounding
it and theaters at the four corners: a motion picture theater, a
silent motion picture theater, a theater for dramatic presentations
and a music hall presenting all kinds of things, including
symphonies and rock. You have to have a social mix.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A lot of your work has predicted the future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, and almost everything in ``Fahrenheit 451'' has come
about, one way or the other: the influence of television, the rise
of local TV news, the neglect of education. As a result, one area
of our society is brainless. But I utilized those things in the
novel because I was trying to prevent a future, not predict one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The authorities in ``Fahrenheit 451'' also eliminated porches
to reduce social interaction. Has this come to pass?
 &HT;    A: It varies from territory to territory. I was in Omaha
recently and, my God! the size of the lawns and porches and the
feeling of community was incredible. We've been so busy building
outside the city that the city centers are falling apart. Now we're
building substitute cities, such as malls _ substitutes for what we
used to have in every downtown in America.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you change the educational system?
 &HT;    A: President Clinton says he wants to wire every schoolroom. I
say it should happen in third grade, maybe, but kindergarten
through second grade has got to educate kids to read and write,
otherwise they have no tools. Get education back on a local level
where it's controlled by teachers, parents and students. What do
governments know about education? Nothing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Somewhere in a third-grade class there is a 9 year old who
will be walking on Mars in 2020. How should we prepare that kid?
 &HT;    A: We already are _ my fellow writers and myself. Albert
Schweitzer said: Do something wonderful, people may imitate it. If
you dream the proper dreams, and share the myths with people, they
will want to grow up to be like you. All the astronauts I meet tell
me they have been influenced by me to grow up the way they did. If
you and I dream properly and creatively, then the future will be
secured. But reality will kill you unless you deal with it through
myths and metaphors. The trouble with people who write
realistically is that they want to electrocute you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What myths should we share?
 &HT;    A: Space travel is our final, greatest dream. If we can reach
the nearest solar system, then we can live for an extra million
years. But ultimately, the particular myth is not important _ it's
how to fall and stay in love. Teach students to be in love with
life, to love their work, to create at the top of their lungs. I
love what I'm doing and started loving it when I was 12. Find
something to love when you're young. Archeology, mythology,
Egyptology, even computerology. Then you can change the future.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Are PCs and the Internet making the future friendlier for
community?
 &HT;    A: No, you've got to make personal contact. Go to the library
and build a network of personal friends, a half dozen or so, as
I've done over the years with other writers. Stop talking on the
telephone, stop talking on the stupid Internet. It's a waste of
time.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So, no Internet, no computer, not even a driver's license. Is
the modern world passing you by?
 &HT;    A: You don't miss what you've never had. If people talk about
sex when you're 12 years old, you don't know what they're talking
about. I don't know what people are talking about when they talk
about driving. I grew up with roller skates, a bicycle, using the
trolley and bus lines until they went out of existence. No, you
don't miss things.
 &HT;    Put me in a room with a pad and a pencil and set me up against
100 people with 100 computers. I'll outcreate (everyone) in the
room.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Within months, a simple, single tower will rise up on the edge
of Australia's vast central desert, inaugurating an era of space
access in which launching payloads to low Earth orbit could be as
easy as booking a night flight to New York.
 &HT;    Kistler Aerospace, headquartered in Kirkland, Wash., is the
company behind the project. Using one of the finest collections of
post-Apollo space engineering talent ever assembled, Kistler wants
to upend our whole approach to getting to space and transform this
scrubby Mad Max desert into an active spaceport.
 &HT;    Its vehicle: a rocket that returns to Earth using parachutes and
airbags, ready for relaunch within days.
 &HT;    If Kistler succeeds, it will be the first in a group of
companies dubbed the Four Musketeers to realize the vision of
reusable space transport.
 &HT;    By introducing airline-type efficiencies to the business of
launching private rockets into space, these new companies aim to
reduce the cost of a typical satellite launch to $1,000 per pound,
down from the current $5,000 to $10,000. Kelly Space &AMP; Technology,
Pioneer Rocketplane, Rotary Rocket and Kistler Aerospace plan to
toss away a decades-old Cold War legacy of government space
monopoly and instead launch private rockets that can be rapidly
refueled and reflown.
 &HT;    In this way, telecommunications, transportation, medicine, even
tourism could be dramatically transformed.
 &HT;    ``If the future holds infinite possibilities for man's presence
in space, transportation is one thing that has to happen,'' says
Mike Kelly, cofounder of Kelly Space &AMP; Technology.
 &HT;    Nearly 1,700 payloads worth $121 billion will need a ride to
space over the next 10 years, according to estimates by the Teal
Group, a defense and aerospace market-analysis firm. Since the
launch industry has never before seen such demand, the anticipated
bonanza is pulling in everyone from NASA lifetime employees to
writer Tom Clancy, who has invested $1 million in Rotary Rocket.
 &HT;    Seventy percent of the payloads will be commercial
communications satellites, most of them in low Earth orbit, or LEO.
Constellations of these satellites will let you travel around the
entire world with one phone number. They'll make pagers beep in
even the most bucolic of rural settings. They'll render high-speed
Internet access more pervasive than ever thought possible.
 &HT;    Taken together, these satellite families will transform the
night sky, effectively turning the orbits into foundations as solid
as city streets for the building of new industries based in space.
 &HT;    Last year, 77 commercial payloads were carried to space
worldwide, tripling the number seen the year before and
outnumbering military and civil-government payloads for the first
time. The quicker these new constellations get deployed and the
more rapidly and cheaply they can be serviced, the faster the
prices of new paging, mobile-phone and Internet services will fall.
 &HT;    And as prices fall, all kinds of other space-based products,
ranging from increasingly sophisticated car-navigation systems to
remote telemedicine, are sure to emerge.
 &HT;    The reduced gravity of orbit could result in new materials
processes, while reusable rockets could deliver packages more
quickly than overnight services by climbing to orbit and dropping
down half a world away in just a few hours.
 &HT;    Many imagine space tourism as a big earner, and one company is
already delivering cremated remains to low Earth orbit for
``burial.''
 &HT;    Iridium, the world's first pan-national corporation _ that is, a
global partnership _ will begin its global telephone service in
late September, and has set the stage for the coming revolution in
space commerce. Although launched on conventional, expendable
boosters, its 485-mile-high, 66-satellite constellation has shown
that giant space-infrastructure projects could be completed at a
speed and budget once considered impossibly tight.
 &HT;    Hot on Iridium's heels is Globalstar, a system of 48 satellites
870 miles high, which is expected to be operational next year.
Other constellation builders include ICO Global Communications,
which is aiming for a first launch to the slightly higher medium
Earth orbit (MEO) before year's end.
 &HT;    Next come what sound like a forgotten Homeric trilogy: Ellipso,
Constellation and Odyssey; each plans initial launches for the year
2000.
 &HT;    Once these constellations are in place, replacements will be
needed regularly as satellites burn out and break down. Late last
year Motorola, already a big buyer of launch services as it builds
Iridium, told launch-service providers it may put up 500 or more
birds by 2010.
 &HT;    These ``big LEOs'' will be joined by ``little LEOs'' that will
soar about 500 to 1,500 miles above Earth (commercial airplanes fly
at an altitude of about 5 miles) and perform highly specific
functions such as reading water meters from space, offering
advanced two-way paging, and tracking fishing vessels on the high
seas. The master of this domain is Orbcomm Global, a Dulles, Va.,
company well on its way to completing a 28-satellite system for
industrial monitoring and two-way paging.
 &HT;    Around 2001, deployment will start for ultrasophisticated
high-bandwidth constellations known as ``broadband LEOs'' that will
make high-speed connectivity _ for videoconferencing and Internet
services, among other activities _ available just about anywhere in
the world.
 &HT;    In this category are Motorola's Celestri, with 63 functioning
satellites; Alcatel Espace's Skybridge, with 64; and the big kahuna
of them all, Teledesic, now at 288.
 &HT;    Until now, most LEOs have gone skyward on heavy booster rockets
capable of carrying several satellites into orbit at once. These
expendable and expensive ballistic workhorses _ with heroic names
such as Delta, Proton and Long March _ are highly impractical for
the kinds of one-by-one replacements the new communications systems
will require.
 &HT;    Recognizing that every large edifice requires a maintenance
staff, Kistler and the other companies _ dubbed the Musketeers _
aim to be the lightbulb changers of space.
 &HT;    For 80-year-old George Mueller, the success of a reusable rocket
would mark a final transition from Cold War technologist to
commercial businessman. Formerly head of NASA's Apollo project and
considered the father of the space shuttle, he's now Kistler's CEO.
 &HT;    Mueller, whose space career blasted off in 1961 when President
John F. Kennedy started the race to the Moon, eventually left the
agency to grow jojoba in Arizona. He was drawn out of retirement by
Kistler to realize a long-held dream denied by the government.
 &HT;    ``I had wanted to design the shuttle to be fully reusable,''
Mueller says. ``This position enables me to accomplish that.''
 &HT;    Mueller's new line of work was made possible in 1984, when the
U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act to encourage
private companies to join the industry.
 &HT;    Momentum picked up after the 1986 Challenger explosion caused an
effective ban on commercial payloads aboard the remaining shuttles,
leading to a bottleneck that persists to this day. And post-Cold
War reductions in military spending meant increased access for
entrepreneurs to U.S. military facilities, not to mention an excess
supply of aeronautical engineers.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, some of these nascent commercial space
operations have set up shop in old government haunts _ including
Vandenberg Air Force Base and the shuttered Norton Air Force Base,
now renamed the San Bernardino International Airport. Others have
located elsewhere _ the California-Nevada desert, for example.
 &HT;    While the reliability rate of U.S.-based launches in 1997 was
97.4 percent, the remaining 2.6 percent represents a set of
devastating possibilities. So, for its gamble, Kistler believes
there's no better place than Australia, a country that joined the
space fraternity in 1967, when an atmospheric-testing satellite
launched atop a Redstone rocket made it the fourth country to orbit
a satellite, behind the United States, the Soviet Union and France.
 &HT;    ``Australia has a large footprint of flat land, and almost no
population,'' says Robert Wang, Kistler's chair. ``It's a lot safer
to launch from there.''
 &HT;    The challenges Kistler faces remind George Mueller of NASA's
gung-ho days, but he also sees the distinctions.
 &HT;    ``Now, while the schedule is just as intense, you also have
shareholders to worry about,'' he says.
 &HT;    Through private placements, Kistler has raised $300 million and
will seek more to carry it through the testing phase and into
commercial service in late 1999. The company's technology utilizes
a K-1 rocket that will shoot to 135,000 feet, where a second stage
will separate from the first and carry a payload to low Earth
orbit. Navigational systems will then guide both stages back to the
launch area.
 &HT;    Assuming test flights go well, Kistler plans to deliver a
commercial satellite for Space Systems/Loral late next year,
marking the first of a 10-launch, $100 million contract. This,
Kistler is sure, is only the beginning.
 &HT;    Others are equally confident. Revenues in the global space
industry could rise 20 percent annually for years to come, says
John Higginbotham, chair of SpaceVest, a Reston, Va., venture firm
dedicated to space investments.
 &HT;    ``In some ways the space industry in 1998 is where the
automobile industry was in 1938,'' Higginbotham says. ``If you look
at where the space industry can be in 2048, it could be a major
sector of the global economy, equal to health care or the auto
industry today.''
 &HT;    He sees profitable new products emerging from the space
business.
 &HT;    For Higginbotham, it's uncertain how many independent launch
companies the space industry can support. Competition may emerge
from a privatized U.S. space shuttle and from low-cost launch
services from China and Russia, both of which use expendable
rockets.
 &HT;    NASA is also working with Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences
on two aerospace plane projects dubbed the X-33 and X-34, intended
primarily to test new engine and materials technologies for a
single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.
 &HT;    While Kistler is developing technology that returns rockets to
Earth on parachutes and airbags, other outfits are eliminating the
launchpad itself.
 &HT;    One of them is Kelly Space &AMP; Technology, which is camped out in
the suburban confines of San Bernardino, Calif. Using a modified
commercial jet, Kelly plans to tow an aerospace plane to 20,000
feet, where it will detach and rocket up to 400,000 feet. From
there, an expendable stage will carry a payload to orbit, while the
piloted aerospace plane returns to Earth, landing, like a
commercial jet, on a runway.
 &HT;    If there's a malfunction at 20,000 feet, Kelly's space vehicle
can return to Earth as a glider. The company has been testing the
system in the California desert, and hopes to carry commercial
payloads next year.
 &HT;    Musketeer No. 3 is Pioneer Rocketplane, a start-up venture
located at Vandenberg Air Force Base, just north of Santa Barbara,
Calif. Pioneer is fusing aircraft and rocket into one in an
airplane-like space vehicle that takes off from a commercial runway
with a payload inside. At 20,000 feet, the vehicle meets up with a
tanker plane, which loads an oxidizer. The rocket plane then blasts
into orbit and releases an additional stage, which carries the
payload to its destination and later disintegrates in the
atmosphere. Meanwhile, the pilots return the rocket plane to
Vandenberg.
 &HT;    The vehicle is still in development, but it could take flight by
2000, says Mitchell Burnside Clapp, Pioneer's president and
cofounder. The company estimates its total development costs at
$100 to $200 million, with first revenue expected by 2001.
 &HT;    ``We'll be looking for replenishment business from Iridium,
Globalstar, and, of course, the Teledesic deployment,'' Clapp says.
``There's going to be no shortage of market.''
 &HT;    Rotary Rocket is taking an equally bold step. The Redwood
Shores, Calif., enterprise plans to use a piloted rocket on the way
up to low Earth orbit and a unique set of helicopter-type rotors to
return to Earth, requiring little in the way of ground
infrastructure. The system remains in the design phase, with tests
at California's Mojave Airport scheduled for next year.
 &HT;    Among those watching Rotary keenly is novelist Clancy, an
acknowledged space buff who invested in the venture after meeting
its president, Gary C. Hudson. Hudson has been plying the
commercial launch market without a launch for some 20 years.
 &HT;    So far, Rotary has raised $17 million of private capital, and it
hopes to raise another $30 million through a private equity
placement. All told, the company needs about $100 million to get a
small fleet operational and start bringing in revenue.
 &HT;    Like Pioneer, Rotary has no contracts yet, but it believes the
LEO-replacement market will provide ready bookings.
 &HT;    It was Hughes who dubbed his firm and its three major
competitors the Four Musketeers, and he thinks there's room in the
market for even more players, all offering somewhat differentiated
services and products.
 &HT;    ``There are other companies, though most of them are still
garage operations,'' he says. ``We distinctly remember when we were
a garage operation, so we don't dismiss them.''
 &HT;    Many of these more futuristic companies are focusing on tourism,
with initial launches expected in 2001 or later. Conceivably, for a
ticket costing about $90,000, you could hop a flight to suborbital
altitude for a quick dose of weightlessness, a view of Earth's
curvature, and a peek into the blackness of space.
 &HT;    While the success or failure of these individual firms may not
be known for a few more years, the early activity is already making
for crowded conditions at established launch sites.
 &HT;    Besides Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg, a site on Wallops Island,
in Virginia, has been licensed by the FAA for commercial launches.
New Mexico and Alaska are also looking to provide launch
operations, along with a site in Manitoba, Canada.
 &HT;    In Australia, other groups of entrepreneurs also are evaluating
launch sites. One has studied the Northern Territory, focusing on
Christmas Island, an atoll in the Indian Ocean that offers open
seas for flight corridors to the south.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Within months, a simple, single tower will rise up on the edge
of Australia's vast central desert, inaugurating an era of space
access in which launching payloads to low Earth orbit could be as
easy as booking a night flight to New York.
 &HT;    Kistler Aerospace, headquartered in Kirkland, Wash., is the
company behind the project. Using one of the finest collections of
post-Apollo space engineering talent ever assembled, Kistler wants
to upend our whole approach to getting to space and transform this
scrubby Mad Max desert into an active spaceport.
 &HT;    Its vehicle: a rocket that returns to Earth using parachutes and
airbags, ready for relaunch within days.
 &HT;    If Kistler succeeds, it will be the first in a group of
companies dubbed the Four Musketeers to realize the vision of
reusable space transport.
 &HT;    By introducing airline-type efficiencies to the business of
launching private rockets into space, these new companies aim to
reduce the cost of a typical satellite launch to $1,000 per pound,
down from the current $5,000 to $10,000. Kelly Space &AMP; Technology,
Pioneer Rocketplane, Rotary Rocket and Kistler Aerospace plan to
toss away a decades-old Cold War legacy of government space
monopoly and instead launch private rockets that can be rapidly
refueled and reflown.
 &HT;    In this way, telecommunications, transportation, medicine, even
tourism could be dramatically transformed.
 &HT;    ``If the future holds infinite possibilities for man's presence
in space, transportation is one thing that has to happen,'' says
Mike Kelly, cofounder of Kelly Space &AMP; Technology.
 &HT;    Nearly 1,700 payloads worth $121 billion will need a ride to
space over the next 10 years, according to estimates by the Teal
Group, a defense and aerospace market-analysis firm. Since the
launch industry has never before seen such demand, the anticipated
bonanza is pulling in everyone from NASA lifetime employees to
writer Tom Clancy, who has invested $1 million in Rotary Rocket.
 &HT;    Seventy percent of the payloads will be commercial
communications satellites, most of them in low Earth orbit, or LEO.
Constellations of these satellites will let you travel around the
entire world with one phone number. They'll make pagers beep in
even the most bucolic of rural settings. They'll render high-speed
Internet access more pervasive than ever thought possible.
 &HT;    Taken together, these satellite families will transform the
night sky, effectively turning the orbits into foundations as solid
as city streets for the building of new industries based in space.
 &HT;    Last year, 77 commercial payloads were carried to space
worldwide, tripling the number seen the year before and
outnumbering military and civil-government payloads for the first
time. The quicker these new constellations get deployed and the
more rapidly and cheaply they can be serviced, the faster the
prices of new paging, mobile-phone and Internet services will fall.
 &HT;    And as prices fall, all kinds of other space-based products,
ranging from increasingly sophisticated car-navigation systems to
remote telemedicine, are sure to emerge.
 &HT;    The reduced gravity of orbit could result in new materials
processes, while reusable rockets could deliver packages more
quickly than overnight services by climbing to orbit and dropping
down half a world away in just a few hours.
 &HT;    Many imagine space tourism as a big earner, and one company is
already delivering cremated remains to low Earth orbit for
``burial.''
 &HT;    Iridium, the world's first pan-national corporation _ that is, a
global partnership _ will begin its global telephone service in
late September, and has set the stage for the coming revolution in
space commerce. Although launched on conventional, expendable
boosters, its 485-mile-high, 66-satellite constellation has shown
that giant space-infrastructure projects could be completed at a
speed and budget once considered impossibly tight.
 &HT;    Hot on Iridium's heels is Globalstar, a system of 48 satellites
870 miles high, which is expected to be operational next year.
Other constellation builders include ICO Global Communications,
which is aiming for a first launch to the slightly higher medium
Earth orbit (MEO) before year's end.
 &HT;    Next come what sound like a forgotten Homeric trilogy: Ellipso,
Constellation and Odyssey; each plans initial launches for the year
2000.
 &HT;    Once these constellations are in place, replacements will be
needed regularly as satellites burn out and break down. Late last
year Motorola, already a big buyer of launch services as it builds
Iridium, told launch-service providers it may put up 500 or more
birds by 2010.
 &HT;    These ``big LEOs'' will be joined by ``little LEOs'' that will
soar about 500 to 1,500 miles above Earth (commercial airplanes fly
at an altitude of about 5 miles) and perform highly specific
functions such as reading water meters from space, offering
advanced two-way paging, and tracking fishing vessels on the high
seas. The master of this domain is Orbcomm Global, a Dulles, Va.,
company well on its way to completing a 28-satellite system for
industrial monitoring and two-way paging.
 &HT;    Around 2001, deployment will start for ultrasophisticated
high-bandwidth constellations known as ``broadband LEOs'' that will
make high-speed connectivity _ for videoconferencing and Internet
services, among other activities _ available just about anywhere in
the world.
 &HT;    In this category are Motorola's Celestri, with 63 functioning
satellites; Alcatel Espace's Skybridge, with 64; and the big kahuna
of them all, Teledesic, now at 288.
 &HT;    Until now, most LEOs have gone skyward on heavy booster rockets
capable of carrying several satellites into orbit at once. These
expendable and expensive ballistic workhorses _ with heroic names
such as Delta, Proton and Long March _ are highly impractical for
the kinds of one-by-one replacements the new communications systems
will require.
 &HT;    Recognizing that every large edifice requires a maintenance
staff, Kistler and the other companies _ dubbed the Musketeers _
aim to be the lightbulb changers of space.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A three-ring impeachment circus
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House impeachment hearings are vacillating between farce and
slow-motion attempted coup.
</P>
<P>
   For farce, there was the Judiciary Committee's vote to expand
its inquiry into fund-raising for the Clinton re-election _ on the
day when Federal Elections Commission auditors recommended record
paybacks from both the Clinton and the Dole campaigns for similar
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   As coup, the same party-line vote to expand the impeachment
scope enlists the committee in the ceaseless effort of Clinton's
political opponents _ for which read, mainly, Clinton-haters _
first to find any excuse to undo the president's election and, when
that failed, then to unravel his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's dip into campaign funding continues the
one-sided political show trials the GOP has been staging for two
years in a series of congressional hearings. It would be one thing
if the investigations were aimed at reforming the corrupting
influence of outsized special-interest money and the grubbing for
it that begrime our politics, but the GOP leadership has made it
emphatically plain it wants no part of changing the system, which
bankrolls Republicans far more generously than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the game has been to use Democratic excesses _ more
egregious than Republican ones in '96 but not different in kind _
as merely a means to partisan ends. Now the impeachment panel, too,
is putting its shoulder to that mired wheel, in hopes of getting
the tumbrel rolling toward the guillotine again.
</P>
<P>
   And all this atop the Red Queen parody of jurisprudence that
marked the committee's Starr-struck thralldom to the report and the
testimony of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has produced no corroborative evidence or
questioned any key witnesses itself. It has heard no rebuttal
witnesses. Its majority is apparently prepared to vote for
impeachment solely on the word of prosecutor Kenneth Starr and on
his at-points tendentious reading of the record _ and never mind
that Starr himself has his information second-hand from assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans pretend special outrage that in response to the
81 loaded questions they asked him, Clinton dared to continue
dodging and weaving, defending himself especially against a
possible post-presidency indictment for perjury. Like Starr, the
majority reads Clinton's failure to confess as an obstruction of
justice. Any Soviet court would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   With House Speaker Newt Gingrich fading from command like
yesterday's bugle call and Speaker-designate Robert Livingston
apparently reluctant to have his fingerprints either on impeachment
or its failure, the Judiciary Committee increasingly looks panicky,
unfocused, disorganized and daily more at the mercy of its
anti-Clinton ultras.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Henry Hyde is presiding over one after another
on-camera meltdown as committee members _ when they bother to show
up, that is _ trade insults, hurl accusations at one another and
act out in ways that would exasperate a kindergarten teacher. What
we have here is impeachment as the Jerry Springer show. Without the
ratings.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Baseball shows its ugliness again
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 6, 1998.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the New York Yankees
did their things this past summer and fall, they gave back to the
game of baseball a soul that has been lacking for some years.
Several weeks later, baseball showed that soul was only temporary;
that it's still a giant, nasty business not beyond the rawest of
moves to reach its goals.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem only minor that baseball took away the 2000 All-Star
game from South Florida and awarded it to Atlanta. But beneath it
lies something that should concern any city with a major league
team, or one hoping to get one.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire owners, awash in the flush of network and cable TV
money, rarely reach into their pockets to pay for their own
facilities. Some steal out of town in the middle of the night
(Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns) to relocate their franchises to
cities hungry enough for a team to mortgage their treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Others take the issues to the voters and, in efforts to convince
a wary electorate, use creative threats to reach their goals. Among
those was the recently concluded issue in Denver, where the Super
Bowl champion Broncos of the NFL sought a new stadium to replace
the one that is sold out week after week after week.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign to gain public favor for a new stadium, it
became ``news'' that if the stadium issue was not approved, a
wealthy Houston businessman was interested in buying the team and
moving it to Houston, which recently lost its team to Nashville _
or is it Memphis?
</P>
<P>
   I always thought it a ruse. The fact that the Broncos had just
won the Super Bowl and were undefeated at the time of the vote on
Nov. 6 played the more significant role in getting overwhelming
voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, where the Marlins won a World Series
championship in 1997, then auctioned off its players the following
year _ thereby creating one of the worst teams in baseball history
_ existing owner Wayne Huizenga knew he could not get the public to
spend for yet another stadium. He already had gone to the public
treasury to build a new arena for his NHL team, while a short hop
down the road, another wealthy owner, Micky Arison of the NBA's
Miami Heat, did the same with a basketball arena being constructed
in downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga said he was selling the Marlins because he didn't think
he could get a new stadium built. He was right. Over a period of
testy negotiations, Huizenga reached an understanding with
commodities broker John W. Henry for sale of the team for $158
million. (There are some who still doubt that Huizenga actually
will complete the deal.) Henry, of course, says he, like Huizenga,
needs a new stadium, most of it with public money, so he can have
some left to buy better players _ and pay them $10 million a year
to maybe hit .275.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the millennium year 2000 All-Star game,
awarded in 1995 to South Florida. Without warning, Major League
Baseball last week yanked the game from South Florida, explaining
that it had to do with the uncertainty of the franchise ownership
and the fact that baseball likes to reward cities with new
stadiums, Atlanta among them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no such condition was put down when the game
originally was awarded to South Florida, and the entire argument
seems a bit balmy when you realize the 1999 All-Star game is being
played in Boston's Fenway Park, built three-quarters of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind this is pressure by baseball and its owners to get
the people of South Florida to again pass the hat for millionaires.
When a new stadium is built, baseball told South Florida, they'll
get an All-Star game there as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sports, even down at the collegiate level, has become a cold,
ruthless business. Baseball just reneged on about $45 million worth
of All-Star business to a community that is now expected to
genuflect and respond to the fictional ``Field of Dreams'' request:
``Build it and we will come.''
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, I doubt there will be an All-Star game in South
Florida in the next millennium, either.

   December can be a frustrating month for those who want to
proclaim the joy of science along with the joy of the season. It
can be especially difficult for parents looking for gifts to please
their little ones. What follows are some of the best toys on the
market for the up-and-coming scientists in your family.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; YEAR OF THE ROBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year NASA's Sojourner robot caught the world's attention as
it trolled across the Martian landscape, sniffing alien rocks and
radioing back information about their composition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the intrepid rover at work not only gave us a new
sense of Mars _ they also conveyed a powerful message about how
robots are extending the reach of human exploration, and human
imagination, to other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, robots are well represented among the
science-themed toys this season.
</P>
<P>
   By far the year's most radical new toy _ if it can in fact be
called a toy _ is lego's Mindstorms ($200, LEGO, 800-453-4652,
www.legomindstorms.com). This kit, the product of a lengthy
collaboration with MIT's Media Lab, lets aspiring roboticists (age
12 to very adult) build and program their own mechanical creations.
</P>
<P>
   Commands for the robot are written on a personal computer using
lego's custom-designed software. It assumes no previous programming
experience and incorporates a reassuring tutorial to guide novices
through the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than writing actual lines of computer code, you string
together graphic blocks, each representing a single instruction for
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you download the program to the robot's
onboard microprocessor using an infrared transmitter, and it's
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The kit provides instructions for 12 projects, such as an
intruder alarm and a trail tracker. Two expansion packs, $50 each,
that will allow the construction of more complicated robots should
be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Mindstorms to be all plug and play. The print and
computer guides give you extensive help; further advice is
available on the company's Web site. But LEGO wants you to use your
brain and figure things out on your own.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored following NASA's lead, you can snap together
the intricately molded Robotix parts into a mechanical brute of
your own design.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DYNAMICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Draganfly Innovations has brought to our
planet the Remote Controlled Flying Saucer ($87, 800-979-9794). The
saucer is a two-foot-wide silver Mylar balloon that must be filled
with helium. A dual-fan propulsion unit and ballast putty attach to
the balloon's underside.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control, you can make the saucer turn, go
forward, and ascend and descend (a breeze could quickly whisk it
away, so this toy must stay indoors).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UPDATING THE CLASSICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some seemingly immortal toys have recently taken on new guises.
Take the Frisbee, whose simple shape might seem immune to
modernizing. Guess again. Chuck Hoberman, the man who brought you
the expandable Hoberman sphere, now unveils the Pocket Flight Ring
($9.95, Hoberman Designs, 212-647-7656, www.hoberman.com/fold/).
</P>
<P>
   Folded, it is about the diameter of a compact disc and does in
fact fit into a large pants pocket; open it and it more than
doubles in size. Then pop it flat and _ voila _ you've got a decent
throwing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Does your kid have what it takes to strike out the likes of
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire? He or she can find out by winding up
with the Radar Ball ($39, Rawlings, 800-729-5464,
www.rawlings.com), a softball with an electronic brain.
</P>
<P>
   A radar gun buried inside the ball measures the speed of a pitch
and indicates the results on a tiny built-in lcd screen. Serious
pitches are required to activate the circuitry, and beware: the
Radar Ball is designed for pitching only, not hitting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO BATTERIES REQUIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-energy toys eliminate the dreary holiday ritual of
running to the store to find batteries for the idle gadgets lying
amid the wrapping paper. They can also address more serious issues.
Trevor Baylis, a British inventor, hit on the idea of a windup
radio to improve communications in parts of Africa where
electricity and batteries are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Freeplay radio ($79.95, BayGen, 914-258-5660,
www.freeplay.net) is built in a South African factory that employs
disabled persons. A full crank provides about one hour of playing
time. Outdoors, a solar panel molded into the radio's case
generates supplemental power. A single large speaker produces fine
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to do without batteries is to make your own. The
Fruit Powered Clock ($13, Schylling, 800-541-2929,
www.schylling.com) and the Two Potato Clock ($17.95, Skilcraft,
available through Edmund Scientific, 800-728-6999) use copper and
zinc electrodes to transform various fruits and vegetables into
low-voltage power supplies, sufficient to run these small LCD
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruit Powered Clock has the more dramatic look and comes
with a proper scientific explanation of how it works. The Two
Potato Clock, on the other hand, is a more reliable timepiece in
our experience, and less likely to deposit bits of rotting apple on
your coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Happy shopping!

</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored following NASA's lead, you can snap together
the intricately molded Robotix parts into a mechanical brute of
your own design.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DYNAMICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Draganfly Innovations has brought to our
planet the Remote Controlled Flying Saucer ($87, 800-979-9794). The
saucer is a two-foot-wide silver Mylar balloon that must be filled
with helium. A dual-fan propulsion unit and ballast putty attach to
the balloon's underside.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control, you can make the saucer turn, go
forward, and ascend and descend (a breeze could quickly whisk it
away, so this toy must stay indoors).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UPDATING THE CLASSICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some seemingly immortal toys have recently taken on new guises.
Take the Frisbee, whose simple shape might seem immune to
modernizing. Guess again. Chuck Hoberman, the man who brought you
the expandable Hoberman sphere, now unveils the Pocket Flight Ring
($9.95, Hoberman Designs, 212-647-7656, www.hoberman.com/fold/).
</P>
<P>
   Folded, it is about the diameter of a compact disc and does in
fact fit into a large pants pocket; open it and it more than
doubles in size. Then pop it flat and _ voila _ you've got a decent
throwing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Does your kid have what it takes to strike out the likes of
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire? He or she can find out by winding up
with the Radar Ball ($39, Rawlings, 800-729-5464,
www.rawlings.com), a softball with an electronic brain.
</P>
<P>
   A radar gun buried inside the ball measures the speed of a pitch
and indicates the results on a tiny built-in lcd screen. Serious
pitches are required to activate the circuitry, and beware: the
Radar Ball is designed for pitching only, not hitting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO BATTERIES REQUIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-energy toys eliminate the dreary holiday ritual of
running to the store to find batteries for the idle gadgets lying
amid the wrapping paper. They can also address more serious issues.
Trevor Baylis, a British inventor, hit on the idea of a windup
radio to improve communications in parts of Africa where
electricity and batteries are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Freeplay radio ($79.95, BayGen, 914-258-5660,
www.freeplay.net) is built in a South African factory that employs
disabled persons. A full crank provides about one hour of playing
time. Outdoors, a solar panel molded into the radio's case
generates supplemental power. A single large speaker produces fine
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to do without batteries is to make your own. The
Fruit Powered Clock ($13, Schylling, 800-541-2929,
www.schylling.com) and the Two Potato Clock ($17.95, Skilcraft,
available through Edmund Scientific, 800-728-6999) use copper and
zinc electrodes to transform various fruits and vegetables into
low-voltage power supplies, sufficient to run these small LCD
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruit Powered Clock has the more dramatic look and comes
with a proper scientific explanation of how it works. The Two
Potato Clock, on the other hand, is a more reliable timepiece in
our experience, and less likely to deposit bits of rotting apple on
your coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Happy shopping!

FURBY DECONSTRUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZA TRUITT 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a brief sordid history of toys-of-the-year:
</P>
<P>
   Fisticuffs have erupted over Cabbage Patch Kids; Tickle-Me-Elmos
have been stockpiled and scalped for bank-breaking prices; Beanie
Baby counterfeiters have taken rubes to the cleaners; and this
year's toy-of-the-year--Furby--is already sold out of several
chains and is being auctioned off on eBay for up to $200 apiece
</P>
<P>
   The doll looks more like a Gremlin than a Galatea--furry, big
ears, big eyes, no neck. The source of its appeal, however, is
Galatea-like: You teach, it learns. It has a motor, internal
speakers, a computer chip, a light sensor, a sound sensor, and
touch sensors, so in addition to old-hat tricks like blinking and
``dancing,'' Furby knows whether you're in the room and will talk,
sing, and generally act cute. But most importantly, Furby responds
to Pavlovian conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   When you first get the Furby, for instance, you can tickle its
stomach and it may or may not give you a kiss. If it kisses you and
you immediately pat it on the back, you increase the likelihood of
it kissing you next time you tickle its tummy.
</P>
<P>
   Furbys also have their own language, Furbish, ``which is heavily
influenced by the languages of Thai, Chinese, Mandarin, and
Hebrew.'' Over time, your Furby will abandon Furbish and begin to
``learn'' English (actually, it doesn't really learn--it's just
programmed to begin speaking more English words after a while).
</P>
<P>
   The Furby can even communicate with and ``teach'' other Furbys
tricks and songs by means of infrared signals similar to the ones
in a TV remote control device. If one Furby sings a lullaby, the
other will fall asleep and snore. If you play music, the Furbys
will dance together.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very cool from an adult's perspective. From the
child's perspective, though, the Furby has drawbacks, such as:
</P>
<P>
   The Carapace Issue. In order to protect the various motors,
there has to be a rigid plastic shell under the fur, which makes
the thing hard to hug. Although press materials call it a ``cuddly
standalone animatronic pet,'' in my book, ``animatronic'' cancels
out ``cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Work Issue. Who wants to train a toy to kiss you, when every
kid knows that a regular stuffed animal kisses you every time you
touch its plastic nose to your cheek?
</P>
<P>
   The Breakability Issue. The delicate plastic ear bones are just
begging to be snapped, and the toy's many cool functions spark
curiosity about how it all works. In order to satisfy that
curiosity, you have to skin Furby and crack open the internal
plastic shell. Another way to see Furby's innards is to check out
the exquisite Furby Autopsy Home Page .
</P>
<P>
   The Grown-Up vs. Kids Issue. As soon as you read that Furby's
unique language is ``heavily influenced by the languages of Thai,
Chinese, Mandarin, and Hebrew,'' you know that this is a toy that
parents will like more than kids. Same goes for all the tricks
Furby learns that are cool in concept--but boring after about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Is your child too young for a Furby? Will it create more
frustration and heartbreak than happiness? Is $30 retail (or up to
$200 online) too much for what you get? Do you want a furry
animatronic pet that burps (and worse) after you ``feed'' it by
pushing down on its tongue? These questions are all worth
considering before you join in on a Furby auction, break into a
cold sweat over the grim warning on Furby fan pages: ``WAL-MART NOW
OUT OF FURBYS!!!!!,'' or smuggle a stun-gun into Toys-R-Us to
disable the competition.

BOEING GOING WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers in cyclical industries are used to uncertainty when it
comes to their jobs. But there weren't any Boeing workers who were
prepared for the company's announcement yesterday that it would be
cutting another 28,000 jobs, bringing total layoffs announced this
year to 50,000. And while in part these cutbacks represent an
aggressive response to a sharp falloff in demand from Asia, they're
also the result of a failure of management--production-line
inefficiencies, mismanaged capacity, and poor forecasting. Boeing
needs a new approach, and job-cutting alone isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has, after all, only one competitor--Airbus--in the
commercial aircraft market. And until Asia fell apart a year ago,
demand for airplanes was at a cyclical peak. Normally, that
combination would allow a company to rake in the dough. But instead
Boeing found itself turning out fewer planes than it needed to and
spending more on each plane than it should have. Boeing was
actually adding workers as late as 1996, and more recently asking
workers to pull extra overtime in order to deliver planes when
promised. As a result, the company never reaped the profits at the
top of the demand cycle that it should have.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that in recent years a number of management
theorists have suggested that Boeing's production model, suitably
modified, represents a possible future for global manufacturing.
Unlike a classic assembly-line company, which restricts the number
of potential options in order to reap the benefits of
standardization, Boeing customizes each of its planes. The number
of potential options is practically unlimited, which means that an
airplane factory looks nothing like the Modern Times classic model
of mind-destroying automation.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of this model is that customers get exactly what they
want, which in theory should allow Boeing to charge premium prices.
And what those management theorists see in the future is a world in
which computerization and e-commerce will combine to allow
companies to customize products like Boeing does while
simultaneously retaining the economies of scale that the assembly
line offers. The current Platonic ideal here is Dell Computer,
which builds its computers to order but still turns them out
quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ``flexible production'' only works if your
entire production system is set up to take advantage of the
approach. And although Boeing has been doing flexible production
forever, it has never really embraced a top-to-bottom reinvention
of the system. As a result, Boeing's approach has a lot of the
old-school craftsman in it and not enough Henry Ford. The company
still has multiple and incompatible computer systems. It has
resisted standardization where it shouldn't. And it has done a poor
job of managing inventory.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are supposedly in the process of changing. And
Boeing couldn't have anticipated what would happen in Asia. But the
50,000 job cuts we'll see between now and the end of next year are
simple testimony to the fact that now as much ever, management
matters.

ESCAPE ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By William Saletan (posted Wednesday, Dec. 2, 1998)
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing wisdom about President Clinton's political fate
in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky affair is that he certainly
won't be removed from office, probably won't be impeached by the
House, and may well escape punishment altogether. It seems unfair
to many people that Clinton, having behaved despicably and then
lied to everyone about it, defeated the investigation of this
misconduct by evading, obstructing, and demonizing Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. But while Clinton may escape justice at
home, he faces a cruel sentence abroad: He must endure, at the
hands of Saddam Hussein, the same tactics he used against Starr. Of
course, Saddam has long been a master of these tactics. But there
is poetic injustice in the uncanny resemblance between his 10 point
strategy against U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler and
Clinton's campaign against Starr and the ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Belittle the subject. Clinton's henchmen dismissed Starr's
investigation as a detour into sexual matters that were nobody's
business. Iraq dismissed Butler's recent requests for documents as
a detour into matters that ``have no relations to the disarmament
procedures.'' Clinton's spinners said Starr had no grounds to
pursue evidence of his misconduct. Iraq says Butler has no
``technical or scientific grounds'' to demand that Iraq relinquish
specific evidence about its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invent privileges. To justify their refusal to testify or turn
over documents requested by Starr, Clinton and his allies stretched
some privileges (executive and attorney-client) and invented others
(``protective function''). To justify its refusal to turn over
documents requested by the weapons inspectors, Iraq stretches some
privileges (sovereignty) and invents others (``national
security''), backed by comparably bogus legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Play word games. Clinton evaded the law and its enforcers by
revising the meanings of words such as ``sexual relations,''
``alone,'' and ``is.'' Iraq, having promised to cooperate with the
weapons inspectors, now says ``cooperation'' doesn't entail
absolute capitulation to their requests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vilify the investigator. Clinton's team neutralized the
investigation of his misconduct by diverting scrutiny from Clinton
to Starr. They elevated Starr's profile, defined him as a vicious
zealot, and undermined the credibility of his investigation.
Likewise, Iraqi officials and newspapers are neutralizing the
investigation of Iraq's misconduct by elevating Butler's profile
and defining him as a ``devil'' and a ``mad bull.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Politicize the investigation. Clintonites accused Starr of
attacking Clinton at the behest of tobacco companies, Richard
Mellon Scaife, and right-wing senators and lawyers. Iraq accuses
Butler of staging confrontations in order to maintain cruel
economic sanctions and provoke a war. Butler seeks ``a new excuse
to be used by the United States and Britain in order to trigger a
new aggression against Iraq,'' says an Iraqi newspaper. Wherever
Clinton and Butler agree, Iraq infers collaboration. When Clinton
spelled out his demands for Iraqi cooperation and Butler
subsequently requested documents, Iraq's foreign minister charged,
``Butler has resorted to a new ploy ... the implementation of the
points made by Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Feign compliance. While erecting legal roadblocks andprivately
spurning Starr's requests to testify before the grand jury, Clinton
publicly vowed to tell the truth (``more rather than less, sooner
rather than later'') and professed that he was cooperating fully
with the investigation. Likewise, Iraq issues statements and
letters touting its compliance with ``surprise'' inspections, even
as it withholds documents sought by the inspectors. Clinton, having
averted Starr's subpoena by agreeing to testify before the grand
jury, spent his testimony fudging, lying, and reverting to his
previous circumlocutions. Iraq, having averted Clinton's Nov. 14
military assault by agreeing to cooperate with the weapons
inspectors, fudged, lied, and reverted to its previous
circumlocutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accuse the investigator of framing you. Clinton's defenders
accuse Starr's prosecutors of pressuring witnesses such as Betty
Currie and Susan McDougal to testify falsely against Clinton. Iraq
accuses the weapons inspectors and the United States of planting
nerve gas on an Iraqi missile warhead in order to implicate Iraq
falsely in weapons violations. Iraq's evidence for this charge was
no better than the evidence against Starr. But it succeeded just as
well in changing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's image war against Butler and the United States hasn't
matched the success of Clinton's image war against Starr, but it
has produced considerable gains. Having obliged Clinton to call off
his Nov. 14 military strike, Iraq continues to thwart the
inspectors. And on Nov. 24, when Butler briefed the U.N. Security
Council about Iraq's noncompliance, Russian and Chinese
representatives questioned the relevance of his document requests
and indicated that they would review the facts independently. The
charges against Butler are a sham, of course. It's too bad Clinton
lacks the authority to say so.

THE DISMAL LOGIC OF THE BODY'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am haunted by a vision in which medical science cures
everything and makes everyone immortal--and I am the last person to
die before scientists get it right. The New York Times nourishes my
vision with frequent reports of promising new treatments for cancer
and arteriosclerosis, which jointly account for the great majority
of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism of the Times' science reporters--and their sources
in the medical community--contrasts with the pessimism of
economists and poets, who continue to focus on the inevitability of
death, decay, and depreciation--at least in this world.
</P>
<P>
   The poetic invention economists most love to cite is ``The
Deacon's Masterpiece or the Wonderful One-Hoss Shay,''
built--according to Oliver Wendell Holmes--so it couldn't break
down. A breakdown, you see, requires some part to fail before
another. So the deacon deliberately made every part exactly as
strong as the rest and rendered that kind of failure impossible.
The result?
</P>
<P>
   You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,
</P>
<P>
   How it went to pieces all at once,--
</P>
<P>
   All at once, and nothing first,--
</P>
<P>
   Just as bubbles do when they burst.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, economists have used the phrase ``one-hoss shay
depreciation'' to describe machinery that works perfectly well
right up to the day when it fails beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes made gentle fun of the deacon's logic, which led him to
write charming poetry but bad economics. The deacon was wiser than
Holmes realized. Any designer--whether of a chaise, or an
automobile, or a living organism--would be well-advised to make
each part roughly as strong as the rest. If the wheels are destined
to disintegrate in 80 years, then it's a waste of effort to design
a floor that will last for 100. If your car engine won't last past
100,000 miles, you don't need a transmission that will last for
500,000 miles. (There's an exception to this rule for parts that
are easily replaceable.)
</P>
<P>
   So to a first approximation, well-designed mechanisms should
depreciate just like the wonderful one-hoss shay--all at once and
nothing first. The human body, for example, is a well-designed
mechanism, thanks to the pressures of natural selection. Therefore
(and I believe this observation was first made by the physiologist
Jared Diamond in his insightful book ``The Third Chimpanzee''), we
should not be surprised that our vision, hearing, mental faculties,
physical strength, arteries, and resistance to cancer all tend to
deteriorate at around the same time. Nature is a good economist.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything fails at exactly the same time--either in your
car or in your body--but that's only because designers can't always
predict the exact moment of failure. There is one circumstance in
which you'd design a part to last much longer than the whole: when
it's just as cheap and easy to make a part long-lived as to make it
short-lived. But Diamond argues that such
</P>
<P>
   cases are unlikely to arise in the human body. That's because
virtually all our organs require routine maintenance, and the
frequency of that maintenance is part of the organ's ``design.''
You can always make an organ last longer by maintaining it better,
but you can never do that for free because maintenance consumes
energy that could otherwise be available for gathering food or
fighting predators. If your stomach were designed to last 100 years
longer than the rest of you, your body would be well-advised to
conserve energy by taking less good care of your stomach--which
means your stomach wouldn't last 100 years longer than the rest of
you.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal conclusion is that even cures for the big
killers--cancer and arteriosclerosis--are unlikely to extend human
</P>
<P>
   life spans very much. Because evolution didn't expect you to
live past 100, it probably had the good sense not to give you too
many organs that will last till 110. To significantly extend your
life span, researchers will have to figure out how to extend the
lives of all those organs, not just a few. That's not a conclusion
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy with, but in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
``Logic is logic. That's all I say.''

ESCAPE ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Fixes repeated byline)  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prevailing wisdom about President Clinton's political fate
in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky affair is that he certainly
won't be removed from office, probably won't be impeached by the
House, and may well escape punishment altogether. It seems unfair
to many people that Clinton, having behaved despicably and then
lied to everyone about it, defeated the investigation of this
misconduct by evading, obstructing, and demonizing Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. But while Clinton may escape justice at
home, he faces a cruel sentence abroad: He must endure, at the
hands of Saddam Hussein, the same tactics he used against Starr. Of
course, Saddam has long been a master of these tactics. But there
is poetic injustice in the uncanny resemblance between his 10 point
strategy against U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler and
Clinton's campaign against Starr and the ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Belittle the subject. Clinton's henchmen dismissed Starr's
investigation as a detour into sexual matters that were nobody's
business. Iraq dismissed Butler's recent requests for documents as
a detour into matters that ``have no relations to the disarmament
procedures.'' Clinton's spinners said Starr had no grounds to
pursue evidence of his misconduct. Iraq says Butler has no
``technical or scientific grounds'' to demand that Iraq relinquish
specific evidence about its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invent privileges. To justify their refusal to testify or turn
over documents requested by Starr, Clinton and his allies stretched
some privileges (executive and attorney-client) and invented others
(``protective function''). To justify its refusal to turn over
documents requested by the weapons inspectors, Iraq stretches some
privileges (sovereignty) and invents others (``national
security''), backed by comparably bogus legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Play word games. Clinton evaded the law and its enforcers by
revising the meanings of words such as ``sexual relations,''
``alone,'' and ``is.'' Iraq, having promised to cooperate with the
weapons inspectors, now says ``cooperation'' doesn't entail
absolute capitulation to their requests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vilify the investigator. Clinton's team neutralized the
investigation of his misconduct by diverting scrutiny from Clinton
to Starr. They elevated Starr's profile, defined him as a vicious
zealot, and undermined the credibility of his investigation.
Likewise, Iraqi officials and newspapers are neutralizing the
investigation of Iraq's misconduct by elevating Butler's profile
and defining him as a ``devil'' and a ``mad bull.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Politicize the investigation. Clintonites accused Starr of
attacking Clinton at the behest of tobacco companies, Richard
Mellon Scaife, and right-wing senators and lawyers. Iraq accuses
Butler of staging confrontations in order to maintain cruel
economic sanctions and provoke a war. Butler seeks ``a new excuse
to be used by the United States and Britain in order to trigger a
new aggression against Iraq,'' says an Iraqi newspaper. Wherever
Clinton and Butler agree, Iraq infers collaboration. When Clinton
spelled out his demands for Iraqi cooperation and Butler
subsequently requested documents, Iraq's foreign minister charged,
``Butler has resorted to a new ploy ... the implementation of the
points made by Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Feign compliance. While erecting legal roadblocks andprivately
spurning Starr's requests to testify before the grand jury, Clinton
publicly vowed to tell the truth (``more rather than less, sooner
rather than later'') and professed that he was cooperating fully
with the investigation. Likewise, Iraq issues statements and
letters touting its compliance with ``surprise'' inspections, even
as it withholds documents sought by the inspectors. Clinton, having
averted Starr's subpoena by agreeing to testify before the grand
jury, spent his testimony fudging, lying, and reverting to his
previous circumlocutions. Iraq, having averted Clinton's Nov. 14
military assault by agreeing to cooperate with the weapons
inspectors, fudged, lied, and reverted to its previous
circumlocutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accuse the investigator of framing you. Clinton's defenders
accuse Starr's prosecutors of pressuring witnesses such as Betty
Currie and Susan McDougal to testify falsely against Clinton. Iraq
accuses the weapons inspectors and the United States of planting
nerve gas on an Iraqi missile warhead in order to implicate Iraq
falsely in weapons violations. Iraq's evidence for this charge was
no better than the evidence against Starr. But it succeeded just as
well in changing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's image war against Butler and the United States hasn't
matched the success of Clinton's image war against Starr, but it
has produced considerable gains. Having obliged Clinton to call off
his Nov. 14 military strike, Iraq continues to thwart the
inspectors. And on Nov. 24, when Butler briefed the U.N. Security
Council about Iraq's noncompliance, Russian and Chinese
representatives questioned the relevance of his document requests
and indicated that they would review the facts independently. The
charges against Butler are a sham, of course. It's too bad Clinton
lacks the authority to say so.

HAIL TO THE PRINCE OF WALES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA RATHBONE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Prince Charles celebrated his 50th birthday
last month, I felt he deserved a word of thanks. One of the most
important roles of any prince is to be a great romantic hero, and,
over the years, Prince Charles has seldom let me down.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have dreamt, watching his Cinderella-like wedding,
that he was secretly harboring an illicit passion for Camilla
Parker Bowles, wife of an erstwhile commander of his mother's
household cavalry, who was sitting right there in the middle of the
congregation? Or that this frumpy doyenne of the hunting, shooting
and fishing set would turn out to be such a great romantic heroine?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there she is, a wrinkled Anna Karenina in Wellington
boots, a gray-haired Madame Bovary, defiantly sacrificing the
British monarchy to the throes of her passion, giving renewed hope
that there really is sex and romance after 50, and that it is not
reserved for men only.
</P>
<P>
   People may disapprove; the consensus among my friends seems to
be that ``Camilla shouldn't have done it,'' that she deserves all
the misery and social ostracism she has received. Whereas it seems
to me that, just like Madame Bovary, she had no choice _ she had to
do it. Otherwise, she would have betrayed the essence of life
itself.
</P>
<P>
   My second cousin once removed, Basil Rathbone, played the cruel
and cold-hearted Karenin to Greta Garbo's Anna in an early movie of
the novel. He has my father's mouth, which I too have inherited,
leaving me to watch, outraged, as Karenin coldly bent to kiss his
passionate wife. How could those lips have touched Anna's, lips
that are, after all, my own, and not find one ounce of arousal? No
wonder she fell in love with Vronsky.
</P>
<P>
   When Princess Diana was alive, I could not help admiring her
Titanic battle with Camilla for Prince Charles, even though it was
hard to understand how such an eccentric, mild and thoroughly
unlikely looking man could inspire such strong passions. And now,
frozen in death, Diana remains the perfect arch-rival. Much as I
loved her for making mincemeat of the stuffy royal family,
ruthlessly using to her own advantage what my sister would call a
bunch of North American psych-babble, Diana was, I believe, at
heart, a Machiavellian figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell has no fury like a woman scorned,'' nor yet like the
vengeful Diana, intent on stealing the throne to punish her spouse
for his wayward passions. She reminds me of the goddess Fricka in
Wagner's ``Die Walkurie,'' whose job it was to uphold the legal
straitjacket of marriage in the face of Wotan, her straying
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Queen Elizabeth is, of course, in trouble on all fronts.
Hopelessly outclassed by the devious and beautiful Diana, in death
even more so than in life, the queen must also be, I should
imagine, thoroughly, deeply and venomously jealous of Camilla. I
suspect that, not unlike the wise but pinched Dowager Duchess of
Tintagel in Edith Wharton's ``The Buccaneers,'' her steely
disapproval of her wayward son has less to do with any harm he is
causing to the monarchy than with the fact that, like the dowager,
she has never once allowed herself to abandon duty for the passion
of romance.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is this need to follow one's heart, especially in the
image-conscious `90s, that explains Jane Austen's sudden
popularity. She may not have understood the glories of elopement,
passion and illicit sex _ there is always some woman in her novels
that does this, but she is flighty and silly and the man a no-good
will-o'-the-wisp _ but she is nevertheless a fervent advocate for
romantic love. All her heroines manage to subvert the neurotic and
mercenary mating dance surrounding them, marrying instead
delicious, goose-bump handsome men, escaping the fury of the
squawking matchmakers and fortune hunters scuttling all around.
</P>
<P>
   And so my secret hope is that Camilla and Charles will elope to
John o' Groats (the British version of Reno and the quickie
marriage), returning radiant and triumphant to what will certainly
be an interesting moral and constitutional pickle for the
Archbishop of Canterbury; that Diana's son William will ascend the
throne, enshrining his mother's wounded beauty in our collective
memory, and that the queen will finally get bored with her
passionless life and have a wild affair with a uniformed and
handsome member of the horse guards, meeting secretly in her
beloved, straw-filled stables, providing living proof to senior
citizens everywhere that life isn't over till it's over.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thank you, Prince Charles, for fulfilling my
dreams. Please don't stop, and I wish you a very happy birthday.

 &HT;    Good news, Texas; you can strike stupidest law from books
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The folks at Texas A&AMP;M have done their best at
wiping out boll weevils and grubs. They've made headway against
fire ants and web worms. But only now can they confirm an outright
bio-eradication.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough was announced to a bonfire rally last week, not
by an entomologist but by a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Football player Dan Campbell said he was glad to attend a school
where ``men like women and women like men.'' Scientists no doubt
are catching planes this week to find out how A&AMP;M has cured
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation is a stunner, and certainly a relief. Whatever
A&AMP;M has done it must share with lawmakers in Austin. With
homosexuality cured, as its first item of business, the 76th Texas
Legislature can revoke Texas' stupidest law.
</P>
<P>
   Is the cure for homosexuality a serum? If so, vials can be
rushed to the University of Texas. Some took the Aggie's comments
to imply that UT is sorely blighted. Campbell and A&AMP;M officials
have apologized to all offended by the comments, but wait.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know you can take a sampling of 34,000 average
collegians, do whatever A&AMP;M did with them, and have every one march
straight, well ...
</P>
<P>
   That means we don't need Texas' sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   Court dockets spared?
</P>
<P>
   That means two Houston men shouldn't have to go on trial for
touching each other in ways outlawed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   That means a Houston lawman wouldn't have to testify exactly how
not-OK the touching was, there among consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Texas Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court
wouldn't have to sit down to review the touching, as opponents of
this ridiculous law want to force the justices to do.
</P>
<P>
   Our courts and our police ought to deal with crimes that have
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of 19 states with anti-sodomy laws. There's one
fewer as of last week. The Georgia Supreme Court struck down that
state's law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot think of any other activity that reasonable persons
would rank as more private and more deserving of protection from
governmental interference than consensual, private, adult sexual
activity,'' said Georgia's chief justice. The Georgia case, but the
way, did not involve homosexual conduct. It involved a male and a
female. Texas is one of five states whose anti-sodomy laws apply
only to homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Their privacy obliterated
</P>
<P>
   What were John Lawrence and Tyrone Garner doing in Lawrence's
Houston apartment the night of Sept. 17? None of Texas' business.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris County deputy responding on an unrelated matter entered
the unlocked apartment and saw what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Showing uncommon courage, these two men decided to face the
music and then step out into the national light challenging the
law.
</P>
<P>
   They pleaded no contest, were fined $125 each by a justice of
the peace, and then filed their appeal. Good luck to them.
</P>
<P>
   No one should have to face this. Texas lawmakers should see to
it. They should stand up for the right of privacy. But they won't.
Some will be spineless. Some will be beholden to pious forces that
put them there.
</P>
<P>
   A serum for homosexuality? Don't be ridiculous. It's not a
disease spread through the air.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of life's mysteries. It bothers many sensibilities.
Many would like to wish it didn't exist or that advisories of
righteous damnation would make us all the same.
</P>
<P>
   People's emotions can no more be controlled by vaccine than by
nonsensical laws.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we run a dragnet at A&AMP;M to check on who's pairing up with
whom? Of course not. It's none of our business. However, I imagine
a census would surprise.

 By PIERRE SANE  
 c.1998 Emerge  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; __ NOTE: Amnesty International, the world's premier
human-rights organization and recipient of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, is sponsoring a yearlong campaign to spotlight human-rights
violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has monitored U.S. abuses since the 1960s, but the
1999 campaign is Amnesty's first effort to focus worldwide
attention on these violations. Its priorities are police brutality,
prison conditions, the death penalty and the treatment of asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants the United States to ratify without reservation
certain international treaties, including the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and to better monitor U.S. foreign weapons
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Sane, the London-based secretary-general, is primary
spokesman for the group, which has 1 million members, 300,000 of
them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sane, a native of Dakar, Senegal, has pursued doctoral studies
at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada and holds an M.S. in
public administration and public policy from the London School of
Economics. He joined Amnesty International in 1988, and became
secretary-general in 1992. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   .................................
</P>
<P>
   What Amnesty International has documented in our research, and
this is over the years _ since the first 17 reports that we have
issued _ are a number of violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States prides itself on being the land of
liberty and the land of democracy, people believe bad things may be
happening but only as isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Our concern now is that there is a deterioration of the
human-rights condition. The United States has the highest
incarceration rate in the world, 1.7 million prisoners, including
79,624 women. And those numbers have really rocketed since the
'80s. The death penalty is used more and more frequently, with less
and less mercy. Juvenile offenders are executed. Mentally ill
people are executed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the prisons are deteriorating. We find cells that
have vermin. Overcrowding is leading to violence of inmates on
inmates, and guards failing to protect inmates from violence, as
well as violence by the guards _ physical assaults, sexual assaults
on women. The use of technology such as stun guns and pepper spray
is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   And complacency, coupled with the legitimate concern of the
population for safety and the spread of drug use, is manipulated by
politicians. All of this is further eroding human-rights protection
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, the members of Amnesty International will be
engaging in an awareness-raising campaign. We want other
governments and intergovernmental bodies to fulfill their
obligations to the American people. We want other governments to
challenge the U.S. government to put its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet Mexico's secretary of foreign affairs, I'll say:
``When you visit the United States and meet with your counterpart,
you should raise your concerns regarding the deteriorating
human-rights condition in the United States.'' Our members also
will be writing letters, expressiong concerns and targeting
Congress, state governors and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, I think people would agree that the United
States uses double standards. In the Middle East, people will often
discuss the way the United States deals with Israel, on the one
hand, and Iraq, on the other, in terms of the implementation of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In western Europe, people find it shocking that the United
States is the only Western industrialized country that continues to
use the death penalty, especially against juvenile offenders and
mentally impaired people.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries of Asia, there is a resistance to human rights
because they perceive that the United States is instrumentalizing
human rights for other purposes, not necessarily out of real
concern for the well-being of the Chinese people, or the Malaysian
people.
</P>
<P>
   They say, ``Why should the United States have concerns regarding
the treatment of prisoners in China when its own prisoners in the
United States are treated in this way?'' They believe it's totally
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. image internationally is also changing through the life
experiences of asylum seekers who, fleeing persecution, come to
what they believe is the land of freedom and find themselves locked
up in jail. For many in America, the promise of equal rights for
all is still a fake promise.
</P>
<P>
   When asylum seekers came from Russia and Communist states, they
were welcome because the United States was using it to show the
superiority of the country, with people fleeing dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same people are fleeing the same dictatorships, but they
are coming from Latin America, Africa and Asia. They are seeking
asylum for exactly the same reasons that led people from eastern
Europe to seek asylum. Instead of being protected and granted the
level of protection to which they are entitled under international
law, they are treated like criminals. And this is because they are
black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics in Amnesty International's report show that you are
more likely to face the death penalty for crimes in which the
victim is white. The black population, compared to its total
percentage, is overrepresented on death row. And I have visited
death row in Texas and Pennsylvania _ there is no millionaire on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those who end up on death row, in large part, had
totally inadequate legal representation. People are fighting for
their lives but they don't have the means to have adequate legal
representation, and they end up being sentenced to death. So from
poverty and being black, you are at risk in America.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the best way to eliminate racism and poverty is
to ensure the full respect for all human rights. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights contains the set of rights that are
guaranteed to everyone, and which governments have an obligation to
meet. Human rights are a way to preserve peace and ensure justice,
and also a way to help heal nations and improve the interaction
among members of just societies.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Congress admonishes Turkey, Colombia, Cuba and
other nations, it does so on the basis of international
human-rights law. When the State Department publishes annual
reports on human rights around the world, they are based on
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   International human-rights law IS the United States of America.
It's the United States that chaired the committee that drafted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It's the United
States that took the lead in establishing the International
Tribunal at Nuremberg. So the United States has been the lead actor
in the development of international law.
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult to develop standards when the United States
opposes them and uses its influence to twist the arms of many of
its allies. As a result, these treaties are developed by consensus
and, once developed, they are used by the United States as a
yardstick against which to judge others.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot be above the law. The Convention on the
Rights of the Child prohibits explicitly the execution of juvenile
offenders, defined as young persons under 18. Those children
require special protection, and when they commit a crime, the
convention reads that they should not be executed. When the United
States does that, it is in breach of the convention. Since 1990
only six countries have executed juveniles: Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Pakistan, Nigeria and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I met a woman from Chicago who gave testimony for
Amnesty's report about being shackled in leg irons when transported
from prison to the hospital to give birth. And she was shackled
during labor for seven and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   I can't understand the logic of the system that shackles women
while they are giving birth. I can understand that some prisoners
may be dangerous and you need to protect others and protect the
prisoners from harming themselves. But a woman who is giving birth
cannot be thinking about trying to escape or harm herself. Why
should she be contained in shackles? Women give birth in prison
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Amnesty's recommendations is to increase police
accountability by ensuring that we have effective methods of
oversight. Another is to develop and enforce standards for the
treatment of prisoners. We need to ban the use of stun belts and do
serious research into the use of pepper spray. There's no reason to
jail asylum seekers; these are not criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we want to abolish the death penalty, but in the
meantime, we think that juveniles should not be executed. Mentally
impaired people should not be executed, and resources should be
provided for legal aid for the impotent. People fighting for their
lives in the courts have the worst legal conditions; that is
totally unfair.

<P>
   &UR; __ NOTE: Amnesty International, the world's premier
human-rights organization and recipient of the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, is sponsoring a yearlong campaign to spotlight human-rights
violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has monitored U.S. abuses since the 1960s, but the
1999 campaign is Amnesty's first effort to focus worldwide
attention on these violations. Its priorities are police brutality,
prison conditions, the death penalty and the treatment of asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants the United States to ratify without reservation
certain international treaties, including the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, and to better monitor U.S. foreign weapons
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Sane, the London-based secretary-general, is primary
spokesman for the group, which has 1 million members, 300,000 of
them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sane, a native of Dakar, Senegal, has pursued doctoral studies
at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada and holds an M.S. in
public administration and public policy from the London School of
Economics. He joined Amnesty International in 1988, and became
secretary-general in 1992. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   .................................
</P>
<P>
   What Amnesty International has documented in our research, and
this is over the years _ since the first 17 reports that we have
issued _ are a number of violations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States prides itself on being the land of
liberty and the land of democracy, people believe bad things may be
happening but only as isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Our concern now is that there is a deterioration of the
human-rights condition. The United States has the highest
incarceration rate in the world, 1.7 million prisoners, including
79,624 women. And those numbers have really rocketed since the
'80s. The death penalty is used more and more frequently, with less
and less mercy. Juvenile offenders are executed. Mentally ill
people are executed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the prisons are deteriorating. We find cells that
have vermin. Overcrowding is leading to violence of inmates on
inmates, and guards failing to protect inmates from violence, as
well as violence by the guards _ physical assaults, sexual assaults
on women. The use of technology such as stun guns and pepper spray
is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   And complacency, coupled with the legitimate concern of the
population for safety and the spread of drug use, is manipulated by
politicians. All of this is further eroding human-rights protection
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, the members of Amnesty International will be
engaging in an awareness-raising campaign. We want other
governments and intergovernmental bodies to fulfill their
obligations to the American people. We want other governments to
challenge the U.S. government to put its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet Mexico's secretary of foreign affairs, I'll say:
``When you visit the United States and meet with your counterpart,
you should raise your concerns regarding the deteriorating
human-rights condition in the United States.'' Our members also
will be writing letters, expressiong concerns and targeting
Congress, state governors and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, I think people would agree that the United
States uses double standards. In the Middle East, people will often
discuss the way the United States deals with Israel, on the one
hand, and Iraq, on the other, in terms of the implementation of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In western Europe, people find it shocking that the United
States is the only Western industrialized country that continues to
use the death penalty, especially against juvenile offenders and
mentally impaired people.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries of Asia, there is a resistance to human rights
because they perceive that the United States is instrumentalizing
human rights for other purposes, not necessarily out of real
concern for the well-being of the Chinese people, or the Malaysian
people.
</P>
<P>
   They say, ``Why should the United States have concerns regarding
the treatment of prisoners in China when its own prisoners in the
United States are treated in this way?'' They believe it's totally
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. image internationally is also changing through the life
experiences of asylum seekers who, fleeing persecution, come to
what they believe is the land of freedom and find themselves locked
up in jail. For many in America, the promise of equal rights for
all is still a fake promise.
</P>
<P>
   When asylum seekers came from Russia and Communist states, they
were welcome because the United States was using it to show the
superiority of the country, with people fleeing dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same people are fleeing the same dictatorships, but they
are coming from Latin America, Africa and Asia. They are seeking
asylum for exactly the same reasons that led people from eastern
Europe to seek asylum. Instead of being protected and granted the
level of protection to which they are entitled under international
law, they are treated like criminals. And this is because they are
black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics in Amnesty International's report show that you are
more likely to face the death penalty for crimes in which the
victim is white. The black population, compared to its total
percentage, is overrepresented on death row. And I have visited
death row in Texas and Pennsylvania _ there is no millionaire on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those who end up on death row, in large part, had
totally inadequate legal representation. People are fighting for
their lives but they don't have the means to have adequate legal
representation, and they end up being sentenced to death. So from
poverty and being black, you are at risk in America.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the best way to eliminate racism and poverty is
to ensure the full respect for all human rights. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights contains the set of rights that are
guaranteed to everyone, and which governments have an obligation to
meet. Human rights are a way to preserve peace and ensure justice,
and also a way to help heal nations and improve the interaction
among members of just societies.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Congress admonishes Turkey, Colombia, Cuba and
other nations, it does so on the basis of international
human-rights law. When the State Department publishes annual
reports on human rights around the world, they are based on
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   International human-rights law IS the United States of America.
It's the United States that chaired the committee that drafted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It's the United
States that took the lead in establishing the International
Tribunal at Nuremberg. So the United States has been the lead actor
in the development of international law.
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult to develop standards when the United States
opposes them and uses its influence to twist the arms of many of
its allies. As a result, these treaties are developed by consensus
and, once developed, they are used by the United States as a
yardstick against which to judge others.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot be above the law. The Convention on the
Rights of the Child prohibits explicitly the execution of juvenile
offenders, defined as young persons under 18. Those children
require special protection, and when they commit a crime, the
convention reads that they should not be executed. When the United
States does that, it is in breach of the convention. Since 1990
only six countries have executed juveniles: Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Pakistan, Nigeria and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I met a woman from Chicago who gave testimony for
Amnesty's report about being shackled in leg irons when transported
from prison to the hospital to give birth. And she was shackled
during labor for seven and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   I can't understand the logic of the system that shackles women
while they are giving birth. I can understand that some prisoners
may be dangerous and you need to protect others and protect the
prisoners from harming themselves. But a woman who is giving birth
cannot be thinking about trying to escape or harm herself. Why
should she be contained in shackles? Women give birth in prison
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Amnesty's recommendations is to increase police
accountability by ensuring that we have effective methods of
oversight. Another is to develop and enforce standards for the
treatment of prisoners. We need to ban the use of stun belts and do
serious research into the use of pepper spray. There's no reason to
jail asylum seekers; these are not criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we want to abolish the death penalty, but in the
meantime, we think that juveniles should not be executed. Mentally
impaired people should not be executed, and resources should be
provided for legal aid for the impotent. People fighting for their
lives in the courts have the worst legal conditions; that is
totally unfair.

TALKING TOY MAY NOT BE THE IDEAL GIFT FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With FURBY-AUTOPSY)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This holiday shopping season, adults are lining
up outside shopping malls at 3 a.m., pushing and shoving in hopes
of buying a small, Gremlin-like interactive toy known as the Furby.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Internet sites have been created to pay homage to
the Furby, offering the speaking creature at more than double the
$34.99 list price.
</P>
<P>
   And a black market of early-buying brokers has sprung up,
offering overpriced Furbys through word of mouth and Internet chat
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lighting up our switchboard, that's for sure,'' said
Mark Cloud, operations manager at the FAO Schwartz toy store in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said the store was avoiding the unruly lines of
angst-ridden parents by keeping a waiting list. Furbys are doled
out as they come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put you on the list,'' Cloud said. ``But you wouldn't
see a Furby until sometime in late January.''
</P>
<P>
   The Furby is an owlish, long-eared, plush toy, filled with
switches, sensors and computer chips, hailing from somewhere up in
the clouds, according to the instruction manual. When filled with
four AA batteries, its eyes open, it lets out a sigh, and then
begins yammering in ``Furbish,'' a nonsensical language in which
``may-may'' means ``love.''
</P>
<P>
   Put Furby in the dark and it goes to sleep _ after a bit of
snoring. It bobs up and down to music. It asks for food. It burps.
It laughs when it's tickled. It can play a rudimentary form of hide
and seek. It also integrates, over time, English phrases into its
vocabulary, simulating learning.
</P>
<P>
   All the hype has made the Furby the hottest toy of the season,
much like the Tickle Me Elmos and Power Rangers of seasons past.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts question whether all the hype is a good thing for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents think buying a material object, like a Furby, is going
to somehow put their kids ahead of the game,'' said Elizabeth
Lloyd-Mayer, a child development psychoanalyst who teaches at the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center. ``It's a very
unfortunate reading of what kids really need.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark I. Levy, an assistant clinical professor and chairman
of the San Francisco Foundation for Psychoanalysis, said the Furby
fever was a result of two modern-day family ailments he encounters
again and again in his practice: guilt and neediness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of parents are enormously guilty about their
kids, for a variety of reasons,'' Levy said. ``Single parents are
invariably working, and couples in general are spending more time
out of the home, at their jobs or whatever. It creates a tremendous
sense in them that they're abandoning their children.''
</P>
<P>
   That guilt, Levy said, isn't unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children do feel abandoned,'' he said. ``They are left with
other caregivers, and they feel like they're no longer any sort of
a priority with the adults in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These parents, Levy said, use the holidays as an attempt to set
things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's makeup time, big time,'' said Levy, who compared the
parents who splurge on holidays to the ``weekend dad syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Needy children need time, not stuff,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, for most parents, time can be the most difficult
thing they can give.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, where there are Furbys there will be buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the coolest toy ever,'' said Rick Washburn, who works at
the Charles Schwab brokerage house in San Francisco. ``Totally
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn said that he, together with two co-workers, bought five
Furbys when they hit the shelves in October, selling two of the
$34.99 toys later for $180 on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson two years ago, when Tickle Me Elmo came
out,'' Washburn said. ``I totally misjudged how popular it would
be. Come Christmas Day, I was the daddy without the toy.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are planning to wait in line all night to
buy a Furby, you might as well have some idea of what you are in
for. We dissected a Furby to find out what makes it tick.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Race: Furby, electronic toy.
</P>
<P>
   Height: Approximately 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Weight: About 1 pound.
</P>
<P>
   DOB: Unknown, but sometime after the February 1998 American
International Toy Fair in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Next of kin: Inventor Dave Hampton, a 46-year-old programmer who
lives in an undisclosed Western national park, where he uses a gas
generator to run his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy technique: Generally accepted Furby autopsy procedure,
as described in the Furby Autopsy Web site (www.phobe.com/furby).
</P>
<P>
   Exterior: No apparent signs of trauma. Large Furby face is
owl-like in nature, apparently resembles owls seen by inventor
Hampton near his home. The Furby is covered by a loose fur skin,
which is 100 percent polyester according to a manufacturer's tag.
Cutting a plastic loop under the tail frees up the skin, which can
then be pulled off over the top of Furby's head. Underneath the
polyester is a hard, black plastic exoskeleton, attached by a
number of small Phillips screws.
</P>
<P>
   Musculature: A series of cams, springs and levers, working off a
single motor, drive the Furby's motion. Manipulating the gears
indicates that they account for the toy's rocking back and forth on
its base, opening and shutting its eyes, waving its ears and moving
its beak.
</P>
<P>
   Brain: There are three unidentified microprocessor chips on a
circuit board which rests underneath the motor and gears. One chip
is wired directly to the Furby's side-mounted microphone,
apparently enabling Furby to respond to noise.
</P>
<P>
   The main processor probably contains the code that enables the
toy to put together about 800 phrases from a 200 word ``Furbish''
vocabulary. According to the instruction manual, Furby will begin
using English words over time, simulating a learning process. Two
computer daughter boards, with smaller custom processors, are
present.
</P>
<P>
   Organs: The Furby's interior contains an array of microswitches
and sensors that allow it to interact with its owner. There is also
an infrared send/receive sensor array in the forehead, that can
send data to another Furby, enabling them to begin talking in
unison. Switches on the head, front and back let Furby respond to
petting. A motion switch on its computer board lets the Furby
respond with a ``whoa!'' when it's picked up. In the base is room
of four AA batteries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ For almost five hundred years, through
earthquakes and war, the tiny Jewish community here protected a
cherished and precious deerskin torah from the 13th Century.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, they wrapped it like a baby and safely hid
it beneath roof tiles, along with 17th- and 18th-Century Venetian
wraps, a pair of gold-crowned Torahs and even a candelabra taken
down from the ceiling of the synagogue. In 1991, when the synagogue
took a direct hit from a Serbian shell, the religious treasures
were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the treasures of Dubrovnik were lost, not to
foreign armies or Croatian Nazis, but to a Croatian-American Jew
living in Manhattan. Dr. Michael Papo, now living on Singer Island
in South Florida, arranged for their restoration and display at
Yeshiva University in New York City, and then fought their return
to here to Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three years spent in court battles in New York and
the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the Jewish community here is quietly
celebrating the successful return of the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Members are also celebrating the support they got from the
Croatian government at a time when its leaders, both officially and
unofficially, are reviving symbols reminiscent of its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the same time a priest widely regarded as a Nazi
collaborator was being beatified, the Croatian government was
paying the legal fees of a New York law firm fighting Papo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a large debt of gratitude to the Croatian government
for helping,'' said Sabrina Horovic, daughter of the president of
the Jewish community here. ``We could not have succeeded without
that help.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo wonders at this success -- it might be a victory for
Horovic, but not for the Jewish community, he said. The treasures
are hidden away in Dubrovnik, where visitors aren't allowed a
glimpse of the famous Sephardic characters. There is no public
display, which is what Papo wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always planned to return them, providing the war ended and
they would be safe,'' Papo said. ``It's sad that people perceive
this as a fight between the Jews. It's a fight between a
congregation and an opportunist. Those people saw an opportunity to
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Papo traces his lineage to a courtesan in Queen Isabella's
court, who left Spain with the torah when Isabella expelled the
Spanish Jews -- the Sephardic Jews -- in 1492. (One theory has
Christopher Columbus as an expelled Jew.) Along the spine of this
torah is the word Tolentino, Papo's family name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those Jews came to Dubrovnik, after stopping in Italy, and found
an established synagogue, built on top of a narrow stone house.
It's one of the two oldest in Europe, built in 1408, and about the
size of the vestibule of the nearby Catholic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a host of anti-Semitic rules -- Jews could only hire
older women for housework -- Jewish merchants came from all over
Europe to settle in Dubrovnik, a thriving city-state on the
Adriatic Sea. For three centuries, they thrived and kept homes
decorated with European tapestries and embroidery from the finest
textile houses of Venice, Paris and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II began, and Croatia joined forces with
Nazi Germany, there were less than a dozen Jews left in Dubrovnik
-- including Papo's aunt and uncles. Papo and his father survived
an Italian concentration camp, his mother did not, and Papo vowed
to care for the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been the guardians for 500 years, now it was up to me
to keep it safe,'' Papo said. He was elected in 1987 as president
of the Dubrovnik Jewish community -- although he never moved back
to Dubrovnik after World War II -- for a two-year term. No
president was elected after him, until the mid-1990's.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Papo managed to get the religious treasures
out of Croatia. What is clear, however, is that in late 1994 and
early 1995 he had them removed from the synagogue and sent to
Yeshiva University to be placed on display in its museum.
</P>
<P>
   Papo, who apparently removed the treasures without the
community's blessing, dismisses most of the Jews living in
Dubrovnik now as non-religious. He calls Sabrina Horovic ``an
ethnic rabble-rouser, and a thief,'' whose eye is only on the money
that can be raised using the Jewish treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented himself as the president of our community when he
went to the museum,'' she said. ``That wasn't true. But he said
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the exhibition was scheduled to close, Horovic's
father, Dr. Bruno Horovic, began writing the director of the museum
to arrange a way to bring the treasures back to Dubrovnik. Dr.
Horovic had been elected the community's president in late 1994,
and was re-elected both in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an answer in January 1995 and it gave us concern,''
Sabrina Horovic said. ``The director's question was, 'With all
respect, I don't know who is in charge of the Jewish community of
Dubrovnik, Dr. Horovic or Dr. Papo?'''
</P>
<P>
   She ended her letter with the message, ``let peace come to your
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, the museum agreed to return the treasure and Dr.
Horovic went to New York to accompany it home. But when he got
there, museum officials said they couldn't turn it over to him.
Papo had threatened to sue the museum if the treasure was returned
to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Papo did sue in New York State court.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming he was the sole living descendant of the Sephardic Jews
who acquired most of the treasures, he said neither the Croatian
government, nor Dubrovnik's tiny Jewish community could properly
protect the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, the Jewish community of Dubrovnik, the
Croatian government and Papo fought in court, both in New York and
in Zagreb, which is where a New York judge ruled the case should be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was moved, the case was lost, Papo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my fault that I couldn't get more public outcry. But I
tried. I spent three years of my life trying to protect it and I
failed,'' Papo said. ``The only good thing -- maybe people are
aware now of the Dubrovnik treasures and maybe nobody will be able
to steal them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Papo is sad that the treasures are hidden far from the
public's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claimed my father wasn't really very religious, that he
wasn't Jewish enough,'' Sabrina Horovic said, showing the pictures
of Dr. Horovic's 1937 bar mitzvah that were filed with the
</P>
<P>
   courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Papo) claimed the synagogue was completely destroyed and
wasn't a suitable place for the treasures,'' she said, showing
pictures of the fully intact roof which were filed with the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was repaired immediately after the war here by the Croatian
government because it was an important historical and cultural
monument,'' she said. ``In 1996 (when Papo filed suit), there was
nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The war between Serbs, Croats and Muslims in the former
Yugoslavia ended in December 1995 though there was no fighting in
Dubrovnik after 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community hired the lawyers to argue the case in
Zagreb while the Croatian government paid a law firm in New York to
handle the case there. It was the same Croatian
</P>
<P>
   government that had revived the use of the checkerboard shield
on flags and official documents. The shield had been the symbol of
the Nazi puppet regime during World War II when Croatian fascists
had killed thousands of Serbs and many of the Jews who lived in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the ethnic wars after the break-up of Yugoslavia,
nationalistic feelings are
</P>
<P>
   on the rise here and they have often turned discriminatory
towards minorities. Recently, Miss Croatia was dethroned after it
was discovered that she is Muslim. And one of the political parties
here used a picture of a Croatian Nazi leader on its posters during
recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Most in this fiercely Catholic country celebrated in October
when Pope John Paul II beatified a World War II priest often
accused of standing idly by while thousands were massacred.
Cardinal Alozije Stepinac converted hundreds of Jews and Orthodox
Christian Serbs to Catholicism during the war, leading some to say
he did what he could to save their lives and others to argue he
collaborated with the regime which had as its slogan, ``Kill a
third, expel a third, convert a third.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jews have not been the target of any recent discrimination
here and the government fought hard to recover the Jewish
treasures. The Horovics don't want to talk about the official and
unofficial nationalism in Croatia right now. Instead, they repeat
that they would not have recovered the treasures without the help
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   As each court in Zagreb agreed with the Horovics, Papo appealed
to the next higher court, until finally, in mid-1998, he had
exhausted all the courts in Croatia. A New York judge the decided
that the ruling from the Croatia Supreme Court would stand and the
treasures had to be returned to Dubrovnik. In mid-October, they
came home.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Horovic won't show them to visitors. As he climbs the narrow
staircase up to the
</P>
<P>
   synagogue, he talks about how carefully they must be protected.
He points out the cabinet where the most important torah will be
kept, once it is unpacked. He shows a visitor the bare hook hanging
from the ceiling where the candelabra will return. High on the
walls, grates hide small chambers where the community used to
insist women sit, hidden from the men of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the women sit in the back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, when they have services. There is only one rabbi in all
of Croatia, a country where there are only about 5,000 Jews --
living among 4.5 million predominantly Roman Catholic Croats.
Occasionally the synagogue in Dubrovnik holds lay services, without
a rabbi. But usually only for special holidays. With so few
members, many of them intermarried, there isn't much demand for
regular services.
</P>
<P>
   But Horovic and his daughter aren't concerned that the community
will die out. It's been
</P>
<P>
   smaller before. There were only about 10 Jews in Dubrovnik in
the 1980s. And no matter
</P>
<P>
   what, the tiny community will protect its treasures, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community of Dubrovnik has protected these
treasures for hundreds of
</P>
<P>
   years,'' Sabrina Horovic said. ``And we will protect them for
hundreds of years more.''

FINALLY, A PLACE TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT AREN'T POLITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why do white people smell like wet dogs when they come out of
the rain?'' asks Cass in Detroit. ``Why do black folks get agitated
when they see the Confederate flag?'' asks Wallace in Suwanee, Ga.
``Why do gay men feel they have to sound gay?'' asks Derek K. in
Duluth, Minn. ``Why do Asian women seem to date more white men than
Asian men?'' asks Victor in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't exactly the kinds of questions you'd overhear in
casual conversation at a crowded train station or in the grocery
checkout aisle. They're the kinds of things an adult might ponder
in private, but only a child would blurt out in a public place. But
they're also whispers on the Web, real questions posted in a
virtual forum where folks are encouraged to seek answers to
questions they'd be too embarrassed to pose in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing fancy or glamorous about this Web site. It's
simply called ``Y? The National Forum on People's Differences.'' It
doesn't offer gee-whiz plug-ins, real-time audio, or images that
gyrate with each click of your mouse. It's just simple text, page
after page of questions typed by users worldwide, from Delhi to
Duluth. And frankly, it's one of the most inventive uses of a
technology that is too often dismissed as a glorified toy or a
gigantic shopping mall. The Web site doesn't make any money, but it
might make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y?'' is the brainchild of one Phillip J. Milano, a workaday
newspaper editor for the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville.
Milano, 36, is a self-described ``white kid'' who grew up in the
posh suburb of Glen Ellyn, Ill. ``It was a pretty segregated place,
and I didn't have a lot of contact with too many people,'' Milano
recalls. ``There was one black kid in my high school class.'' The
fifth son of a metallurgical engineer and a homemaker, Milano was
always encouraged to ask questions _ on music or politics or art or
diversity. He was taught that curiosity is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he became an editor, he launched a project called the
National Diversity Newspaper Job Bank, an on-line clearinghouse for
positions at newspapers. Then last fall, he had a simple idea. What
if he started a Web site where folks could ask painfully
embarrassing questions in a safe, anonymous environment? What if he
asked others to answer those questions? He set up the computer in
his den, signed up for a Web address (www.yforum.com), and launched
the forum.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Milano wasn't sure it would work. Heck, he wasn't even
sure it was necessary. Are people really that isolated? But then
the questions started to trickle in, and folks started posting
responses. Then a startling query came across his screen: ``What
would take place during a typical weeknight in a black family?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a woman in Philadelphia who was so far removed from
other groups that she couldn't even imagine what it would be like
to live in a black household,'' Milano recalls. ``I went running to
my wife and said, `This is going to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   And it has worked. This low-tech site gets about 400,000 hits a
month, and has a loyal group of followers who check in daily, the
same way a sports fanatic turns to the ESPN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Clardy, an industrial engineer for Ford Motor Co. who
lives in Southfield, Mich., is one of those regulars. A single
mother who serves on Ford's diversity council and is a member of
its gay and lesbian employee group, she frequently posts answers to
questions about sexuality. ``Some of the questions really surprise
me,'' she says. ``I've never seen so many people who seem to think
other people smell funny. Where on earth do they get these ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that people have these ideas is the very reason Y?
Forum works. This isn't Oprah, where audience members do the
talk-show version of ``We Are the World.'' Nor is it one of those
canned ``town meetings'' on race, where the dialogue is as natural
as a snowman in Bali. The dialogue here can make your face turn
red, but it's also refreshingly honest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success, the Y? Forum hasn't been able to attract
many sponsors. Milano pays for the site and works on it late at
night, when his three children are asleep. That might change soon,
though. Milano just forged a partnership with a startup interactive
entertainment outfit called EnterMedia Network Co.; together,
they're going to launch a live version of the Y? Forum that starts
preproduction next week and launches in January. It will be a kind
of talk radio on the Web, where a panel will discuss diversity
issues in real time and users can participate in chat rooms and
fire off questions for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's nothing new about the concept of live chat on
line. But this isn't idle chatter. It's vital stuff. The question
here isn't why this forum exists. The question is simply, why did
it take so long for someone to think of it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's comforting to know that people like Milano are using the
Net to ask important questions. But what about Monica? What would
take place during a typical weeknight in her household?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was only a matter of time before someone launched the
``first full-scale Web biography'' of Lewinsky. Earlier this week,
a British on-line publisher called Atlantic Productions was hyping
``Monica: Behind the Myth,'' an on-line book about our own Helen of
the Oval Office. For about 3 British pounds (about $1.65), browsers
can see home movie footage of Lewinsky, and scroll through pictures
from her ``best friend's photo album.'' As a matter of principle,
the only pounds we're interested in losing are the ones we gained
at the dinner table yesterday, so we skipped the salacious details.
But inquiring minds can check it out at www.atlantpro.demon.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Search of the week. Monica scribblings aside, where do you find
real books on-line? A good place to start is at the Internet Public
Library (www.ipl.org), an extremely helpful site run by librarians
at the University of Michigan's School of Information. It starts
with this premise: ``The Internet is a mess. Since nobody runs it,
that's no surprise. There are a lot of interesting, worthwhile, and
valuable things out there _ and a lot that are a complete waste of
time.'' Run by librarians, the site sifts through the dreck and
suggests useful places to help folks find useful information. In
addition to exhaustive reference materials, it also has links to
more than 7,700 books on line, featuring the full texts of classic
and contemporary fiction and nonfiction. There's no time like a
holiday weekend to check out what people are saying about race at
the Y? Forum and then curl up at your computer and scroll through,
say, ``Great Expectations.''

THINKING SMALL, SMALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first machines run by the Microsoft CE operating system
started appearing a little less than two years ago, a lot of people
_ including me _ labeled them toys. The problem with the pocket
organizers was their size: They were simultaneously too big and too
small. That is, they were too big to fit into your pocket, but they
were so small that it was impossible to touch-type on their
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Let it never be said that Microsoft doesn't listen to its
customers and learn from its mistakes. In the time that has passed
Microsoft has taken the jewel that is Windows CE and, working with
hardware manufacturers, redeployed it onto two decidedly different
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Going in one direction, Microsoft shrank the screen and removed
the keyboard; the result is the new generation of palm-size
organizers like the $350 Phillips Nino, designed to compete
head-to-head with the 3Com Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time it was developing the tiny organizer,
Microsoft pushed Windows CE in the other direction and created a
new class of machines that look like a shrunken laptop. This
so-called Jupiter class combines the best features of Windows CE _
such as its ease-of-use, small memory size, and ability to run on
advanced low-power microprocessors _ with a keyboard you can type
on and a screen you can read.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's new Mobilion PV-5000 is one of the most respectable
machines in the class.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things that I like about the Mobilon PV-5000.
For starters, there is its weight _ just 2.7 pounds. Then there's
the price. While $900 is steep in terms of other palm-top
computers, it's cheap compared with other laptops. The PV-5000 has
a very readable 640-by-480 color screen and a built-in modem. It's
got a battery that lasts a whole day in use (Sharp claims eight
hours). It has a PCMCIA slot into which you can slide a digital
camera or a high-speed Ethernet card, both sold separately. And all
of that comes with 16 megabytes of RAM and a zippy MIPS 3000 RISC
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive, the PV-5000 comes with a huge amount of
built-in software. There's also an image editor and an MPEG audio
player. Like previous versions of Windows CE, the PV-5000 comes
with synchronization software that runs on your desktop machine and
lets you upload and download programs, files, names, addresses, and
more between the two.
</P>
<P>
   As an operating system, Windows CE has a lot of advantages over
its desktop cousin. For starters, the Mobilion doesn't need to
boot: Just press the power button and it is ready to go. It rarely
crashes, and when it does, it boots right back up.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Mobilion still doesn't do the one thing that I want:
I can't use it to replace my laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the problem is the software. Pocket Word has gotten a lot
better since I looked at it last; for example, the program can now
open standard Microsoft Word 97 files. But the program still lacks
important features that are needed by serious writers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there are problems that prevent me from creating
complex documents. I can create a bulleted list or a numbered list,
for example, but they can't be multilevel lists. I can't
auto-number my outlines. I can't create tables. I can't even create
page headers and page footers.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Internet Explorer is another problem. Web pages look
wrong, because the layout engine doesn't work the same way it does
in the desktop version. And running on the Mobilion Pocket IE is
very slow. Sharp says the unit has a 33.6 modem, but it seemed the
Web pages were downloading at 14.4 or slower. That's because the
modem is synthesized in software, robbing important CPU power from
other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The PV-5000's keyboard has problems too. Of course the keys need
to be small. But the placement of the keys is far from optimal. The
row of function keys along the keyboard's top row jump you from
application to application, which can be most infuriating when you
accidentally tap them while typing.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new piece of technology there are a few minor
integration problems. For example, I keep getting an error message
that says ``Your backup battery is low or missing,'' and then
warning me about losing data, even though the PC also says that my
``backup battery is good.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, I was impressed with how sturdy the technology
seems to be. Ultimately, I can see this machine being very popular
among high school and college students. But without a companion
desktop machine, this Windows CE device would be significantly less
useful.

SOME SAY CHEAP OIL WILL SOON BE A MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil prices are so low these days that Americans buy gas-guzzling
sport utility vehicles with impunity and ditch wood stoves they
once installed to save energy. Meanwhile, the oil industry feels
the pain, as Exxon plans to buy Mobil to cut costs _ and an
estimated 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But enjoy the oil glut now, because Earth's conventional crude
oil reserves are almost half gone, according to several energy
analysts. Sometime early in the next century, they predict oil
output will begin to decline, ushering in an age of rising fuel
prices and, possibly, political tension.
</P>
<P>
   Already, global oil consumption far outstrips discovery of new
oil fields, and countries such as the US and Canada are past their
peak output. Meanwhile, OPEC nations, whose embargo on sales to the
US caused drastic price hikes in the 1970s, are seizing a bigger
share of the oil market again, potentially increasing their ability
to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always will be more oil to be found, but it's not going
to make up the difference of what is being extracted,'' warns James
J. MacKenzie of the World Resources Institute, a Washington think
tank, who expects the oil decline to begin between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say that MacKenzie is too gloomy, but even they
agree that consumers worldwide are enjoying a rare bubble that has
to pop eventually. The collapse of Asian economies last year
reduced global demand for oil, while OPEC has been unable to limit
its members' output, flooding the world with oil.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, average gas prices in the US dipped below $1 a
gallon last month, lower in inflation-adjusted terms than in 1973,
when the OPEC oil embargo started what became known as the Energy
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are short term circumstances because of the problems in
Asia and some warm weather and a complete failure by OPEC members
to be able to do anything about it,'' said Henry Jacoby, an energy
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The US Energy Information Administration anticipates a 60
percent increase in world oil prices by 2007 as the Asian economies
recover and today's artificially low prices disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of an end to cheap oil is largely lost on
American consumers for the moment as US energy demand, and oil
imports, approach 1973 levels. Almost half of US oil consumption
fuels our vehicles, which have been getting lower fuel efficiency
as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles surge in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite mounting concern that carbon dioxide from burning
fossil fuels may be warming the planet, there is no end in sight to
growing demand. The Energy Information Administration forecasts
that carbon dioxide releases from US energy use will be 47 percent
above 1990 levels by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are scared witless about trying to reduce oil
demand or even trying to control it. They'd rather go to war than
do that,'' said MacKenzie, author of the book ``Car Trouble,''
which calls for alternative vehicle fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, doomsday forecasters have been predicting that oil
would run out for decades, only to be proven wrong by new
discoveries or improved oil recovery technologies. Today, oil
companies say that proven oil reserves are sufficient to last for
decades, not counting oil-laced sands and other unconventional
sources that could be tapped at a higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   But two longtime oil industry geologists sent shock waves
through the industry earlier this year when they predicted that
worldwide oil production would reach its peak within 10 years as
humans depleted the most easily accessible oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrere, both 40-year oil
industry veterans with Petroconsultants of Geneva, estimate that
humans have consumed 800 billion barrels of oil so far, leaving
perhaps 1 billion barrels still in the ground. With demand rising
more than 2 percent a year, they predicted that oil companies would
pass the 50 percent depletion mark in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As the oil supply shrinks, they said, prices will rise, and OPEC
nations such as Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern states could
control 50 percent of the world's oil business, giving them greater
power to increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is not running out of oil _ at least not yet. What
our society does face, and soon, is the end of the abundant and
cheap oil on which all our industrial nations depend,'' wrote
Campbell and Laherrere in the magazine Scientific American in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The pair called for rapid development of energy alternatives
such as nuclear power, renewable energy and conservation to ``help
postpone the inevitable decline of conventional oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts saw Campbell and Laherrere's article as the
latest version of ``The Poverty of Power'' and other books that
have wrongly foreseen the end of big oil. Critics said they had
overlooked new technology that allows oil companies to drill in
places such as the rough seas off Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin Campbell is fostering a fraud on the public,'' said
MIT's Jacoby. ``He is looking at the wrong numbers. He is not
taking account . . . of all these resources out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Campbell and Laherrere are wrong, however, consumers
have reason to worry that oil prices will rise in the years to come
from such factors as government efforts to cut fossil fuel
emissions and the reduced competition that comes when the nation's
largest oil company merges with the second largest.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the two energy consultants are right, they argue, ``the
next oil crunch will not be so temporary.''

<P>
   Aside from the six weeks of the Persian Gulf war, Americans have
known peace for longer than the interval between Versailles and
Pearl Harbor. For the first time since the early 1930s, we face no
single powerful enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. Since nations no
longer need our protection from the Soviet Union, our international
leverage, despite our strength, is not what it was in an earlier
day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the demands upon us have not lessened. Like a
kaleidoscope, the patterns of world affairs shift with each spin of
the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old problems
reemerge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and I, as well as other members of our team,
have spoken often about the goals of American foreign policy.
Boiled down, these have not changed in more than 200 years. They
are to ensure the continued security, prosperity and freedom of our
people.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy, unlike baseball, has no world championship;
there are no permanent victories and no 70th home runs. In our era,
moreover, neither the adversaries, nor the rules, nor even the
location of the playing field are fully fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if our dynamic world were to stop for a snapshot today,
it would be possible, very generally and imperfectly, to discern
four basic categories of countries: full members of the
international system; those in transition, seeking to participate
more fully; those too weak, poor or mired in conflict to
participate in a meaningful way; and those that reject the very
rules and precepts upon which the system is based.
</P>
<P>
   This division carries with it a corresponding four-part
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ First and foremost, we must strengthen the bonds between and
prevent ruptures among the leading nations. Today, these nations
are at peace and increasingly share a community of interests. This
serves America by contributing to stability, fostering vibrant
economic relationships and having partners available to respond to
regional and global problems.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs is, however, not inherently
self-sustaining. Russia is wrestling with severe economic and
political challenges. China's course, despite hopeful signs, is
uncertain. And we must work hard to maintain fully productive
partnerships even with our closest friends, for history warns us of
the risk to alliances once the threat that brought them together
has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Our top priority remains cementing key relationships and
harnessing them to constructive ends _ including collaboration with
Europe in strengthening NATO and building peace in Bosnia;
cooperation with Korea, Japan and China in talks aimed at lasting
peace on the Korean peninsula; and using the Summit of the Americas
to forge a hemispheric consensus supporting democracy and the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we must fortify the international system by helping
transitional or otherwise troubled states become full participants.
This is essential to maintain the momentum of democracy's recent
advances and create more anchors of regional stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, we are encouraging rivals in areas such as the
Middle East and South Asia to settle their differences peacefully.
We are helping our friends in central Europe and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union navigate financial
minefields, fend off criminals, rebut communist backsliders and
position their societies for entry into key regional institutions.
Worldwide, we are urging every nation to move toward democracy and
abide by global norms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we must give a boost to weaker states that are most
willing to help themselves. In this era, there are no geographic
barriers to full participation in the global economy or, more
generally, in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But burdens of debt, poverty, unresolved disputes and
ineffective institutions leave many nations at the margins.
Accordingly, we are trying to help Haiti overcome divisions and
build its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the Caucasus to the Congo, we are engaged with regional
leaders and international organizations trying to end destructive
conflicts. And we have urged Congress to enact the Africa Growth
and Opportunity Act, which emphasizes trade as a complement to aid,
rewards reform and heralds a more self-reliant and prosperous
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, we must repel threats to the system of laws and
relationships that affect the security of all nations. We have
created monitoring and inspection regimes to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons and poison gas while imposing penalties on those
who violate global standards.
</P>
<P>
   We are working hard to halt the proliferation of advanced
missile technologies while developing theater and national
missile-defense systems to defend ourselves. In the Balkans and
elsewhere, we are supporting the advocates of moderation and
tolerance against the ruthless exploiters of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   And we are seeking, through relentless diplomacy and tough law
enforcement, to create a multilayered web of agreements, laws,
inspectors, police and military power to deny weapons and operating
room to terrorists, criminals and aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in order to protect our interests, we must take
actions, forge agreements, create institutions and provide an
example that will help bring the world closer together around the
basic principles of democracy, open markets, law and a commitment
to peace.
</P>
<P>
   If we succeed, the American people will benefit from a world
economy that has regained its footing and resumed broad-based
growth. We will find it safer, easier and more rewarding to trade,
travel, invest and study abroad. And our armed forces will be
called upon less often to respond to urgent and deadly threats.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, more people in more nations will recognize
their stake in abiding by the international rules of the road and
seeing that others follow suit. Nations will be more likely to work
together to respond to new dangers, prevent conflicts and solve
global problems.
</P>
<P>
   A salutary consensus about what is fair and unfair on trade and
what is right and wrong on human rights will grow. Although the
most we can hope for, in our time, is to build a solid foundation
for such a world, that is nevertheless a tall order.

FIDELITY IS TOPS IN BUYING BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes big stocks trading text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has your mutual fund gotten big?
</P>
<P>
   We don't necessarily mean the the size of the fund. We're
talking about the size of the stocks it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Big has been beautiful in the stock market for years. Big
stocks, particularly those that dominate the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index, continue to run circles around the rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   We've written about how some funds at Fidelity Investments have
bulked up on big stocks like General Electric, Microsoft, and
Intel. But we lacked a good tool to closely measure individual
funds and compare them to competitors across town and around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   We just got our hands on a computer software program called
Overlap, which can measure mutual funds against one another and
calculate the degree to which their equity investments overlap.
Using the Vanguard Index 500 fund as a proxy for the S&AMP;P 500 index,
we ran virtually every growth mutual fund of any size in Boston
through the process.
</P>
<P>
   The actively managed local fund with the greatest similarity to
the Vanguard 500 Index fund: Fidelity Magellan, with a 54 percent
overlap. The next six locally run funds of any size, ranked by
percentage overall, were also Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   We knew a number of Fidelity funds would be high on the list.
The surprise: the degree to which Fidelity funds dominated.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven different Fidelity funds showed an overlap of at
least 40 percent. We could find only one local fund not run by
Fidelity that cracked the 40 percent barrier. The giant Putnam Fund
for Growth and Income weighed in at 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured the overlap in the world's 20 largest mutual
funds. Magellan and Fidelity Growth &AMP; Income, with a 46 percent
overlap, ran first and second on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother measuring funds for their resemblance to the S&AMP;P 500?
Funds that bulk up on high-flying big stocks tend to come under
scrutiny by analysts who wonder whether managers are drifting away
from their stated investment style to chase bigger returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst cases, some fund managers are accused of being
closet indexers. Or are they just doing what investors pay for:
finding stocks that are going to appreciate the most?
</P>
<P>
   Most Boston-based mutual fund companies field a roster of
actively managed stock funds with overlaps ranging from 20 percent
to 40 percent, according to our calculations. Often small stock or
micro-cap funds generated lower overlap figures.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Financial Services, Pioneer Group, Scudder Kemper
Investments' Scudder funds, and State Street Research and
Management each had only one sizable fund with an S&AMP;P 500 overlap
of 30 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what managers are getting paid for; they should be
making investments they think can outperform the competition, which
is the S&AMP;P 500,'' said Kevin Parke, chief equity officer at MFS.
</P>
<P>
   We heard similar comments from David Eisenberg, chief equity
strategist at John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity isn't talking to us these days, but the last time we
chatted with funds chief Robert Pozen he made several points about
big stocks. He said there was no big-stock mandate issued from
above, that fund managers were making their own decisions, and, in
every case, big-stock buyers were well within the limits of their
funds' investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   Other Fidelity watchers tend to agree. ``Even at (Magellan's) 54
percent, that still leaves you a lot of leg room,'' said James
Lowell, editor of the Fidelity Investor newsletter. ``It's a very
prudent way to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Fidelity's big-stock investing has been concentrated
among the very largest of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks. Fidelity is the
largest institutional investor in six of the 10 largest S&AMP;P 500
stocks and tops in each of the four biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those stocks have been driving the S&AMP;P for the last couple
of years and the (performance) concentration is getting higher, why
not own them?'' said William Dougherty of Boston-based fund tracker
Kanon Bloch Carre.
</P>
<P>
   One other rationale: Many of Fidelity's funds are so big they
have to own lots of the largest, most liquid stocks available.
</P>
<P>
   A word about Overlap. Created by Bill Chennault, a Kansas City,
Kan., college administrator, it provides lots of information but is
not perfect. Data about specific funds is limited to the percentage
of assets that overlap and can be slightly dated. Most of the
Overlap information about local funds was based on portfolio data
from the spring and summer, but went back to January in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Overlap was really created for avid investors and financial
planners to determine whether funds in a portfolio own too much of
the same things and mask a lack of diversification.

BRUINS' BATES STILL GETS NOWHERE FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If speed alone equaled success, Shawn Bates might be
dominating the NHL today with his piston-like legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed kills,'' the 23-year-old center/wing likes to say. ``If
I can use it at the right time, it will only benefit me.''
</P>
<P>
   So went the brief conversation between Bates and Bruins coach
Pat Burns at the Bruins' practice rink outside of Boston Wednesday.
Burns talked. Bates listened. The conversation moved from
ice-filled rink to open, greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your speed's worth a million bucks,'' Burns told the former
Boston University standout after practice. ``But it's like the
farmer with the tractor out in the fields. Out there alone with no
one around him, he looks just fine. But take that tractor out on
Route 93 at 7:30 in the morning ... now that's a different story
altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Bates was doing a fine job in Providence, where he
was leading the Baby B's in scoring (12-8_20 in 15 games), but now
it's time for him to show that he can apply his speed and finesse
north of Providence. It's time to get his game in gear and make
certain the clutch doesn't slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to use my legs and I've got to be smart about when
I'm using them,'' said Bates, who is expected to play on a line
with Anson Carter and Steve Heinze Saturday night when the Penguins
visit the FleetCenter. ``What it comes down to, I guess, is
one-on-one battles. Whether I'm forechecking, backchecking,
whatever _ I've got to beat their guy to the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns wanted to roll Bates out with Carter and Heinze Tuesday
night during the 1-1 tie with the Canucks, but the flu kept Bates
from playing what would have been his third game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to give Batesie a good shot,'' said Burns,
whose lineup always is in need of offensive enhancements, viable
options for a No. 2 scoring line behind Jason Allison-Sergei
Samsonov-Dmitri Khristich. ``He's got NHL speed, no question, and
he's also got a heck of a shot. Speed's the key, though. He flies
around out there in the drills, and then when the game comes, he
seems to get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates earned a shot at the big time last September, his first
training camp out of BU, when he impressed the coaching staff with
his speed and his determination to dig along the boards and in the
corners. A couple of weeks into the season, his game dipped, his
legs stopped moving, and on Nov. 14, 1997, he was standing in
Providence with his big-time dream about to turn into a minor
league morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there and didn't have a solid year, so that didn't
help me,'' he recalled. ``That caused me to do a lot of thinking
over the summer, and I came in determined to go all out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Right thought. Wrong outcome. Midway through training camp, he
was dished back to the minors. But on Nov. 14 _ exactly one year
after his demotion last season _ he was summoned again to Boston,
with Burns immdediately reminding him to keep those legs moving
because there are only so many invitations to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can go out there and be a pain in everyone's neck, it
will get me in the lineup, I think,'' said Bates, who was crowned
the club's fastest skater in Sunday's skills competition,
completing one lap around the rink in 13.619 seconds. ``And show up
here every day ready to go, show in practice that you really
care.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same kind of prodding Burns applies to
sensation-in-waiting Joe Thornton. A year plus removed from junior
hockey, Thornton's game moves along in fits and starts. One night
he appears on the brink of getting it all together, his Berlitz
course of the boards finally making sense. The next night,
suddenly, everything's Greek to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're two opposites,'' said Burns. ``Batesie realizes he
has to do something, so he starts skating and does the wrong thing.
Away from the puck, he panics. Then there's Joe, who realizes he's
got to do something, but he just stops ... just stops and looks.
They're getting it, but they've got to keep at it.''

<P>
   The recent, brutal civil wars in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and
the Congo make plain the need to prosecute amoral leaders who show
no care for civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   At least, this seemed to be America's position for the last four
years as Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright touted the
establishment of the International Criminal Court as a key
foreign-policy aim.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in July 1998, when the draft treaty to create the ICC
was approved in Rome, the United States found itself in a nasty
minority, siding with Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Qatar against the
court. (The final vote was 120 in favor, 7 opposed and 21
abstentions.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's concerns were serious and legitimate.
American troops are deployed across the globe, and should not be
put in a position of having to face the added danger of politically
motivated prosecutions. But more broadly, the administration failed
to think through or effectively articulate its position.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, wary of a skeptical Congress, the
White House dithered. Though international meetings on the ICC
began in 1994, the United States failed to decide key issues _
would it back the court? under what terms? _ until the president's
return from China in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, four weeks into the five-week U.N. final conference,
were cabinet debates resolved and instructions issued to the
American negotiating team. But by then it was too late to convince
frustrated allies to accommodate new U.S. demands _ a case study in
how not to conduct multilateral diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   True, the evaluation of the court's ultimate potential (and
whether America should join), as well as the court's future, will
hinge on the sound choice of a prosecutor and judges, and the
enunciation of prosecutorial priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an historic opportunity to shape the court in America's
image was lost. What we got instead was a court America cannot
agree to _ at least not until its good faith has been tested over
years.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Rome conference was inauspicious for the
United States. After triumph at the Ottawa land-mines conference _
where they brushed aside U.S. military needs in Korea _ a caucus of
so-called like-minded states, under Canadian and Norwegian
leadership, demanded an unfettered court. Thus the unity of
traditional NATO allies was pried apart.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the European Union had also hailed an independent
court as the hallmark of its post-Bosnia try for a unified foreign
and security policy. The Germans, French and even the British
(citing the ``ethical dimension'' of Tony Blair's foreign policy)
went to Rome ready to abandon America in their race for European
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In its fateful decision to vote against the treaty, the United
States complained of having been rebuffed on two issues. Yet these
issues were, in fact, red herrings, since they added little to the
risks the Americans were already willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. negotiators made no objection to the complaint system that
allows any state party, friend or foe, to refer investigations to
the court without Security Council approval. Yet Washington
vehemently opposed an independent prosecutor out of fear he might
start investigations on his own motion, subject only to court
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American team pushed to broaden the treaty's
probationary period. The Rome conference established that for the
first seven years, states need only accept the court's power over
genocide and crimes against humanity (though at the end, countries
must accept war-crimes coverage as well or quit the treaty). The
United States argued for a 10-year probationary period and to
exclude coverage of crimes against humanity during that time.
</P>
<P>
   But this would not have eliminated the risks to American troops.
A rogue state bent on harrying Americans will use any available
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the treaty's protections, it is possible that hostile
states will file complaints against American troops and civilian
leaders to settle political scores. U.S. military decisions _ in
peacekeeping, antiterrorist enforcement, freedom-of-navigation
exercises and strategic deterrence _ will be scrutinized by those
hoping to show that an American use of force was disproportionate
or improper (and thus criminal).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ICC treaty bars formal amendments for the
first seven years and forbids individual reservations (opt-outs by
countries). And the prospect of early alterations is unlikely,
given the hostility that lingers toward the United States, in
countries that made hard concessions at Rome only then to see
America reject the entire treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has declared war on the ICC for not giving ``100 percent
protection'' from prosecution to American GIs. Indeed, exposure of
U.S. troops and commanders to judgment by an international court
free to decide for itself what is a ``disproportionate'' use of
force (and hence a war crime) should concern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms must be persuaded that flaws in Rome can be
constructively addressed, protecting American interests without
abandoning America's leadership role. The power and prestige of the
United States would be enhanced if it helped improve the ICC,
rather than retreating in dismay. A preparatory session, already
scheduled for next year to hammer out rules of evidence and
procedure, might be a good place to start addressing American
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Effective authority in international politics requires power as
well as legitimacy. The international tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia has found that its orders are paid little heed unless
the United States and its allies lend their diplomatic, economic
and military muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure defendants, evidence and funding, the new
court must rely on the goodwill of many states _ but foremost among
them, the world's one remaining superpower. Unless it acts
scrupulously, the court will never win financial backing. The ad
hoc tribunal for the former Yugoslavia runs an annual budget of $70
million, while its counterpart for Rwanda struggles by with $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Many states hope that the United Nations will fund the new court
in its first years of operation. But this again devolves to the
United States, as the deep pocket that supplies a quarter of the
world body's budget (if and when it pays its dues). While other
states will resist explicit American conditions on tribunal funding
(thanks to the ongoing U.N. dues battle), they must recognize that
the United States will never bankroll an abusive court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military role in international security will not be
altered by the evangelism of an international court. After all, the
court was set up to address the horrors of contemporary civil wars,
not cut down America's preeminence in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the United States should learn some long-range
lessons from its missteps at Rome. For one, Americans must realize
that their allies no longer view them as indispensable, and that if
America stonewalls, it may get left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating vital matters should not be left to the last minute,
to the chaos of open conferences and the mystery of working groups
from which Americans may be excluded. This includes raising issues
well in advance through NATO and other alliance channels, and
through quiet contacts in national capitals at a political level
where flexibility remains possible.
</P>
<P>
   And Rome should teach American diplomats not to start listening
to Capitol Hill so late in the game, once thoughts turn to
ratification, but to take Congress seriously and heed its warnings
early on, at the start of the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   America will get other chances to lead the battle against war
crimes. But foresighted diplomacy, not always shown in preparation
for Rome, will be required.
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity for action arises, the United States should
have its mind already made up, so it may lead future negotiations
and not just lamely follow them.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The memory of a brief conversation nags me whenever I think
about Asia's future. The conversation took place shortly after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, during a secret meeting with a leader
of China's underground democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   We met in a quiet corner of a Beijing restaurant, where he
tapped the table suspiciously to see if it was bugged. This was a
man whose vision I admired, so I listened intently when the
waitress stepped away and he leaned forward to disclose his plans
for promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese businessmen. That'll scare them
so they won't invest here. And then the government will really be
screwed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're serious. We can't demonstrate these days and
we can't publish. The only thing we can do for democracy is kill
Japanese businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   I protested that it seemed odd to promote human rights by
murdering innocent businessmen. But he just smiled at my
narrow-mindedness, with a ``you-will-never-understand-Asia'' grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Japanese,'' my friend said dismissively. ``Japanese
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   He never did kill anyone. But the vitriol in his voice
underscored Asia's historical tensions, which are especially
intractable because they exist between peoples, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia has seemed remarkably peaceful since the end of the
Vietnam War, the peace is a fragile one, concealing dormant
antagonisms and disputes that could still erupt. Now the recent
economic crisis has increased the risk of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With nations as with households, tempers fray when the money
runs out. And insecure regimes may try to boost their legitimacy by
picking a fight, distracting discontented citizens with military
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tension in Asia lies Japan's failure to
apologize meaningfully for its wartime brutality. While anti-Japan
sentiment among the Chinese and Koreans has deeper roots, it
largely derives from Japan's behavior before and during World War
II. Japan must therefore come to grips with its past before the
region can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Americans (not to mention the Japanese) to fathom
how deep the historical fault lines run. Some assume that Asia's
resentment of Japan will die with the World War II generation. In
another decade, they think, with the old folks gone, the issue will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that should visit a certain hill in Kyoto,
one few Japanese know of and few guidebooks mention. Of course,
every Korean knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ear Mound, it contains the ears and noses of perhaps
100,000 of their countrymen whom Japanese warriors slaughtered in
the late 16th century. The few Japanese who have heard of it
consider the Ear Mound a grisly but irrelevant relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious
by the standards of the time,'' argued a plaque at the site in the
1960s (eventually removed after Koreans complained). To most
Koreans, however, the Ear Mound is another example of Japanese
brutality _ and Japan's reluctance to face up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Japan continues to simmer in its former victims in
Asia, from Indochina to Indonesia. The hostility is only moderate
in most Asian nations, and almost nonexistent in Taiwan, but
remains dangerously intense in Korea and China. The signs are
everywhere in these two countries. When foreigners learn Chinese,
they are sometimes taught that the character ``hen,'' for hatred,
represents the feeling Chinese have for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Korea, in violation of trading rules, bans the
import of Japanese books, movies and magazines. Elderly Koreans,
schooled in Japanese during the occupation, often refuse to speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment has provoked minor crises. When a Beijing
newspaper ran an expose on Chinese waitresses kneeling to serve men
in Japanese restaurants _ as do all waitresses in fine Japanese
restaurants _ a wave of public fury arose at the idea of Chinese
prostrate before their ancient enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Tianjin, four Chinese employees of a Japanese
software company refused to work on a computer game about World War
II, which they denounced as a monument to Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The four became local heroes when the company threatened to fire
them, and the Japanese eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Beijing newspaper poll, 51 percent of Chinese
rank Japanese businesses as the least desirable employers. Only 4
percent cite American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many Chinese and Koreans hate Japan? World War II is
an obvious explanation, as is Japan's stubborn failure to show
contrition for its behavior. Japan has never adequately apologized
for the war. Indeed, a sizable segment of the population feels
little remorse and vehemently opposes any apology.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, especially in rural areas, firmly believe their
country did nothing particularly bad during the first half of this
century. Seisuke Okuno, a former cabinet minister who led 161
members of the Diet (Japan's legislature) in opposing an apology
for World War II, suggests that if any country is guilty of war
crimes it is the United States, for dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's purpose for invading its neighbors was, he insists,
entirely noble: ``These countries had been colonized and oppressed
by whites. Our purpose was to free and stabilize them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this view was dramatically demonstrated by the
success of the film ``Pride,'' Japan's biggest box-office hit of
early 1998, which paints wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo as a
national hero. Tojo comes off as a kind and honorable man, thrust
into war by the West and then unfairly executed as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   While real questions remain about the fairness of the Allied
war-crimes tribunals, one cannot imagine such a movie being made
about Hitler or Goebbels, or even a similar depiction of General
Westmoreland and the American role in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese diplomats insist that movies like ``Pride'' are merely
a tribute to pluralism, and that their country has apologized many
times for its wartime conduct. But Japan's statements of regret
always end up sounding hollow and calculating, as if they come from
some committee in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama did make a genuine
effort to wrench a forthright apology from the Diet, but the result
only undermined the party line on Japan's supposed contrition.
Drafters of the resolution replaced the word ``apology'' with
``hansei,'' and ``aggressive acts'' with ``aggressive-like acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, legislators ascribed the acts in question to all
countries, not just Japan. Even in this gutted form, only 230
members of the 511-seat chamber voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing at the start
and end of every conversation and many times in between _ which
makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even more remarkable.
If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a nuisance, even when
they are not, why will they not show regret for the slaughter of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   Apart from cultural explanations, such as a Confucian reluctance
to speak critically of one's elders, there is a more obvious
answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling
to see the upstart outstrip its tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, of course, is not the only continent where the past
overshadows the present. French-German rivalry plagued modern
Europe for decades, making stability impossible until that
relationship improved. Like France and Germany in the interwar
years, China and Japan now stare suspiciously at each other across
a gulf of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   High stakes freight every American action in Asia with intense
symbolic value. Thus the recent U.S. effort to boost military
cooperation with Japan sent China into a sulk. And Japan felt
snubbed when President Clinton flew to Beijing but neglected to
drop by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering Asian fear of Japan, while irrational, remains genuine
and can shape policy. According to Chinese officials, China
downgraded Russia as a security threat at the end of the Cold War
while upgrading Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as is now known, the West drifted close to war with
North Korea _ though few Americans realized it at the time _ and
probably only the intervention of Jimmy Carter prevented armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States prepared for battle, it quickly became
clear that Japan could not be counted on to negotiate a solution or
give military support. It even was unclear whether Japan would lend
doctors to treat wounded GIs or send ships and planes to help
rescue Americans in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, Germany was forced long ago to confront its past;
victim countries like France and Israel scrutinized every German
statement and protested when dissatisfied. Until recently, Japan
never faced such scrutiny, thanks in part to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cold War over and Asia fracturing, the United
States should encourage Japan to confront its responsibility,
apologize and provide some redress to its former sex slaves and
other victims who are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far Japan has refused to pay official compensation to the
``comfort women,'' insisting that such issues have already been
settled on a government-to-government level.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has some legal, but no humanitarian, basis. A
forthright Japanese apology and an attempt to help its victims
would allow Japan to play a more important international role.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, most Americans held virulently racist
opinions of the Japanese, much worse than the stereotypes held by
Chinese or Koreans today. A 1944 poll found that 13 percent of
Americans favored the extermination of all Japanese people after
the war (the question was never asked about Germans), and according
to another poll from late 1945, 23 percent of Americans regretted
that Japan had surrendered before more atomic bombs could be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such hatred, American racism toward Japan has largely
dissipated in the years since the war. Japan surrendered and
accepted American occupation and involvement. The bond subsequently
forged between these former adversaries has come to be described as
the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan could overcome American racism in 1945, it can overcome
the animosities that linger in Asia in 1998.

<P>
   The memory of a brief conversation nags me whenever I think
about Asia's future. The conversation took place shortly after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, during a secret meeting with a leader
of China's underground democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   We met in a quiet corner of a Beijing restaurant, where he
tapped the table suspiciously to see if it was bugged. This was a
man whose vision I admired, so I listened intently when the
waitress stepped away and he leaned forward to disclose his plans
for promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese businessmen. That'll scare them
so they won't invest here. And then the government will really be
screwed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're serious. We can't demonstrate these days and
we can't publish. The only thing we can do for democracy is kill
Japanese businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   I protested that it seemed odd to promote human rights by
murdering innocent businessmen. But he just smiled at my
narrow-mindedness, with a ``you-will-never-understand-Asia'' grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Japanese,'' my friend said dismissively. ``Japanese
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   He never did kill anyone. But the vitriol in his voice
underscored Asia's historical tensions, which are especially
intractable because they exist between peoples, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia has seemed remarkably peaceful since the end of the
Vietnam War, the peace is a fragile one, concealing dormant
antagonisms and disputes that could still erupt. Now the recent
economic crisis has increased the risk of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With nations as with households, tempers fray when the money
runs out. And insecure regimes may try to boost their legitimacy by
picking a fight, distracting discontented citizens with military
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tension in Asia lies Japan's failure to
apologize meaningfully for its wartime brutality. While anti-Japan
sentiment among the Chinese and Koreans has deeper roots, it
largely derives from Japan's behavior before and during World War
II. Japan must therefore come to grips with its past before the
region can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Americans (not to mention the Japanese) to fathom
how deep the historical fault lines run. Some assume that Asia's
resentment of Japan will die with the World War II generation. In
another decade, they think, with the old folks gone, the issue will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that should visit a certain hill in Kyoto,
one few Japanese know of and few guidebooks mention. Of course,
every Korean knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ear Mound, it contains the ears and noses of perhaps
100,000 of their countrymen whom Japanese warriors slaughtered in
the late 16th century. The few Japanese who have heard of it
consider the Ear Mound a grisly but irrelevant relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious
by the standards of the time,'' argued a plaque at the site in the
1960s (eventually removed after Koreans complained). To most
Koreans, however, the Ear Mound is another example of Japanese
brutality _ and Japan's reluctance to face up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Japan continues to simmer in its former victims in
Asia, from Indochina to Indonesia. The hostility is only moderate
in most Asian nations, and almost nonexistent in Taiwan, but
remains dangerously intense in Korea and China. The signs are
everywhere in these two countries. When foreigners learn Chinese,
they are sometimes taught that the character ``hen,'' for hatred,
represents the feeling Chinese have for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Korea, in violation of trading rules, bans the
import of Japanese books, movies and magazines. Elderly Koreans,
schooled in Japanese during the occupation, often refuse to speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment has provoked minor crises. When a Beijing
newspaper ran an expose on Chinese waitresses kneeling to serve men
in Japanese restaurants _ as do all waitresses in fine Japanese
restaurants _ a wave of public fury arose at the idea of Chinese
prostrate before their ancient enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Tianjin, four Chinese employees of a Japanese
software company refused to work on a computer game about World War
II, which they denounced as a monument to Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The four became local heroes when the company threatened to fire
them, and the Japanese eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Beijing newspaper poll, 51 percent of Chinese
rank Japanese businesses as the least desirable employers. Only 4
percent cite American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many Chinese and Koreans hate Japan? World War II is
an obvious explanation, as is Japan's stubborn failure to show
contrition for its behavior. Japan has never adequately apologized
for the war. Indeed, a sizable segment of the population feels
little remorse and vehemently opposes any apology.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, especially in rural areas, firmly believe their
country did nothing particularly bad during the first half of this
century. Seisuke Okuno, a former cabinet minister who led 161
members of the Diet (Japan's legislature) in opposing an apology
for World War II, suggests that if any country is guilty of war
crimes it is the United States, for dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's purpose for invading its neighbors was, he insists,
entirely noble: ``These countries had been colonized and oppressed
by whites. Our purpose was to free and stabilize them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this view was dramatically demonstrated by the
success of the film ``Pride,'' Japan's biggest box-office hit of
early 1998, which paints wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo as a
national hero. Tojo comes off as a kind and honorable man, thrust
into war by the West and then unfairly executed as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   While real questions remain about the fairness of the Allied
war-crimes tribunals, one cannot imagine such a movie being made
about Hitler or Goebbels, or even a similar depiction of General
Westmoreland and the American role in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese diplomats insist that movies like ``Pride'' are merely
a tribute to pluralism, and that their country has apologized many
times for its wartime conduct. But Japan's statements of regret
always end up sounding hollow and calculating, as if they come from
some committee in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama did make a genuine
effort to wrench a forthright apology from the Diet, but the result
only undermined the party line on Japan's supposed contrition.
Drafters of the resolution replaced the word ``apology'' with
``hansei,'' and ``aggressive acts'' with ``aggressive-like acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, legislators ascribed the acts in question to all
countries, not just Japan. Even in this gutted form, only 230
members of the 511-seat chamber voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing at the start
and end of every conversation and many times in between _ which
makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even more remarkable.
If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a nuisance, even when
they are not, why will they not show regret for the slaughter of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   Apart from cultural explanations, such as a Confucian reluctance
to speak critically of one's elders, there is a more obvious
answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>

   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling

ANTI-EPILEPSY PILL SHOWS PROMISE IN ADDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPTON, N.Y. _ A small white pill, available as antiepilepsy
medicine in 60 countries but banned in the United States, might
help control cravings for cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, and even
cigarettes, according to several scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many drug treatments, the scientists say, the pill _ at
least in tests with animals _ does not seem to be addictive, nor
does it produce the withdrawal pains of other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists emphasized that the pill is no magic bullet.
It has not been tested on humans, who often respond to experimental
drugs differently from animals.
</P>
<P>
   If human trials prove successful, a patient must want to quit
the addiction, the scientists said. Even then, most patients would
need to supplement the pill with drug counseling to prevent a
relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, announced Wednesday by scientists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, Long Island, is generating
more excitement among drug researchers than any medical news in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
which funds 85 percent of the world's research on addiction, called
the finding ``exciting and dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most antinarcotic medicines work, at best, against one drug.
Methadone, for example, blocks the craving for heroin, but only
heroin. The significance of the Brookhaven study, Leshner said, is
that it uncovers and suggests a way to attack a ``common essence of
addiction.'' Many drug abusers are addicted to more than one
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Conan Korentsky, professor of pharmacology at Boston
University's School of Medicine, who has worked on drug treatments
for 50 years, has replicated some of Brookhaven's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the drugs that have come up'' to treat addiction, he
said, the pill tested here, known as gamma-vinyl GABA, or GVG, and
sold under the name Vigabatrin, ``looks very interesting, more
interesting than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   GVG works by blocking sharp increases in the levels of dopamine,
a chemical in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have dopamine,'' said Stephen Dewey, chief author of a
paper that details the Brookhaven experiment. It was published
Wednesday in the scientific journal Synapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `feel-good' neuro-transmitter . . . the thing that
lets us feel pleasure after a good meal or a fun movie,'' Dewey
said.
</P>
<P>
   When pushed to extremely high levels, dopamine induces euphoria,
a high that, at first, makes a person want to experience it again
and again, until the desire becomes a craving beyond control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like most, if not all, drugs of addiction raise
dopamine levels,'' Dewey said. ``The evidence certainly suggests
that's what makes them addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   In their experiments, Dewey and his Brookhaven colleagues got
several rats and primates addicted to cocaine or nicotine, then
gave them GVG. Brain scans found that GVG reduced their dopamine
levels. The animals' behavior indicated that GVG also diminished _
and, at higher dosages, eliminated _ their craving for the
addictive substances.
</P>
<P>
   The results with nicotine were published Wednesday. The results
with cocaine appeared in Synapse in August. At the time,
Vigabatrin, one drug company's brand name for GVG, was under review
as an antiepilepsy treatment by the US Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, in October, the FDA rejected the drug on the grounds
that it constricts peripheral vision in some users.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey noted that the dose of GVG needed to treat addiction is
much smaller than the amount needed for epilepsy. Where Vigabatrin
is prescribed for epilepsy, its users, mainly children, take 2 to 4
grams a day. To eliminate the craving for nicotine, Dewey
estimates, an adult would have to take only 200 milligrams a day _
1/10 to 1/20 as much.
</P>
<P>
   Quelling the need for cocaine would take 2 to 3 grams. However,
Dewey noted, the balance of risks and benefits, which the FDA
calculates in assessing a drug, might be different if it were the
only drug that suppressed cocaine addiction, as opposed to one of
many drugs that controlled epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhaven has applied to the FDA for permission to conduct
limited human trials of GVG, which could begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey, meanwhile, is conducting further tests to see the effects
of GVG on alcohol and, soon after that, heroin.
</P>
<P>
   All of GVG's enthusiasts emphasize that even if the medicine
works in humans as well as in animals, it will not herald the end
of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Volkow, head of Brookhaven's addiction-research department,
said: ``I do not think we will be able to cure addicts by giving
them a pill and saying, `OK, you're on your own.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By controlling dopamine levels, GVG blocks the high that a drug
produces. But if people want to get high, they will stop taking the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pill will help us integrate an addict into society, so it
increases the likelihood that he stops taking drugs,'' Volkow said.
``But beyond that, it depends on your alternatives in life. If you
take someone off cocaine but offer no alternatives and there's not
enough to engage him, he'll fall back on drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress is the most important variable on whether you take
drugs,'' she continued. ``Stress causes biochemical changes, which
rewire pathways that make a drug more pleasurable. So you cannot
dissect biochemistry from sociology. . . . The environment produces
changes in the biochemistry of the brain that make it more
susceptible to drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Korentsky agrees. ``In people who want help, a little added
crutch may be all they need and this pill may give them that
crutch,'' he said. ``This will probably help people get off, and
maybe stay off, drugs. But we're not going to get rid of drug
abuse. . . . It's sort of like sex. If we had a war on sex, we'd
lose it.''

<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>

Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,

<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

THINKING DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a Christmas story for you: A cynical journalist, given to
frequent jibes at the expense of Apple Computer Inc., adopts an
Apple iMac computer. Against his will, he's delighted by its
simplicity, thrilled by its impressive performance, moved by its
ineffable cuteness. The journalist becomes a new man _ witty, warm,
filled with love for all mankind except for that wretch Bill Gates.
He has learned to think different.
</P>
<P>
   Well, life's not that simple _ and neither am I. It'll take more
than the iMac to make a convert of me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not warming up for a bout of Mac-bashing. The iMac has
served me well for the past two months. It's like at first sight.
Feast your eyes on the monitor: a 15-incher that looks even bigger,
thanks to its crisp text display and opulent color reproduction.
The iMac also feels good; its keyboard is the most comfortable I've
ever used. It's almost good enough to atone for the iMac's clumsy
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I still resent the iMac's lack of a floppy drive, but I use the
Globe's internal network to move files to a Mac in our graphics
department, which has an Iomega Zip drive. I've got a Zip plugged
into a PC at home. Windows machines will only accept PC-formatted
disks, but Macs read and write to PC disks without a qualm. So I
can easily tote my files home.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I suspect the months of griping over this issue
secretly pleased Apple execs. Otherwise, more people might notice
that the iMac is still just another Macintosh, running Apple's
aging operating system. Five years ago, the Mac OS was much better
than anything offered by Microsoft. Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, I found myself wishing the Mac did things the
way Windows does. Of course, much of this is a matter of taste, or
lack thereof. For instance, I like the way Windows uses a
two-button mouse, so you can use many commands merely by clicking
the right mouse button. I resent the Mac's one-button mouse; others
like its simplicity. It's a judgment call.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mac OS features are flaws, pure and simple. At first,
programs would often refuse to run because of lack of memory. It
seemed 32 megabytes was not enough, even though my PC cruised along
on the same amount. But Windows machines make better use of
``virtual memory,'' a system that lets a computer use blank hard
drive space as imitation memory chips. Windows machines
automatically set the right amount of virtual memory. But on the
``easy-to-use'' Mac, you set virtual memory by hand. Too little,
and programs died. Too much, and they ran so slowly they might as
well be dead.
</P>
<P>
   I bought RAM Doubler from Connectix Corp., a $50 program that
fixed the problem. Then some Apple technicians said the new Mac OS
8.5 and a little more fiddling would do the trick. It did. Still,
why so much trouble over a feature most PC users never even think
about?
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with my iMac nicely tuned up, I can find no compelling
reason to prefer it to a PC. This may change next year, when Apple
unleashes Mac OS X, a promising operating system upgrade based on a
version of the advanced Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier incarnation, OS X was named Rhapsody, and was to
have been available in a version for PCs. That plan was scrapped
last year, so that Apple could focus on its core market, the key to
its survival. By doing this, Apple has missed an immense
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the growing popularity of the Linux operating system,
with 7 million to 10 million users worldwide. It's proof that
people long for Windows alternatives. But why aren't they choosing
Mac OS? In some ways, it's better than Linux; it's certainly easier
to use.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux has one vast advantage. It runs on anything _ Macs,
PCs, even pocket-size Palm Pilots. Opt for Linux, and a universe of
hardware platforms is open to you. Choose the Mac OS, and you have
to buy a Mac _ and lose out on the plunging prices and rapid
innovation found in the PC hardware market.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, with its blue-green shell, is a glowing metaphor of
Apple's problem. It's different all right _ like a lovely beast
that evolved in isolation on the Galapagos Islands, and can't
thrive anywhere else. But I've no intention of moving to the
Macintosh Archipelago, no matter how pretty the computers are
there.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' R (profanity, violence, sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   An ``X''-cessive mess. Edward Norton plays a reformed skinhead
trying to keep his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following
the same sick, dead-end path. Though it trafficks in racial
confrontations and ethnic slurs, it never delves any deeper than
the junk spewed out on ``Jerry Springer.'' But Norton is
phenomenal. He disturbs us; his movie doesn't.1 hour, 58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' PG
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester
Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the same artists are involved, this sequel to
``Babe'' loses its way in the big city, turning the noble piglet
into little more than a supporting player. 1 hour, 36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire, half-human hero who can
handle sunlight but also has a taste for blood. Armed with an
arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, Blade is devoted to wiping out all
vampires. Especially a strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen
Dorff. Alas, all the nonstop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more
repetitive than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 23 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave
</P>
<P>
   Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 m inutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' R (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Fame is the name of the game in this Woody Allen film, but the
game is all too familiar. Kenneth Branagh (doing an uncanny Woody
impersonation) and Judy Davis (doing her version of Woody) are
ex-spouses making their way through the celeb-filled worlds of
supermodels, TV talk shows, book signings at Elaine's, etc. Aside
from some amusing observations, the movie feels stale and strung
together.1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cruise'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch.
</P>
<P>
   Get on the bus. Cruising takes on a whole new meaning in this
quirky, low-budget black-and-white documentary. Timothy ``Speed''
Levitch is a loquaciously eccentric tour guide for a Manhattan bus
company. Levitch is a heck of a character study; he can get
irritating. But surveying his domain from the top of a
double-decker, he's a kind of inspired performance artist. 1 hour,
16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadjo Dilo'' Not rated, but sexual situationsand NC-17-rated
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Romain Duris.
</P>
<P>
   Those with a little gypsy in their soul will appreciate Tony
Gatlif's tale of a young Parisian (Romain Duris) who joins a Gypsy
community in Romania. An engaging patchwork of self-contained
scenes, the movie is often more effective as an anthropological
tract than a full-fledged narrative. Still, once you accept the
hang-loose style, the material's intrinsic interest takes hold.1
hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' Unrated (plot contains pedophilia)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly
comic look at several citizens of New Jersey whose lives are
defined by sexuality. Director Todd Solondz says he prefers the
expression ``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is
about as dark as they come.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 14 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Catherine O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-fried hokum about an unwed mom-to-be (Drew Barrymore) and
the stepsons (Luke Wilson and Jake Busey) of her late boyfriend.
One wants to kill her, the other wants to kiss her. A mix of
Hollywood blandness and smalltown condescension, the movie can't
decide if it's a romance or a farce. But Catherine O'Hara chews the
scenery nicely as the boys' vengeful mom.1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' PG (profanity, rude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college kid who has to hitch his
way home to New York in time for Christmas Eve. If he's late, he'll
lose the Porsche his dad has promised. This Disney comedy has some
clever moments as Thomas, a scam artist, has to learn the meaning
of family. But it aims too often for the far-fetched. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Inheritors'' N/R(violence, sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Simon Schwarz, Sophie Rois.
</P>
<P>
   When a farmer wills his property to his farmhands, ownership
sparks newfound pride in the peasants. But it also rouses fury from
established farmers in this engaging but uneven Austrian film. In
German with English subtitles.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer: Ringmaster'' R (profanity, sex, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   If you like ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' you'll probably
appreciate this rude and crude look at putting on an outrageous
daytime talk show _ here dubbed ``The Jerry Show.'' Follow two
groups _ including a mother and daughter sleeping with the same man
_ as they angle to get on ``Jerry,'' then sit back and watch the
fights break out.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' R (profanity, drug use, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah.
</P>
<P>
   A suddenly single fortysomething (Holly Hunter) leaves her tony
Upper East Side co-op and ventures into new territory, an
cross-town jazz bar, where she becomes friends with the resident
torch singer (Queen Latifah), and has a ``kinda'' relationship with
her building's elevator operator (Danny DeVito). The tone is
bittersweet, the story unresolved, but the performances are fresh
and funny.1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper. 2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n' roll
to the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play unalike sisters with one
strong bond: They're witches. In the lively film version of the
Alice Hoffman novel, the two deal with backfired spells and that
most unpredictable magic, love. Co-starring Aidan Quinn, Dianne
Wiest and Stockard Channing, it's lightweight but works like a
charm.1 hour, 45 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds. 1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Kung fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. Chan and Tucker learn to work together, in part by
imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one works.1 hour, 37
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' R (violence, profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche.1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' R (profanity, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   When a stag party goes murderously out of control, the
groom-to-be and his pals (Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern
and Christian Slater) go to great lengths to cover their tracks.
Even if it means killing a bunch of people, or each other. This
pitch-black comedy from Peter Berg is the sort of sick-joke
experience you'll tend to love or hate.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama.1 hour, 26
minutes. C

   CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Trying to outline an agenda for the
106th Congress of cutting taxes, fixing schools and preserving
Social Security, Republican leaders of the House and Senate could
not avoid the I-word Thursday. ``Is there a question other than on
impeachment that we could maybe (answer)?'' wondered Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott as reporters asked repeatedly about
coming developments in the congressional investigation of President
Clinton. ``No,'' replied a voice from the journalistic horde
crowded into Lott's Senate office. ``Nuts!'' laughed House
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, who clearly indicated that he
would like the thorny issue settled before he officially replaces
Newt Gingrich when the new Congress convenes Jan. 6. (Dart, Cox
News Service 450).

   POLMONEY _ WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission prepared
Thursday to reject its staff's recommendation that 1996
presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole repay millions of
dollars in federal matching funds. The formal vote will be next
Wednesday or Thursday, but a daylong debate made it clear that
there are enough votes to block approval of the finding that Dole
and Clinton used party-paid TV ads to evade spending limits. The
impending decision illustrates the weaknesses of the current system
of policing campaign finance. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

 New study corrects osteoporosis theories
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to medical dogma, white women over age 50 are at
highest risk of bone-thinning osteoporosis and resulting fractures.
That's what the National Osteoporosis Foundation said last month in
its first-ever guidelines for recognizing, treating, and preventing
a disease that costs $14 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. In fact, white women rank fourth among major US ethnic
groups on tests of marked bone loss, with more than 50 percent
having serious weakening of bone structure, according to results
from the largest study undertaken on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American women are at highest risk, with 65 percent of
menopausal women having low bone density, followed by native
American women at 59 percent. African-Americans, who had long been
thought to be at low risk, ranked fifth. But still, 38 percent of
them have weakened bones if they are past menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ethnicity does not protect you against osteoporosis,''
Dr. Ethel Siris of Columbia University said Wednesday in San
Francisco, where she presented the findings at an osteoporosis
meeting. ``This was a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, half of all post-menopausal American women have serious
bone disease. Those with actual osteoporosis _ the stage of bone
loss associated with imminent risk of fracture _ make up 7.2
percent of all women.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier notions about the risk of bone loss, Siris said, were
based on doctors' impressions that minority women don't suffer
fractures as often as whites. But this may be due to the greater
numbers of whites in physician practices, coupled with their
generally better access to care.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first to assess bone loss among large numbers
of women from various ethnic groups. The results are based on
48,000 women with an average age of 65, but the study will
encompass at least 250,000 subjects. All will be followed for five
years to see how many suffer fractures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is to increase awareness,'' Siris said. ``Primary
physicians are waiting for women to have a fracture before
evaluating them for osteoporosis. That's like waiting for someone
to have a stroke before taking their blood pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is funded by Merck &AMP; Co., which makes a leading
osteoporosis drug, but Siris said the investigators ``are not in
the business of selling drugs.'' The main message, she said, is
that doctors should screen older women for bone loss, using tests
costing $50 to $120 that Medicare began covering in July.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Heart instrument cuts hospital admissions
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A super-electrocardiogram invented at New England Medical Center
can help doctors decide when it's safe to send a patient with chest
pain home, or admit him to a regular medical ward for observation
rather than to a coronary care unit.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation, reported in the current issue of Annals of
Internal Medicine, consists of software that extracts data from a
regular ECG and calculates the probability that a patient is having
a heart attack or serious shortage of blood to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Tested in a study of nearly 11,000 patients with possible heart
attacks in 10 US hospitals, the instrument reduced unnecessary
hospital admissions from six to 100 percent, depending on the
institution. It reduced needless coronary care unit admissions from
16 to 50 percent. It did not result in any patient being sent home
or refused admission who really was suffering a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is really sick or really well, you don't need a
probability calculation to tell you what to do,'' said Joni
Beshansky, one of the study authors. ``It's in the gray area where
you need guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   The device is used routinely at New England Medical Center and
some other hospitals, and the Food and Drug Administration has
recently approved its wider use. The researchers say it could
prevent 204,000 hospital admissions a year and 112,000 coronary
care unit admissions, for a total savings of $728 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Seizures drug eases damage, pain
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A drug called gabapentin, approved in 1994 for seizures, reduces
the pain of two hard-to-treat conditions: the nerve damage that
afflicts nearly half of all diabetics and the pain that persists in
up to 15 percent of people after a bout of shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association showed gabapentin reduced pain in such patients and
improved their ability to sleep and carry out daily activities.

CLINTON, DEMOCRATS PROVOKE IMPEACHMENT BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago it appeared that the impeachment of President
Clinton had reached a dead end. Republicans, spooked by the midterm
election results and the consequent departure of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, had all but given up. Democrats, emboldened by same,
offered up draft resolutions of ``censure.'' Talk of a deal was in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Today it appears that the House of Representatives will vote in
the affirmative on one article of impeachment regarding
presidential perjury. House GOP head-counters now believe they have
a seven-vote majority to pass just such a measure. They are
increasingly adamant that a vote of the full House on this matter
occur before the end of the legislative session. And there are
equally adamant that there be no deal for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Three things changed the political dynamic. First, Democrats
seriously overplayed their hand when they turned Kenneth Starr's
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee into a 12-hour
inquisition into the independent counsel's professional conduct.
That performance, wrote National Journal editor Michael Kelly,
``was contemptible, really loathsome in its cynicism and in its
naked disdain for the evidence and for the law. From the opening
sneers of Mr. Lowell to the closing insults of Mr. Kendall, the
Democratic side made clear their absolute unconcern with anything
approaching a desire to discern the truth. All they cared about was
trashing Starr on television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment of Starr by the Democratic members,'' Kelly
continued, ``was striking for its relentless ugliness. Some members
were ugly and bombastic (Reps. Wexler and Nadler), some were ugly
and snide (Rep. Frank), some were ugly and incoherent (Rep.
Waters). But all were ugly.'' Kelly's view was widely shared by
congressional Republicans. More important, the ferocity of the
Democratic assault generated a huge backlash of support for Starr
from the GOP's core constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Second, incoming House Speaker Robert Livingston was disgusted
by the Democratic assault on Starr and acutely aware of the
reaction to it at the grass roots. Shortly thereafter, he let it be
known publicly and privately that censure was not really an option
and that he expected the House to vote either up or down on the
question of impeachment. Livingston also made it plain that he had
full confidence in the House Judiciary Committee's chairman, Henry
Hyde, and that he would support whatever Hyde decided was right.
</P>
<P>
   Third _ and this was the kicker _ President Clinton's
``responses'' to 81 questions submitted by the House Judiciary
Committee were released by the White House on the Friday after
Thanksgiving. The questions were designed to establish what lawyers
in appellate cases call a ``fixed set of facts.'' Clinton's answers
to these questions stunned GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that Clinton yielded not one inch of legal
ground. It wasn't just that Clinton continued to maintain that he
suffered from a new form of mental incapacity known as convenient
amnesia. It wasn't just that Clinton did nothing to hide his utter
contempt for the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry. What was so
astonishing to GOP members was the tone of the president's replies.
``It was like the Tom Wolfe book (``A Man in Full'') with the
workout specialist at the bank,'' said one Republican consultant.
``Clinton gave them the `unidigital salute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The president's answers to the committee's questions were
quickly characterized by The New York Times as ``lies about
lying.'' That phrase caught on like wildfire up on Capitol Hill,
and by Tuesday of this week it was clear that the mood of the
members had changed. Republicans who were thought to be leaning
toward some sort of censure arrangement were now back in the
impeachment-for-perjury camp. To the surprise of the GOP
leadership, the head count even included three Democrats. Four or
five other Democrats were considered ``possible'' votes for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By overplaying their hands and underestimating Speaker
Livingston, Democrats and President Clinton have all but guaranteed
a vote in the House on impeachment. It appears likely that the full
House will vote, by a slim majority, to impeach the president on
one count of perjury. The Senate will then take the House's action
under advisement. And there, the issue will die.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the best possible result. Those who favor
allowing Clinton to remain in office will be satisfied. Those who
favor his impeachment will also be (at least partially) satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing Clinton out of office was never really an option. The
votes in the Senate were never there. A House vote of impeachment
for perjury would nevertheless stand as an indelible rebuke for
conduct unbecoming of an officer of the United States government.
It is a rebuke that President Clinton fully deserves. It would
haunt him through history.

WATCH OUT FOR `INVISIBLE DECISIONS' IN CAREER MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes the worst career decision you can make
doesn't feel like a decision at all. You're either deciding one
thing when you should be focused on a broader or more important
issue, or you lull yourself into a false sense of security when you
should be doing something to protect yourself or your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call these `invisible decisions,''' said Ralph L. Keeney,
co-author with John S. Hammond and Howard Raiffa of ``Smart
Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions.'' ``The
person doesn't realize they can create a choice situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeney said decisions often are triggered by specific events,
such as tragedies, layoffs or children reaching a certain age. He
added, though, that people often don't take the time to evaluate
their current situations at work and determine whether they can
make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He said job hunters in particular often make three common
mistakes:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``They work on the wrong decision at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   People spend too much time in job interviews evaluating whether
the job sounds right for them, Keeney said. ``What they should be
thinking of is, `What should I be doing to get the offer?''' After
you know that the company wants you, you're in a stronger
bargaining position to try to make the job right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not being clear about what skills they have and what they want
out of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I have to offer the employer? What do I hope to
experience? What's the scope of responsibility I will have?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Accepting the jobs that others have created.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeney said that sometimes people are better off thinking about
what in particular they want out of a job, then approaching
companies with that as a proposal. ``The key often is thinking of
the objectives of the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeney said people who might otherwise be good at making
decisions can make mistakes because they are identifying the wrong
problems. Are you planning to move when all you really need is to
remodel your home? Is your commute really too long or does an
inflexible work schedule force you into a lot of traffic? Is your
salary too low or are you spending too much?
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that doesn't happen, he suggests people list all
the objectives they can think of that will be involved in a
particular decision. Then they should ask why that objective is
important, which may lead them to even more objectives. Then they
should ask how those objectives can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Keeney said, if one of your objectives is a shorter
commute, that might lead you look for work closer to home. But if
you ask yourself why the shorter commute is important, the real
objective might be that you want more time to spend with your
children.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find more time to spend with your children? Maybe
with a company that encourages telecommuting or has flexible hours
or offers a condensed workweek or has on-site child care. If all
those things will meet your real objective, Keeney explained, then
you have a wider range of job options than if you simply look for
work closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't put restraints on your job search, you can later
reject anything that you don't like,'' he said. ``You can always
reject offers that you have, but you can't accept offers that you
didn't get.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mistake people often make is with ``anchoring,'' when
your mind gives too much importance to the first information it
receives, said Keeney, who is a professor of management and
engineering at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, the authors give this example: ``How would you
answer these two questions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the population of Turkey greater than 35 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your best estimate of Turkey's population?''
</P>
<P>
   When the authors posed similar questions to other groups, but
substituted ``100 million'' for ``35 million'' in the first
question, the typical answer to the second question shot up by many
millions.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Keeney suggested both that you think about
your objectives before discussing them with friends and advisers,
and that you don't tell those people too much about your own
beliefs before they get a chance to give advice. If you don't cloud
their thinking, they might present alternatives that you hadn't
thought of.
</P>
<P>
   Once you decide what your objectives are, Keeney said it was
crucial to put them in writing so that all the elements of each
alternative are in front of you. You can then weigh the advantages
and potential consequences of each, and determine which elements
are the most important.
</P>
<P>
   He said it helped to cross off aspects that you consider ``even
swaps,'' so that you can boil the decision down to the major
differences. If you have two potential jobs that offer the same
salary, then you can cross ``salary'' off the list as a
consideration. But Keeney said you also should do that for
different elements you consider to be of equal value.
</P>
<P>
   People also need to understand how crucial the invisible
decisions are, Keeney said. If, for example, they procrastinate on
building their skills and ignore the waves of layoffs around them,
they are setting themselves up to be victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only control you have on your life is your
decision-making,'' he said. ``The rest just happens to you.''

PATRIOTS OUTLOOK MUCH HEALTHIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Think of it as a glass figurine shattered in
a free fall. Little by little, you start piecing it back together.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Patriots' situation.
</P>
<P>
   Because 15 regular players have missed games and three others
have played injured, it is taking a while to piece the team back
together.
</P>
<P>
   When wide receiver Terry Glenn returned two weeks ago, the
change was dramatic because of the multitude of options quarterback
Drew Bledsoe suddenly had available. Now there's a good chance Troy
Brown will return after missing six games with a severe ankle
sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the big-play weapon, not to mention the NFL's top punt
returner (14.3-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of his return, the team terminated the contract
of receiver Henry Ellard Wednesday and activated cornerback Kato
Serwanga off the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Things also are looking up on defense.
</P>
<P>
   End Willie McGinest has been in for only four plays in the last
six games. In the last five, the Patriots have sacked the
quarterback twice, putting excess responsibility on the secondary,
which allowed a ton of yardage.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, suffering from a chronic groin pull, is inching his
way back into the lineup. While he was expected to miss the rest of
the season, he's showing signs that he may return much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to do some things in the warmups this morning,''
said defensive line coach Ray Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing everything I can can to get back out there and help
us win some games,'' said McGinest. ``I can't wait to be able to go
full strength. I'm tying to do some things out there in practice
this week, and we'll see how it responds. It's feeling better, but
this early in the week, it's hard for me say whether I can play or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game. It's against Pittsburgh, and I'd love to be
able to get back in there,'' added McGinest, who had 1 1/2 sacks
and eight tackles in the Patriots' 7-6 playoff loss at Pittsburgh
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest would be a welcome addition against Kordell Stewart,
especially when the Steelers quarterback tries to escape to the
outside. McGinest's presence also would improve the pass rush
because he usually draws special attention, which opens up the rush
for the inside guys like Henry Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long haul for Brown, who first injured the ankle
Oct. 19 against the Jets after catching four passes for 41 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew threw me a pass out in the flat, and I caught it and
tried to turn with it,'' recalled Brown. ``When I turned, I didn't
put it away. I thought it was going to be a fumble, so I threw it
over my shoulder and I went to get it and the guy rolled over my
ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was bad, but it's been six weeks Monday, and the
report I got originally was that it was going to be six weeks
before I even ran again. I think I've taken big strides in a short
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown hadn't been hurt since he missed the Super Bowl two years
ago after a double-hernia operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm look foward to coming back out there,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a good, tough game in Pittsburgh. Their secondary is
playing well over there. Going up against Carnell Lake is a great
task. He's a great corner. He plays the inside guys in the nickel
package. That's gonna be tough coming off an injury, but I think
I've prepared myself well for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been like an extra coach on the sidelines during his
convalescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to offer tips during the game,'' he said. ``You see
them do certain things, and sometimes it gets a little repetitious
with the route running. I just tell (the receivers) to change it up
a bit. When I'm in there, I'm thinking of things to do to get open,
and when I'm on the sidelines, I'll say, `Coach, maybe you should
try doing this or that because he's overplaying this way or that
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that not everyone has the knack of getting open the way
he does. That's why Bledsoe said at his press conference Wednesday
that he felt it would be a major boost for the Patriots to have
Brown ready for Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different guys run routes different,'' said Brown. ``We've had
to move some guys who run outside and run them inside, so they
weren't used to playing inside. I've tried to help them out a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   He's assuming nothing but has been pushing the trainers and
coaches to let him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been out this long,'' said Brown. ``It's tough. The
last two weeks, they've had a lot of fun, so you want to be a part
of that. When they go on road trips and leave you behind, that's
disappointing. But now I know I'll be back.''

HARTFORD'S STADIUM QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ When Robert Fiondella looks up from his desk
on the 12th floor of the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co.,
the site of the proposed new stadium for the New England Patriots
is right outside the window. It is just past the proposed $1
billion Adriaen's Landing development that he has spent years
promoting.
</P>
<P>
   One can easily imagine the glimmering, distinctive shape of The
Phoenix _ the name of the building _ broadcast to the nation during
televised National Football League games. Such incidental marketing
is one reason Fiondella has been so enthusiastic about bringing
sports events to Hartford and central Connecticut for years.
</P>
<P>
   What began four years ago as a campaign to increase the name
recognition of his company has blended with his leadership role in
revitalizing the city. And now Fiondella, chairman of the Greater
Hartford Chamber of Commerce, wants the New England Patriots to
help him do both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view the Patriots being a part of Adriaen's Landing
as the catalyst for revitalizing the whole region and, to a lesser
extent, the whole state,'' Fiondella said during a recent
interview. ``I have always had an interest and involvement in
sports and in urban renewal, and, a few years ago, Hartford was at
the point where it needed a business person to try to help deal
with that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you look at cities that have gained teams,
that has been a real source of revitalization in all ways,
including economic,'' said Fiondella, a lawyer and a former town
councilman and redevelopment official in his lifelong hometown of
Bristol. ``And if you look at cities that have lost teams, they
have regretted losing them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the public will benefit from Connecticut
taxpayers' financing of the new stadium _ an investment of at least
$375 million, one of the most lucrative deals ever offered an NFL
owner _ Fiondella says he disagrees with studies that show sports
stadiums do little to attract new business or create jobs. He cites
few figures to support his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue of the stadium is a lot like the issue of
advertising,'' Fiondella said. ``How do you demonstrate that
branding and name recognition results in profits? It's pretty hard.
But it's pretty clear that if you don't have it, you know that
impact is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiondella has worked long hours for years with other businessmen
and with state and local government officials to support the
Adriaen's Landing development, which includes a convention center,
a hotel, stores, and residences. In May, and quite in secret, the
planning began to include the Patriots, shortly after Jonathan
Kraft, the son of owner Robert Kraft, reviewed the redevelopment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Robert Kraft has met Governor John Rowland in the
Phoenix Home Life boardroom, which also overlooks the stadium site,
as they negotiated the proposed deal. Fiondella personally guided
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue around the site during a subsequent
meeting. And, this week, politicians and businessmen sat around the
big table in the boardroom talking excitedly about the proposed
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company and a CEO who have not just given lip
service to the idea that bringing sports to Hartford is good for
Hartford,'' said Boston sports lawyer Robert Caporale, who has
helped governments and franchise owners negotiate sports deals.
``They have written checks to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, realizing that Phoenix Home Life's market
position was ``as a large company, but not the largest'' Fiondella
began attracting and sponsoring a number of sports events. It
started with women's basketball at the University of Connecticut.
About the time the company put up $5,000 of the $20,000 it cost to
broadcast the games on public television, the women won the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fiondella also helped bring the Special Olympics to Connecticut
along with a franchise of the women's American Basketball League
and the American Tennis Professionals Tour World Doubles
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sports is a great medium for reaching people at all
levels and for bringing people in a community together. It evokes
pride, particularly if it is done well,'' Fiondella said.
``Whenever we had an opportunity to focus on name recognition, if
we could also stimulate activity in the city, then we would do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots are an even bigger and better use of sports to
market the town, Fiondella reasons. But many doubt that the massive
expenditure of public finances will make that much difference,
beyond some people around town feeling better about calling
Hartford home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly financed stadiums essentially have almost no
anticipated revenue,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics
professor at Smith College and coauthor of a Brookings Institution
study, ``Sports, Jobs &AMP; Taxes: the Economic Impact of Sports Teams
and Stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalist has been contacted by Connecticut legislators who want
him to testify during hearings before the General Assembly on the
stadium proposal set for Wednesday. The study includes a number of
reports from cities nationwide concluding that the financial
payback from publicly financed stadiums is minimal, and the public
subsidies almost always exceed the incremental tax revenues and
other financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subsidized sports facilities do not exist because they are
financially valuable assets in their own right,'' Zimbalist and his
coauthor, Roger G. Noll, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, wrote. ``They exist, instead, because most cities have
decided that a subsidized team is better than no team at all, and
because scarcity in the number of teams give owners the advantage
in bargaining with cities.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar study of the impact of new stadiums in California on
other businesses, written by University of California at Berkeley
professor Jack Sylvan, found that sales-tax data from 1972 to 1995
showed no increase in business clearly related to the construction
of any stadium in seven California cities.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the studies, Fiondella said: ``I never read
them. I think I know a little bit more about job creation than the
people who do those studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly significant investment,'' Fiondella says of the
$375 million in proposed public financing, which he said has
substantial support in the General Assembly. ``But I think that
what's less important to one person may be more important to
someone else. For us, causing the Patriots to come here is
significantly more important than it may have been for
Massachusetts to keep them. And that's the way business goes, and
that is the way life goes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejects, with a shrug and a smile, criticisms of some in
the sports business industry that Hartford's lucrative offer to the
Patriots has merely driven up the costs for all other cities intent
on securing NFL teams or other professional sports franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, quite honestly, those very same cities that are
complaining about it didn't seem to complain about moving factories
out of the Northeast, with fairly significant incentives,'' he
said. ``I mean, the economy is competitive.''

NEW `NOGGIN' NURTURED BY NICKELODEON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Empowered by rocketing ratings and a hit movie spin-off,
Nickelodeon is teaming with the Children's Television Workshop to
launch Noggin, the first 24-hour kids' ``thinking channel,'' on
Feb. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being offered on standard cable, Noggin will be both a
digital network and an online site.
</P>
<P>
   Being digital enables some cable systems to carry the show even
though their standard lineup is full. Being online means the
network can supplement shows with related interactive elements,
seeking kids' input and participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make entertainment educational, rather than
make education entertaining,'' said Dan Martinsen, a spokesman for
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon claims Noggin is one of the top new channels that
cable operators nationwide are interested in carrying by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Noggin will feature original programs _ not yet named _ as well
as such CTW and Nick Jr. shows as ``Blue's Clues'' and ``Sesame
Street.'' Such shows also will continue to air on their current
channels.
</P>
<P>
   The focus from 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. will be preschoolers, shifting
to kids 6-12 years old in the afternoon, with evening shows will be
aimed at a more general audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though Noggin is conceived as a cable-computer hybrid, Martinsen
said it can be appreciated exclusively through either medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see different things online,'' he said. ``But you can
watch either one without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nickelodeon isn't faring badly with its entertainment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``Nicktoons TV'' was the most-watched programming block on
Saturday mornings during the November ratings sweeps, beating all
competition on broadcast and cable.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen, ``Nicktoons TV'' finished 24 percent ahead
of ABC's Saturday morning kid shows, which were second. Nickelodeon
also had a 4 percent increase in that time slot over the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``The Rugrats Movie,'' spun off from Nickelodeon's
``Rugrats'' cartoon show, is riding high at the box office. It has
earned $58 million in two weeks. &QL;

LUCINDA WILLIAMS KEEPS MOVIN' ON DOWN THE ROAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the title track of Lucinda Williams' latest album,
``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' a little girl looks out of the
rear window as a car pulls away, ``little bit of dirt, mixed with
tears ...''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has said she was trying to tell a story in the song.
Only later did she realize that it was the story of her own
childhood as she moved constantly with her father and siblings from
town to town around the South.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years down the road, Williams is still staring out the
rear window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll always have one foot out the door,'' she said in
an unmistakable Gulf Coast drawl. ``It's just my nature. I'm just
kinda restless, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like to explore
different places. I never had kids or anything, so I've always been
able to go where I want to go. I've gotten used to that freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Williams will explore the Aerial Theater at Bayou
Place in Houston, where she'll perform with her band. Jim
Lauderdale opens the show, which marks Williams' first Houston
appearance since ``Car Wheels'' was released in July.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limited commercial airplay, the album has sold a
respectable 300,000 copies to become far and away the best-selling
release of Williams' career. It's also a strong contender for album
of the year in various critics' polls, having drawn rave reviews in
Rolling Stone, Spin and many major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things where now that you've gotten there,
what does it mean?'' Williams said of her rising national profile.
``I've got mixed feelings about the whole thing, because I don't
really want to be a big star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to finally be making a living as a musician. But
there's a lot of other stuff that you can potentially get into that
I've seen other people do, and I just don't want to go there. The
whole idea of fame is an illusionary thing. I'm still doing the
same things I used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 45, was born in Lake Charles, La. By the time she was
4, she'd already passed through Baton Rouge, La., Vicksburg, Miss.
and Jackson, Miss. Her father, distinguished poet Miller Williams
(he spoke at President Clinton's second inauguration), kept
switching universities in search of a tenured position.
</P>
<P>
   After her parents divorced, Miller Williams received custody of
Lucinda and her younger brother and sister. The family moved on
through Mobile, Ala., Atlanta, Santiago, Chile, Mexico City and New
Orleans before the poet settled in at the University of Arkansas in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda briefly attended college in Little Rock but dropped out
after a year to take a job performing in a folk bar in New Orleans.
From the first, her music was a mix of traditional country,
acoustic blues and '60s folk-rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always managed to kind of drift in and out of different
groups of people,'' she said. ``I was always able to play in
country honky-tonks or folk bars or biker bars. I opened for Ted
Nugent one time at Liberty Hall. It didn't occur to me that I was a
`folk' singer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Williams landed in Austin. But she quickly realized she
felt more at home in Houston's acoustic singer-songwriter scene
than with Austin's cosmic cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of people were just getting started at the same time I
was,'' she said. ``Nanci Griffith, Eric Taylor, Vince Bell, Lyle
Lovett, Robert Earl Keen. And, of course, Townes (Van Zandt) would
come in all the time to play. It was a really healthy breeding
ground for songwriters. That whole scene nurtured me quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leatherwood, longtime owner of the Anderson Fair folk club,
said Williams stood out for her talent, although she lacked the
career focus of some of the other emerging young songwriters
playing his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really one of the sweetest people I've ever known,''
Leatherwood said. ``Lucinda always struck me as someone who, if
things went right for her, could achieve success. But I never knew
if she was going to get her life together enough to really get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   During the time she lived in Houston, Williams was managed by
her boyfriend, Clyde Woodward. The couple moved to Los Angeles to
pursue her career. After they split up, Woodward moved back to
Austin, where he died of liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' relationship with Woodward has inspired a number of
her best songs, including ``Lake Charles'' from ``Car Wheels on a
Gravel Road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel particularly special about `Lake Charles,' because that
was a real difficult thing that I went through,'' she said. ``Some
of his ashes were scattered over Lake Charles _ off the bridge
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Williams found a home in the
roots-rock/alternative country scene developing around the
Blasters, Los Lobos, Dwight Yoakam, the Desert Rose Band and
others. Her self-titled 1988 album for the British Rough Trade
label (two previous albums for the Folkways label had received
limited distribution) brought her an international audience
seemingly overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After virtual anonymity, all of a sudden, boom!, people had
discovered me,'' Williams said. ``Before that, I was just singing
in the little bars and doing my little thing. I got noted by the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Williams released another critically acclaimed album,
``Sweet Old World,'' on the Chameleon label, which promptly went
out of business. Around the same time, after another brief stay in
Austin, she moved to Nashville, where she currently lives with her
bassist boyfriend, Richard Price.
</P>
<P>
   When she started work on ``Car Wheels,'' Williams was signed to
Rick Rubin's American label. She began work on the recording in
Austin with her longtime musical collaborator, Gurf Morlix. She
then re-cut the basic tracks in Nashville with Twang Trust
producers Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams still wasn't satisfied, so she headed to L.A. for
additional overdubs co-produced by former E-Street keyboardist Roy
Bittan. When American Records bogged down renegotiating its
major-label distribution deal, Mercury bought the rights to the
album in April and released it in July.
</P>
<P>
   Given the arduous recording process, it's a miracle that ``Car
Wheels'' didn't come out sounding terribly overcooked. Instead,
every track has something extra _ from the lead guitar playing by
Buddy Miller, Charlie Sexton and Johnny Lee Schell to the harmony
vocals by Lauderdale, Morlix and Emmylou Harris _ that takes it to
another dimension.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, it all comes back to the songs: ``Car Wheels on a
Gravel Road'' is the strongest collection of new material released
this year by an American singer-songwriter. With a lifetime of
rambling behind her, Lucinda Williams has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's already getting antsy to move on. After six
years in Nashville, where she lives with bassist boyfriend Richard
Price, she's dreaming of a new life in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years is about my limit,'' she said with a laugh. ``I
think I'm always looking for that community feeling, that
camaraderie thing, that we all had back then. It's hard to find. I
can't tell if that's what's changed, or if I've changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's that some folks are just born to run.
</P>
<P>
   Like the song says, ``Cotton fields stretching miles and
miles/Hank's voice on the radio/Telephone poles, trees and wires
fly on by/Car wheels on a gravel road...'' &QL;

   Picked-up pieces while pondering the spirit of Ben Drieth....
</P>
<P>
   --Pete Carroll simply has to do something about his sideline
comportment. The constant cheering makes him look like Potsie Weber
and Ralph Malph from ``Happy Days,'' and it's not dignified to be
getting tackled by your assistant coaches after a luck-laced,
last-second victory. The sight of Pete rolling on the ground was
mildly reminiscent of a prone Jeff Van Gundy holding on to Alonzo
Mourning's leg during a basketbrawl.
</P>
<P>
   --The Red Sox are banking on the All-Star Game to protect them
from season ticket drop-off in the wake of this dismal,
embarrassing, and passive offseason. Will Clark? Now that everyone
else is gone, why not bring back Jack Clark? He could probably use
the money. Hope Jose Offerman can play first base.
</P>
<P>
   --One last time: The Red Sox never had any intention of signing
Mo Vaughn. If you want to keep a guy, do you tell him to go get
market value, then come back with something slightly less? Don't be
duped by the PR spin. And know that Mo's animosity will forever be
aimed at Dan Duquette, not John Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   --Glad to see that Connecticut resident Ralph Nader has spoken
to his fellow citizens. Old Laughing Boy characterized the Kraft
stadium giveaway as ``the worst kind of corporate welfare,'' but
thus far, the Connecticut Yahoos aren't listening. Desperate to be
``big league'' at any cost, the legislators are expected to approve
the Love Canal Stadium bill in the middle of the month. I still say
the Pats aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   --How Did We Miss This Dept.?: Nine days after Pete Schourek
toed the rubber instead of Pedro Martinez against the Cleveland
Indians _ a decision which was equated with Joe McCarthy's decision
to start Denny Galehouse in the 1948 playoff game _ Mr. Galehouse
died from complications caused by heart disease in Doylestown,
Ohio. Ever a gentleman, Galehouse was the surprise starter and
loser of the first playoff game in American League history. He
never won another game in the big leagues and was a scout with the
Padres for 18 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   --If you have a son or daughter who digs sports and is between
the ages of 10 and 14, see ``The Waterboy.'' Jimmy Johnson and Bill
Cowher make cameos, and Henry Winkler's assistant coach might
remind you of Fred Smerlas.
</P>
<P>
   --Vaughn rearranged his schedule to come back from Anaheim to
appear at Team Harmony at the FleetCenter Dec. 15 (his 31st
birthday). He'll be honored at the fifth annual event to promote
diversity and harmony among today's youth. More than 12,000 New
England young people are scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   --Mike Greenwell is thinking of coming out of retirement and
signing with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   --Is Press Corner Kraft still feeling good about replacing
Curtis Martin with Robert Edwards?
</P>
<P>
   --In defense of Roger Clemens's last four years (40-39) in
Boston: In '93, he was 4-1 with a 1.55 ERA before a groin pull
plagued him and he had his worst year ever (11-14). In '94, he was
9-7 with a 2.85 ERA, and batters hit .204 against him, lowest in
the majors. He also finished second in the AL in strikeouts. In
'95, he was 10-5. The Sox scored three runs or fewer in 10 of his
starts but still went 16-7 in his starts and won the AL East. In
'96, he went 10-13 with a 3.63 ERA, the seventh-best ERA in the
league. He led the league in strikeouts and allowed a .237 average,
second lowest in the league. The Sox scored three or fewer runs in
15 of his starts, and Heathcliff Slocumb blew seven leads for
Clemens in the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   --Is there a better NHL coach than Pat Burns?
</P>
<P>
   --Wondering what ever happened to Sam Jankovich? He's been named
interim athletic director at Cal State-Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   --How many Big East wins for Boston College's ``Get Shorty''
basketball team? One? Two? This could be Holy Cross's best chance
for a rare victory over the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriot cheerleader swimsuit calendar somehow doesn't
sound like Myra's idea.
</P>
<P>
   --Best wishes to Mike Barnicle for a speedy recovery from heart
surgery.

`ANGELS' IS AFFABLE RENDITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're no angels, the Devil's Island convicts who make up the
title trio in Sam and Bella Spewack's ``My Three Angels.'' Alfred
and Jules are killers, while Joseph is merely a fraud, forger and
all-around crook.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there were mitigating factors in the murders. And Joseph
always has viewed his criminal career as a sort of fairy tale,
subject to his own storytelling fancy.
</P>
<P>
   These three shopworn angels reveal hearts of gold when they come
to the assistance of a put-upon shopkeeper and his family on
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   No masterpiece, ``My Three Angels'' nonetheless generates mild
entertainment in Main Street Theater's uneven but affable
rendition.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953 Broadway comedy (filmed as ``We're No Angels'') was
written by the husband and wife writing team best remembered for
``Boy Meets Girl,'' a comedy spoofing 1930s Hollywood, and for the
book of the classic Cole Porter musical ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in sweltering French Guiana on a Christmas Eve early in this
century, ``Angels'' sets up the situation in the opening scene.
Felix is a good-hearted merchant who failed in France and now is
struggling to succeed with a general store in the French colony. As
his practical wife, Emilie, reminds him, Felix is too generous and
trusting _ giving away merchandise, letting his customers get away
with owing but never paying.
</P>
<P>
   As the play opens, Felix is preparing for a visit from his
cousin Henri, the bane of Felix's existence, who drove him out of
his business in France. Apparently, Henri has designs on Felix's
business in the colony _ and also wants to put a stop to the
budding romance between Felix's pretty daughter Marie Louise and
his (Henri's) son Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the angels, on shore in the colony (from Devil's Island,
just off the coast) to work as free labor for the respectable
class. During a break from repairing Felix's roof, the trio
ventures downstairs just in time to see Marie Louise faint upon
reading a telegram indicating that her plans to marry Paul are to
be thwarted. The trio come to the girl's aid and, after helping her
parents with other matters, they are invited to spend Christmas Eve
with the family.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the trouble-making cousin, the stage is set
for the angels to save Felix and his business while ridding the
world of the miserably greedy visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels'' is decent, second-tier work of its era. The offbeat
plot (with its unusual notions about when it's appropriate to get
away with murder) is bolstered by modest helpings of whimsical or
ironic humor and doses of pardonable sentiment. The play also
evinces the inevitable flaws of its type: Some passages are
needlessly talky and prolonged, while others are merely weak or
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Director Steve Garfinkel has overseen a production as uneven as
the material. Some scenes are right on target, while others are too
overstated; still others lag or lack energy. What MST's production
always has in common with the script, however, is a good-humored
affability.
</P>
<P>
   The three cons here are amiable but variable in dramatic impact.
Charles Charpiot takes a natural relish in his role as Joseph, the
resourcefully larcenous rogue who proves especially useful to
Felix. Joe Hudson sometimes scores with a quiet wistfulness as
Jules, the philosophical member of the trio. Maurice Tuttle has
moments of energy and humor as Alfred, the most impulsive one _
though as with the others, his line readings don't always ring
true.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Masterson is aptly cast as Felix _ decent, ineffectual,
flummoxed and in need of rescue. Theo Lane Moffet is ideal as his
wife, Emilie _ fussy, pragmatic, worried yet ever-loving. In many
ways, this is the play's most believable role and in Moffet's
portrayal it becomes the emotional center of the play _ though you
may wish Moffet were more central to the action, as she was in
MST's delightful ``Good Housekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Pfister makes a substantial villain of Henri _ so bossy,
insulting and obnoxious to everyone that you will not mind at all
when the angels find a neat way of dispatching him. Good riddance!
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Haag is the quintessence of ingenue as Marie Louise _
fresh, fetching, eager and girlishly romantic. Garfinkel has
directed her to overdo things a bit, though, especially in her
breathless line readings of the first act. Ty Mayberry (subbing for
Mark Pickell at Saturday's performance) did crisp and capable work
as the villain's son Paul, temporarily a love interest for Marie
Louise, but too determinedly following in his nasty dad's footsteps
to retain her love for long. Theatergoers can decide for themselves
whether the punishment meted out by the angels fits Paul's crime.
</P>
<P>
   MST's ``My Three Angels'' is a pleasant, unspectacular revival
of a pleasant, unspectacular play. It's for theatergoers who, like
the playwrights when they penned this, are in a benevolent and
forgiving mood. &QL;

A FELINE FANTASY UNDER THE TREE

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've browsed the gift catalogs for the super-rich, scanned
Martha Stewart's seasonal entertainment guides, sneered at the
neighbor's go-for-broke decorating scheme.
</P>
<P>
   You think you've seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   You're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday money-making machine has churned out another idea,
this one aimed at that favorite feline on your list. Turns out when
it comes to cats, it's not the gift that counts, it's the gift
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan-based Kong Company has introduced catnip-scented
wrapping paper, saturated in fresh catnip nectar and sealed to
preserve the scent.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff is alleged to be so powerful that it comes with a
warning: Don't put a gift wrapped in the paper under the tree until
you're ready for the cat to rip into it.
</P>
<P>
   It's pricey _ $3.49 for a 9-inch by 12.5-inch sheet. But if
you're game, call the company at 303-216-2626 for more
information. &QL;

ELECTRIC CAR A REAL GAS  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The little Toyota Prius hardly seemed worth a second
glance, parked at the curb with a dozen sleek and exotic examples
of electric cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But ordinary as it may appear, there's a critical difference
between Prius and the other electric vehicles being demonstrated
Wednesday in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Prius is an electric vehicle that never needs to be recharged.
Range is not an issue. Nor is battery replacement.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world's first mass-produced car with hybrid power _
part gasoline engine and part electric motor _ providing the
benefits of low emissions and high gas mileage in a real-world
vehicle that can be driven anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's the closest thing so far to an all-purpose electric
vehicle, maybe lacking the purity of a battery-powered car, but
possibly the type of clean, efficient vehicle we'll all be driving
someday. And without ever having to plug it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this is that you don't have to change your
lifestyle at all to accommodate an electric vehicle,'' said Jeremy
Barnes, Toyota's product safety and environment administrator.
``You can drive it as fast and as far as you want without worrying
about recharging.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's technological brainchild is one of about a dozen
electric vehicles on display or being demonstrated at the North
American Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Conference, an
international cadre of automakers, small companies, researchers and
electric utility companies being held at Phoenix Civic Plaza.
(NOTE: THROUGH SATURDAY DEC.5)
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by California's clean-air mandates and growing public
impatience with the brown clouds that hang over urban areas,
including Phoenix, electric-powered and other alternative-fueled
vehicles are under intense development efforts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek form of the General Motors EV1 is a familiar sight in
the Phoenix area, with about 100 of them being leased, not nearly
as many as hoped for, but still seen as a toehold in public
acceptance of electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the conference participants were sampling electric
vehicles from various manufacturers, including the EV1, Nissan's
Altra station wagon, Ford's electric Ranger pickup and
DaimlerChrysler's EPIC van, as well as a small, short-range
``neighborhood vehicle'' from Bombardier, a Canadian small-vehicle
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   As well-developed as these vehicles may be, they still have the
well-known bugaboo of electric cars and trucks _ the short driving
range between lengthy rechargings, making them impractical for
anything but urban commutes and errands.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius is a different sort of vehicle, one that seems hardly
different from a conventional gasoline-powered car. But it gets
about 67 miles per gallon, Toyota says, in mixed urban and highway
driving while sending only a tiny amount of pollutants out the
tailpipe.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid works through a complex electronic and mechanical
system that varies the power to the front wheels between a small
gasoline engine and an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5-liter gas engine serves to recharge 40 small
nickel-metal hydride batteries that drive the 40-horsepower
electric motor, and it provides extra power for acceleration and
cruising at highway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-horsepower gasoline engine stops running completely when
the car is stopped, instead of idling in traffic, a major source of
pollution in rush-hour conditions. When the car is stopped, it's
completely quiet, just like a regular electric car, though the gas
engine will kick over at times to recharge the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the batteries never have to be replaced for the
lifetime of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it operates:
</P>
<P>
   - When pulling away from a stop or under light acceleration,
only the electric motor is doing the work, with the gas engine shut
off.
</P>
<P>
   - In normal driving, the gas engine turns on and off, with power
split between providing power for a generator to recharge the
batteries and run the electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   - Under full acceleration, both the electric motor and the gas
engine share the load.
</P>
<P>
   - In highway cruising, the gas engine takes over, supplemented
by electric power.
</P>
<P>
   - In deceleration, the batteries are recharged as the electric
motor doubles as another generator.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that although the Prius is a subcompact vehicle with
a small engine, there's no reason why hybrid cars couldn't be built
with V-6 or even V-8 engines, getting the same performance as
today's cars with much better fuel economy and far fewer
emissions. &QL; 
In Japan, the Prius is already being used regularly by the public,
and Toyota plans to bring them into this country in early 2000,
priced in the low $20,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Prius feels only marginally different from a
regular gasoline vehicle. Acceleration is brisk, an attribute of
the electric motor. A video display on the dashboard monitors the
various functions of the engine, motor and generator.
</P>
<P>
   That Prius can be driven anywhere was demonstrated recently when
``Road and Track'' magazine drove a Prius from Los Angeles to
Florida without a single recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to baby this thing,'' Barnes said, referring to
how electric-car drivers have to drive and accelerate slowly to get
the longest range between recharging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't run the batteries down, and the only recharging you
have to do is at the gas pump.'' &QL;

HOTTEST TOY IN TOWN: FURBY FLIES OFF SHELVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Attention, shoppers: Furby has left the building.
</P>
<P>
   And no, we don't know when he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   But if price is no object _ if, say, the idea of spending $300
or more for a $30 talking hairball won't make you fear you've taken
leave of your senses _ you may be in luck.
</P>
<P>
   Houston stores receiving shipments of the toys don't hold on to
them for long. And store employees say there's no way to predict
when the next shipment might arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get them when we get them,'' said Shanlanda Holman, a
customer service representative at the Toys R Us in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And then they'll fly off the shelves again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three cases (before Thanksgiving), and they probably
went in 30 minutes,'' Holman reported. ``And the only reason it
took 30 minutes was people didn't know we had them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Tickle Me Elmo and the Cabbage Patch Kids before it,
Furby has become a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And Houston's entrepreneurs are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Ortiz, a 39-year-old papermill worker in Galena Park,
stumbled upon a dozen Furbys obscured by other toys at a Kmart
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He bought all 12, spending about $360.
</P>
<P>
   He gave one to a girlfriend and placed a classified ad offering
the rest at $550. Each.
</P>
<P>
   The first day, he said, he sold one for $500 and a second for
$400.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's ad was one of 18 offering Furbys for sale in Tuesday's
Houston Chronicle, with prices ranging from $200 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to take their chances and pay retail,
finding Furby may be frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   At the Target on San Felipe, it is telephone operator Sophie
Capelo's misfortune to deliver the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the calls,'' she said. ``We don't have any (Furbys).
Even before the store opens, they're calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart in Tomball, Texas, north of Houston, got a shipment
on Friday, as after-Thanksgiving shoppers swarmed into the store,
operator Lorene LaRoche said. The booty was rationed _ one per
customer _ but still sold out almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The story was the same everywhere Furby was to be found.
</P>
<P>
   A manager at the Kay-Bee Toy &AMP; Hobby Shop in Baybrook Mall in
Houston arrived at work at 4:30 a.m. Friday to find people already
lined up for the 180 Furbys he had in stock.
</P>
<P>
   He handed out numbers, and all 180 were spoken for by the time
the store opened, according to the manager, who declined to give
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Why Furby?
</P>
<P>
   The Kay-Bee manager speculated that the toy's fortunes took off
after it was included in a cache of hot holiday toys on a ``Good
Morning America'' segment a month or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on the show fussed over Furby, he said, and another
chapter in hot-toy history began.

SEASON IS HERE _ WINTER IS NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some years early-season skiing is a snap. Last year, for
instance, the big snows that swept down from the north around
Thanksgiving set up one of the best early skiing seasons in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Other years are ... well ... like this one.
</P>
<P>
   It's about that narrow strip of white snow running river-width
through the brown woods.
</P>
<P>
   Or about the fact that, without a frozen base underneath the
surface, there's no protective buffer between ski bottom and
submerged object _ rock, stump, petrified squirrel fossil,
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Early-season skiing takes the kind of imagination required to
appreciate Shakespeare's ``Othello'' acted without costumes or
stage sets. Keep telling yourself you're in Cyprus and the Turkish
navy just got sunk in a hell-howling tempest (really bad storm).
</P>
<P>
   Just tell yourself it is winter and we really are in the midst
of another ski season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, by all records, was a freak. The snow that piled in
with arctic air meeting the moist Atlantic air created a wondrous
2-foot storm in ski country and something that almost never happens
with such storms _ enough snow down in Boston to inspire Bostonians
to go skiing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, says John Diller from Sugarloaf, which is usually
buried in the natural stuff for most of the season, the big storm
hasn't hit yet. Still, Thanksgiving was tolerable because of a foot
of wet snow that fell over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind that really packed in well,'' said Diller,
adding that a few of the good natural trails such as Double Bitter
and Sluice were open throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, warm weather has damaged the weekend snow that most
higher elevations were blessed with for the first big weekend of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, eight ski areas are open with limited terrain, which
generally means limited ticket prices as well. Molley Mahaer Kerr
of the Vermont Ski Areas Association said that while bookings for
later in the season are up over last year, early season is still
usually marginal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really for the hardcore,'' she said. ``This year has been
more typical, whereas last year was an anomaly. It would be great
if we had a storm like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Thanksgiving dump brought a wave of skiers to the
slopes. As that storm packed in, it became base for more natural
and manmade snow, setting up an early season that skiers are still
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' said Jon Buell, who has already skied twice
at Killington this year. ``Last Thanksgiving we left the rock skis
on the car and used our good stuff. But not this year. You're not
going to be that lucky two years in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Killington's open terrain was crowded last weekend, and
the crowds, says Kerr, are likely to increase into the Christmas
holidays, which is the traditional time the season fully opens. But
in the meantime, there are some warm days to fight through, like
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out in the slush,'' said Buell Tuesday, ``but when you
ski this time of year _ and there were boards out _ you kind of
know what you're getting into, literally. It is what it is _ not
the best skiing we're going to see this year. At least I hope
not.''
</P>
<P>
   As most areas open, what natural snow has fallen is augmented
with snowmaking, but that requires a consistent string of cold
nights. Even so, the look of winter that many skiers prefer is not
available in most ski areas this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben Monte bought new shaped skies at the Boston ski show
two weeks ago, the first thing he wanted to do was try them out.
``I've been reading about shaped skis, and everyone talks about
them. But my girlfriend is a big skier, and she said I'd wreck
them. So here I am on the same old skis I had last year. I even got
them used. I suppose the real winter snow will be here by
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The point? Back to those submerged objects under the thin cover.
When the skier or boarder does hit them, the plastic on the bottom
of the ski can get damaged. The answer is a pair of old skis,
usually known affectionately as ``rock skis.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback to early-season skiing, aside from aesthetics,
is safety. Without a blanket of snow in the woods, around trees,
signs, and lift towers, there is less buffering effect than snow
provides in mid-winter conditions. However, while most ski
patrollers believe the conditions are harsher in early-season
skiing, the evidence of danger is only anecdotal, especially since
the number of skiers is relativley small, and dominated by those
with advanced skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it only makes sense,'' said a Loon patrolman, ``that if
there's less snow around off the trails and everywhere on the
mountain, that the hard surfaces are closer to the skiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Diller, ``any day now, we're going to get that big
storm we're wating for, and suddenly everyone will want to come
skiing. It happens every year.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Memories come rolling back
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional feature in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Hall Hutchinson, age not disclosed, of Tucson, Ariz.,
takes us roaring down memory lane on in-line skates. Here's her
story:
</P>
<P>
   ``While filling out the form to rent the in-line skates, I
hesitated at the 'age' blank. Was it really necessary to record the
number that labeled me a senior citizen? I had to admit that on
paper the number did not look age-appropriate to the activity. But
then, was there a correct age?
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity was just too good to pass up: Six high school
girlfriends reunited more than 40 years after graduation for a
weekend in a Mission Beach house in San Diego that was surrounded
by smooth, wide, curving sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Dorothy had brought along her in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some of us were eager to join her in this activity,
others hesitated. Excuses were forth-coming: hadn't skated since
high school ... a bad knee ... fear of injury ... in-line skates
were not the same as roller skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement mounted as, one by one, we tried on Dorothy's
knee-pads, skates and wrist-guards, and with her gentle coaching,
each decided to take a tentative turn close to the security of a
wall. It helped that some of us had learned to ski, as the stopping
motion felt similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began to share our socks with the skater-of-the-moment
to achieve the proper fit, and to squabble like children over whose
turn it was, we knew we were ready to roll. Each of us was
committed to renting skating equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about my enthusiasm. Some five decades later the
soles of my feet can still feel the satisfying click-click-click of
racing full speed over the sidewalks of my Midwestern childhood
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets, sidewalks and empty lots in the neighborhood were
our playground. Shaded by a canopy of stately elm trees, the
neighbor kids rollerskated, jumped rope, played hopscotch and rode
bikes all summer long. More ambitious projects were organized by
the bigger kids: carnivals, theatrical productions, dog shows and
parades. Their little brothers and sisters were willing lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At twilight we'd gather under the elms to play 'I Will Draw
the Frying Pan,' 'Red Light/Green Light' or 'Ghosts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But any summer day would find me on my skates, the skate key
dangling on a grubby cotton string around my neck, scabs on my
knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My most daring feat on roller skates was regularly performed
at the steep hill that led down to the next street at the end of
our block. Lickety-split, my friends and I would roar down the hill
and stop ourselves at the bottom with a quick jerk to the left.
We'd slam with a resounding bang into a conveniently located garage
door. The door, much to the owner's displeasure, was permanently
dirtied with a row of child-sized handprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, some 50 years later, I gleefully suited up with knee-pads
and wrist guards, buckled up the rented skates and followed
Dorothy, my friend since fourth grade, down the alley to the wide,
smooth pavement where we could really take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning her head, she grinned at me and said, 'We're 8 years
old.'
</P>
<P>
   ``'Absolutely,' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the number I'd been searching for.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A working theory of road rage
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got zapped by somebody's BMW horn the other day for,
apparently, having committed an egregious civility. I had paused to
let a marooned driver take a left in front of me. This, to
paraphrase Churchill, is an insult up with which a BMW driver will
not put. What the heck's the use buying a luxury car if you can't
drive over someone whenever you want?
</P>
<P>
   This is a city that prides itself on its deeply rooted Southern
courtesy. All very true, too, until you put many Atlantans behind a
wheel and on the road, where they instantly turn into mad dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe tailgating is the result of all those years of watching
Southern stock car racing on television. My definition of a true
tailgater is someone who won't get off your rear bumper even if you
speed up.
</P>
<P>
   I always follow the old rule of leaving a car length of space
for each 10 miles of speed. If you're going 60, that means six car
lengths. In this city, it means only three or four cars will zip
laughing into the open space.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is a city famed for constructing freeways that solve
nothing. Cars became popular because they gave people freedom.
Remember the Sunday family drive? Now cars limit freedom. I guess
that's why everyone's so cranky.

ALERO HAS A LOT FOR THE DINERO  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Here's a small Oldsmobile that's worth a second look.
The all-new Alero has style, it has content, it has value, and it's
going after the big guns in the midsize market _ notably Honda
Accord.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing it doesn't have is a name. Alero. What's an
Alero? Tell people you're driving an Alero, and they'll say,
``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The marketing people have a big job in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who know what an Alero is, they'll find the latest
Oldsmobile to be a sporty, moderately priced and well-equipped
alternative to the mostly mundane conveyances available in this
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Alero is the first new car for Oldsmobile, the nation's oldest
continuously operated automobile company, as it enters its second
century. The compact is also the latest event in Oldsmobile's
effort to transform itself from the weak-sister division of General
Motors into the stylin' cover girl.
</P>
<P>
   Starting off with the futuristic design of the high-end Aurora
sedan, Oldsmobile has been popping off hits, all based loosely on
the look of the Aurora, hoping to build a distinctive brand image.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize Intrigue (now (begin ital) that's (end ital) a name)
has been a solid success for Olds, especially this year, when it
gets its new, more refined V-6 engine. The Alero keeps the old V-6
mill, a 3.4-liter power plant, but it's a good engine with decent
performance and proven reliability. It is boomy under acceleration,
but what it lacks in sophistication it makes up for in gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Alero shares its basic body structure and architecture with the
Pontiac Grand Am, aimed at a younger audience. Yes, Grand Am has
the stronger name. But Alero has the better setup.
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, Alero has a better ride, more responsive
steering, and a nicer interior. The only area in which Grand Am
outshines Alero is its sportier image, which most assuredly will
attract the greater number of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the Alero, Oldsmobile folk say, the division's
management compelled all the designers, engineers and marketing
people to drive an ever-changing collection of imported cars, in a
kind of ``know the enemy'' approach to product planning.
</P>
<P>
   The chassis tuning and interior design are a result of this
cultural revolution, which Oldsmobile hopes will steal those pesky
import buyers away from their foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Alero demonstrates how much car you can get
for about $20,000. The size is considered compact, but it's hardly
tiny. And fully equipped with a boatload of performance and
convenience options, Alero still comes in several thousands under
most of its competitors, such as the ever-popular Accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Alero feels tight and solid, without any notion
of tinniness or cheapness. Handling is good, if not real exciting,
and the rack-and-pinion steering provides good response.
Acceleration is hardly dazzling, but it will scoot ahead of the
pack and perform such chores as highway cruising and hill climbing
with minimal effort.
</P>
<P>
   The standard engine is a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine, which
puts out 149 horsepower and enough oomph for most purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic is a particularly nice-shifting slush
box, which is a good thing, because no stick shift is available.
Anti-lock, four-wheel disc brakes and a traction-control system are
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero's styling is clean, with strong hints of the
streamlined Aurora in the sloping front end. Though it shares its
basic shape with Grand Am, it is nowhere near as flamboyant, its
subtle lines blending in with traffic. It does look good in the
driveway, though, especially the black sedan we tested.
</P>
<P>
   The standard GL interior is comfortable and fairly roomy, with a
usable back seat and a good-size trunk. There's a sportier two-door
coupe Alero, which has a bit more panache, though it's a
less-practical configuration for families.
</P>
<P>
   Alero, which replaces the lackluster Achieva (another ho-hum
handle), could build a name for itself as a sporty compact that
offers a lot for a little. Which could help boost Oldsmobile's
fortunes as it tries to build a new image for itself. &QL;

BABY, DON'T THROW BATH OUT WITH THE TUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dumbest remodeling mistake I ever made was eliminating our
bath tub.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now, in these cold, damp winter days, I miss a long
hot soak in a tub.
</P>
<P>
   I removed the tub to gain room for a roll-in handicapped shower
in the adjoining bathroom, and have regretted ever since not
finding or making the space for at least one tub in our home.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-flat where I grew up, eight of us _ three generations
_ shared a big ol' lion's-foot bath tub. Not at the same time,
except in my early years when my twin sister and I were
rub-a-dub-dubbed in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shower, save for the gravity-fed one out back in
the garage, fed by a hot water tank under the roof and used only on
hot summer evenings when we would run bare-butt naked back across
the yard to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, we took Saturday night baths. And with that
many people in line, there were definite rules against
lollygagging. Especially since that also was the location of our
single toilet.
</P>
<P>
   A home with more than one bathroom was a luxury dreamed of, and
one that I and all of my siblings realized. And long, hot soaks in
a tub have always seemed to me the most luxurious of indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   To be done right, a bath should follow a relatively short,
cleansing shower ... the kind many of us do in our daily routines.
Showers, for the most part, leave you with a kind of slam-bam sense
of something missing.
</P>
<P>
   And our missing tub offered best what I miss most: that
unhurried and deliciously guilty indulgence in self-gratification.
When I announced: ``I'm going to take a bath,'' the family knew
that I would disappear for about the same amount of time as when
I'd say: ``I'm just going down to McLendon Hardware for a couple
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But a bath was infinitely more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   A bath, when done correctly, is a protocol in pampering. Your
biggest and fluffiest bath towel is set out. A fresh bar of soap is
at hand. And a bath oil of choice is administered to the torrent of
hot water.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of what image you project in real life _ whether
you slop hogs, apply hot-tar roofs, teach school or drive a desk _
you are allowed to add bubbles to your bath.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things that add to the soft ambience of bathing.
While some so-called relaxation bathers will sneak in a paperback
mystery or maybe a Reader's Digest, true Zen bathers prefer a
minimum of light. Or, at best, a few carefully placed candles.
</P>
<P>
   Beverages are best left outside. Glasses pose a danger as well
as a diversion from true relaxation. So too, snacks are verboten in
the bath. A bath is an indulgence that works from the outside in,
and should not be compromised by soggy sandwiches or crumbs in your
bath bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   A good bath must be HOT! This is best accomplished by slowly
lowering your tired body into the tub when it's half full. Once
your body has adjusted to the warmth, you then may increase the
flow of hot water along with your tolerance of same. (Warning:
Don't tell your cardiologist, because really hot baths reportedly
pose certain cardiovascular dangers. Then again, so does really hot
sex. And any combination of hot baths and the latter indulgence
must be done prudently and semi-moderately. Especially if there are
lighted candles nearby.)
</P>
<P>
   A good bath also requires a full tub. It helps if you hold a
wash cloth on the overflow with your foot, thereby allowing the
water level to reach your nose while you are in the
fullest-possible reclining position. This also facilitates your
imitating a crocodile or, if you will, a hippo, while you are at
periscope depth.
</P>
<P>
   The wash cloth or a bath sponge may be used, along with the
fresh bar of soap, to gently massage your body and remove the old
skin cells softened to a greater extent than in any shower.
</P>
<P>
   While they are not necessary, and might even interfere with the
total relaxation, bath toys are left to individual bathers'
discretion. Splashing about, especially when you are alone in the
tub, might create undue curiosity in passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Music might help your bath relaxation. A battery-powered radio
or CD player is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   As your body adjusts to the water temperature, you might
occasionally add hot/hotter water, until your skin is a rosy pink
and your fingertips begin to show prunish wrinkles. That might be a
good time for a final crocodile imitation, followed by your best
``Aphrodite (or, Neptune) Rising From the Sea'' pose.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the vent fan going, the ambient moisture will fog up
your bathroom mirror sufficiently for secret messages. Inscriptions
in fogged-up mirrors will reappear briefly when the next person
takes a shower or bath.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unsure what message to leave, you can always write:
``Burma-Shave.''

   Glimpses of unspoiled nature, visions of high style, strolls
down memory lane, portraits of passion, advice on getting control.
Each one an idea of the way gardening should be, they are all found
in this year's best garden books. If you're buying gift books,
think hard before you make a match. After all, you're pairing
someone up with a vision of their ideal world. &QL;

   ``The Botanical Footwear of Dennis Kyte,'' by Dennis Kyte
(Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $30). These amusing watercolors of
fabulous footwear, all fashioned from flowers and fruit, are based
on the premise that a shoe inspires the imagination and thus
demands to be created from far more interesting material than
leather. For the shoe fetishist on your gift list. &QL;

   ``Earth On Her Hands: The American Woman in Her Garden,'' by
Starr Ockenga (Clarkson Potter, $55). Most of the American women in
Ockenga's word and photo portraits are, like Martha's Vineyard's
Polly Hill, elderly doyennes with ample acreage, means, and free
time, who chose to devote these assets to gardening _ with awesome
results. Ockenga treats them as respectfully as artists, weighing
in with a retrospective of their lifes' work, which is what these
women are.

   ``A Tuscan Paradise,'' by Marina Schinz (Stewart, Tabori &AMP;
Chang, $35). A Swiss photographer, Schinz traveled widely to
capture the world's most beautiful gardens in ``Visions of
Paradise,'' her 1985 classic. This time she's discovered heaven on
earth in a single, 10-acre Tuscan villa owned by two spirited,
quirky Roman friends, Matteo and Frederico. Over a three-year
period she explores every corner of their two courtyard-linked
homes and the surrounding 10 acres of hilly gardens and olive
groves. The melding of indoor and outdoor living, of fresh flowers
and Etruscan antiques, of fugitive and eternal beauty make this the
year's most evocative house and garden book. There is much to learn
here. Superbly printed in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardens of the Wine Country,'' by Molly Chappellet with
Richard Tracy (Chronicle Books, $40). Napa Valley is the Tuscany of
America, and these estates are its villas. Longtime resident
Chappellet has gained access to 40 of its most opulent private
gardens to banish winter blues and start you planning that
California trip.

   ``Reflecting Nature: Garden Designs from Wild Landscapes,'' by
Jerome Malitz and Seth Malitz (Timber Press, $39.95). This
father-son team looks at how private gardens can adapt ideas from
wilderness landscapes. They focus on both natural and artificially
created waterfalls, alpine rock gardens, wetlands and meadows, as
well as 10 Japanese gardens that elegantly suggest nature. For the
naturalistic gardener or landscaper. &QL;

   Essays &AMP; Memoirs &QL;

   ``Henry Mitchell on Gardening,'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24). ``I
well know I have neither the time nor the energy nor even the
desire to have a garden that people admire,'' wrote the
iconoclastic Washington Post garden columnist, who died in 1993.
Yes, he was getting tired in this last collection of essays, but
Mitchell remained dedicated to the pursuit of subjective, piercing
beauty and indifferent to merely putting on a good show. Mitchell
wrote as he gardened. Pursuing contrarian enthusiasms for obscure
roses or finicky camellias that he happened to fall in love with,
rather than enforcing rules of taste or even giving particularly
helpful advice, he reminds us here that gardening can be a passion,
instead of an exercise in organic decorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Hall,'' by Beverley Nichols (Timber Press, $24.95). This
reissued 1952 memoir by the late British garden writer creates an
entertaining period piece with cantankerous gardeners, ditzy floral
designers, and disastrous flower shows that reads like P.G.
Wodehouse. It is the first in a trilogy about the author's efforts
to rehabilitate an old house and garden in a sleepy English
village. The second, ``Laughter on the Stairs,'' was also reissued
this year. The third, ``Sunlight on the Lawn,'' will be reprinted
next spring. Hilarious for gardeners who adore Masterpiece Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich Harvest,'' by Don Hastings (Longstreet, $20). Hastings
has a wholesome, almost reverent way of telling stories ranging
from working on his family's Georgia seed farm as a child to
developing agricultural projects in Egypt, the Philippines, and
Chile as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardening Life,'' by Lee May (Longstreet, $22). A collection
of favorite newspaper columns by a noted journalist and the Atlanta
Journal's first black editorial writer who decided one day he had
had enough of writing about murder and mayhem and wanted to focus
on ``feeling good about life as I aged.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   Gardens as Sanctuaries. &QL;

   ``The Inviting Garden: Gardening for the Senses, Mind and
Spirit,'' by Allen Lacy (Henry Holt, $40). ``Gardening is not a
hobby, and only a non-gardener would describe it as such,'' writes
Allen Lacy in the best-written garden book of the year. A professor
of philosophy, Lacy has, in fact, long used gardening as the
vehicle for his intellectual inquiries into the nature of
existence. In these essays accompanied by enlightening photographs,
he deconstructs the meaning of gardening as a source of renewal,
sensual pleasure, and ultimately of connection to time and place
and the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magic Land: Designing Your Own Enchanted Garden,'' by
Julie Moir Messervy (Macmillan, $19.95). This sensitive and
imaginative book can help homeowners draw on the deepest levels of
their psyches to create healing landscapes full of personal
meaning. Using design philosophies from feng shui to Egyptian
symmetry, this Wellesley landscape designer shows how to translate
emotions into garden designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rustic Retreats: A Build-It-Yourself Guide,'' by David and
Jeanie Stiles (Storey Books, $19.95). First it was gazebos. Now an
increasing number of people are building little sleep-away
bungalows, even in the corner of their own back yards. Here's how
to add habitable nooks and hideouts to yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardens of the Spirit: Creating Your Own Sacred Spaces,'' by
Roni Jay (Sterling, $19.95). This book borrows from many traditions
to create garden plans for a build-it-yourself Japanese Zen garden,
a Taoist garden, a teahouse, a fruit- and rose-filled Islamic
garden, an English knot garden, and an Italian Renaissance garden
with gravel walkways, a central pool and stone statue fountain,
tunnel arbors, and flower beds. A delight for the dreamer and the
skilled gardener or someone working with a professional landscape
architect, but too ambitious for the casual amateur. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instruction &AMP; Advice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a Garden: Reliable Techniques, Outstanding Plants, and
Honest Advice,'' by Rita Buchanan, illustrations by Steve Buchanan
(Houghton Mifflin, $35). Connecticut-based Rita Buchanan's talents
as both a veteran gardening editor and writer are present in this
reassuring book that takes the beginner by the hand and explains
everything she really needs to know, and nothing she doesn't.
Combining warmth and efficiency, each word and illustration is
well-chosen so you absorb a lot of information without feeling
overwhelmed, or even realizing how much ground you've covered.
Potentially intimidating subjects such as raising seedlings indoors
and pruning shrubs, as well as fun stuff like the new tropical pot
plants, are gently explained, and everything in it works for our
climate. A jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Garden Style,'' by Bunny Williams (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35).
A noted New York interior designer, Bunny Williams brings haute
interior design to the out-of-doors in this book devoted to style,
nuance, and ornmentation. Everything you ever wanted to know about
using concrete fragments, finials, posts, pedestals, obelisks, and
pots. Williams is also the owner of the New York garden ornament
emporium Treillage, and gardens in Connecticut, too. A lush idea
book for refined tastes.

A RECOMMITMENT TO `JUST THE FACTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year of credibility-sapping scandals _ from Mike
Barnicle's, Patricia Smith's, and Stephen Glass's mingling of fact
and fiction to CNN's report alleging US use of nerve gas in the
Vietnam War _ the journalism business now seems very eager to
redevote itself publicly to Sergeant Joe Friday's ``just the
facts'' credo. (Perhaps just in time, too. A stunning 66 percent of
the respondents to a recent Media Studies Center survey believe
journalists often or sometimes ``make up stories and pass them off
as real.'')
</P>
<P>
   In September, journalists, photographers, and writers gathered
at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
to debate the issue of fact versus fiction. ``The Poynter thing was
to streamline the mortification, to say we have a code,'' says
Boston University journalism professor and co-editor of the
``Literary Journalism'' anthology, Mark Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, the influential Committee of Concerned
Journalists recently sent out a survey to 200 randomly selected
journalists asking them about ``altering reality,'' explains
committee vice chair Tom Rosenstiel. (A typical question is whether
it's OK to clean up someone's grammar in a quote.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the results are incomplete, Rosenstiel says the
response is running about 4-1 ``against all alteration. . . .
People don't always necessarily agree on the details (but) on the
broader question, there's almost no serious support for inventing
things in non-fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is teaming up with Poynter to produce what could
become a definitive document on journalistic standards. Currently
an early draft, the report is expected to address a range of
questions including: how to handle slang and ungrammatical quotes;
reconstructing scenes that were not witnessed firsthand; reading
back quotes to sources to verify accuracy; creating composite
characters; using devices like slow motion or dramatic music to
enhance television news reports; and employing computer technology
to alter photographs.
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, the final version will look askance at any
whiff of fancy and will counsel strict adherence to two core
principles. Do not report things that did not happen and do not
deceive listeners, viewers, or readers.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, ``Do we have to move the line (for standards of
truth) or do we have to take a big black marker and redraw it?''
says Poynter Institute senior scholar Roy Peter Clark. The loudly
professed intent is to toe the line all the more respectfully.

   Author Philip Nobile's crusade to convince media outlets to
acknowledge that the late Alex Haley played fast and loose with the
facts in ``Roots'' now focuses on a 26-year-old New York Times
article. Nobile is not the only doubting voice in the chorus:
Harvard's Henry Louis Gates Jr., who co-edited the Norton Anthology
of African American Literature, recently told the Globe that ``
`Roots' is a work of the imagination rather than strict historical
scholarship.'' But Nobile has failed miserably in his efforts to
get Haley's 1977 Pulitzer Prize rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is waging war over a 1972 article tracing Haley's
genealogy _ titled ``My Furthest-Back Person _ `The African' ''_
that the ``Roots'' author wrote for the Times's Sunday magazine. On
Oct. 16, Nobile wrote Times executive editor Joseph Lelyveld asking
why _ even at this late date _ the paper ``does not publicly
disown'' the Haley magazine article. ``The New York Times,'' he
stated, ``finds itself in the dubious ethical position of refusing
to admit a hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Lelyveld had responded to his request, Nobile
said: ``Shockingly, not.''

   Who says a newspaper's demise has to deprive the community of an
editorial voice? When the evening Chattanooga Free Press
(circulation 40,119) and the morning Chattanooga Times (circulation
41,229) merge Jan. 5, several dozen out of more than 500 staffers
will lose their jobs. But the Free Press's conservative-leaning
op-ed/editorial page and the Times's more liberal opinion section
will be kept intact and published on facing pages, thus maintaining
a two-newspaper ideological war in a one-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   According to Walter Hussman, who will be publisher of the merged
paper, one major issue has already been resolved. ``The more
conservative Free Press editor said he'd like to move to the right
side,'' of the two-page layout, he says.

   ``Gardening From Scratch: How to Turn Your Empty Lot Into a
Living Garden,'' by Ann Lovejoy (Macmillan, $19.95). This is a
crash course for the new homeowner who needs to landscape ``from
scratch.'' Lovejoy first gardened in Massachusetts and now writes
and gardens on Bainbridge Island, in Washington. It takes into
account the reader's time, energy level, and budget, but does make
the design process seem complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Way to Garden: A Hands-On Primer for Every Season,'' by
Margaret Roach (Clarkson Potter, $30). Roach is garden editor of
Martha Stewart Living magazine and this book shares the same high
level of photography and design. She divides the year into a
gardener's calendar of six two-month segments beginning with
``Conception'' (January and February) and ending with ``Death and
Afterlife'' (November and December).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Greenthumb Plows Ahead: Five Steps to the Drop-Dead
Garden of Your Dreams,'' by Cassandra Danz, (Crown, $25). Some
people wince at Danz (alias Mrs. Greenthumb) and her jokiness, but
I find her shtick a welcomed antidote to garden snobbery. Danz
shares good humor and good advice with the harried homeowner on a
quarter-acre lot, not the wanna-be lady of the manor.
</P>

   ``Solviva: How to Grow $500,000 on One Acre &AMP; Peace on Earth;
Learning the Art of Living, with Solar-Dynamic, Bio-Benign
Design,'' by Anna Edey (Trailblazer Press, $35). Visionary Anna
Edey tells the story of her model experimental farm on Martha's
Vineyard, where she has raised organic vegetables, laying chickens,
sheep, and angora rabbits for the last 15 years using solar energy
and other nonpolluting technologies. &QL;

   Perennials &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Well-Tended Perennial Garden: Planting and Pruning
Techniques,'' by Tracy DiSabato-Aust (Timber Press, Portland,
$29.95). This is the book of the year for anyone who gardens with
perennials. While most books focus on initial design and planting,
this details ongoing maintenance and particularly pruning for
specific types of perennials, a subject never before so thoroughly
covered. DiSabato-Aust tells which perennials are better
deadheaded, disbudded, thinned, pinched, or cut back to extend
flowering periods, with explanations of each technique. She even
tells how to renovate an overgrown garden without throwing
everything out. Her own garden-tested recipe for great soil, her
surprising list of the truly low-maintenance perennials, and her
tips on getting the most from each make this book a time-saving
road map to perennial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perennial All Stars: The 150 Best Perennials for
Great-Looking, Trouble-Free Gardens,'' by Jeff Cox (Rodale Press,
$29.95). Get this book for beginners overwhelmed by the vast
variety of perennials available. I admire the bold specificity of
Cox's choices. Here's a man willing to pick the best day lily, the
best hosta, the best daffodil. Brave indeed. And mostly right. His
selections, such as Ingewersen's Variety cranesbill, Marshall's
Delight bee balm, David summer phlox, Lord Baltimore hibiscus, Alma
Potschke New England aster, and Ceasar's Brother Siberian iris,
match my own hard-earned experience as to the best ``doers'' in
each category. Well illustrated and easy to use, this book will
help readers pick winners next February when flipping through those
plant catalogs that rhapsodize about everything they sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plantfinder's Guide to Tender Perennials,'' by Ian Cooke
(Timber Press, $34.95). Gardeners looking for something totally
different will be fascinated by the gorgeous and unfamiliar plants
in this well-photographed and designed directory of tropicals for
the outdoor garden. The new trend toward perennials that aren't
hardy in our zone may sound silly, but they do offer stunning
colors and exuberant foliage. Best of all, they make summer seem
longer, hitting full stride from August through October, when most
other plants have wound down. Instructions on overwintering are
included, but plants described as borderline hardy for the British
author are definitely not hardy for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gardener's Guide to Growing Daylilies,'' by Diana Grenfell
(Timber Press, $29,95). Day lily fans, and they are legion, will be
glad for this update on the new and remarkable cultivars. The color
photographs make all look as glittering and tempting as
sugar-crusted bonbons. But are they hardy here? Written by an
English gardener (with a chapter on day lilies in North America by
a Virginia gardener), this book doesn't say. Place your confidence
in cultivars that go dormant in the winter and approach varieties
labeled semi-evergreen or evergreen with caution. With day lilies,
it pays to buy from a local specialist such as Bob Seawright in
Carlisle or Tranquil Lake in Rehoboth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbs in Bloom: A Guide to Growing Herbs as Ornamental
Plants,'' by Jo Ann Gardner (Timber Press, $34.95). No worry about
hardiness here. The author stumbled on the idea of using herbs as
ornamental perennials when they proved the only things she planted
that survived her first winter on her Canadian farm on remote Cape
Breton Island. In a friendly but straightforward manner Gardner
details propagation methods, site and soil selection for her 80
favorite flowering herbs. Good for northern New England gardeners. &QL;

   ``Taylor's Guide to Growing North America's Favorite Plants,''
by Barbara Ellis (Houghton Mifflin, $35). Here is an encyclopedia
containing the most commonly grown perennials, bulbs, annuals,
vines, flowering shrubs and trees, in a single easy-to-read volume.
Especially helpful are the groupings by use with, for instance, one
heading for fragrant viburnums and another for viburnums with
four-season interest. Sidebars on topics such as tea herbs and
perennial tulips help make this hefty volume fun to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 Orchids for the American Gardener,'' by Elvin McDonald
(Smith &AMP; Hawken Series, published by Workman, $17.95). Orchids are
the ultimate houseplant. This is the first orchid book to show the
whole plant, pot, foliage, and blooms, with outstanding photos by
Steven McDonald accompanied by his father's precise growing
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bird Gardening Book: The Complete Guide to Creating a
Bird-Friendly Habitat in Your Backyard,'' by Donald and Lillian
Stokes (Little, Brown, $12.95). Through the tips they outline here,
the Stokeses have transformed their own Carlisle yard from a wild
and tangled but effective bird santuary into a showpiece garden
equally attractive to birds and humans. This is by far the best of
several new books with a user-friendly pictorial format for bird
lovers who garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brooklyn Botanic Garden Gardener's Desk Reference,''
edited by Janet Marinelli (Henry Holt, $40). A well-done,
all-in-one reference that is part how-to guide and part
horticultural encyclopedia. It lists public gardens and plant
societies but also includes entertaining horticultural trivia such
as biographies of 50 great figures in garden history, seven of whom
lived in Massachusetts. Ecological issues are well-covered in four
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tropical Look: An Encyclopedia of Dramatic Landscape
Plants,'' by Robert Lee Riffle (Timber Press. $49.95). It's
margarita time! If you're looking for a banana that can bounce back
from zero-degree temperatures or plants that merely look tropical,
this book has them, along with 400 color photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose Garden Series: Shrub Roses; Tea Roses; Old-Fashioned
Roses; Climbing Roses,'' by Elvin McDonald (Smithmark, four books,
$12.95 each). Each of these four small but beautifully illustrated
books zeros in on a different category of rose, making them ideally
personal yet inexpensive gift books for true rose-lovers, who are
apt to have strong preferences. (For instance, fans of
old-fashioned roses often disdain tea roses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees of the Central Hardwood Forests of North America: An
Identification and Cultivation Guide,'' by Donald J. Leopold,
William C. McComb, and Robert N. Muller (Timber Press, $49.95). Our
trees lose their leaves in the fall, but that's not true in most of
the country. Since the end of the last ice age, southeastern New
England has been part of what scientists call the Central Hardwood
Forests, a broad band of deciduous trees that are bordered on both
the north and south by evergreen forests. This scholarly manual

HARTFORD'S STADIUM QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ When Robert Fiondella looks up from his desk
on the 12th floor of the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co.,
the site of the proposed new stadium for the New England Patriots
is right outside the window. It is just past the proposed $1
billion Adriaen's Landing development that he has spent years
promoting.
</P>
<P>
   One can easily imagine the glimmering, distinctive shape of The
Phoenix _ the name of the building _ broadcast to the nation during
televised National Football League games. Such incidental marketing
is one reason Fiondella has been so enthusiastic about bringing
sports events to Hartford and central Connecticut for years.
</P>
<P>
   What began four years ago as a campaign to increase the name
recognition of his company has blended with his leadership role in
revitalizing the city. And now Fiondella, chairman of the Greater
Hartford Chamber of Commerce, wants the New England Patriots to
help him do both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view the Patriots being a part of Adriaen's Landing
as the catalyst for revitalizing the whole region and, to a lesser
extent, the whole state,'' Fiondella said during a recent
interview. ``I have always had an interest and involvement in
sports and in urban renewal, and, a few years ago, Hartford was at
the point where it needed a business person to try to help deal
with that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you look at cities that have gained teams,
that has been a real source of revitalization in all ways,
including economic,'' said Fiondella, a lawyer and a former town
councilman and redevelopment official in his lifelong hometown of
Bristol. ``And if you look at cities that have lost teams, they
have regretted losing them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the public will benefit from Connecticut
taxpayers' financing of the new stadium _ an investment of at least
$375 million, one of the most lucrative deals ever offered an NFL
owner _ Fiondella says he disagrees with studies that show sports
stadiums do little to attract new business or create jobs. He cites
few figures to support his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue of the stadium is a lot like the issue of
advertising,'' Fiondella said. ``How do you demonstrate that
branding and name recognition results in profits? It's pretty hard.
But it's pretty clear that if you don't have it, you know that
impact is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiondella has worked long hours for years with other businessmen
and with state and local government officials to support the
Adriaen's Landing development, which includes a convention center,
a hotel, stores, and residences. In May, and quite in secret, the
planning began to include the Patriots, shortly after Jonathan
Kraft, the son of owner Robert Kraft, reviewed the redevelopment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Robert Kraft has met Governor John Rowland in the
Phoenix Home Life boardroom, which also overlooks the stadium site,
as they negotiated the proposed deal. Fiondella personally guided
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue around the site during a subsequent
meeting. And, this week, politicians and businessmen sat around the
big table in the boardroom talking excitedly about the proposed
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company and a CEO who have not just given lip
service to the idea that bringing sports to Hartford is good for
Hartford,'' said Boston sports lawyer Robert Caporale, who has
helped governments and franchise owners negotiate sports deals.
``They have written checks to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, realizing that Phoenix Home Life's market
position was ``as a large company, but not the largest'' Fiondella
began attracting and sponsoring a number of sports events. It
started with women's basketball at the University of Connecticut.
About the time the company put up $5,000 of the $20,000 it cost to
broadcast the games on public television, the women won the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fiondella also helped bring the Special Olympics to Connecticut
along with a franchise of the women's American Basketball League
and the American Tennis Professionals Tour World Doubles
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sports is a great medium for reaching people at all
levels and for bringing people in a community together. It evokes
pride, particularly if it is done well,'' Fiondella said.
``Whenever we had an opportunity to focus on name recognition, if
we could also stimulate activity in the city, then we would do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots are an even bigger and better use of sports to
market the town, Fiondella reasons. But many doubt that the massive
expenditure of public finances will make that much difference,
beyond some people around town feeling better about calling
Hartford home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly financed stadiums essentially have almost no
anticipated revenue,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics
professor at Smith College and coauthor of a Brookings Institution
study, ``Sports, Jobs &AMP; Taxes: the Economic Impact of Sports Teams
and Stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalist has been contacted by Connecticut legislators who want
him to testify during hearings before the General Assembly on the
stadium proposal set for Wednesday. The study includes a number of
reports from cities nationwide concluding that the financial
payback from publicly financed stadiums is minimal, and the public
subsidies almost always exceed the incremental tax revenues and
other financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subsidized sports facilities do not exist because they are
financially valuable assets in their own right,'' Zimbalist and his
coauthor, Roger G. Noll, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, wrote. ``They exist, instead, because most cities have
decided that a subsidized team is better than no team at all, and
because scarcity in the number of teams give owners the advantage
in bargaining with cities.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar study of the impact of new stadiums in California on
other businesses, written by University of California at Berkeley
professor Jack Sylvan, found that sales-tax data from 1972 to 1995
showed no increase in business clearly related to the construction
of any stadium in seven California cities.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the studies, Fiondella said: ``I never read
them. I think I know a little bit more about job creation than the
people who do those studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly significant investment,'' Fiondella says of the
$375 million in proposed public financing, which he said has
substantial support in the General Assembly. ``But I think that
what's less important to one person may be more important to
someone else. For us, causing the Patriots to come here is
significantly more important than it may have been for
Massachusetts to keep them. And that's the way business goes, and
that is the way life goes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejects, with a shrug and a smile, criticisms of some in
the sports business industry that Hartford's lucrative offer to the
Patriots has merely driven up the costs for all other cities intent
on securing NFL teams or other professional sports franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, quite honestly, those very same cities that are
complaining about it didn't seem to complain about moving factories
out of the Northeast, with fairly significant incentives,'' he
said. ``I mean, the economy is competitive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's been only a few times in their 30-year partnership that
Dr. Barbara Ann Payne Rockett has had to put Dr. Francis Xavier
Rockett in his place, publicly. And one of those occasions was
during a marathon operation on a 21-year-old woman with a brain
tumor. Six or seven hours into the surgery, Dr. Francis Rockett
turned to his wife and cosurgeon and said, ``Barbara, pay
attention!''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Barbara Rockett turned to her husband and said, ``If you
keep that up, I'm leaving you!''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a stunned silence (a la the TV show ``ER''),
everyone in the operating room at Newton-Wellesley Hospital _
nurses, anesthesiologists, attending surgeons _ burst out laughing.
They had just seen the Drs. Rockett at possibly their worst public
moment and they knew the husband and wife surgical team would
survive it.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed they have. Married 40 years, the Rocketts have
flourished doing what many couples today say they could never do:
work together and stay married. And along the way, they have raised
five children (two of whom are also doctors), and have won numerous
awards for their work in medicine and the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the Rocketts, whose relationship seems as
comfortable and well-worn as the furnishings in their office, don't
have their differences. There are times, Francis Rockett
acknowledges, when he gets curt and moody, such as when he snapped
at his wife in the operating room. But there are consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get curt, I'll get my toast burned the next morning,'' he
says, with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after decades of being a rare breed, the Rocketts find
themselves joined by a growing phalanx of younger husband-and-wife
teams who have discovered the Rocketts' secret: being married to
your partner may be the best way to raise children and still work
full time in a job you love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you it's a growing phenomenon and that's because a
lot of women have figured out that it's one of the ways to
establish equity right from the beginning,'' says Fran Rogers, CEO
of Work/Family Directions, a national consulting firm in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know from the research is that men and women often
enter marriage as equals in the workplace, but when children come,
the woman backs off and the man moves forward. But if you're doing
something together, you have a better chance of establishing an
equal relationship at home and with the business,'' Rogers says.
</P>
<P>
   The number of husbands and wives working together is also
growing, family business specialists say, because more people are
leaving corporate life and starting at-home businesses, and many
spouses are doing it together. According to the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the number of people working in home-based businesses
has doubled since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But so much togetherness carries a strong undercurrent of risk.
``If you have a lousy marriage, it's not going to work,'' Rogers
warns. ``You have to have a strong marriage going into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers should know. Ten years ago, after founding Work/Family
Directions in 1983, Rogers brought her husband, a labor economist,
into the business as her partner. And very early on, Rogers and her
husband, Charles, &UR;  &LR; learned that too much togetherness can suffocate
a marriage, particularly when both partners are strong-willed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is kind of an organized person who keeps notes from
week to week, and while I remember the important things, I don't
necessarily write things down or follow through the way he does,''
Rogers says. ``So when we tried to do things together it was too
much of a strain. Keep in mind that the honesty you're going to get
from a spouse is very different from what you're going to get from
an employee, so when he first joined the company, I have to say it
was a shock to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says she and her husband solved that problem by
separating their roles. ``My husband, who has more of a research
and academic background, runs the consulting side of the business,
and I manage the service side of the business,'' Fran Rogers says.
``And we talk a lot. Communication is key; you can't let this stuff
build up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Rogerses have long since figured out how to make their
differences work for them, Vera and John Diaz-Freitas, married
Brazilian immigrants who run a small jewelry store in downtown
Framingham, are still grappling with that issue.
</P>
<P>
   John Freitas, 32, a tall &UR;  &LR; man who laughs a lot, is the more
easygoing of the pair. Vera Diaz, also 32, a petite dark-haired
woman with a passion for life, is more high-strung. And there are
times, John Freitas says, when they will disagree over how to
handle a customer who, say, wants to return some jewelry and get
his money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more aggressive on business matters,'' Freitas says.
``I'm more inclined to let things go.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do argue on the job, Vera Freitas says, it's very hard
for her to keep working in the same room with her husband. ``When
you have a disagreement, you don't want to see that person again
for a few hours,'' she says candidly. ``So sometimes I grab my
handbag and I go out and have a Starbucks coffee and then I'm fine
when I come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But underneath their flare-ups, the Diaz-Freitases say, lies a
strong current of mutual admiration and respect. A year after the
couple married in 1991 _ they met at a Brazilian Baptist church in
Framingham _ Vera decided to open the jewelry store, a risky
venture by any measure, and John supported her by continuing to
work in his cleaning business. Now that their jewelry business has
taken off, John has joined her in the store.

   ``She is the one who did all the work; she has all the credit
for it,'' John says of his wife. ``She really knows where to buy
and when to buy. She has a gift for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera, interviewed from Brazil, where she is on a business trip,
hasn't heard what her husband said about her. But when told, she
instinctively returns the compliment. ``I couldn't do it without
him,'' she says. ``He doesn't feel that if I'm growing, he has to
put me down. He likes to see me grow. It's really amazing the way
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Such mutual generosity is not unique to the Diaz-Freitases
marriage. It is present in the 40-year marriage of the Rocketts,
who repeatedly sing each other's praise during a brief interview in
their Newton-Wellesley office. When asked what makes their
relationship tick, Francis Rockett, a genial, white-haired man who
could easily play Santa Claus without makeup or pillow, replies,
``We recognize we're a team. I bask in the glory of what she has
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is obvious in the easy, laughter-filled rapport between
Mary Ann Thompson and Charles Rose, principals in their own
architectural firm in Harvard Square. Both 38 and dressed stylishly
in black as they greet a visitor in their office high above the
square, they laugh at each other's jokes and finish each other's
sentences as they explain how their philosophy of working together
fits with the way they are trying to run their marriage and raise
two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thread that runs through our lives and our practice is the
thread of collaboration,'' says Mary Ann Thompson, who like her
husband is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Graduate School of
Design. ``We have a shared goal _ to create an incredible project.
So we don't get competitive about who has the best idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thread runs through the marriage of Ed and Shelley
Rainen, who have worked together in the field of title law for
almost 20 years, while raising two children and making sure that
Shelley went back to earn her undergraduate degree and then her law
degree, at night. (She had dropped out of college to support Ed,
who was then in law school).
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelley worked full time the whole way through,'' her husband
says proudly. ``And she finished law school in three-and-a-half
years as opposed to four.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Rainen, ,45, who works as an equal alongside her husband
in their two-partner firm in Government Center, puts her finger on
it halfway through lunch at the Parker House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not threatened by me,'' she says, and he finishes the
thought: ``I want her to succeed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, they fight. ``Just last night, we had an argument in
the car on the way home,'' Ed Rainen says casually. Rainen, 47,
hates to talk about work once he locks the door to the couple's
Center Plaza law office. But the other night, when the Rainens were
driving home from a late meeting around 10 p.m., Shelley Rainen
started in on a troublesome business matter that had come up that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the opposing view and when she continued to argue with
me, I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore,'' he recalls.
``All of a sudden I was the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Rainen nods, sagely keeping quiet, and her husband
continues: ``Maybe it's the Mars and Venus thing. I tend to work
significantly later than Shelley _ for me to walk in the door
before 9 p.m. is a miracle _ and when I get out of the office, I
don't want to think or talk about work and sometimes Shelley
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Chan and Anne Mock, who are building an innovative
architectural practice a few blocks down the street from Thompson
and Rose, ran into the same roadblock when they first started
working together two years ago. And that gender gap was exacerbated
by the fact that their office was initially located in their
Cambridge home.
</P>
<P>
   There were blueprints all over the kitchen table and living room
floor, and the constant disarray drove Annie Mock, as everyone
calls her, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a small space; it was really bad,'' recalls Mock,
a serious, competent-looking woman with a rosebud mouth. ``We
realized very quickly we needed a separate office.''
</P>
<P>
   Their new office, in a stately yellow Victorian a few blocks
from Harvard Square, has made a big difference. And their
workstyle, they say, gives them a flexibility that many of their
friends don't have. When Annie Mock, for instance, leaves work
every day at 1 p.m. to pick up their newly adopted 2-year-old
daughter from a nearby day-care center and bring her home, she
doesn't get any resentful stares from coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that with our own friends who have high-powered jobs:
how difficult it is for them to get the flexiblity they need for
home and family,'' says Mock, 40, &UR;  &LR; who met her husband at the
Harvard Graduate School of Design. ``We have more flexibility.
There's a cost to it, of course; we have to worry about making a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other costs. Chris Chan acknowledges that he still
occasionally gets exasperated by his partner's need to chew over
work-related problems after hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes think it works best to compartmentalize this
stuff,'' Chan says. Mock immediately disagrees: ``I don't think so.
I certainly can't compartmentalize!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he says. ``With Annie, stuff is always oozing out all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they laugh and exchange affectionate, knowing grins.

 ELLEN DeGENERES FOR MAYOR  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ellen DeGeneres and partner Anne Heche say
they're tired of anti-gay prejudice in Hollywood and they've
decided to move to either San Francisco or Ojai.
</P>
<P>
   Ojai, what's that? A sport played in Miami? Ellen, we want you.
Move to San Francisco. Who else can beat the city's mayor, Willie
Brown?
</P>
<P>
   I was the first to write ``Run, Willie, run'' back in early
1995. Do I regret it. I've been waiting for a bus ever since.
</P>
<P>
   I was a king-maker. Now I can be a queen-maker, pardon the
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Run, Ellen, run.
</P>
<P>
   We need a real comedian as mayor, a kind one, not an amateur
like Brown who laughs at his own mean jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say Supervisor Tom Ammiano, who is gay and a comedian by
trade, could be a viable candidate for mayor. If Ammiano has a
chance, imagine the popularity of a comedian, a household first
name, who spent much of 1997 coming out on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ammiano says he's not running. ``It's scary,'' he told
me when I asked him about that poll. ``The world is flat.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Mayor Brown has gone flat.
</P>
<P>
   What would Ellen do about San Francisco's problems once she
takes office with Anne by her side? You can bet she wouldn't say
she'd fix the Municipal Railway's problems in 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than that to promote her coming-out episode.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say there are advantages to having a real Hollywood
star running the city, instead of a wannabe who's always running
off to Los Angeles and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless problem: Easy. They can be extras. The work pays
scale, and beats three years of Willie Brown pretending the
homeless don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The housing shortage: Everyone can just hang around Ellen's
house, the way all those useless supporting characters did on her
TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Muni: On TV, Ellen ran a bookstore. She can give everyone who's
waiting for the train a book and a cup of coffee. Big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Being dictator: Heck, no, not her. On ABC, she only wanted to be
herself, not Mao or Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Sartorial splendor: None. No dress codes from Ellen. It'll be
come out as you are.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure out the rest of the Ellen program _ as hard
as it was to figure out the ``Ellen'' program when it began as
``These Friends of Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it won't involve those friends of Willie's.
</P>
<P>
   Does Ellen have big developers as friends, or run a steamroller
of a political machine? No way. From what I read in the gossip
columns, she can't even get a producer to do lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, we eat lunch, and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen used to live and perform here. She shouldn't worry about
residency requirements, or whether she can go on tour while running
for office. Willie Brown is always on some trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time we had a gay mayor. It'd be a twofer. We'd get
Anne Heche as first partner.
</P>
<P>
   Heche stars in the remake of ``Psycho,'' playing the Janet Leigh
role. After looking at that picture of Frank Jordan, it'll be nice
to have a pro doing shower scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen and Anne can even take showers together. This is San
Francisco, and we won't put parental warnings on them the way ABC
did on Ellen's show.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco may be a theme park, but it's for adults. It's not
about to be bought by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of good reasons to move to San Francisco
from L.A., besides becoming mayor and having a show that can't be
canceled for four years.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has better restaurants than L.A. And you don't
have to drive as far to get to them. Mayors don't have to figure
out where to park, either. They get squadrons of police motorcycles
as escorts.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., the police only draw fire.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans love Hollywood stars who move here, and
immediately take them into their hearts and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans don't stalk or gawk. It isn't cool. Instead,
they studiously pretend not to see celebrities until their backs
are turned.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen and Anne can even get married, and the local papers won't
cover the event. That's how cool we are.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans don't care if Ellen and Anne hold hands and
smooch as they walk around town. In fact, we hope they do. We won't
look. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm not Dick Morris, thank God, but here's the way I see
Ellen's campaign. Call it lavender triangulation.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the triangle, she wins the gay and lesbian votes.
She's an icon. It's a gimme. On the second side, she wins the
women's vote. She had Linda Ellerbee on the legendary last episode
of ``Ellen.'' There's the women's vote right there.
</P>
<P>
   On the hypotenuse of the triangle, she wins the
celebrity-worshiper vote. Brown tries too hard to be a celebrity.
And he may have had a lot of women on his arm, but definitely not
Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   Gays, women and celebrity worshipers add up to more voters than
Willie Brown can turn out no matter what he does with the registrar
of voters, when special polling places are opened, or how early and
often the dead vote.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Ellen, any comedian can run this town.

THE NEW YORKER'S BOYISH WONDER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes editors box)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``My father was a dentist,'' David Remnick explains,
``and he got lots of magazines. One of them was The New Yorker. I
remember reading it, initially, like anybody else, because it had
these cartoons. . . . then, slowly, slowly, you get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A good 25 years later, as the magazine's editor, the 40-year-old
Remnick not only gets the idea of what makes The New Yorker what it
is, he gets to define it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it my dream job?'' Remnick asks of the post he's held since
Aug. 1. ``No. Am I liking it? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He's only the fifth editor in the publication's 73-year history,
putting him in a line of succession that comprises two certified
magazine legends (Harold Ross and William Shawn), a man widely
regarded as the finest book editor in postwar US publishing (Robert
Gottlieb), and the once and future empress of buzz (Tina Brown).
</P>
<P>
   This is heady company to be in, and editing The New Yorker may
be the most coveted job in print journalism and, from the sheer
weight of all that covetousness, the most onerous.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation about dozens of possible successors when
Brown made the surprise announcement in July that she'd be leaving
to start up her own magazine. But the one who got the job was
Remnick, a dark horse unity candidate commonly regarded as the only
contender who might combine the best of Brown's innovations with a
feel for the magazine's fabled sense of tradition. ``There's joy in
Mudville,'' senior editor Hendrik Hertzberg told The Washington
Post the day Remnick's selection was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 1992. One of
Brown's first hires, he almost immediately emerged as her era's
biggest star (after Brown herself, of course). On the day his
selection was announced, she called him ``the key member of my
dream team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Storybook 101: Boy meets magazine; magazine gets boy; boy
gets magazine. There was even a juicy subplot: New Yorker owner S.
I. Newhouse Jr. had briefly tapped an outsider, Slate editor
Michael Kinsley, only to rescind the offer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Brown's calm legatee
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker had long been America's most revered
general-interest magazine. Brown made it the most talked about: for
better, the 200,000 new readers she brought to it would argue _ for
worse, traditionalists, and the magazine's balance sheet, would
counter. Remnick has no trouble with being Brown's legatee. ``What
she did was she revived (The New Yorker) by intelligently getting
rid of the `cannots': You can't have photographs, you can't have
color, you can't do this, you can't do that. It took a kind of
rebellious spirit, like Tina's, to say, `Well, why not try to do
it?' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I agree with every single decision she made? No. And no
one here agrees with every single decision I make. But I think she
played a great role here, without having to deify it.''
</P>
<P>
   What changes Remnick has made since taking over have been
incremental. New York magazine's David Denby has come aboard as a
film critic, and The Village Voice's Peter Schjeldahl as art
critic. The Shouts &AMP; Murmurs page has been moved from the back of
the magazine to the middle. The New York Times's Elizabeth Kolbert
will be writing a column on city politics. More generally, the
magazine's Brownian motion has grown visibly less agitated (there
have been, as yet, no articles about dominatrixes under the new
regime).
</P>
<P>
   In person as in print, where Brown was a cool whirl of activity,
Remnick suggests a penetrating stability. He has sleepy eyes and a
boyish air. He talks in unhurried, even tones that aren't so much
soft-spoken as calm-spoken. The whole package _ eyes, air, speech _
works to allay the otherwise-disconcerting effect of the liveliness
of his intelligence, like putting a 45-rpm record in a 33-rpm
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
360-degree curiosity
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An agile mind married to an almost-rabbinical equanimity: It's a
good combination in an editor. Nor does it hurt to have an
almost-360-degree curiosity. As a staff writer, Remnick was a
one-man table of contents, equally comfortable writing about Amish
drug dealers and warring Shakespeare scholars, Boris Yeltsin and
Michael Jordan. A. J. Liebling, one of Ross's greatest hires, once
wrote of his boss, ``Many aspects of life entranced him
imprecisely.'' When this remark is quoted to Remnick, he roars with
laughter. ``My first and foremost fault as a writer was an
imprecision of obsession,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   That's a very good line and a very good thing in his new line.
On the other hand, Remnick has never previously held an editing job
(his high school paper excepted), and he's finding out what it
means to have to use different editorial muscles. ``Writing is
singular. You're thinking about your piece, your next interview,''
he explains. ``Editing is the opposite. You are trying to help
someone else do their best work. One enterprise is nobly selfish,
and the other'' _ he breaks into a grin _ ``is ignobly unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing Remnick is rather less substantial. Even
Brown's harshest critics had to concede that the former editor of
Vanity Fair _ the executive with the most famous fashion allowance
in publishing _ was in synch with an important part of New Yorker
tradition: the magazine's being the epitome, in Remnick's nice
phrase, of a certain ``Manhattan champagne fizz.'' In attire,
anyway, her successor is more Sam Adams than Veuve Clicquot.
Remnick might be Eustace Tilley, the magazine's dandified mascot,
in an anti-universe: Tilley's monocle, top hat, and cravat would be
as unthinkable on Remnick as his earth tones, open-necked shirts,
and rolled-up sleeves would be on Tilley.
</P>
<P>
   There's a divergence in attitude, as well. A side effect of The
New Yorker's special place in magazine culture has been a certain
institutional arrogance. The late Brendan Gill titled his
best-selling memoir of the magazine, ``Here at The New Yorker'';
the implicit subtitle was ``Out There All the Rest of You.'' It's
hard to detect much New Yorker affectation about Remnick. He has an
easy modesty and relaxed, slouchy manner born of absolute
confidence (why dress for success when you're already so
successful?). Solicitousness and a shrug come naturally to someone
who not only knows how good he is, but knows everyone else does,
too.
</P>
<P>
   An international reputation earned during four years as Moscow
correspondent for The Washington Post, four books published in five
years (the first of which, ``Lenin's Tomb,'' won both a Pulitzer
Prize and George Polk Award), 100 New Yorker bylines in six years:
Even if Si Newhouse fired him tomorrow, Remnick knows his family
wouldn't starve. For one thing, his wife, Esther B. Fein, earns a
good salary as a New York Times reporter. (Remnick and Fein have
two sons, Alexander and Noah, and live on Manhattan's Upper West
Side.) For another, he can always go back to his first love,
writing and reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick started at the Post as an intern on its Style section.
He briefly worked the night police beat, then spent three years as
a sportswriter before returning to Style for another three. He
wasn't quite 30 and was a rising star at one of the country's best
papers. But in 1988 came the move that took him to a wholly new
level.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of artwork adorns the walls of Remnick's large but
far-from-imposing office: family pictures, sports photographs, book
jackets. Surprisingly enough, only one is a New Yorker cartoon. A
beggar holding a tin cup wears a sign that says, ``Expert on
Russia.'' ``It seems appropriate,'' Remnick says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The luck of Moscow
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After going to Moscow, Remnick's career would never be the same.
``That was an accident _ a happy, happy accident,'' he sighs. ``I
put my name in for Moscow because I just thought it would change my
life and it sounded thrilling, and I wanted both things to happen:
change and thrills. I was too young to be in the office all day _ I
thought. I had no reasonable sense that I'd get sent, because they
don't send feature writers off to revolutions. . . . And I got
preposterously lucky _ and I mean preposterously lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His Moscow days led to ``Lenin's Tomb'' and Remnick's third
book, ``Resurrection: The Struggle for a New Russia,'' and they
even crop up in his second book, ``The Devil Problem and Other True
Stories,'' a collection of magazine pieces that includes a
memorable profile of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and a moving tribute to
Joseph Brodsky. But Remnick wrote his latest book, ``King of the
World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero,'' as a
conscious departure from what he jokingly calls ``all these baggy
Russian books.''
</P>
<P>
   The former heavyweight champion might seem an odd choice for
someone who for some time now has had his pick of assignments. But
Remnick's passion for Ali predates even those adolescent visits to
his father's waiting room to see what William Steig or Charles
Addams had been up to that week.

A HEROIC TALE OF MEN ON THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ICE MASTER 
By James Houston 
McLelland &AMP; Stewart, 372 pp., $29.99 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   North America holds no area more romantic, more unknown, more
mysterious than the icy waters off Baffin Island, just south of the
Arctic Circle. In the 1870s those waters, so cold, so uncharted, so
forbidding, were inhabited by whales _ and, it strains credulity
still, by small bands of hardy men from New England and
Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The men, determined to harvest the whale's oil for lights and
its bone for ladies' corsets, were of a different breed _
independent, to be sure; adventurous, of course; foolhardy,
probably. They were also smart and tough and crooked and mean and
inspiring and courageous.
</P>
<P>
   James Houston's ``The Ice Master'' is a tale of captains
courageous, and of boat steerers, coopers, sailmakers, carpenters,
stewards, cooks, and ship's boys. Together they sailed the great
whaling ships and together, when the big freezes came and the snows
blew, they planted tiny, isolated whaling camps on the ice. Their
lives were all but unknown to their contemporaries, and all but
unknown to us.
</P>
<P>
   This volume is a novel, a gazetteer, a field guide, a
reminiscence, and a morality tale. But it is also a lengthy
statement about a life that has disappeared and a breed of man that
has vanished. Think of it as a tribute that cries: Lest we forget.
</P>
<P>
   Houston hasn't. His name provokes no nods of recognition in New
England, where the waters are cold but not frigid, but he is
something of a folk hero in Canada, where the ice defies man's
humble strength and noblest intentions. A half-century ago he
ventured into the Arctic on a sketching trip and returned with a
cache of folk crafts that introduced the term ``Eskimo art'' to the
urban centers of Canada and the United States. For years he lived
in the North, learning the folkways and life rhythms of the Inuit,
as the native people of the region today are called.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has sketched a credible portrait of a world unimaginable,
where agile mammals with primitive tools battle ancient mammals
with terrifying instincts. His rendering of life on Arctic-bound
ships and at Arctic hunting camps is unforgiving and unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The story is punctuated with a remarkable set of characters and
episodes, classic elements of the literature of the mariner.
Mutiny. Mutineers in leg irons or stuffed into wooden barrels.
Flights of snow geese. Men in sealskin mitts and boots and
caribou-skin pants and parkas. Feasts of seal kidney stew.
Explosions of gunpowder shattering the spring ice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there are shards of colorful mariner talk and
flashes of graceful writing: ``At night, Finn lay on the bed in his
cabin, eyes open, staring through the dark, imagining that he and
his anxious crew were holding old Lancer afloat with their stomach
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a gripping group portrait of men on ice. They
lived on provisions of salt beef and pork, molasses, salt mackerel
and cod, coffee, tea, vinegar, dried corn meal, pickles, and beans.
They knew that the rancid whale oil that soaked their hulls also
helped keep their ships afloat. They scrubbed each other down with
pig-bristle brushes and horse-tar soap. They believed whistling
aboard ship brought bad luck, but whistling on shore brought good
luck. They handled dental problems by inserting a patient's head in
a wooden vise and twisting the stricken teeth out with pliers.
</P>
<P>
   These were not toffs and dandies. They lived with native people,
hunted with them, slept with them, respected them. When they
departed for warmer climates (and for the paymaster), they missed
them. These men were a little salty, a little lusty, but they were
not without sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The climax is gripping, terrifying, and masterfully drawn, as
the crippled Sea Horse limped home from the Arctic only to be
battered and broken apart off Montauk Point:
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge wave caught Sea Horse on the starboard quarter, lifted
her, and thrust her hard on top of Blackfish Rock, and the hatch
cover, with men still clinging to it, was hurled into the water.
The ship stopped with a grinding, tearing jolt and hung there
shuddering, her bottom ripped wide open. Sea Horse was defenseless
against the power of the next incoming wave. This wall of water,
when it struck her, broke Sea Horse's spine.''
</P>
<P>
   This life is gone now. Fortunately, it is not forgotten.

 NEW YORK: ... that week.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ali was this great hero of mine as a kid,'' Remnick explains.
``He was thrilling the way rock 'n' roll is thrilling. At that
time, for me, it was Bob Dylan, Muhammad Ali _ and it just doesn't
go away (I saw Dylan two weeks ago at the Garden, looking not bad,
by the way, with Joni Mitchell). And Ali kept evolving: beginning
first with shtick and athletics, then evolving into something with,
well, greater dimensions: a religious dimension, a racial
dimension, a political dimension. . . . He's just so interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ali's youthful admirer
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was more than keeping faith with a youthful admiration that
moved Remnick to write about Ali. It was also journalistic
instinct: the sheer richness of the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the fact that the Ali story in the '60s has the
classic proportions of the conventional novel. The main character
changes over time and is faced with improbable odds and difficult
decisions _ it's like right out of the handbook. You have secondary
characters who both reflect the main character and (are themselves)
of enormous interest: Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson. Then you
have interesting times. And you have tertiary characters like
Malcolm X, (fight manager) Cus D'Amato, (sportswriters) Jimmy
Cannon and Bob Lipsyte, the Beatles. It's a gift, a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick saw Ali's 1976 title defense against Ken Norton at
Yankee Stadium, sitting in a $25 seat that was closer to Queens
than it was to the ring. That was the only time, though. ``I wasn't
even allowed to go to closed-circuit things,'' Remnick laughs. He
adds that his parents ``didn't mind that I loved Muhammad Ali but
they weren't ready to shell out 25 bucks so I could go to a
theater'' to see a fight.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey native, Remnick was born in Hackensack, grew up in
Hillsdale, and went to college at Princeton. If it was in a
dentist's waiting room that Remnick first encountered The New
Yorker, it was in a college seminar room that he truly fell under
its spell. Besides being one of the magazine's most celebrated
writers, John McPhee has long taught a course at Princeton on the
literature of fact. Remnick took it his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that it must be like someone who has seen a lot of
movies, and has read a lot about this director and that director,
then gets a chance to spend a semester hearing Martin Scorsese talk
about acting and editing and actually making something into a
movie. . . . Princeton tuition cost a lot back then _ a lot _ but
getting to learn from McPhee was worth every penny.''
</P>
<P>
   The seed had been planted. ``Quite frankly, as much as I loved
The Washington Post, the thought of going to The New Yorker (which
seemed fairly impossible for a long time) was always there,''
Remnick says. And now, he's here, at the top, at The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I don't know how this thing will turn out,'' he says.
``I hope I might turn out to be good at it. It's early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never, ever in a million years have done this anywhere
else. I can't presume I would have been offered a job anywhere
else, but I also know I wouldn't have done it. I care immensely
about The New Yorker. I think its existence, its thriving, is
important not only to the 800,000 readers. But it's important to
have a weekly magazine that's on the search for the very best
fiction, poetry, narrative journalism, essays, criticism. Believe
me _ believe me _ I know there is good of all that elsewhere. But
as a single roof, this is a very unique place. I just care about
this place, I always have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEW YORKER NOTABLES
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In its 73 years, The New Yorker has played host to a legendary
array of writing and editing talent. Here are New Yorker editor
David Remnick's comments on six of the magazine's best-known names,
himself included. &QL; 
 &QL; 
John Updike: Updike is our Ted Williams _ and, of course, I was
terrified about dealing with him (the whole notion of editing John
Updike is hilarious on the face of it). Yet it turns out he's more
game, more open to suggestions, than any 25-year-old freelancer. .
. . He's an incredible man.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A. J. Liebling: Liebling is probably my favorite, the big vibrating
guy with the belly, he's such a writer of joy.. . . The image of
him sitting in his office, laughing at his own lines as he pounded
away at the typewriter, jiggling with delight, is a kind of cream
soda _ a Cel-Ray tonic _ to think about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ross: Too much is made of his lack of education. To have
produced this magazine he had to be a very clever guy and very
smart indeed. The famous story about him writing in the margin next
to a Moby-Dick reference, ``Who he: the man or the whale''? That's
shtick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
William Shawn: The stereotype of Shawn as someone Buddha-like and
soft-spoken to the point of inaudibility and simon-pure and the
rest? In fact, this was a guy who played jazz piano and had real
passions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown: Can I be very frank with you? I think this business
of ``Tina Brown, show-biz editor'' is baloney.. . . Circulation
(during Brown's tenure) went from 600,000 to 800,000. I don't think
the new 200,000 people signed on to get Show Biz magazine, to get
Photoplay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
David Remnick: People like Ross and Shawn, and probably Tina Brown,
have attached to them a 15-word thumbnail sketch. I don't know what
mysketch is at this point _ I don't know if I'm even worth having
one at this point.

REMEMBER, TURKEYS ARE PEOPLE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days before Thanksgiving, emerging from Park Street Under
at dusk, I heard chanting: ``One, two, three, four! Don't eat
turkeys anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   The source was a knot of demonstrators standing near the T
entrance. Some of them were holding signs depicting the horrors of
turkey farming. One was handing out leaflets adorned with a drawing
of a turkey family _ tom, hen, chicks _ gathered around a dinner
table, and several ``Thankful Turkey Recipes,'' including one for
roasted tom tofu.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were there to remind passersby that there are
those who look upon turkeys not as food, but as individuals in
their own right, entitled to live out their lives in peace and not
end up roasted on a dinner table. Their struggle _ the
demonstrators' struggle, that is _ is a noble one, but let's face
it, one that's pretty much uphill. The turkeys' struggle is even
grimmer, and, generally speaking, a losing one, especially during
the holiday season, when millions are slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure gave an address for ordering a vegan cookbook
published by Farm Sanctuary, a rescue organization that maintains
shelters for abused and neglected farm animals in New York and
California. Farm Sanctuary has an adopt-a-turkey program. For $15
you can sponsor a turkey. In return you receive a color photograph
of your turkey and an adoption card. Holly McNulty, who works at
the sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y., said the adopt-a-turkey
program runs through the holiday season because so many people like
to give a turkey as a gift. I adopted one named Cosmos for my
husband. We await his, or her, photograph and adoption card,
eagerly. (If you'd like to adopt a turkey, call 888-776-6767.)
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Tofurky, a vegan turkey substitute (``A Delicious
Vegetarian Feast''), donate part of their profits to Farm
Sanctuary's program. I'm not a vegetarian, just one of those
hypocrites who would be a vegetarian if she ever had to kill
anything. The demonstrators had started me thinking about the mass
slaughter of turkeys, and frankly, I was getting a little queasy at
the prospect of eating one. I like tofu. I thought I'd try Tofurkey
on an experimental basis, before Thanksgiving. (My husband and I
took our mothers out to dinner on the big day, to the Mohegan Sun
casino, but that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   I bought a small Tofurky roast ($19.95), thawed it, and cooked
it as directed, basting it in a mixture of orange juice, soy sauce,
and honey. I baked the accompanying six tempeh ``drummettes,''
which resembled drumstick-shaped Gardenburgers, and heated the
package of ``heavenly golden mushroom gravy.'' When the Tofurky
emerged from the oven it looked like something you might see in a
glass case at the Basketball Hall of Fame with a sign reading,
``Prototype basketball designed by James Naismith, 1891,'' a
battered, deflated spheroid object.
</P>
<P>
   It tasted only slightly better than it looked. The consistency
of the ``flesh'' was similar to turkey, but more rubbery. Actually,
it tasted like nothing much at all, certainly not tofu. The
stuffing wasn't bad, if a bit salty. But the ``heavenly'' gravy was
unspeakable. The drummettes tasted a little like Gardenburgers.
They were the best part by far.
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian neighbor, Jim Levinson, obligingly sampled the
Tofurky. I wanted his opinion. He said it wasn't bad, exactly.
Would he want to eat it on Thanksgiving? ``I'd prefer a
Gardenburger,'' he said. Personally, I'd just as soon skip turkey
and Tofurky and move straight to dessert.
</P>
<P>
   As a tofu lover, I can't help thinking that Tofurky amounts to
cruelty to tofu. Maybe the president could be persuaded to
``pardon'' a Tofurkey next Thanksgiving, along with the turkey he
reprieves every year, and send them both to Farm Sanctuary.

THERE'S CRAZING IN THE GLAZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The original white ceramic tile in my 70-year-old house is in
good shape, except it is crackled in the glaze. The crackle lines
are black, and no bleach or anything else will workfor me. I tried
Tilex, straight bleach, and acid, on separate occasions (I never
combnine these materials), all without success. What will clean
those crackle marks?
</P>
<P>
   JANE WEISS, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Those crackle marks are called crazing, and you may have to
live with them. But as a final try, wash the floor with Soft Scrub
or Simple Green. Flow on either material and let it sit on the
floor for 15 minutes or longer. Then scrub and rinse. If this
improves things, fine; if not, try KRC-7 Porcelain Cleaner, sold in
plumbing supply stores. Good for dirty grout, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My newly acquired old summer house in the Berkshires has a 3
1/2-foot crawl space with a concrete-block foundation and three
vents. The vent closures are on the inside, and I am loath to crawl
in there to close them. Can I cover them on the outside? They seam
to have several steel louvers behind the cast-iron grille.
</P>
<P>
   KAY KILPATRICK, Framingham, Mass...
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Look at those grilles a little more carefully; there should
be a handle at one side or in the middle that you can move to close
the louvers. They may be rusted open, which will make them
virtually impossible to close. But you should be able to unscrew
the grilles and pull the whole unit out in order to get the louvers
to move again. To do so, spray the louver connections and all
mechanical parts with WD40, then try to work them closed and open.
</P>
<P>
   You can also cover them from the outside: Tape a piece of
polyethylene plastic over them, or secure a pressure-treated board;
any thin board will do. An insulated cover is not necessary, since
the cover is needed only to stop the flow of cold air through the
space. The vents should be covered in cold weather, say from
October to April.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I like the idea of using the hard-faced ceiling tiles you
mentioned recently for my bathroom. I can keep them clean and paint
them when I feel like it. But where can I find them? Home Depot was
no help.
</P>
<P>
   C.T., Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are not alone. There were several inquiries from callers
who could not find them. I assumed they still existed because I put
them in my own bathroom several years ago. If they are no longer
made, it's a pity; they did yeoman service. So, your best bet is to
call Armstrong World Industries Inc. at 717-397-0611 to determine
if they exist and where you can buy them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My dining room ceiling is scrolled, and it's peeling. The
advice I received was to apply a coat of BIN after scraping off the
peeling paint. But the BIN is now peeling off, too. What can I do
to prevent the peeling?
</P>
<P>
   ANNE HILTON, South Weymouth, Mass...
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. BIN is a good stain killer where needed but not much of
primer or sealer. Now you have to try to scrape and brush off the
peeling paint with a medium-stiff bristle brush. Those scrolled
ceilings are a pain when the paint peels because removing the paint
is difficult. With the paint scraped, brushed, or sanded off, wash
the ceiling with a strong solution of detergent and water, then let
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a thin coat of a latex enamel undercoater. Normally, this
is not needed on plaster but because of your previous peeling
experience it is a good idea here, since such undercoaters stick to
a lot of surfaces. Then apply two thin coats of latex ceiling
paint. Notice that I suggest thin coats; thick coats are much more
likely to peel.
</P>
<P>

LIVING WITH THE FEAR OF DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Christina was diagnosed with a precancerous throat
condition at 42. Six years later, in 1992, she was diagnosed and
treated for breast cancer. Five years later, in 1997, while she was
in Holland visiting her family, she became exhausted and feverish.
Rushed to a hospital emergency room, she was operated on for
ovarian cancer and later treated at Dana-Farber in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a sermon at our Unitarian-Universalist Church that
spring, speaking from the heart about the ``Euthanasia Passport''
she had obtained in the Netherlands, a document that gives anyone
with a fatal illness the right to decide at what point they wish to
end their suffering. She talked about what a comfort it was to know
she would be allowed to make that choice. Then, seemingly restored
to health, she went on with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, she felt unusually tired once again. She
had a blood test and discovered her blood count had risen 12 points
above the normal range, a sign that the cancer was returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first response was total fear,'' she tells me as we sit
together over coffee. As members of the steering committee of the
Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project, we are colleagues as well as
friends. ``I felt I was coming totally unwrapped and although I had
no control over the cancer, it was not OK with me to have fear
rampant like this. But I couldn't just push it away. I had to come
to grips with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina decided to spend a week at Kripalu, a yoga center in
Western Massachusetts where a woman named Dayashakti was teaching a
method of entering deep within called ``Wave Work.'' The process is
designed to create a safe space for the integration of strong
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Christina found herself able to enter a deep state of
relaxation. With the support of a partner, she visualized healing
energy coming toward the cancer as waves of color swept across her
mind's eye and a sense of lightness flooded her body. ``The first
two days,'' she says, ``I had a very positive experience of
relaxing into my body in the most wonderful way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, when she entered the same relaxed state,
she was invaded by an overwhelming sense of sadness. Did she really
have to go through this again? It seemed more than she could bear.
In her mind she asked the Universal Power for help.
</P>
<P>
   I'll let her tell the rest in her own words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I saw myself on a high, overhanging ledge. I was in
a deep trance, and yet, though I was still aware of where I was and
what was happening, I knew somehow I had to get up and jump. I was
unsure whether I would be crushed when I landed or fall into a
feather bed. And then I dove into the abyss. But I didn't fall.
Instead, wrapped in what seemed to be a linen shroud _ like a piece
of candy twisted at both ends _ I was swirling in a cone of light
full of beautiful colors. I could sense that there were beings of
some sort at the top of the cone and I wanted them to pop me out of
the wrappings so I could go there. I wanted to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying out loud, `I'm dying. I'm dying,' but at one
point I laughed out loud. I felt so incredibly alive. I had no
sorrows, nothing weighing me down. And then I felt a pinch on my
left toe, pulling me back into my body, and I was back in the room,
laughing, feeling so free, so unbrittle. I remember saying to my
partner, `My God, dying is the most alive thing you can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Christina is radiant, reexperiencing those sensations as she
describes them with a quiet confidence. I can feel the power of
that knowledge in her. The hair is standing up on the back of my
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda,'' she continues, ``when I went to Kripalu I was
expecting simply to release the tension I was feeling and, instead,
I felt something flowing into my body, and it was pure ecstasy. I
had a visceral experience of dying and there was no negative, only
pure being, gentle and alive and very deeply felt. Oh, my God, we
worry so much about dying and it's the most alive thing we'll ever
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening at Kripalu, feeling calm and unafraid, Christina
checked her answering machine. The fact that she'd had a follow-up
blood test had slipped her mind until she heard her doctor's voice,
giving her the test results. In one week Christina's blood count
had shot up dramatically from 12 to 72 points above the normal
range.

HELPING KIDS CURB THE HOLIDAY `GIMMES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When her daughter was 3, Nina Senatore set to work to combat the
``Gimmes,'' that awful disease of childhood that runs rampant
around Christmas and Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   Early in December, Senatore would give Amanda scissors, glue,
cardboard, and toy catalogs and tell her to cut out pictures of
toys she liked and paste them on the cardboard. Another day, they
would go through her toys, discarding what was broken, outgrown, or
what Amanda wanted to give to charity. That served as a reference
point later on for Senatore, who could say with credibility,
``Remember how that crying doll broke really quickly?'' or ``Didn't
you say that toy was boring?''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the toy store was next. This is typically headache
time, when the Gimmes are at their peak. But Amanda had a mission.
Armed with her cardboard cutouts, she would compare the real toy to
its picture and write-up, eliminating as she went along.
</P>
<P>
   What survived the cut would now be divided into two categories,
``toys you can create with'' and ``toys that are what they are.''
It didn't take her many years to catch on to her mother's bias or
to see the wisdom of it: Toys from the latter category get boring,
toys from the former are more fun for a longer time. Each year,
that list would grow while the other would shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Amanda is 12, the cardboard has evolved into notebooks
and she's graduated from toy to clothing catalogs (she circles the
item and folds the page instead of cutting and pasting), but the
pre-list scouting trip is no less instructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's picked up a lot of nuances about advertising at a young
age,'' says her mother, a developmental education specialist and
assistant professor at Simmons College.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of acquisition in which children are unwitting targets
of marketing campaigns that reach a frantic peak this time of year,
developing an analytical eye is not only an antidote to the Gimmes
but arguably a survival skill for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are not born with the Gimmes,'' says educator and
child developmentalist Judith T. Wagner. ``They only turn into
materialistic creatures with the help of grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The more-is-better inculcation typically begins when a child is
2 or 3, when there's a literal pile for her under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' says Senatore. ``Even if there's a
wonderful, creative toy in that pile, there are too many toys to
appreciate any one.'' The inescapable message even to a toddler is
that there is value in acquisition alone.
</P>
<P>
   It's never too late to start to limit quantity, even if a child
is older; in fact, the older a child, the more you can discuss it.
Keep it non-judgmental and impersonal: ``I've heard about some
families where they agree to a limit on the number of presents each
person gets. I'm wondering about the pros and cons of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Child psychologist Roni Leiderman tells parents not to take
literally every request your child makes for this or that toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time she says, `I want this,' it's instinctive; she
sees something and can't control the impulse to say she wants it,''
says Leiderman, who is director of the Family Center at Nova
Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute the word ``admire'' for ``want''; it reflects more
accurately what's in her mind. ``She's attracted to it but she
doesn't expect to get it any more than we expect to get everything
we see and like,'' says Leiderman.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking she's simply admiring the toy will also keep you from
accusing her of being a spoiled brat. When we respond negatively or
put her down _ ``That toy is a waste of money!'' ``How many toys
can one child have?'' _ we make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to justify herself,'' says Leiderman. The more
defensive she becomes, the more she convinces herself of her own
argument. Now she not only wants it, she can't live without it.
</P>
<P>
   Leiderman says that offering a sympathetic response _ ``I can
see why you want this!'' ``That does look exciting!'' _ enables a
child to move on because you validate rather than belittle her.
</P>
<P>
   For the times when this doesn't work, try granting your child
her wish in fantasy: ``It would be fun to play with this''; turn
catalog shopping into a learning experience: ``Let's cut out all
the toys with wheels''; or defuse the situation by buying time: ``I
can see how much you like it. Why don't you add this to your list
and decide about it later?'' This also works when a child is
unhappy: ``I can see you're sad not to get that toy. You must be
very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gimmes are not fueled only by quantity. We also need to pay
attention to the kind of play a toy encourages and the values it
represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of these toys come with hidden messages that push
grown-up ideas on little kids,'' says Wagner, who is director of
the Broadoaks Children's School, the lab school of Whittier College
in California. ``Without realizing it, we buy into, in fact, we pay
for retailers to dictate values to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for Mom to paint her preschooler's nails while
she does her own; that's part pretending but it's also part
bonding. To buy a preschooler a cosmetic, nail, or hairstyling kit
(there's one on the market this season called Miss Glamour) sends a
different message entirely. ``It tells a little girl, `This
(concept) is for you,' and encourages her to embrace behaviors
she's too young for,'' says Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Because children under 7 typically can't make the cognitive leap
to think about how an ad or catalog write-up was made to appeal to
them, early childhood educator Diane Levin tells parents to
deconstruct ads.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests asking a series of questions: I wonder how they
made that toy do that? If we had that toy, do you think it would
work that way? What else could you do with it besides play with it
the way they're showing? I've never seen kids look that happy
playing with a toy, have you?
</P>
<P>
   Also don't be afraid to restate your values, says Levin, a
professor at Wheelock College: ```It looks like all this action
figure does is fight and you know I don't like violence. Is there
anything else you could do with it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Amanda came to value creative toys, almost every year
one or two trendy toys would make it to her final wish list, and
almost every year Senatore and her husband, John, would pick the
least offensive to put under the tree. ``Parents need to be
sensitive to kids' needs to fit in,'' Senatore says.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other strategies to fight the Gimmes:
</P>
<P>
   _Involve children in giving to charity. One Hanukkah gift Levin
and her husband give their son every year is a certificate:
``Tonight, your present is a gift to the charity of your choice.''
They typically offer him a list to choose from, like Oxfam or World
Wildlife Fund. Now a teenager, Eli is likely to add some of his own
money to the donation.
</P>
<P>
   _Create family rituals. ``The greatest gift is time spent as a
family,'' says Wagner. When her children were growing up, there
would always be a family game under the tree. Christmas afternoon
would be devoted to playing it together. ``That's what the kids
remember most about our Christmases,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   _Create gifts that encourage creativity. Last year, Wagner gave
her step-grandchildren, ages 13, 8, and 6, discarded bolts from a
fabric store, $10 worth of strong tape, and yards of frilly organza
she bought on sale. They spent the afternoon making a house, a
road, and costumes. Levin encourages what she calls Shoe Box Gifts,
which is a collection of small items organized around a play theme
(office, restaurant, rescue) and placed in a decorated shoe box.
Office, for instance, might include a message pad, receipt book,
labels, ink pad, stamps.

   By combining strategies, Senatore says it's not only possible to
immunize children to the holiday Gimmes but to turn them into
thoughtful consumers all year long. She knew that had happened with
Amanda the day her daughter looked at a picture of a doll in a
catalog and said she doubted it could really fit on the toy horse
the way it was pictured.

   EUROPE-RATES (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The central banks of the 11
European countries that are adopting a common currency next month
unexpectedly cut interest rates to combat what the president of the
German bank calls a ``clouded'' economic outlook. The reductions
reflect growing concern among central banks that the global economy
may be heading for recession next year. In this country, the Fed
has lowered rates three times within two months. Earlier in the
day, Germany reported that its economy grew 0.9 percent in the
third quarter from the prior three months and 2.8 percent from a
year earlier, powered by industrial output, a pace economists say
probably cannot be maintained. By Edmund L. Andrews.

what amounts to a moment's thrill for those who pass by the windows
is the result of months and months of tedious, highly-guarded
planning among retailers, who are looking for much more than
general gawking from the world: they see the windows as a
competitive tool for increasing media attention and store traffic.

 &HT;    GOP LEADERS CAN'T AVOID THE I-WORD
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders of the House and Senate tried to
outline an agenda Thursday of cutting taxes, fixing schools and
saving Social Security, but could not avoid the I-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a question other than on impeachment that we could
maybe (answer)?'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi
wondered as reporters asked repeatedly about developments in the
congressional investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied a voice from the journalistic horde crowded into
Lott's Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuts!'' laughed House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston of
Louisiana, who signaled he would like to see the issue settled
before he officially replaces Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia when
the new Congress convenes Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said it was premature to speculate on whether the GOP
leadership would allow a vote on censuring Clinton, an alternative
to impeachment that is supported by most Democrats and some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that he'd already been asked about censure ``about
40 times today,'' Livingston said, ``the fact is that I don't have
any idea what we're going to do until the Judiciary Committee
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'd be perfectly happy'' if the battle drags into
the new Congress, Livingston admitted, but that's the likely timing
if the committee doesn't meet its schedule of voting by the end of
next week on an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Lott sidestepped questions about a Senate trial of
Clinton should the House vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making any plans or any preparation at this time,''
Lott said. While there is no constitutional mandate that the Senate
hold a trial, the leader said, ``it would be very hard not to'' if
the House voted for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in armchairs in front of a fireplace and a mantel
decorated for Christmas, the Republican leaders sought to steer the
subject to their long friendship and how it would help them achieve
``our common agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts will be a top legislative priority, promised
Livingston, as will ``making sure our youngsters have good schools
to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course we did talk about the importance of preserving
Social Security so it will be there, not only for my 85-year-old
mother, bless her heart, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, but so it'll
be there for my grandson now, that's six months old,'' said Lott.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions kept coming back to possible votes on
impeachment _ which the leaders agreed would be the most
``weighty'' that members of Congress would cast during their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each member of Congress has the responsibility to search his
heart and his conscience and judge for himself the importance to
his constituents what his vote should be,'' said Livingston. ``And
I think for us to arbitrarily prejudge the conditions under which
he casts that vote is unfair at this point, because we really don't
know what the recommendations of the Judiciary Committee are going
to be.''

<P>
   Last Sunday's opposition primary elections in Argentina, and
this coming Sunday's presidential vote in Venezuela capture both
the potential victories awaiting, and the dilemmas befalling, Latin
America's left-of-center, anti-status quo, politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Between next week and the middle of the year 2000, countries as
varied as Venezuela, El Salvador, Argentina, Chile and Mexico will
hold presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the free-market tide submerged the
region in the mid- and late 1980s, candidates, coalitions and
parties from the left, or who question or openly criticize the
status quo, stand an excellent chance of winning according to polls
in all of these countries.
</P>
<P>
   While previous occasions did surface _ in Brazil in 1989, in
Mexico in 1994 _ the upcoming contests suggest that
anti-establishment candidates such as former military coup author
Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, the ex-FMLN guerrilla commander Facundo
Guardado in El Salvador, Socialist Party leader Ricardo Lagos in
Chile, Buenos Aires mayor and head of the anti-Menem alliance
Fernando de la Rua in Argentina and Cuauhtimoc Cardenas _ on the
progresisve left _ and Vicente Fox _ on the anti-authoritarian
right of center _ in Mexico all could be the presidents of their
respective countries two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   As they get closer to power, though, they are all being beckoned
by a traditional political temptation, which in their case could
prove either decisive for victory, or fatal. Because of the
benefits that fiscal stability have brought to Latin electorates
over the past few years, and thanks to the market-oriented programs
implemented by sitting governments, these candidates all have tried
to minimize their differences with incumbents on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The two contenders for the Alianza Opositora nomination in
Argentina _ De la Rua and defeated human-rights activist Graciela
Fernandez de Meijides _ both committed themselves to conserving
Menem's currency board and convertibilty-based monetary policy, as
well as privatizations and other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and Fox have also, in fact, resigned themselves to
leaving the Salinas and Zedillo economic reforms in place. Even
Guardado in El Salvador has stopped distancing himself from
right-wing Arena's fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, opposition candidates, or further left-of center
coalition leaders such as Lagos in Chile, are defining themselves
in non-economic policy terms: on cultural issues, anti-corruption
grounds, social matters and law enforcement and security themes.
</P>
<P>
   This seems wise apparently, since it assuages fears of
instability and radical change among highly conservative
electorates and elites. Only Chavez in Venezuela, and more
rhetorically than in substance, has emphasized his
anti-establishment credentials.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger lurking here, however, and the Argentine
primaries underline it. Graciela Fernandez lost by a nearly
two-to-one margin. A possible explanation for her defeat, as well
as for the setbacks encountered by PAN and PRD opposition
candidates in governor's races in Mexico over the past year, may
lie in the consequences of being too insipid, too tame, too
``responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition and anti-status-quo candidates have to mobilize their
troops. Repeatedly claiming that the election makes scant
difference, since on many defining matters they'll perform like
incumbents, hardly qualifies as a highly mobilizing statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Fernandez claimed that the main
difference between her and her opponent, and between the Alianza
and Menem and his successors, was that she possessed honesty and
integrity. The PRD and the PAN, in deed if not in word, are
essentially making the same claim in Mexico, since they either have
no economic, social or international program or it is
indistinguishable from the government's.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' response seems to be: In that case, we may prefer
proven and relatively competent crooks to honest, incomptetent
neophytes. In the Argentine case, if that is the platform De la Rua
runs on, he risks being overtaken on the left by the Peronist
candidate, Eduardo Duhalde, who can mobilize his troops simply on
the basis of historical loyalty and populist demagogy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a slippery slope phenomenon at work. These
candidates start out excluding macro-economic policy from the field
of differences separating them from rivals. They can end up
including a great many more issues in the ``untouchable'' category.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, for example, while contenders such as Fox and
Cardenas have inevitably toned down their long-term economic policy
differences with the government _ limiting their split to
short-term matters such as the bank bailout or the 1999 budget _
they had emphasized their disagreement on matters such as
corruption. They would ensure greater accountability and
transparency, past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
   And unquestionably, the Cardenas and Fox administrations in
Mexico City and Guanajuato are far more honest than their
predecessors. But both leaders have been frustratingly tepid in
their investigations and prosecution of past corruption _ as if to
imply, why rock the boat before they reach the presidency? So the
country's past also becomes taboo as an electoral issue, other than
in purely rhetorical terms.
</P>
<P>
   The same has happened with Lagos in Chile regarding the Pinochet
affair. The Frei government, of which Lagos was a member until
recently and which is supported by the same coalition whose ticket
he will presumably run on in 1999, has found itself in a terribly
uncomfortable position after the ex-dictator's arrest in London.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, rank-and-file Socialists and Christian
Democrats cannot but applaud the arrest and possible extradition to
Spain. On the other, this attitude infuriates the right, the
military and part of the business community, jeopardizing Lagos'
chances of attaining power next year.
</P>
<P>
   Too sensitive to past experience, and too savvy to believe
naively in the strength of Chile's reborn democracy, Lagos waffles,
but would prefer to remove the Pinochet issue from the 1999
electroal agenda. He may be right, but how many issues would soon
be left on the agenda?
</P>
<P>
   The elections in Venezuela may provide a clue to how voters view
this phenomenon. Coronel Chavez has run on a stridently
anti-establishment platform. He may prove his colleagues in other
countries right, by losing the election because of his lack of
caution, or by returning to the moderate, cautious fold right after
his inauguration if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Or conversely, he may demostrate that prudence is not the better
part of electoral valor, and show that other contenders may want to
pay more than lip service to the rumblings against the status quo
in Latin America.

<P>
   Last Sunday's opposition primary elections in Argentina, and
this coming Sunday's presidential vote in Venezuela capture both
the potential victories awaiting, and the dilemmas befalling, Latin
America's left-of-center, anti-status quo, politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Between next week and the middle of the year 2000, countries as
varied as Venezuela, El Salvador, Argentina, Chile and Mexico will
hold presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the free-market tide submerged the
region in the mid- and late 1980s, candidates, coalitions and
parties from the left, or who question or openly criticize the
status quo, stand an excellent chance of winning according to polls
in all of these countries.
</P>
<P>
   While previous occasions did surface _ in Brazil in 1989, in
Mexico in 1994 _ the upcoming contests suggest that
anti-establishment candidates such as former military coup author
Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, the ex-FMLN guerrilla commander Facundo
Guardado in El Salvador, Socialist Party leader Ricardo Lagos in
Chile, Buenos Aires mayor and head of the anti-Menem alliance
Fernando de la Rua in Argentina and Cuauhtimoc Cardenas _ on the
progresisve left _ and Vicente Fox _ on the anti-authoritarian
right of center _ in Mexico all could be the presidents of their
respective countries two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   As they get closer to power, though, they are all being beckoned
by a traditional political temptation, which in their case could
prove either decisive for victory, or fatal. Because of the
benefits that fiscal stability have brought to Latin electorates
over the past few years, and thanks to the market-oriented programs
implemented by sitting governments, these candidates all have tried
to minimize their differences with incumbents on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The two contenders for the Alianza Opositora nomination in
Argentina _ De la Rua and defeated human-rights activist Graciela
Fernandez de Meijides _ both committed themselves to conserving
Menem's currency board and convertibilty-based monetary policy, as
well as privatizations and other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and Fox have also, in fact, resigned themselves to
leaving the Salinas and Zedillo economic reforms in place. Even
Guardado in El Salvador has stopped distancing himself from
right-wing Arena's fiscal policies.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A three-ring impeachment circus
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House impeachment hearings are vacillating between farce and
attempted coup.
</P>
<P>
   For farce, there was the Judiciary Committee's vote to expand
its inquiry into fund-raising for the Clinton re-election _ on the
day when Federal Elections Commission auditors recommended record
paybacks from both the Clinton and the Dole campaigns for similar
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   As coup, the same party-line vote to expand the impeachment
scope enlisted the committee in the ceaseless effort of Clinton's
political opponents _ for which read, mainly, Clinton-haters _
first to find any excuse to undo the president's election and, when
that failed, then to unravel his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The new tack was abandoned almost as quickly as it had been
undertaken, but the committee's pass at campaign funding reanimated
the cynicism of the show-trial congressional hearings the GOP had
staged over two years. It would be one thing if investigations were
aimed at reforming the corrupting influence of outsized special
interest money and the grubbing for it that begrime our politics,
but the GOP leadership has made it emphatically plain it wants no
part of changing the system, which bankrolls Republicans far more
generously than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the game has been to use Democratic excesses _ more
egregious than Republican ones in '96 but not different in kind _
as merely a means to partisan ends. It was in hopes of getting the
tumbrel rolling again toward the guillotine that the impeachment
panel briefly put its shoulder to that mired wheel.
</P>
<P>
   And all this atop the Red Queen parody of jurisprudence that
marked the committee's Starr-struck thralldom to the report and the
testimony of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has produced no corroborative evidence or
questioned any key witnesses itself. It has heard no rebuttal
witnesses. Its majority is apparently prepared to vote for
impeachment solely on the word of prosecutor Kenneth Starr and on
his at points tendentious reading of the record _ and never mind
that Starr himself has his information second-hand from assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans pretend special outrage that in response to the
81 loaded questions they asked him, Clinton dared to continue
dodging and weaving, defending himself especially against a
possible post-presidency indictment for perjury. Like Starr, the
majority reads Clinton's failure to confess as an obstruction of
justice. Any Soviet court would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   With House Speaker Newt Gingrich fading from command like
yesterday's bugle call and Speaker-designate Robert Livingston
apparently reluctant to have his fingerprints either on impeachment
or its failure, the Judiciary Committee increasingly looks panicky,
unfocused, disorganized and daily more at the mercy of its
anti-Clinton ultras.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Henry Hyde is presiding over one after another
on-camera meltdown as committee members _ when they bother to show
up, that is _ trade insults, hurl accusations at one another and
act out in ways that would exasperate a kindergarten teacher. What
we have here is impeachment as the Jerry Springer Show. Without the
ratings.

 &HT;    PARENT OF LEXIS NEXIS EXPECTS LOWER 1998 PROFITS
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Financial categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Profits for the parent company of Lexis Nexis will fall
short of 1998 projections because of lower demand for its
publishing products and a weakening worldwide economy, the company
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Elsevier PLC also attributed the shortfall to investments
it is making in its on-line information products, such as the
Dayton, Ohio-based Lexis Nexis. The division has experienced
slower-than-expected revenue growth because of increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that it's a very competitive sphere,'' said
Susanna Smart, a spokeswoman in Reed Elsevier's headquarters here.
``However, Lexis Nexis continues to develop and launch new
information products.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the investments in its online information business was the
purchase of Matthew Bender, a legal information service which is
being integrated into Lexis Nexis, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-Dutch company, which also publishes scientific,
business and legal magazines, said it expected pre-tax profits to
be US$1.27 billion, 6 percent below earlier expectations. Another
factor contributing to the decline is the strength of the British
pound, which erodes revenues because of the cost of converting the
currency, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening global economy, particularly in Asia, is largely
to blame for the reduced demand for its travel-related publishing
products, Smart said. ``People are cutting back on their business
travel and that affects the demand for business publications,'' she
said. ``A new management team is in place, and we're refocusing the
products, but we don't expect a rapid rebound in the travel
publications business.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings had also been diluted by a number of sales made during
the year, most notably the sales of IPC Magazines last January,
which publishes consumer magazines including TV Times, Loaded and
Marie Claire.
</P>
<P>
   The company also was hit in its trade show management business,
in part because many of the exhibitions take place on two-year
cycles and 1998 was an off-cycle year, Smart said. Reed Elsevier
manages 335 trade shows and other events in 25 countries --
including the Showbiz Expo, the National Hardware Show and National
Manufacturing Week in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a partnership of the London-based Reed
International PLC and Amsterdam-based Elsevier NV, has not
concluded its search for a single chairman and a sole chief
executive officer for Reed Elsevier. The company announced in
August that it was going to abandon its co-chairman structure but
said that neither Herman Bruggink or Nigel Stapleton -- the
company's co-chairmen -- were in line for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search is well in hand,'' Smart said. ``We will make an
announcement when we have an announcement to make.''

<P>
   POWELL-NOVELS (New York) _ Time for holiday shopping. Why not
first stop at a bookstore and give yourself a treat? This is a good
season to catch up on reading. It's also good for rambling around
the neighborhood of a writer many readers are only now beginning to
catch up with: the brilliant social satirist Dawn Powell. Her
glittering novels, especially those set in New York, offer a rare
opportunity to reflect on the dependence of cities and books for
mutual survival. Take home a stack. You'll thank me. By Herbert
Muschamp.

<P>
   POOLROOMS (New York) _ The premise was simple enough. Now that I
am closer to my second childhood than to the first one, would I be
able to find any spaces as dark, dank and nurturing as the
poolrooms of my adolescence? It was in these vaguely disreputable
parlors, up stairways or below street level, that at the age of 15
I found refuge from the purposefulness of school, from dreams of
glory and fears of failure, and though I probably didn't realize
it, from the looming rituals of sex and courtship. Once you walked
into these places, you were immediately comforted by the notion
that your parents would not be happy if they knew you were there.

   FORSYTHE-DANCE (New York) _ William Forsythe, the American
choreographer who has been artistic director of the Frankfurt
Ballet in Germany since 1984, is a prodigious talent but no
prodigal son. He refuses to come home. But he does drop in
occasionally to create new work and restage old ones for major
American ballet companies. More rarely, he visits with his own
troupe, now officially billed as Ballett Frankfurt on its tours,

choreography. By Anna Kisselgoff.

CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS GET A CRITICAL GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charter schools, touted as a way to improve
public education in California, are less accountable than other
public schools and offer no evidence that students are faring
better academically, according to a sweeping two-year study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Beyond the Rhetoric of Charter School Reform,'' has
broad implications for California, which enrolls more students in
charter schools than any state.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is an important laboratory to test the effects of
charter schools,'' said Amy Stuart Wells, the University of
California at Los Angeles education professor who led the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that despite the hard work and dedication of
charter school operators, charter school reform, for the most part,
falls short of the broad and comprehensive claims made by many of
its proponents,'' Wells said. ``It's time to look at where this
reform is going. Is it headed toward vouchers? Toward revitalizing
public schools or privatizing them? Policymakers need to think
about what this means for the bigger system.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are publicly funded but free from many state and
local regulations. Proponents say such schools offer parents more
choice, stricter student accountability and the freedom to
innovate. These innovations may then be picked up by educators in
traditional public schools, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, disputes the these contentions.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA researchers looked at 17 charter schools in 10
districts across the state. Researchers conducted more than 450
interviews with parents, teachers and educators.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes at a time when charter schools are heartily
endorsed by Democrats and Republicans. With 1,100 charter schools
in operation nationwide, President Clinton has called for 3,000
such schools by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   California has nearly 50,000 children in 130 charter schools.
The original charter law, adopted in early 1993, limited the number
of charter schools statewide to 100. The law was amended in May and
raised the cap to 250 charter schools for the 1998-99 school year
and 100 more per year after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Rhetoric of Charter School Reform'' had 15 major
findings. The highlights are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter schools in California are more likely to be held
accountable for how money is spent rather than how well students
are doing academically, partly because a defining purpose of
charter schools is non-academic in nature, making it hard to use
traditional testing.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no clear understanding of who is supposed to hold
charter schools accountable, parents, district officials or elected
school board members.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are no mechanisms in place for charter schools and
regular public schools to learn from one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ While teachers at charter schools value the added freedom,
smaller classes and closer relationships with students and parents,
work loads are heavier than at other public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter schools have a far greater ability to shape who
enrolls than most public schools. The requirement that charter
schools reflect the ethnic makeup of the district has not been
enforced, with whites overrepresented and Hispanics
underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter schools are not evenly funded and receive less money
than other public schools. The level of funding depends largely on
the political savvy of the charter school directors, who lobby the
district and outside benefactors for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to survive, charter schools have to raise private
resources,'' Wells said, noting that charter schools are not
eligible for many state categorical programs, like money to
maintain buildings and other non-academic costs. ``That pushes the
system toward privatization. It's a bigger trend in public
education that's accelerated in this context.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA researchers did not study for-profit charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA report serves as a reality check for those who follow
attempts to overhaul education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advocates of charter schools have set themselves up for
criticism because they over-attribute problems to the public school
system and underestimate the difficulty of setting up good new
schools,'' said Stanford University education professor David
Tyack, who has written extensively on the topic. ``Creating a good
new school is very hard work, like creating a small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tyack believes the charter school concept is promising.
``To ask people to think about what kind of school they want and
then hand them a charter and say go do it ... well, that's good.
People who are dissatisfied with what's out there might be able to
make a charter school really pay off.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Noguera, an education professor at the University of
California at Berkeley and an adviser to the UCLA researchers,
hopes charter schools will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this sense that small is beautiful and by breaking off
from the district, and all the politics, you can focus on the
education,'' Noguera said. ``What happens, though, is politics
emerge on a smaller scale in these charter schools.''
</P>
<P>
   To make charter schools function better, the authors of the
report make a number of suggestions, including: Establishing a
variety of tests to measure achievement of specific goals; lobbying
districts or states to facilitate interaction between charter and
public schools; making sure charter schools have less _ not more _
authority over who is enrolled.

I found refuge from the purposefulness of school, from dreams of
glory and fears of failure, and though I probably didn't realize

 &HT;    REPORT SAYS STATES NOT CURBING ANIMAL WASTE POLLUTION
 &HT;    555 words
 &HT;    Robbin(cq)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At least 30 states are failing to curb pollution
from large livestock and poultry operations, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   The waste from these ``animal factories'' fouls drinking water
and threatens public health, according to the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group who released the report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states have few regulations and do little to enforce what
laws might be on the books,'' said Robbin Marks, one of the authors
of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is unchecked pollution leading to contaminated well
water, fish kills, sickness from toxic gases in the air and
plummeting property values for neighboring landowners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock industry representatives say the report lacks
scientific evidence and is packed with old information.
</P>
<P>
   ``'If this (the report) was food, it would have salmonella,''
said Steve Cohen, spokesman for the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cohen said many states have regulations that are
more strict than the national standards. He also said pork
producers are not against regulation. For example, the industry
supports recent efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to regulate large farms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, however, say much more needs to be done.
The report details specific environmental problems in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those states, North Carolina, groundwater
contamination near animal factories is increasing, posing a
potentially serious drinking water problem for nearby residents,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report states that 88 percent of North Carolina
hog farms had at least one water-quality violation, but the state
has been unwilling to take enforcement action against the majority
of them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of dissatisfaction with the state permitting system,
North Carolina implemented a two-year moratorium on new and
expanding hog farms, but hog production continues to grow because
of loopholes in the law, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the environmental impact of the nation's 1.4
billion tons of animal waste has escalated as livestock and poultry
farms have become larger and more concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address the problem, the EPA and the Agriculture
Department released a draft strategy earlier this year to further
regulate the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy would require an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of the
largest livestock operations to have plans that detail how the
owner will collect and store manure and how the waste might be
applied to fields as fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners would have to keep detailed records and test their soil
regularly to ensure no excess buildup of nutrients that could
potentially pollute nearby waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal laws, large livestock farms are prohibited
from discharging waste directly into rivers and streams, but the
rules do not prevent waste from being washed off farmland by rain.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy also includes encouraging tens of thousands of
smaller farms and animal feeding operations to voluntarily adopt
similar plans. The goal is to have all feeding operations on board
by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and the Department of Agriculture are conducting public
hearings nationwide to get feedback before finalizing the plan.

 &HT;    REPORT SAYS STATES NOT CURBING ANIMAL WASTE POLLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At least 30 states -- including Texas -- are
failing to curb pollution from large livestock and poultry
operations, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   The waste from these ``animal factories'' fouls drinking water
and threatens public health, according to the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group who released the report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states have few regulations and do little to enforce what
laws might be on the books,'' said Robbin Marks, one of the authors
of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is unchecked pollution leading to contaminated well
water, fish kills, sickness from toxic gases in the air and
plummeting property values for neighboring landowners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock industry representatives say the report lacks
scientific evidence and is packed with old information.
</P>
<P>
   ``'If this (the report) was food, it would have salmonella,''
said Steve Cohen, spokesman for the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cohen said many states have regulations that are
more strict than the national standards. He also said pork
producers are not against regulation. For example, the industry
supports recent efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to regulate large farms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, however, say much more needs to be done.
The report details specific environmental problems in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   One of those states, Texas, suffers significant river pollution
from dairy factory farm operations, the report says. Waste from
dairies in Erath County in Central Texas has significantly degraded
the Bosque River and the creeks of the Upper Bosque, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosque River is the major tributary to Lake Waco, the source
of the city of Waco's drinking water. Waco has regularly found a
parasite from animal waste in samples from the lake, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report states that expanding swine and cattle
operations are potential threats in Texas. In particular, the
report is critical of the state's design standards for large
feeding operations that allow clay liners for the lagoons where
millions of gallons of animal waste are stored. The liners can
crack after long droughts, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, groundwater contamination near animal
factories is increasing, posing a potentially serious drinking
water problem for nearby residents, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report states that 88 percent of North Carolina
hog farms had at least one water-quality violation, but the state
has been unwilling to take enforcement action against the majority
of them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of dissatisfaction with the state permitting system,
North Carolina implemented a two-year moratorium on new and
expanding hog farms, but hog production continues to grow because
of loopholes in the law, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the environmental impact of the nation's 1.4
billion tons of animal waste has escalated as livestock and poultry
farms have become larger and more concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address the problem, the EPA and the Agriculture
Department released a draft strategy earlier this year to further
regulate the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy would require an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of the
largest livestock operations to have plans that detail how the
owner will collect and store manure and how the waste might be
applied to fields as fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners would have to keep detailed records and test their soil
regularly to ensure no excess buildup of nutrients that could
potentially pollute nearby waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal laws, large livestock farms are prohibited
from discharging waste directly into rivers and streams, but the
rules do not prevent waste from being washed off farmland by rain.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy also includes encouraging tens of thousands of
smaller farms and animal feeding operations to voluntarily adopt
similar plans. The goal is to have all feeding operations on board
by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and the Department of Agriculture are conducting public
hearings nationwide to get feedback before finalizing the plan.

&HT;    HONDURANS START LONG CLIMB BACK TO LIVES THEY ONCE HAD 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ After weeks of digging, Jose Luis
Duron and his wife finally can see the floor of the two-room house
that was once their proudest possession.
</P>
<P>
   Duron has been shoveling mud from the sitting room, hurling it
over the roofless house's front wall into the shaded yard. His
wife, Josefa, has been scraping away in the small bedroom, using a
jagged piece of plastic torn from a bucket to scoop the mud into
balls and toss them out of the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had just finished remodeling their home in late
October. A few days later, floodwaters driven by Hurricane Mitch
carried away the house's new tin roof and deposited about 7 feet of
sewage-laced mud inside the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Duron, 53, and his wife have cleared the mud from about half of
the house's concrete floor, but up to 3 feet of dirt covers the
rest. Weeks of more work lie ahead. ``We have no choice. We have
nowhere else to live,'' he says with a sad smile as he takes a
break from the labor. ``We have to make this place right again.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a month after Mitch tripped ashore on the northern
coast of Honduras and kicked its way across Central America, the
poor have started the long climb back to the lives they once led.
Government officials say the storm killed at least 9,000 people in
the region, most of them in Honduras, and that hundreds of
thousands remain homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For the many who lost loved ones, homes and jobs to the storm,
rebuilding will be defined by economic circumstances and political
systems that have been less than benevolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rebuild what you had,'' says Efrain Diaz, a
Honduran agricultural economist who works on development issues for
the United Nations. ``The question is, how to go about it. There
are still a lot of uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, perhaps, are things more uncertain than in the gutted
riverside neighborhoods of Chamelecon, a sprawling working-class
section of the industrial city of San Pedro Sula on Honduras'
northern coast. Scores of houses were swept away when a levee on
the nearby Chamelecon River collapsed, and hundreds of other homes
were flooded to the rafters
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Central America, Mitch killed far more people and
wreaked more lasting damage. But in Chamelecon, the struggle back
undoubtedly will prove as tough as anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   International aid is pouring into the region. But people in
Chamelecon share the belief of many of Central America's poor that
the help will somehow remain in the hands of the rich or powerful,
siphoned away through corruption or passed out in return for
political support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound resentful about the help,'' says Mauro
Pineda, 58, whose house was chest-deep in muddy water. ``But it
never reaches to the poor. If the government asks for something, it
is for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after the Chamelecon River returned to its banks, the
area's streets remain clogged with mounds of fetid mud and pools of
filthy water.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people made homeless by the flooding still sleep in
makeshift shelters in schools and gymnasiums. Others crowd into
relatives' houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all living on top of each other,'' says Catalina Reyes,
whose family of six occupies a 5-foot-by-5-foot piece of classroom
marked off by desks, old boxes and hanging clothes. ``There is no
privacy, everyone is sick, and we don't know what the future
holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people return each day to the riverbank to scrounge for
remnants of their lives. &UR;  &LR; They dig in the earth like archaeologists
to recover buried mattresses and other possessions. They wash
clothes and bathe at the still-functioning water spigots where
their kitchens formerly stood. They cook over open fires and sit
talking under trees that once shaded their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Young men swim in the muddy Chamelecon River, apparently
unconcerned about reports of disease being carried in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no help, no nothing,'' says Raquel Sarmiento, a
28-year-old mother of four whose flooded home was spared the total
destruction suffered by houses one street closer to the river.
``Each family has to make their own effort to get out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamelecon was built piecemeal over the past 30 years, expanding
with the arrival of each wave of newcomers from other parts of
Honduras, people who hoped to find steady work in the factories of
San Pedro Sula. But the jobs were too few and too lowly paid to
lift most from poverty. Today, Chamelecon's neighborhoods are rife
with crime and youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Situated where the Chamelecon River enters San Pedro and at the
foot of a low mountain range, the area has a long experience with
floods.
</P>
<P>
   After the city government built a levee along the Chamelecon
River, the floods became less severe and less frequent _ until
Mitch arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's heavy rains, which at their height poured down at
the rate of 4 inches an hour, began to inundate the neighborhoods
along the levee on Oct. 26, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Families started evacuating their homes when the waters reached
thigh-deep, so few people were in their houses when the levee gave
way the night of Oct. 30. Mitch killed only two people in
Chamelecon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here was bitter, but those who were prudent got
their things out,'' says Humberto Lara, 46, who managed to rescue
some of his family's belongings from their flooded home before the
levee collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a lot of things, but that is secondary,'' Lara
says. ``We have our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   With storm-scuttled classes set to resume in January, those
taking refuge in schoolhouses here and around Honduras will have to
new places to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro Sula officials hope to move the homeless into five
``megashelters'' that will hold as many as 5,000 people each.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the officials plan to use loans from international
lenders to relocate families from the hardest hit neighborhoods to
what they call a flood-proof area on the outskirts of the city. The
development's tiny houses, which will be hooked to city water,
sewage and electricity, will cost about $2,000 each, says Roberto
Larios, an industrialist who serves as San Pedro Sula's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's practically a gift,'' the mayor says of the planned
homes, which residents will pay for over 20 years. ``And it's on
land where there is not the slightest risk of flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Chamelecon, where unemployment runs high and a good job
doing piece work in garment factories pays about $35 a week, many
worry they will never be able to afford the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rich, so it seems like a great deal to them,''
Salvador Plateros, 39, an unemployed father of five, says of the
city's relocation scheme. ``But if somebody doesn't have the money
to buy a lot, what are they supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Most people worry about the long-term economic effects of the
storm. Although many in Chamelecon work in the foreign-owned
clothing factories that have sprung up throughout San Pedro Sula,
the competition for those jobs is expected to become fierce in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Brands International plans to lay off many of the 7,300
workers it employs on storm-ravaged banana plantations and packing
sheds in the countryside surrounding San Pedro Sula.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here already have relatives working in Houston, Los
Angeles and other U.S. cities. Slipping illegally through Mexico
and into the United States remains a powerful attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without money you are nothing, and we have no money,'' says
17-year-old Humberto Lara Mejia, who was caught trying to slip
across Mexico's southern border earlier this year. ``Many people
are saying they are going to migrate now.'' &QL;

YOUNG'S INJURY HOVERS OVER THE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Ken Norton Jr., in the wake of the
gruesome injury to San Francisco 49ers teammate Bryant Young, is
beginning to sound like a man who is losing his taste for the
violent world of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   It was an accidental blow from Norton's helmet in a frenzied
fourth-quarter collision that broke the two bones in Young's lower
right leg. Young is out for the year and recovering from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, a linebacker known for his hustle and his hitting, was
somber and subdued Wednesday as he talked about Young's injury in
the 49ers' 31-7 win over the New York Giants on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we all know is possible,'' Norton said. ``When
it happens to someone you know, someone you're real close to,
somebody you've been in a lot of battles with and you really care
about, it makes you wonder if it's all really worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, say coaches, saying Norton will be emotionally
ready when the 49ers play the Carolina Panthers on Sunday in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to allow him some mourning time,'' defensive
coordinator John Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Steve Mariucci said Norton would be fine with a
little time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny came to work today, and he had a good day,'' Mariucci
said. ``Nobody said it was going to be easy for Kenny. He's got to
know it's not his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall referred to Norton's father, Ken Sr., a former
heavyweight boxing champion, in expressing his confidence that
Norton would bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made out of big-time stuff,'' Marshall said. ``Kenny's
got that same grit.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier interviews Norton has said he wasn't sure if he had
caused the injury. By Wednesday he knew without a doubt that he
struck Young's leg when he came crashing in at the end of a play as
Young tackled Giants quarterback Kent Graham. ``I was in on the
play,'' Norton said. ``I'm the guy who hit him, obviously, and it's
hard to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed he would be ready to play on Sunday, Norton
said, ``It's hard to really focus right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL, is out for
the season. He had surgery on Monday, in which a titanium rod was
inserted in his right tibia. Both the tibia and fibula were cleanly
broken, about halfway between the knee and ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Young had further minor surgery Tuesday night to
reduce swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said the team's orthopedic surgeon was confident that
Young could play next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Young was doing fine, but would be kept in the
hospital a few more days _ possibly until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bored silly right now,'' Mariucci said. ``He's not the
kind of guy who can sit around and watch `Oprah' and `Jerry
Springer.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norton also had talked to Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be doing OK,'' Norton said. ``His spirits are
decent.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of Norton.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm not doing too well,'' he said.
``I'm feeling lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton said that no one blamed him for the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'm really putting on myself,'' he said.
``We're taught to hit people, we're taught to jump on people. This
was just a freak situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's injury has been hard for many players to deal with
because of its severity. Feelings have also run strong because
Young is highly respected and well-liked by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can feel bad and we can grieve for B.Y.,'' Mariucci said.
``We can go through all those emotions. But when it comes time to
play football, that's our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team faced the task of replacing Young. Marshall
said the two leading contenders were Gabe Wilkins and Shane Bonham.
Marshall hedged on naming a starter for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly who the ball-buster is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who signed as a $20 million free agent from the Green
Bay Packers in the offseason, has seen limited action at defensive
end in the past four games. He injured a knee in last year's Super
Bowl, had surgery and missed the first eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham came to the 49ers from the Detroit Lions, where he
started two games in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mariucci and Marshall said Wilkins, Bonham and Junior
Bryant, who has been starting next to Young all year, would
alternate at the two tackle spots. Also in the mix is Brenston
Buckner, who has missed the last two games with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear the coaches are looking to Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as an opportunity for him to show us what he's
got,'' Mariucci said.

   &UR; By SALMAN RUSHDIE &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Distributed by New York Times Special Features &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the month's other ``unnatural'' figure ought to be
getting easier. Pinochet, after all, has earned the right to be
called the most evil man now alive on earth. (Sorry, Saddam.) The
British law lords have decreed that he is not immune from
extradition. The crucial principle of universal accountability has
thus been upheld. Atrocity is not to be excused by the occupancy of
high office. All this has become very clear in the past days.
</P>
<P>
   Why then has the British Home Secretary asked for extra time to
decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

<P>
   Man is by nature a political animal, said Aristotle, who argued
further that the public life of a ``good'' society must reflect the
nature of its members. Many of the great Macedonian's assertions _
that the slave is ``naturally'' inferior to his master, the female
to the male, the ``barbarian'' to the Greek _ now seem absurd. And
yet Aristotle's basic proposition still rings true. The present
travails of three leading political figures - Bill Clinton, Saddam
Hussein and Augusto Pinochet - reveal how deeply we believe in
natural justice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's probable escape from his domestic pursuers
can be ascribed in part to his foes' astonishing folly. He has been
lucky in his enemies: the sex-crazed, mealy-mouthed Kenneth Starr
and his backers on the Christian Right, who remind us that
``fundamentalism'' is a term born in the USA; Newt Gingrich, who
overplayed a winning hand and lost his shirt; and Linda Tripp, the
wicked witch of the wire, who, like Nixon, didn't understand that
by bugging herself she would only prove her own villainy, even with
the expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   When an ancient force _ puritanical fanaticism _ combines with
the contemporary tabloid dogma that public figures have no right to
privacy, and when the Washington political and media elites work
themselves up into a mighty pompous froth, even the President rocks
on his throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton survives, because he has human nature on his side.
Human nature distinguishes between sexual dalliance and political
misconduct. It can be brutal; asked to take a view about Monica and
Paula, the American people replied that they just didn't care. They
have come to know Bill Clinton far more intimately than they
normally know their leaders, and he, of course, has always known
them better than any other politician. Clinton is winning his fight
because he is like his people; because, you could say, he's a
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Iraq, however, the US administration's
understanding of human nature has been deficient, to say the least.
The notion that bombing raids might provoke a coup against Saddam
was always an improbable hypothesis. On the whole, people do not
see as allies those who are dropping large quantities of high
explosives on them from the sky. Like Yossarian, the hero of
``Catch-22,'' they take the bombs personally.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to bomb and then not bombing has the advantage of
killing fewer people, but the disadvantage of making oneself look
silly. Apparently some Iraqis seriously believe that Paula Jones
and Monica Lewinsky were pawns in an international Zionist
conspiracy designed to make Clinton bomb Baghdad. The recent
aborted American-British attack may demonstrate the declining
international influence of these two ladies, but otherwise plays
right into Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices advocating a rapid end to sanctions, and a
subsequent opening up of the Iraqi market to Western goods and
ideas, may not find much favor with America's military analysts,
but an Iraq freed from the privations of the embargo and the threat
of aerial attack is more likely to think of the West as a friend.
The best way to topple Saddam Hussein may be to help bring into
being an Iraq in which his tyrannies are not only hateful but also
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the month's other ``unnatural'' figure ought to be
getting easier. Pinochet, after all, has earned the right to be
called the most evil man now alive on earth. (Sorry, Saddam.) The
British law lords have decreed that he is not immune from
extradition. The crucial principle of universal accountability has
thus been upheld. Atrocity is not to be excused by the occupancy of
high office. All this has become very clear in the past days.
</P>
<P>
   Why then has the British Home Secretary asked for extra time to
decide Pinochet's future? The ex-tyrant was well enough to hang out
with Lady Thatcher just the other day, but now claims that the
pressure he's under has provoked a stress-related mental ailment.
The families of the dead must be disgusted by this ruse. Pinochet
must not escape on such flimsy ``compassionate'' grounds. Jack
Straw should confirm at once that for the mass murderers of the
world, there can be no compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature exists, and it is both deep and highly
structured,'' writes Edward O. Wilson, the biologist and writer
whom Tom Wolfe calls ``a new Darwin.'' If it did not _ let us be
clear _ then the idea of universals _ human rights, moral
principles, international law _ would have no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fact of our common humanity that allows most of us to
forgive Bill Clinton his faults, that will not allow us to agree
that bombing innocent Iraqis is the right way to punish Saddam
Hussein, and that makes us want to see Pinochet brought to justice.
A world that hounded Clinton but turned a blind eye to Pinochet
would indeed be a world turned upside down.

. 
PSYCHO-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ By some logic, Gus Van Sant's almost
shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' should be
welcomed by fans and cineastes everywhere. It's both a radical
formal notion and as faithful a tribute to a master filmmaker as
could be imagined. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
EXHIBIT-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Paul Schrader penned the words ``You
talking to me?'' uttered by a really frightening Robert DeNiro in
1976's ``Taxi Driver.'' Schrader's been talking to us ever since
and LACMA is putting up a two-weekend exhitibition of this auteur's
personal style of filmmaking. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
VOICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt
with the best of them, is the best reason to see ``Little Voice,''
a wildly uneven movie about a sheltered, fragile young woman who
won't speak but can sing up a storm. 2{ stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
GUTHRIE-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Billy Bragg and Woody Guthrie are
linked by musical tradition and a belief in the power of one voice.
On the acclaimed ``Mermaid Avenue'' (Elektra), Bragg teamed up with
rootsy Chicago rockers Wilco in Dublin for a collection that puts
new music to never-before-released lyrics by Guthrie. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
SHARPS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The consolidation of Seagram-owned
PolyGram and the Universal Music Group (UMG) could eliminate as
many as 3,000 jobs, and has employees at Geffen, A&AMP;M, Mercury and
other imprints preparing for the worst. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ If you're a Pearl Jam fan, you'll just
have to own ``Live on Two Legs,''career-spanning package that
ignores ``Jeremy'' but adds nods to old tour partner Neil Young _ a
verse of ``Rockin' in the Free World'' inside ``Daughter'' and a
cover of a Young tune that boasts an unprintable title. 3 Stars. By
Fred Shuster. 
. 
ZORRO-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ ``The Mask of Zorro'' was the best pure
popcorn movie of the summer. Call it retro fun, which is no
surprise because Steven Spielberg, who loves adventure films, had a
hand in making it. By Rob Lowman.

SWISS GIVE US SOMETHING TO CONSIDER ON DRUG POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who have not been there, and some who have, picture
Switzerland the way that Ernest Hemingway described it
three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down
than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built
on the cuckoo clock style of architecture,'' wrote Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   And the citizens of Switzerland are usually thought of as
practical people, more upright than broad-minded on issues of
morality, politics and lifestyle, a people not given to the ready
embrace of cuckoo ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How came it, then, that the staid people who dwell in that place
of snowcapped mountains, placid lakes and unimposing architecture
went to the polls last weekend and voted on the outlandish notion
of legalizing ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Swiss sensibly rejected that cuckoo idea
overwhelmingly. That was predictable. Even the proponents of the
constitutional amendment to legalize drugs, those who collected the
100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, knew it wouldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them were relieved that it didn't because they
really were not wed firmly to the idea of taking prohibitions off
the sale and distribution of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What they were really seeking was freedom to use such soft drugs
as marijuana, which is not a cuckoo idea by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, really, is total legalization of drugs on a conceptual
level. It is worth talking about, particularly in the context of
pointing out how current drug policy is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Certainly not in the United States.
Contrary to a lot of misinformation, it has not happened in the
Netherlands. In fact, the closest it has come to happening anywhere
in the world has been in Switzerland. And it was rejected there by
76 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   If it wouldn't fly in Switzerland, it wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in a Central Texas summer of becoming public
policy in the good old U.S. of A. After all, the practical,
conservative Swiss already have demonstrated that they are far more
progressive on the subject of drugs than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That became abundantly clear last year when Swiss voters
overwhelmingly endorsed state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. The Swiss sensibly concluded that it would be more
profitable to their society to provide the addicts with what they
need and allow them to be productive citizens than to leave them no
choice but to obtain their drugs from criminals and commit crimes
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there is a considerable body of American
public opinion that even rejects methadone distribution to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although full decriminalization of drugs in Switzerland, the
United States or any other country doesn't appear to be in the
cards, discussion of the notion needs to continue as a counterpoint
to the failing policies of pouring increasing millions into
minimally productive interdiction efforts, incarcerating thousands
on minor drug offenses, and building more jails and prisons to
contain the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that clash of extremes can evolve more understanding of
the need to emphasize and fund treatment and to de-emphasize
punishment for relatively minor drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the successful initiatives in Washington, Alaska,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada derived some of their driving force from
the general discussion of drug decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   The standard argument for decriminalization is that it would
take the profit out of drug trafficking and reduce the crime and
violence associated with it. That may or may not be true. The fact
is that drug trafficking is profitable because people in this
country and around the world crave drugs to fill a void in their
lives, some existential need that is not satisfied by their work,
their personal relationships or their systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Decriminalization may take some of the crime out of drug use,
but it would likely be no more effective in reducing addiction than
the repeal of prohibition on curbing alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's worth talking about because as real drug policy, it
is no more cuckoo than what now masquerades as the war on drugs.
</P>

MINIMIZING HOLIDAY TRAVEL WOES  
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers can be especially un-jolly this time of year.
Airports and planes are full of people who don't travel very often.
While these are perfectly nice people, they don't know the tricks
of travel. Many of them don't use the technological toys --
laptops, cell phones, pagers -- that business travelers take for
granted. To help lessen the travel trauma, here are ways to cut
down on the hassles of holiday travel.
</P>
<P>
   Book early for bargain fares. If you don't book early, you are
not going to be able to find either an inexpensive flight or a
flight that's convenient. If you have to book a flight on short
notice during this season, be prepared to pay full fare. Flights
are usually overbooked, and someone is going to get bumped. The
full-fare passengers are more likely to be the bumper rather than
the bumpee. If you have to pay full fare, consider using your
frequent flyer miles to upgrade to first or business class.
BizTravel has a service called BizMiles that keeps track of your
points on both the airlines and hotel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Use the Web to check on your flight before leaving home. Most of
the airlines post flight information on their Web sites. Even with
a confirmation that the flight is leaving on time, you still need
to get to the airport early. The admonition to arrive two hours
before the flight is not to be taken lightly during heavy travel
periods. The earlier you check in, the less likely you are to get
bumped from a flight. Also, holiday travelers have lots of luggage.
Both curbside check-in and the ticket counter will have long lines,
so it will take twice as long to check in.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be an unwritten law of travel that all connecting
flights must be at the farthest point from your arriving gate. It
won't cut down on the run, but getting an idea of the layout of the
airport can at least let you plan your mad dash more efficiently.
QuickAid has links to the layouts and services of all the major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   The usual advice is to travel light and never check your bags.
It slows down your exit from the airport if you have to wait for
your luggage. But during holiday travel, do the opposite. Take only
the essentials (delicate electronics, any medication, and
toiletries) on the plane. Infrequent fliers don't seem to know what
can and cannot fit under the seat and in the overhead compartment.
You'll spend a lot of time waiting for too many of them to accept
that the bag they brought on board is too big and needs to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure batteries on all electronic gadgets are charged in
case you need to demonstrate to security personnel that they are
what they appear to be. Each airport seems to have its own rules.
Major American airports that are international hubs, like Los
Angeles and New York's Kennedy, tend to be stricter about checking
electronic equipment. For the rest, it is an even bet that you will
be asked to turn on your laptop after going through the security
check. The last time it happened to me, in Indianapolis, I had a
dead battery and had to go into a nearby office to plug it in. I
nearly missed my flight.
</P>
<P>
   Once through security, turn off all the gadgets, especially
pagers, that emit either infrared or radio waves before boarding
the plane. The jury is still out on what effect these devices have
on sensitive equipment aboard the plane, but why take a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Take public transportation into the city. It's not just airport
traffic that piles up during the holiday season, Most of the
highways to the airport are also the fastest way to major malls.
Avoid the stress of sitting behind the wheel of your rental car
stuck in a traffic jam. If you must drive, check road conditions at
RWA Direct's road conditions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Get to the hotel very early or very late. Checkout in most
hotels is noon, but most will tell you that check-in is after 3
p.m. If you arrive early, before 8 a.m., you're likely to get a
room that wasn't occupied the night before. Also, the check-in
lines will be non-existent -- everybody's checking out. Arriving
late, after 5 p.m., gets you a nice clean room and no check-in
line. You can find out the hotel's check-in and check-out policy on
its Web site. Many hotels are now starting to accept e-mail at the
front desk. If yours doesn't, it will surely have a fax machine,
and you can use your computer to fax them your arrival time. I once
did this from a plane that circled Boston for three hours, using
the AirFone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to take a client out to dinner, make a
reservation before you leave home, since restaurants can be busy
this time of year. You can use the Internet to find a good
restaurant. Check any of the city guide sites or Internet phone
books like Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to confirm your returning flight. A couple of hours
before you leave for the airport, check to make sure your flight is
on time and has not been canceled. You might try one of the pager
notification services like the one offered by Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient with your fellow travelers. It's only a couple of
days a year that you have to deal with the overload. Relax. This
too shall pass and you can go back to dealing with the problem of
talkative seatmates.

did this from a plane that circled Boston for three hours, using
the AirFone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to take a client out to dinner, make a
reservation before you leave home, since restaurants can be busy
this time of year. You can use the Internet to find a good
restaurant. Check any of the city guide sites or Internet phone
books like Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to confirm your returning flight. A couple of hours
before you leave for the airport, check to make sure your flight is
on time and has not been canceled. You might try one of the pager
notification services like the one offered by Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient with your fellow travelers. It's only a couple of
days a year that you have to deal with the overload. Relax. This
too shall pass and you can go back to dealing with the problem of
talkative seatmates.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 ARTS EDUCATION GETS A TECHNOLOGICAL BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gift-giving seasons come and go, but gloomy reports about the
state of the educational system appear to be as eternal as a
holiday fruitcake. Fortunately, a slew of new online and off-line
arts-education resources has arrived to help alleviate the latest
slice of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of schoolchildren is close to being
arts-illiterate, according to a recent study by the National Center
for Education Statistics. The survey of eighth graders found that
fewer than one in four attend schools where dance or theater is
offered, and only 25 percent could pick out a Cubist work from
among four paintings. (The nation seems to be training a population
of bad guessers, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley said the study
``verifies that most American children are infrequently or never
given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music,
the arts or theater. That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What's right is that an increasing number of educators are using
technology to interest children in the arts, just as their
colleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics
of reading, writing and 'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said last week that it
would spend $27 million to add a new children's center to its famed
Media Laboratory. Areas of research will include new digital
techniques for music, dance, storytelling and the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Arts education is important, and technology will be an essential
element in that educational process, said Mitchel Resnick, an
associate professor at MIT who is involved in planning for the
children's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the richest learning experiences come when people are
involved in designing, creating and expressing, and generally there
aren't enough of those experiences in the lives of children,'' he
said. ``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new
technologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with
those technologies than previous generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger
paints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited. We
want to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling
clay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of
expressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one intriguing program is already under development at
MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will
allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments
such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar.''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two
other high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already
opened their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Zeum, an art and technology center for children that
opened on Oct. 31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for
interactive art. Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot
structure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp -- a skateboarder's
dream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a
crew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using
visuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising. Ultimately, the
videos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of
recent creations can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila
Bergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and
indicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.
Already, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for
teens.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an
interactive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's
extensively renovated performance complex. In the A-Musing Room,
young visitors plug their hand-held ``instrument boxes'' into a
computer system that introduces them to such musical basics as
rhythm and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Many new digital arts-education resources can be experienced at
home. The composer Morton Subotnick has just premiered ``Making
More Music,'' a CD-ROM that provides more advanced exercises than
the fundamentals found in its highly regarded predecessor, ``Making
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   At the disk's core are two areas, ``Rhythm Band'' and ``Chamber
Music,'' that enable aspiring composers to draw marks on a page of
on-screen sheet music. The marks can then be converted into
standard musical notation and, more important, audible sounds.
Hearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of
photographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom. The disk's
graphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly
overcome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even
when a string of random marks is drawn on the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy
arts-education ventures. ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the
ever-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last
month and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying
teachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.
</P>
<P>
   But there is already much fun to be had. The student-activities
section of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth
of interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary
(``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated
(``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always know they're interested in the (art)
object,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director. ``One of the
things that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a
variety of life experiences. There's so many stories there, there's
so many opportunities to be charmed by discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but
similar program in the works. ``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be
launched Dec. 12, will provide interactive exercises like a
Java-enabled area for making collages. However, a recent addition
to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal
mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's
display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.
</P>
<P>
   Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an
educational vision. And that, said MIT's Resnick, is perhaps the
most essential element of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact of getting a lot of technology out there will
not necessarily do anything for the arts,'' he said. ``In fact,
without active effort, it won't be productive at all. You can put
all the finger paints in the world out there in kindergarten, and
that's not necessarily going to lead to great artists.''

LAPTOP PROGRAM RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gay S. Keyes, the mother of a sixth grader in Beaufort
County, S.C., first heard about a local school district program
encouraging middle school students to obtain portable computers,
she was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to a meeting in September to find out more, she
emerged with a case of sticker shock. To participate, Keyes
learned, she and her husband would have to buy the computer
outright for about $2,000, or arrange for private loans of about
$30 to $80 a month, depending on the repayment schedule and the
lender.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Keyes decided to forgo the purchase -- instead
putting in extra hours as a substitute teacher to buy a new desktop
computer for the whole family. She also decided to join other
parents raising vocal public questions about the program and its
costs. Keyes was one of the speakers at a school board meeting
earlier this month, where parents presented a petition, signed by
53 people, protesting the program as inappropriate for a public
school system dedicated to equal opportunity for all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong to be talking about that kind of investment
-- $2,000-- to families who don't have the means to consider it,''
she said in an interview this week. ``Public school is not designed
to be this way. It's supposed to mean access for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort County is one of about 515 school districts and private
schools around the country participating in the
increasingly-popular school laptops program, which is sponsored by
Toshiba and Microsoft. Families buy or lease the computers, bundled
with word processing and other software programs, with the hope
that portable computers can offer their children the ability to
take notes more easily, write papers and do research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 60,000 students and teachers in the United States
participate in the program, a big jump from two years ago, when it
was kicked off in 52 institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort County, a diverse oceanside community that includes the
wealthy Hilton Head area as well as numerous families so poor that
they qualify for free school lunches, was one of the pioneer
participants. Today, about 1,950 students, or about half of those
enrolled in Beaufort's three middle schools, have laptops through
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, the cost of leasing the machines was
subsidized for all participants by a nonprofit group set up to help
with the portables program, with the biggest subsidies going to the
poorest families. But this year, subsidies were restricted to 300
poor families, in large part because the fundraising efforts of the
program could not keep up with demand for the computers.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that middle class parents like Keyes were told
they would have to pay for the laptops themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was just asking too much, said Sheree P. Wright, a
mother of three, including one middle school student. ``People were
having to decide between buying a laptop or putting braces on their
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she said, parents questioned whether the
educational bang from the laptop program was worth the big bucks it
demanded. Wright noted that in parent-teacher meetings this year,
teachers have told her that her honor roll daughter is not missing
out academically by not owning a portable computer. And, she said,
she has heard stories that students who have had laptops for a year
or so do not make extensive use of them.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyes said it is unclear to parents how, exactly, the
devices are being used in classrooms, many of which are already
equipped with personal computers. ``We don't know what are the
benefits to the kids and how do they compare to just taking a
computer class,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another issue, too. Parents assert that even though
school administrators say the initiative is voluntary, anxious
young teens who want to feel part of the group feel pressure to
participate -- pressure that they in turn exert on their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol. You ask any sixth, seventh or eighth
grader who doesn't have it. They feel left out. You have enough of
that sort of thing with Hilfiger outfits,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor the program say it has ample precedents in
schools. Parents are routinely asked to contribute to everything
from field trips to the purchase of musical instruments, said
Margaret D. Rushton, a parent who believes that having a laptop has
helped her daughter become a more fluent writer.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Williams, a spokesman for the district, said laptops do
give children an academic edge. He said soon-to-be-released test
results, comparing middle school students who have the devices with
those who don't, show that on average the laptop owners are able to
avoid a slump in test scores that typically occurs with other sixth
graders.
</P>
<P>
   Williams conceded that to date there may be teachers who are not
making good use of technology in the classroom, but he said that
should change shortly, because teachers are receiving technology
training. ``In the worst cases, the laptop is probably used just
for note-taking,'' he said. ``We expect that to be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   As for peer pressure, Williams said parents could use the laptop
question as ``a valuable lesson to kids that Mom and Dad can't
afford everything under the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Toshiba and Microsoft say the Beaufort
parent protest is not the first time the program has encountered
resistance from parents who balked at the price. But, they insisted
that the program, which is voluntary in all districts where it has
been introduced to date, is generally accepted with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   However, for Wright, the program violates a principle of public
education, that no one child is better off than another because of
family income. ``It can't be voluntary if you don't have $2,000
laying around,'' she said.

LAWYERS ON THE BOTTOM TAKE AIM AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year when thoughts turn to ... salary
bonuses. That is, if you are a lawyer at one of the nation's top
law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are a few Web sites where young, overworked lawyers --
known as associates -- can go to trade the latest news and rumors
about end-of-year bonuses and salary pay scales. There is also
plenty of gossip about law firm culture, hiring possibilities and
the grind of making it at a competitive firm.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of a bulletin board ``club'' on Yahoo called ''
Greedy Associates,'' whose screen name is ``nowhitenoise,'' wrote
in a ``Founder's Message'' that the club is ``designed to give the
whiny overprivileged lawyers at the nation's most prestigious law
firms a place to discuss such pressing matters as whether or not
this $20,000 bonus is really going to pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   The club has grown to 125 members since it was founded in
September. According to access statistics on the site, 37 members
logged on Wednesday morning, and 219 non-members visited. Messages
on the site can be viewed by anyone, but only members may post
comments. Membership is free.
</P>
<P>
   The unvarnished notes, written anonymously by people with screen
names like ``DebitBoyz,'' ``Body_Count_Rising,'' ``NYCglamourgirl''
and ``happylawyer,'' can be childish, supportive, informative or
scandalous. They give a glimpse of what is on the minds of young
lawyers who toil late into the night on a dry legal memo or the
sixth draft of a motion concerning a business dispute between
toothpaste companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``jmkm'' described himself in a message on the board
as a ``greedy associate-to-be,'' indicating that he is probably a
law student. He noted that while an $87,000 starting salary at the
top San Francisco law firms was ``a ridiculous amount of money,''
it still trailed behind the $95,000 starting salary in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next day, a ``Greedy Associates'' member replied to
the message with a combination of self-pride and self-pity: ``JMKM,
I take it you mean that $87,000 is a ridiculously high amount of
money. When you are expected to work ridiculously long hours, pay
ridiculously high rents and service ridiculously high debts, I can
assure you that $87,000 will seem ridiculously low.''
</P>
<P>
   A young lawyer out of law school can make around $100,000 at a
major New York City firm during his first year of employment,
</P>
<P>
   according to the New York Law Journal, a newspaper that tracks
salaries and bonuses at the top firms in New York and that first
reported on the Greedy Associates sites. The figure includes a
routine annual bonus of several thousand dollars. But this year,
some firms are offering additional ``boom year'' bonuses'' of
$10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Greedy Associates'' discussion group, unaffiliated
with the Yahoo club, is located on a message board site called
``Inside the Web.'' It, too, hosts an exchange of gossip about
salaries and bonuses, along with other topics. Members include
``DeathbyLoans,'' ``MoMoney,'' SnobbyNewYorkloser'' and
``overworked_skadden_fool,'' a likely reference to the powerhouse
New York-based law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, correspondents discussed whether a law student was
better off taking a job at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett or Skadden
Arps (both have their good points, the members said). Others
tackled the question of which town on Long Island was a commuter's
paradise. One member touted Long Beach, with its yuppie-friendly
bars and boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Law students who are eyeing their first stint of real legal work
at firms during summer break now have their own place to gossip.
Earlier this month a new Yahoo club was formed, ``Greedy Summer
Associates.'' Founded by someone named ``Perks4US,'' the groupswaps
information on the size of summer associate offices at various
firms, the number of weekends off and the types of free sports
tickets offered by management.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Henning, a senior vice president and general counsel at
Hildebrandt, a law firm management consultant, said associates
already have ``a pretty good network'' of information about pay
scales thanks to articles in trade magazines, headhunter calls and
chats with colleagues. The ``greedy associates'' sites add to the
mix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Henning questioned the validity of the information on the
sites, given the notorious inaccuracy of anonymous postings on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms aren't going to be buffaloed by associate demands, even
though it is a seller's market for associate talent,'' he said.
``The best impact of these sites would be to stimulate the powers
that be at the firms to do a reliable survey,'' one that is not
based on Internet gossip, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sites' latent function as a pressure-valve for law
firm drones, Henning said gossip has always gone on in coffee rooms
and bars every Friday night after work. ``The Net just makes it
more available,'' he said.

`LITTLE VOICE' FALLS A LITTLE SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With her moptop haircut and prodigious nose,
actress Jane Horrocks bears more than a passing resemblance to a
``Hard Days Night'' era Ringo Starr _ except for the singing voice.
Horrocks doesn't need a little help from her friends. She can
imitate them. From a brassy Shirley Bassey to a quivering Judy
Garland, Horrocks can capture every legendary inflection, right
down to the smallest hand gesture and facial expression.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks is the best reason to see ``Little Voice,'' a wildly
uneven movie about a sheltered, fragile young woman who won't speak
but can sing up a storm. The film was adapted from an English play,
``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice,'' and, my guess is, it worked
much better as a live stage show than it does as a movie. But
Horrocks' presence, along with a devilish supporting turn from
Michael Caine and a soundtrack full of marvelous standards, ensures
more than a few entertaining moments.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks plays LV (or Little Voice), a young woman who lives in
the dark attic of her father's once thriving record shop. Dad is
dead now, and LV has never quite recovered from that. She plays
albums from his record collection night and day, developing an
uncanny ability to sing along with the likes of Bassey, Garland,
Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   LV may never talk, but her obnoxious mother, Mari (Brenda
Blethyn), more than fills the sound void. Ever on the prowl, Mari
has her sights set on a low-life talent promoter with the wonderful
name of Ray Say (Caine). Obliging and convivial (at least on the
surface), Ray is convinced that he could have made it big if only
he had caught one lucky break. When he overhears LV singing ``Over
the Rainbow,'' Ray realizes he has found his meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: LV doesn't want to perform in public. For her,
singing is a private therapy, a way to cope with her tortured
relationship with her spiteful mother. The ties between mother and
daughter should be ripe for exploration, but writer-director Mark
Herman's script doesn't delve into the subject until it's much too
late.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he didn't reign in Blethyn's over-the-top
performance _ she comes off as a cross between Eliza Doolittle and
any dunce from the royal family _ doesn't help matters much,
either. Neither does a rather pointless subplot involving Ewan
McGregor as LV's pigeon-loving suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Horrocks' nuanced performance almost makes up for all these
shortcomings, though. Having originated the character on stage, she
knows LV inside and out and delivers a rollicking revue once Little
Voice takes to the stage. Caine is equally enjoyable, particularly
in a quiet scene where he convinces LV to go public with her
talents. It's an indelible reminder of a talent too often hidden
through the years by poor choices.

`PSYCHO:' IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By some logic, Gus Van Sant's almost shot-for-shot
remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' should be welcomed by fans
and cineastes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's both a radical formal notion and as faithful a tribute to a
master filmmaker as could be imagined by a director whose highly
personal films have made him a critics' favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sense of outrage surrounding the new ``Psycho.''
The very idea of remaking Hitchcock's 1960, black-and-white
masterpiece in color smacks of tasteless exploitation to some.
That's understandable, because of all Hitchcock's great films,
``Psycho'' is the best known and most influential.
</P>
<P>
   The original slasher thriller remains a watershed of pioneering
technique, and even though it's tame by subsequent standards, the
film broke oodles of Hollywood taboos regarding the presentation of
sex, violence and deviant psychology at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it's an iconic piece of American pop culture that
stands apart from its numerous, non-Hitchcock-involved sequels and
knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   All of which Van Sant is eminently aware of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to improve the film in any way,'' the
famously low-key, easygoing filmmaker says. ``We're trying to
actually popularize a film that people don't watch. The people that
would be offended by this whole idea are probably not in our
audience; they know the original and are very happy watching the
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Those would be people like genre specialist John Carpenter, who
has repeatedly put homages to Hitchcock and other classic
filmmakers in his horror films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot figure that one out,'' Carpenter, whose movies
include the ``Psycho''-inspired ``Halloween'' and a remake of ``The
Thing,'' says, wincing, about the new ``Psycho.'' ``I don't get
that. Somebody's going to have to explain that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant tries again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that we're making the film for are people that
would never go see the original because it's antiquated,'' says the
director, who had his first mass-market hit with the Oscar-winning
``Good Will Hunting'' within the past year. ``It's a very general
audience type of reason, but it's a very strong reason.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, it appears that Van Sant tried to make the best new
``Psycho'' that he could (we can only speculate, though, since he
also refused to screen the film for critics before today's
commercial release). Besides adding color and stereo sound, Van
Sant has incorporated elements from Joseph Stefano's original
``Psycho'' script that Hitchcock had to cut for the censors or _ as
in the case of an elaborate helicopter shot _ for which he did not
have the technology to film properly at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano was also brought in as an accuracy consultant and to
update a few plot points. For example, Marion Crane, the famous
shower victim played by Janet Leigh in the original and Anne Heche
in the remake, now steals $400,000 from her boss instead of 1960's
less-of-a-motive-after-inflation $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also hired were the world-renowned Australian cinematographer
Christopher Doyle (``Chungking Express'') and such admired actors
as Julianne Moore (``Boogie Nights''), William H. Macy
(``Pleasantville'') and Viggo Mortensen (``A Perfect Murder,''
itself a remake of Hitchcock's ``Dial M for Murder'').
</P>
<P>
   But the most important hire, of course, was the actor who would
portray Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins' jittery performance as the
homicidal mama's boy is easily the best-known madman in movie
history. But instead of going for an actor with a proven ability to
project neurotic creepiness, Van Sant opted for Vince Vaughn, the
robust, 6-foot-5 party animal from ``Swingers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince has a mysterious quality, and he also has a very
friendly quality, which I thought was good for Norman,'' Van Sant
says. ``And, like Anne, he seemed very excited about doing it,
which was a very big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well aware that his every move would be compared with an icon's,
Vaughn did his best to walk the thin line between respectfulness
and making the character his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just based my work on the material, which is where the first
performance came from,'' Vaughn says. ``I watched Hitchcock's film
before we started this one, and certain things I did do are exactly
like the original. But there are other times when I said `No, I'm
going off in this head space.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you just don't get a fair shot out of the gate with
it, and I understand why, because people liked the first one,''
Vaughn admits. ``I just think that people should be open to the
fact that music is constantly replayed, plays are restaged many
times over, and works are meant to be explored and reinterpreted.
It's 40 years later, and it's time for that to happen with
`Psycho.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Van Sant first dreamed up the idea eight years ago _
and off the top of his head at that. On the strength of ``Drugstore
Cowboy,'' his first independent hit, the Oregon-based director was
making the obligatory rounds of meetings with semi-interested
Hollywood studio executives.
</P>
<P>
   The suits at Universal didn't care for the project he wanted to
make next _ a pseudo-Shakespearean tale of narcoleptic teen-age
hustlers that would become ``My Own Private Idaho'' _ so they asked
him if there was anything in the studio's vast archive he'd like to
remake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the remake process is to find an obscure movie _
like `Death Takes a Holiday,' I suppose _ and change it into `Meet
Joe Black,''' Van Sant says. ``But my feeling was that the whole
reason to remake a film was because it did something that was good.
I didn't really see why remakes had this practice of changing the
language of the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said, `Instead of trying to hide it's a remake, why not
pick something great like ``Psycho''?' They weren't real excited by
the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But after ``Good Will Hunting'' grossed upward of $130 million
and won two Oscars, Universal, well, agreed to do anything Van Sant
wanted. So he not only set about making as perfect an update of
``Psycho'' as possible but made it like Hitchcock did whenever
possible, sticking to an eight-week shooting schedule and keeping
the production cost _ an estimated $25 million _ in the same,
relatively low-budget ballpark as the $800,000 original.
</P>
<P>
   Expect some changes, though, like a few different cuts in the
sacred shower scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I've done something that not only supports what
Janet Leigh did, because I love her performance in the original,
but also makes it interesting enough for the audience who's seen
that to appreciate what I've done differently,'' says Heche, who
proudly adds that she did her own screaming.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the inevitable changes, Stefano was amazed by how
closely the production followed the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that there were some lines that I wanted to change
that Gus didn't want to change, as well as lines that the actors
didn't want changed,'' says Stefano, whose adaptation of Robert
Bloch's source novel was only his second screenplay. ``So, far from
happily being there to protect my sacred work, I was the one who
was pushing the most for changes. I read something I've written 10
minutes ago, and I'm already into rewriting it; imagine what I
thought I could do with something I'd written almost 40 years
ago!''
</P>
<P>
   Stefano reports enjoying the rare opportunity of seeing a new
group of actors reinterpreting his lines. And at least one other
partial observer, Hitchcock's daughter Pat Hitchcock, has given the
project her blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very flattering to my father that Gus wanted to
do it this way,'' she says. ``I can understand the naysayers' point
of view, but everybody should be allowed to express themselves in
any way they want to. If you want to remake a picture like
`Psycho,' then more power to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other customers remain tougher to sell, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talented people involved in this movie, and I think
they'll make an interesting one,'' says Janet Leigh's daughter,
actress Jamie Lee Curtis (Leigh refuses to comment on the project).
``They're never going to make a better movie, though, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant says that was never the intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original will always be the original,'' he says. ``Our
restaging shouldn't upset people.''

FOREIGN FILMS SHARE CANNES-DO ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A record-tying number of foreign language films
from 45 countries have been submitted for Academy Award
consideration, including the first-ever entry from Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Morocco sent entries in the Best Foreign Language
Film competition for the first time in 20 years. Under Academy
rules, each country is invited to submit its top film of the year.
This year's response ties the record set in 1994, according to the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy are ``Eternity and a Day'' by the mercurial Greek
director Theo Angelopoulos, who took top prize at this year's
CannesFestival, and the runner-up, ``Life is Beautiful,'' by
Italian director Roberto Benigni. Foremost Russian filmmaker Nikita
Mikhalkov, who won the 1994 Foreign Language Oscar for ``Burnt by
the Sun,'' is entered again with ``Barber of Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Oscar race is news, some of the films will be
recognizable to audiences. ``Life is Beautiful'' and `The
Celebration'' by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg have already
opened in Los Angeles theaters. Spanish director Carlos Saura's
entry for Argentina, ``Tango,'' and the Brazilian-made ``Central
Station'' by Walter Salles are due to open.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Language Film committee begins screening entries in
December to select five for Oscar consideration. Nominations will
be announced Feb. 9 and Oscars will be presented March 21 at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL'S OWN: This year's annual Israel Film Festival opens
Thursday with the the U.S. premiere of ``Circus Palestina,'' an
Oscar entry for Best Foreign Language film.
</P>
<P>
   More than 35 features, documentaries, television and miniseries
productions will be making their U.S. debuts. ``Circus Palestina''
won five Israeli Academy Awards this year for screenplay, score,
actor, supporting actor and outstanding picture. Last year's winner
of six Academy Awards in Israel, ``Afula Express (Pick a Card)''
will also be screened.
</P>
<P>
   The festival opens with a gala event at the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, and the presentation of
a lifetime achievement award to Lia van Leer for her preservation
efforts for the cinematic arts in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition runs through Dec. 17 at Laemmle's Music Hall,
9036 Wilshire Blvd., in Beverly Hills.

A MUST FOR `JAM' FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
PEARL JAM/``Live on Two Legs'' (Epic)
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a Jam fan, you'll just have to own this
career-spanning package that ignores ``Jeremy'' but adds nods to
old tour partner Neil Young _ a verse of ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' inside ``Daughter'' and a cover of a Young tune that boasts
an unprintable title. No matter what you think of terribly
self-important lead singer Eddie Vedder, you'll admit they've
churned out a solid live effort. Other goodies here include punchy
readings of ``Corduroy,'' ``Even Flow'' and the emotive ``Black,''
still among the band's best numbers. 3 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GARTH BROOKS/``Double Live'' (Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Brooks made no bones about it _ he issued this specially priced
two-disc package with various covers as a marketing ploy to set a
sales record. A modest talent to begin with, Brooks is clearly more
interested in raking in as much dough and glory as possible in
these waning days before the parade passes by. If you fall for this
so-so set, don't expect anything groundbreaking, just the usual
arena-country fare (with numerous overdubs and annoyingly loud
crowd response). Here are artificially charged concert versions of
``Two Pina Coladas,'' ``Friends in Low Places,'' ``Unanswered
Prayers'' and ``The Dance,'' along with three new songs, including
a duet with Trisha Yearwood. 1{ Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MILES DAVIS/``The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions'' (Columbia
Legacy)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the myth, ``Bitches Brew,'' issued in 1970 as a double
album, wasn't the first fusion record and it wasn't Miles' first
electric effort. That happened even before ``In a Silent Way'' a
year earlier. But ``Bitches Brew'' showed how far the Davis
ensemble (and that includes producer Teo Macero) had come in the
use of abrupt dissonant cues, silence, contrasting moods, long
spare rhythmic passages and, most of all, tape editing since the
album was spliced together from various sessions. This four-disc
box offers the album's original six cuts, plus nine previously
unissued tracks and material chronologically sequenced according to
the 1969-70 sessions that lent material to later Davis releases
such as ``Big Fun,'' ``Circle in the Round'' and ``Live-Evil.''
Fantastic, atmospheric and timeless music. 4 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN/``Tracks'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Bruce fans have been waiting for this four-CD, 66-song
collection spanning 25 years for ages. Starting with a song from
his 1972 audition for Columbia right through stirring '80s outtakes
with the magnificent E Street Band to tunes cut in the last few
years with L.A. session pros, there's rarely a dull moment here.
Best of all, though, is disc two, containing tunes Springsteen
jettisoned from ``The River,'' including the haunting ``Restless
Nights'' (a distant relative to the great ``Point Blank'') and the
equally hypnotic ``Wages of Sin.'' He also reclaims ``Born in the
U.S.A.,'' offering the toughened, slide-guitar version familiar to
those who attended the ``Tom Joad'' tour a few years ago. 4 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHITNEY HOUSTON/``My Love Is Your Love'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   For her first non-soundtrack-based album in eight years, Houston
wants to be viewed as a contemporary r&AMP;b artist instead of a
mink-lined lifestyle accessory. ``My Love Is Your Love,'' overseen
in part by Brandy producer Ronald Jenkins, could be the latest from
Mary J. Blige or Faith Evans (who appears on one track here). Other
cameos include Missy Elliott, who drops hip-hop science on two
tracks, and Wyclef Jean, who creates a reggae-tinged rhythm bed for
the title song. This warm set also reunites Houston with producers
Babyface and David Foster, with whom she has worked in the past.
The biggest drawback: that horrific ``Prince of Egypt'' duet with
Mariah Carey, ``When You Believe,'' which sounds like a cageful of
hopped-up hamsters at feeding time. 2{ Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHN COLTRANE/``The Classic Quartet, Complete Impulse! Studio
Recordings'' (Impulse)
</P>
<P>
   This eight-CD set showcases what might just be the greatest
working band in jazz history, saxophone legend John Coltrane's
riveting quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison
and drummer Elvin Jones. The music picks up where last year's
Village Vanguard box left off, encompassing four years of music
(1962-65) that would change the face of jazz. The 66 tracks
(including seven previous unreleased alternate takes) are arranged
chronologically, providing a fascinating journey through Coltrane's
spiritual and musical quest. The band's playing is unbelievably
telepathic, whether they're tackling beautifully lyrical ballads or
Coltrane's later explosive, experimental work. The set is
exquisitely packaged and includes a 100-page book with rare photos,
interesting essays and a fond remembrance by drummer Jones. This is
an absolute must for every jazz library. 4 Stars &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Beleza Tropical 2'' (Luaka Bop)
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, David Byrne helped fuel a resurgence in U.S.
interest in Brazilian music with his excellent first ``Beleza''
compilation and succeeding retrospectives of individual artists.
Now he returns with an even wider-ranging collection of 15 songs,
showing the impacts such American musical developments as rap and
sampling have had on Brazilian artists. Standout tracks include

GILBERTO GIL/``O Sol de Oslo'' (Blue Jackel)
</P>
<P>
   The great Gil here explores the musical backlands of his
country, and those of other places, in a sort-of supergroup
recording at an Oslo, Norway, studio. The unusual combination of
instrumentation (violins, accordion, tablas with guitars, bass,
Brazilian percussion) makes for an intoxicating mix. 3{ Stars &QL;

GONZALO RUBALCABA AND CUBAN QUARTET/``Antiguo'' (Blue Note)!off!
</P>
<P>
   The endlessly inventive Cuban-born jazz pianist here composes,
produces and plays a suite of vaguely related songs exploring his
and his country's Yoruban (West African) and Caribbean roots, while
using more electronic keyboard colorings than in any of his
previous works. Santeria master singers bump up against custom
synth samples and classic horn charts. This is complex stuff, not
always easy or pretty in the ways some of his meditative previous
recordings and pyrotechnic live shows have been. But it is
rewarding, and worth a listen to hear one of the world's best young
jazz pianists examine his musical roots, and future. 3 Stars &QL;

STRUNZ &AMP; FARAH/``Wild Muse'' (Selva)
</P>

   Duo Jorge Strunz and Ardeshir Farah play delightful Latin-tinged

   Mexican conjunto king Jimenez takes a break from his supergroup
exercises of recent years (Texas Tornados, Los Super Seven) with
this fun solo album, assisted by prominent friends such as the
Mavericks' Raul Malo. It's not strictly Mexican country accordion
here, as the rocking title track shows. Bouncy, bright and warm,
this is party music for your next road trip to the Tex-Mex border.

TALKING TO SCHRADER FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``You talking to me? You talking to me? There's
nobody here, so you must be talking to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976's ``Taxi Driver'' was molded into unsettling cinema
by Martin Scorsese, screenwriter and director Paul Schrader has
been talking to us. First, it was through Robert DeNiro's character
as a loose-cannon, night-shift cabbie who's infatuated with a
12-year-old prostitute, played by Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1980, Schrader let Richard Gere's male prostitute
character do his bidding in another story of a loner, only this
time one with Gucci style and cool charm that draws him into the
company of well-appointed women looking for a good time in the city
of fallen angels.
</P>
<P>
   The co-existence of alienation and humanity in the metropolitan
rat race is a theme he's come back to frequently _ from 1992's
``Light Sleeper,'' with Willem Dafoe as a drug courier living on
the razor's edge in New York, to 1997's ``Touch,'' about a young
man with healing powers that make him vulnerable to exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight with the screening of ``Taxi Driver'' and
``Light Sleeper,'' audiences can realize Schrader's rather bleak
cinematic style and see his evolution from writer to
writer-director to director of other authors' works. The program
begins at 7:30 p.m. at Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing
Theatre. ``American Gigolo'' and ``Touch'' screen on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The program continues Dec. 11 with ``Mishima'' and ``The Comfort
of Strangers,'' and concludes Dec. 12 with the L.A. premiere of
``Affliction,'' based on the novel ``The Sweet Hereafter'' by
Russell Banks. Schrader will introduce his newest film, which opens
later this month. All shows begin at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   EVENING WITH GREGORY PECK: Disney studio's restoration of David
O. Selznick's western-love story ``Duel in the Sun'' was given the
thumbs-up by co-star Gregory Peck, who said seeing the picture gave
him a new appreciation for his co-star and friend Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited her to join me tonight,'' the charming and rugged
Peck, now 82, revealed, ``but she's a shrinking violet. She told
me, `I wouldn't know what to say in front of all those people'.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Duel in the Sun,'' Jones plays a mixed-heritage daughter
who goes to live with a Texas family after her own father is hanged
for killing his wife and her lover. There, she encounters the
hostility of the ranch's patriarch, played by Lionel Barrymore, and
the affection of the motherly Lillian Gish and her two sons, the
lawyerly Joseph Cotten and the free-spirited ladies' man Peck.
</P>
<P>
   The actor maintains a close friendship with Jones, with whom he
was paired again in Fox's ``The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call her tonight and tell her,'' Peck said, after
applauding the preservation effort done by Walt Disney Library
Restoration, the Museum of Modern Art and the Library of Congress.
This new version of the 1946 picture includes the original
10-minute ``Roadshow Overture,'' the three-minute ``Popular
Overture'' and the ``Roadshow Exit Music'' written by Dimitri
Tiomkin.
</P>
<P>
   Bits by Butterfly McQueen as the family's talkative house
servant and Walter Huston playing a hellfire preacher sprinkle some
hearty humor into this overtly sexual production that critics
dubbed ``Lust in the Dust.'' The censors let it go, but
conservative groups were outraged when it debuted and more editing
was needed to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about playing a fiend (albeit, a likable one) against
type, Peck let everyone in on a secret. Playing the bad apple in
only his fifth motion picture was easier than it looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in La Jolla, I had a cousin named Stretch. He was a
Lothario. I was just playing my cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST FOR ACADEMY BOARD: Oscar winner Kathy Bates has been
elected to the motion picture academy's Board of Governors, filling
the seat left empty by the late Roddy McDowall.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who won an Academy Award in 1990 for ``Misery,'' joins
governors Gregory Peck and Karl Malden, making this the first time
that three Oscar-winning actors have served together, according to
academy spokeswoman Leslie Unger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary Colors,'' ``The Waterboy,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Fried
Green Tomatoes'' are among Bates' screen credits.
</P>
<P>
   McDowall died of cancer at age 70 on Oct. 3 in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the academy's 13 branches is represented on the board by
three governors.
</P>
<P>
   PICKING ARTISTS' BRAINS: Documentarians come at art from
opposite directions in this month's Contemporary Documentary series
Tuesday, hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelangelo, Restored,'' produced by Perry Wolff and Severine
Bourlet de la Vallee, examines the painstaking, 13-year effort to
restore the great Michelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel,
arguably the world's most famous frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder where creative people get their ideas? In the second
film, ``Inspirations,'' seven artists describe their own creative
process and how they communicate their ideas. Produced by Michael
Apted and Jody Patton, ``Inspirations'' interviews musician David
Bowie, painter Roy Lichtenstein, architect Tadao Ando,
choreographer Edouard Lock, dancer Louise Lecavalier, sculptor Nora
Naranjo-Morse and glass artist Dale Chihuly.
</P>
<P>
   This free event is at the James Bridges Theater on the northeast
corner of the UCLA campus. Parking is available for $5 in Lot 3,
next to the theater. For information, call (310) 206-3456.

PREPARING FOR THE WORST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; These are sad times in the music industry, and
the new Cher album has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The depressing mood at the major labels has little to do with
music and everything to do with business.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of Seagram-owned PolyGram and the Universal
Music Group (UMG) into one company could result in the elimination
of as many as 3,000 jobs. Rank and file employees at Geffen, A&AMP;M,
Mercury and other imprints are preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's ever certain in the music business. A quick look at
the albums chart confirms that. Acts that were selling millions a
year ago are hanging on by their teeth today.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, executives who may be forced out during this massive
reorganization will have hefty severance packages to fall back on.
Staff in the publicity and promotions departments, however, won't
be as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are expected to work, Geffen, A&AMP;M and Interscope
will be folded into the Interscope Music Group based in Los
Angeles. MCA will remain as is, while New York-based Universal
Records will include Motown and Def Jam. Island and Mercury also
would be merged and based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The changes should start next month with the first round of
firings expected the second week of January.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the loss of jobs, Geffen's historic string of offices
in the 9100 block of Sunset will be put on the block, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Spector Productions operated there in the '60s and '70s,
before Lookout/Frontline Management moved in. That's where David
Geffen co-managed Joni Mitchell; Jackson Browne; Neil Young; and
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Later, those little bungalow offices were home to the Asylum
label (the Eagles, Tom Waits, Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt and Browne).
</P>
<P>
   The Strip just won't be the same when Starbucks moves in.
</P>
<P>
   HOOKER AS PIONEER RECIPIENT: Delta bluesman John Lee Hooker will
receive the lifetime achievement award at the Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Foundation's 10th annual Pioneer Awards on Feb. 25 at Sony Studios
in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   Smokey Robinson will host the event, in which 1999 Pioneer
honorees include soul greats such as the late Johnny Adams, Mickey
Baker, Brenda Holloway, Barbara Lewis, Barbara Lynn, Garnet Mimms,
Johnny Moore, Bill Pinkney, Joe Simon, Charlie Thomas and Dee Dee
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   Ashford &AMP; Simpson and David Porter/Isaac Hayes will be
recognized as songwriters, while Patti LaBelle &AMP; the Bluebelles and
the Manhattans will be honored in the vocal groups category.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, part of Grammy week each year, will bestow
$260,000 to the honorees.

FROM GUTHRIE TO BRAGG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Although separated by 50 years and an ocean,
Billy Bragg and Woody Guthrie are linked by musical tradition and a
belief in the power of one voice.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, British troubadour Bragg hit upon the heady mix of
the Clash's fiery energy and Guthrie's political fervor, managing
to avoid the ``angry folkie'' tag due to his command of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie, born into dust-bowl poverty, roamed far and wide during
the Depression and afterward, writing such classic anthems as
``This Land Is Your Land'' while chronicling social struggle and
the resiliency of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Since both artists belong to the same singer-songwriter
heritage, it seemed like a natural for Bragg to cover Guthrie.
Instead, something more creative took place.
</P>
<P>
   On the acclaimed ``Mermaid Avenue'' (Elektra), Bragg teamed up
with rootsy Chicago rockers Wilco in Dublin for a collection that
puts new music to never-before-released lyrics by Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics, mostly penned at Guthrie's Coney Island home in the
late '40s and early '50s, were fitted with tunes composed by Bragg
and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although some of these lyrics are over 50 years old, they
don't sound dated at all,'' Bragg said recently. ``This is not a
tribute album but a genuine collaboration between contemporary
artists and the man who in many respects is the original
singer-songwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg and his band the Blokes appear tonight at the House of
Blues in West Hollywood. Slide guitarist Corey Harris opens.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June release of ``Mermaid Avenue,'' Guthrie's widow,
Nora, has unearthed more Guthrie material at the Woody Guthrie
Archives in New York. It was her idea to invite Bragg to work on
the original treasure trove in spring 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a spirit to these songs that matches Billy's outlook
and intensity,'' she said. ``Billy has a way of getting a message
across without being pompous, the same way Woody did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg put the idea of a collaboration to Wilco in London two
years ago. The following summer, both acts were on the bill at the
Fleadh Festival in New York where they met with Nora, ``and from
there on it was a done deal,'' Bragg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg and Wilco met in Chicago to demo the material, and the
ensemble soon decamped to Dublin fwpossibility of another Guthrie
record with Wilco and a tour featuring both Bragg and Wilco next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out promoting the album, and as a result a group of
people have taken a closer look at Woody,'' he said. ``I have a
strange inkling that this might be Woody's time. People may at last
be ready to reassess his contribution to popular music and
recognize him as the first true singer-songwriter.''

`ZORRO' SLASHINGLY GOOD FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Truman
Show'' grabbed the critical acclaim, ``There's Something About
Mary'' packed in the comedy lovers, and ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon'' cranked up the decibel level, the best pure popcorn
movie of the summer was ``The Mask of Zorro'' (Sony), which hit
video stores this week.
</P>
<P>
   Call it retro fun, which is no surprise because Steven
Spielberg, who loves adventure films, had a hand in making it.
Starring Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins as the aging swordmaster Don
Diego de la Vega and Antonio Banderas as his rash young pupil who
eventually dons the mask to fight for the rights of the oppressed
peasants, ``Zorro'' combines an old-fashioned swashbuckling quality
with a modern, hip sensibility. And what helps give it the latter
is the stunning addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena, de la
Vega's long-lost daughter. The scenes in which she dances and duels
with Banderas smolder _ in a PG-13 sort of way, of course.
</P>
<P>
   With her fiery beauty and strong screen presence, Zeta-Jones is
likely destined for stardom. She was literally cast for the film
when Spielberg saw her in a television movie about the Titanic.
Next up for her is the thriller ``Entrapment,'' with Sean Connery,
that is set for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Zorro'' pits good vs. evil in an easily definable way,
``The Negotiator'' (Warner) blurs the edges. The thriller pits one
hostage negotiator (Samuel L. Jackson) who has been framed for
stealing from the police disability fund and takes a room full of
people hostage to prove his innocence against another high-profile
negotiator (Kevin Spacey). The film becomes a cat-and-mouse game
between two wily opponents set against the intrigue of who the real
villains are. (This is complicated by those cops who are angry at
Jackson's character because they think he's guilty.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the action scenes are a bit overblown, and the end is a
bit too tightly wrapped, but where the script falters, the acting
fills in. And it's a treat to watch Jackson and Spacey, who are
both at the top of their game, command the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sliding Doors'' (Paramount) offers its take on a question that
most of us us ask every day: ``What if?'' In this case, it shows us
how Helen's life would be different if she had caught a London
subway train instead of just missing it. In one of the two
alternating futures intercut throughout the film, Helen (Gwyneth
Paltrow) makes the train and meets a handsome fellow (John Hannah),
who offers the possibility of a new job and fresh love. In the
other future, Helen misses the train and returns home to her dull
job and a live-in boyfriend (John Lynch) who is cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow, like the film, is charming in either parallel future.
``Sliding Doors'' is a light confection that will fall flat under
too much examination, but nevertheless is entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   DVD WATCH: Twentieth Century Fox recently joined the DVD
revolution with the release of its first eight titles. Considering
Fox's great catalog of film, there are some curious choices here
for film bluffs, though perhaps not for marketing people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get no argument here with the selections of Jan De Bont's
``Speed,'' ``Predator,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and
``Young Frankenstein.'' The first two are terrific action pictures
with spectacular special effects that look great, especially in the
wide-screen format option.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Brooks' black-and-white ``Young Frankenstein,'' starring
Gene Wilder as the doctor and Peter Boyle as the monster may not
the have the special effects of the other two _ except the
ever-changing hump of the hunchback Igor (the late Marty Feldman)
and whatever weird stuff he does with his eyes _ but the bonus
features of Brooks' commentary and a feature of outtakes/bloopers
makes this a fun DVD choice.
</P>
<P>
   The other five titles _ ``Marked for Death,'' ``Home Alone 3,''
``Porky's'' ``Hope Floats'' and ``Jingle All the Way'' _ are
dubious picks to lead off Fox's foray into DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Clark's teen comedy ``Porky's'' is admittedly funny for all
of us with adolescence senses of humor, and ``Hope,'' starring
Sandra Bullock, and ``Jingle,'' with Schwarzenegger, have their
moments. ``Home'' and ``Marked'' have marginal entertainment value
at best, but none of them is crying out to be the first on DVD. No
doubt ``Jingle'' was chosen because of the holidays, and ``Hope''
for it romance, but a Steven Seagal film (``Marked'') and the worst
of the ``Home Alone'' series? Come on.

ROBOTS SHOW OFF THEIR SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. - Max and Lisa, two workers at a new Chandler
company, lift and haul heavy boxes, flawlessly repeat boring tasks
and work in hazardous environments without complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll do it all for eight straight years without taking a
coffee break, getting a raise or a headache.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't superhuman. They are robots.
</P>
<P>
   The two are among many robots at a new 28,000 square-foot plant
tucked away among the miles of semiconductor companies in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Motoman Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, recently opened the shop to cater
to the semiconductor industry worldwide. It will sell, support and
teach people how to control the robots. Also, engineers will
customize existing robots for customers like Intel, Motorola,
SpeedFam International and others.
</P>
<P>
   Just sitting in the floor of the cavernous building, the robots
seem underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our robots look like C-3P0,'' said Don Adkins, general
manager of Motoman's supermechatronics group.
</P>
<P>
   But after firing up their motors, creating an eerie humming
noise, the powerful hunks of metal come to life _ rapidly moving
heavy boxes, flipping around windshield-size plates of glass held
on by suction cups. They can really dance.
</P>
<P>
   The robots come in two basic designs. One is fairly small and is
designed to pick up an item and move it from one place to another
in a straight line. Such devices tend to cost in the low $20,000
range.
</P>
<P>
   The other is like a mechanical arm, with six joints that mirror
the movement of a shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. The
``wrist'' part has a couple of joints for full-range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   These robots, which include Lisa and Max, range from about 2.5
feet tall to 6 feet tall and cost up to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   And they can do a slew of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as your hand, you can pick up a cup or you can
sew. You can teach it to do very simple things or you can teach it
to do complex assembly,'' said Jim Brinegar, Motoman's customer
satisfaction supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Crafty programmers taught Max and Lisa to work together to show
off their skills during trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Max will lift up a pallet and Lisa will promptly draw a picture
of herself. They also can goof off _ when programmed to do so, the
two will play take away with a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa always wins, she always wins,'' Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   On the more practical side, robots play a critical role in the
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even people wearing clean suits, like those folks dancing around
in the Intel commercials, pose a risk of contaminating the highly
sensitive silicon wafers used to make chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically taboo to handle wafers,'' said Darren McDougal,
international field operations manager for SpeedFam International
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   SpeedFam, which neighbors Motoman in Chandler, uses robots in
most of the polishing equipment that it makes for the semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, robots are extremely clean and have a greatly
reduced chance of tainting the chips.
</P>
<P>
   Some have only one particulate, which can be a speck of dust,
moisture or anything else, per cubic foot, while an operating room
has 1,000 particulates per cubic foot.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about tidy, some robots will even wash their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical arms will take a wafer from one kind of chemical
solution and dip its hands in highly purified water before touching
another chemical bath.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, robots will do much more. They will use laser
optics and specialized cameras to ``see'' and sophisticated
microprocessors to ``think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to surface right now. We have some very
sophisticated vision guided applications out there and some
rudimentary artificial intelligence systems,'' Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   There will soon be a day when a robot will see a part and
decided if it's good or bad. It will know if a product is assembled
right and if not, what adjustments are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Adkins doubts there will be a day when robots will put us
all out of work, comparing it to the fear people felt when the
automobile first threatened to replace the buggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robots allow you to be able to do mundane jobs and do it
better, faster and correct,'' he said. &QL;

SHORT THEATER NOTES ON STAGE AND OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks after dismissing the artistic staff of ``Elaborate
Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' producers at Disney have reportedly
selected a new creative team. The newcomers are expected to make
big changes in the troubled musical.
</P>
<P>
   A senior production executive who spoke only on condition of
anonymity said this week that Robert Falls, artistic director of
the Goodman Theater in Chicago, would replace Robert Jess Roth as
director, and Bob Crowley would take over the set and costume
designs. For choreography, the producers have tapped Wayne Cilento,
who won a Tony for ``Tommy'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Katz will stay on as the lighting designer. The music by
Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice will remain, as will the book by
Linda Woolverton. Disney declined to comment on its plans for
``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has poured more than $10 million into the show,
which had a rough tryout this fall in Atlanta. It was dogged by
jokes about its cartoonish look and its central set piece, a giant
mechanical pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The new choices suggest a shift of focus from the glitzy
spectacle exemplified by ``Beauty and the Beast,'' which Roth
directed, toward the more high-minded charms of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls, for example, has never directed a Broadway musical but
has been hailed for his surreal, cerebral take on Arthur Miller's
``Death of a Salesman,'' which will open on Broadway in February.
Crowley is also hot, with his lushly elegant scenic design for last
summer's ``Twelfth Night'' at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the new team will also face high expectations and tough
decisions. Will Falls, for example, add the same artistic gravitas
to ``Aida'' that the director Julie Taymor did to ``The Lion
King''? Will Crowley keep the show's finicky and expensive pyramid
in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something quite deep and wonderful there,''
Falls said. ``I think it's a serious work _ certainly entertaining,
but also a love story set against an epic landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The new team is expected to begin work on the show in New York
after Falls completes the transfer of ``Salesman'' to Broadway
</P>
<P>
   The target date for a Broadway run has been pushed back a year,
to the spring of 2000. A scheduled out-of-town run is likely next
fall, probably in Chicago. And a new title, possibly shorter, is an
option. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several other shows are also facing changes.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, Wendy Makkena will be bowing out of ``Side Man,''
probably next month. The reason is a happy one: she's pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Her replacement in the role of the narrator's mother is expected
to be named soon. Producers are said to be looking at two familiar
faces: Edie Falco, who originated the role last year, and Angelica
Torn, who plays Patsy, the flirty waitress in the show, and has
filled in for Ms. Makkena several times.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, at the white-trash thriller ``Killer Joe,'' Amanda
Plummer, who plays a semi-demented stepmother, and Scott Glenn, who
is the show's lecherous gun for hire, are to leave on Jan. 17. The
producer, Darren Lee Cole, said he hoped to recast by next week.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Off Broadway shows are having unexpected delays. At
New York Theater Workshop, the actress Jenny Bacon broke her foot
onstage on Saturday night during a performance of Paul Rudnick's
``Most Fabulous Story Ever Told.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw her fall, but she just bounced up,'' Rudnick said.
``She was amazing. She got all her laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bacon performed another show before a doctor diagnosed a
serious fracture and prescribed a knee-high cast. Kathryn Meisle
has taken over Ms. Bacon's role, but the show's opening has been
delayed until Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Vineyard Theater, Tristine Skyler has been replaced
by Amelia Campbell in ``Mercy,'' Laura Cahill's play about four
young New Yorkers. That set back the show's opening until Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Vineyard, Betty Buckley, who recently completed a
run as Rose in Paper Mill Playhouse's ``Gypsy,'' in New Jersey, is
signing on to ``The Eros Trilogy,'' the new Nicky Silver play,
which begins performances on Jan. 21. &QL;

   The theater world and the animal kingdom lost one of their own
on Sunday when Zingaro, a longtime performer and the namesake of
Company Zingaro, the French equestrian theater troupe, died after
surgery for colic at a veternarian hospital in New Jersey. The
horse was 17, or about 60 in human years.
</P>
<P>
   Zingaro, a towering black stallion whose name means gypsy,
became ill in mid-October during the company's recent run in
Battery Park City, said Bartabas, the company's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically he was a monster, very powerful,'' Bartabas said.
``But he was very kind, and like an actor, he had a lot of
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Zingaro began acting when he was a foal, making his debut in
1983 in the show ``Cabaret Equus'' in Paris. He always worked
without a rider.
</P>
<P>
   While the recent show, ``Eclipse,'' received tepid reviews,
Zingaro had a knack for upstaging his human counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dunning of The New York Times called Bartabas'
choreography anemic, but she said Zingaro ``settles into a recline
so slowly that one can see every rippling strand of muscle down the
length of his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartabas said Zingaro had no immediate family (``He didn't have
time''), adding: ``He was the foundation of this company, and its
memory.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   _ The deal is done to move ``This Is Our Youth'' by Kenneth
Lonergan to the Minetta Lane Theater on Jan. 8, after it finishes
its run at Second Stage on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corin Redgrave will perform an adaptation of ``De Profundis''
by Oscar Wilde on Monday at the Century Center for the Performing
Arts, 111 East 15th Street. The material should be familiar to
Redgrave, a scion of the Redgrave acting clan; this fall he
finished a run in Plymouth, England, in the title role of ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'' by Moises Kaufman.

ESCAPISM: THE STORY OF HOUDINI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erich Weiss was lucky to have been born in a more innocent time.
Before the turn of the century, he transformed himself into Harry
Houdini and never had the secrets of his famous escapes revealed on
the tacky, magicians-reveal-all television specials so popular now.
</P>
<P>
   When he was manacled and submerged underwater in a giant milk
can, or suspended upside down in a straitjacket over a city street,
the audience held its breath until he set himself free.
</P>
<P>
   As the TNT film ``Houdini'' makes clear, engaging the crowd with
his showman's patter and evoking the specter of his death were
essential parts of Houdini's magic.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who think of him as only a great escape artist may be
surprised to find how strongly Houdini was rooted in vaudeville,
and this uninspired film works best when focusing on the theatrical
aspects of his career. He stumbles before being sealed in the milk
can, every time he does that trick; the stumble heightens the
audience's concern.
</P>
<P>
   But when it addresses his private life, the film becomes wildly
erratic. There is a whirlwind romance and long-lived marriage to a
woman named Bess; that tritely written part of the story is
salvaged by Stacy Edwards' warm, graceful performance.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the film veers from the pedestrian (overblown
dialogue in shouting arguments with his jealous brother) to the
actively bad (Houdini is a tormented soul because his beloved
mother never kissed him).
</P>
<P>
   The film is awkwardly structured as a series of flashbacks,
constantly returning to 1936 and a seance, broadcast live on radio,
in which Bess tries to contact her husband 10 years after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   His early years are handled in the perfunctory style of most
made-for-television biographies. He works in a New York sweatshop;
he meets and quickly marries Bess, an aspiring singer who becomes
his onstage assistant; he is seen doing one of his earliest tricks,
stuffing a hunk of thread and a pile of needles in his mouth and
pulling out a long chain of threaded needles.
</P>
<P>
   George Segal, as the vaudeville impresario Martin Beck, turns up
with a laughably thick German accent but good advice. He tells
Houdini to do stunts so dangerous he'll be dead if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   The film recreates several of his best tricks, and though there
is no question he will escape whatever water-filled chamber he is
tossed into, there are tantalizing hints and revelations about how
he pulled off those feats. The secrets were merely part of it,
though.
</P>
<P>
   With a neurotic need to push himself into ever-more-dangerous
stunts, Houdini was truly death-defying. As Bess explains, ``Few,
even if they knew his secrets, would have the courage or ability to
attempt them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Houdini's theatrics are still so entertaining,
for they keep a viewer going through the many dull patches here. As
Houdini, Johnathon Schaech is wooden, and improves only as the
character ages, acquiring wild, grizzled hair and a fanatical look
in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the script falls apart along with the character. When he
goes on a crusade to expose fake spiritualists who have promised to
connect him to his dead mother, no trick can save the movie from
its cheap psychologizing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime's Intimate Portrait biography series may be the
puffiest of a uniformly puffy genre. But with Saturday's profile of
Gloria Steinem, its 100th episode, the series has finally come up
with a program worth celebrating. Though no less glowing than the
typical installment, this one is more substantial, taking its tone
from the tough-minded, clear-sighted, always articulate Ms.
Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   (Sure, it's easy to call her Ms. now, but only because she once
crusaded for a term as neutral as, making no distinction between
married and unmarried women.)
</P>
<P>
   This richly detailed program takes her from childhood (complete
with family photographs) to a sad girlhood caring for her
emotionally unstable mother, to the years of founding Ms. magazine
and traveling around the country giving feminism a glamorous face.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist Dorothy Pittman Hughes, who often spoke with her on
lecture tours, recalls that while Ms. Steinem famously attracted
attention with her miniskirt and flowing hair, ``Once she got that
attention she just really used it.''
</P>
<P>
   The profile includes vibrant interviews with Ms. Steinem,
friends like Marlo Thomas, and Blair Chotzinoff, the man she was
once engaged to marry and who remains endearingly smitten. Above
all, it is packed with reminders of how much has changed in the 30
years she has been on the public stage.
</P>
<P>
   Just out of college, en route to study in India, Ms. Steinem had
an abortion in London; it cost $500, half her scholarship money. As
she says here about her decision not to marry, ``Looking at the
world, I didn't see very many women who were married and mothers
and free, and were their own selves.'' If you see more of that
today, it is because she helped make it happen. &QL;

U.S. SUPREME COURT TRASHES PRIVACY IN ONE'S HOME

editorial in the Casper Star-Tribune.)

<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court once again chopped a hunk out
of what remains of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against
unreasonable searches and seizures. A 6-3 majority ruled that a
short-term visitor to a home or apartment doesn't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy _ meaning, of course, that neither does the
homeowner or renter.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was told by an informant that two men were
measuring out drugs in a garden apartment. The officer managed to
get a peek in the window through a gap in the blinds, saw what he
believed to be two men bagging cocaine, left and came back with a
warrant to search the premises.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Minnesota Supreme Court which had the case
first, the officer climbed over bushes, crouched down by the
window, and peered into the apartment through a small gap in the
blinds. The state supreme court determined that the officer's
actions violated the Fourth Amendment and threw out the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court disagreed. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the majority. Because the two men
engaged in measuring out cocaine were not overnight guests of the
woman who leased the apartment, they cannot have an expectation of
privacy, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While we understand the government's concern about illegal
drugs, this logic slices the law pretty thin. Transparently thin.
This is clearly jurisprudence aimed at a conclusion. The high court
was not going to let these men free, no matter how the Fourth
Amendment's protections had to be twisted.
</P>
<P>
   If the renter had invited a lover over for an afternoon delight,
would there be no reasonable expectation of privacy? Does that mean
that unless the renter asked the lover to stay overnight, the
renter would not be secure from unreasonable searches? What if you
invite your friends into your home in order to plan a political
campaign to beat an incumbent city councilman, could the police
peek in your windows to spy on what the group was planning?
</P>
<P>
   In trashing a visitor's rightful expectation of privacy from the
outside world, the court trashed the homeowner's right too. This
decision creates bad law, law that puts all of us in jeopardy.

BROOKLYN PLANS `EFFETS DE NEIGE' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on the success of its 1997 blockbuster, ``Monet and the
Mediterranean,'' the Brooklyn Museum of Art announced this week
that it would be the final stop for ``Impressionists in Winter:
Effets de Neige,'' an exhibition of winter scenes by masters like
Monet, Sisley, Pissaro, Renoir, Caillebotte and Gauguin, artists
more readily known for their lush warm-weather landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The show will open in Brooklyn on May 27. It originated at the
Phillips Collection in Washington, where it will remain through
Jan. 3, and it will be at the Fine Arts Museum in San Francisco
from Jan. 30 through May 2.

   ``Impressionists in Winter'' has been a big success so far,
attracting more than a thousand people a day. ``We're obviously
delighted that this will have a New York audience,'' said Jay
Gates, director of the Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem odd to show scenes of winter in late spring,
the chance to generate the kind of record-breaking attendance the
Brooklyn Museum had for ``Monet in the Mediterranean'' (more than
250,000 saw it) was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, curators there are joking that the advertisement for the
show should read ``Chill Out at the Brooklyn Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold L. Lehman, director of the museum, said the season should
not make a difference. ``This is exactly the kind of exhibition for
us to have here,'' he said. ``It's a show with a particular point
of view, not a survey, and brings together for the first time many
really gorgeous paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Included will be Monet's ``Red Cape'' (1871), a snow scene that
shows the artist's wife, Camille, through a window, and
Caillebotte's ``View of Rooftops (Snow)'' (1878), a wintery Paris
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three museums will have a slightly different
selection of paintings, because some lenders do not want their
works to travel. Elizabeth W. Easton, curator of European paintings
at the Brooklyn Museum, who is organizing the exhibition there,
said she hoped it would include 50 to 60 paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show ranges from the early years of Impressionism, when
artists like Monet and Pissaro were painting the same scenes side
by side,'' she said, ``to later works, including Monet's series of
ice flows on the Seine, which were a metaphor for mourning the
death of his wife in 1879.''
</P>
<P>
   Timed tickets will be required for the show, which runs through
Aug. 29. They go on sale on Tuesday by telephone at (877) 946-8379
and on the Internet at www.2btech.com/winter/. Tickets may also be
purchased at the museum, beginning on Jan. 2. &QL;

<P>
   Christie's sale of Old Master drawings in New York on Jan. 28
will include a selection of important works by artists like
Barocci, Rubens, Goya and Lorenzo di Credi.
</P>
<P>
   In past years such high-quality offerings would have been
reserved for the London sales, but the market has been shifting to
New York. As the number of important buyers here has grown, the
auction house has decided to send its best offerings across the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will include a collection of 40 drawings formed by the
Banque Nationale de Paris. Like the British Rail Pension Fund in
London, the bank began buying works of art in 1989 as an
investment, intending to keep them for only 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Its collection, mainly from the Florentine and Roman Mannerist
schools, includes ``The Life of Taddeo Zuccaro'' (circa 1590),
drawn by his brother Federico Zuccaro and made up of 20 drawings
that tell the life of an artist. The series is estimated to sell
for $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sale is Barocci's ``Madonna del Popolo,'' which is
being sold by a family trust set up by David Tunick, the New York
art dealer. It was among the highlights of Christie's landmark 1987
London sale of drawings from the Dukes of Devonshire at Chatsworth,
when a $2.8 million bid made it the highest-priced drawing in the
sale. Christie's now estimates it will sell for $1.9 million to
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Barocci drawing is a study for an altarpiece commissioned by
the Confraternita dei Laici di Santa Maria della Misericordia for a
1576 chapel in Arezzo. It now hangs in the Uffizi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Barocci pictures in America,'' said Francois
Borne, who runs Christie's Old Master drawings department in New
York and London. ``So I hope a museum here will buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sale is a newly rediscovered drawing by Lorenzo di
Credi, ``Drapery Study,'' which comes from an unidentified European
collection. ``The collectors didn't know what it was,'' Borne said.
``When we saw it, we made the attribution.'' Christie's estimates
it will bring $300,000 to $500,000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Constance Wolf, who has been associate director of public
programs at the Whitney Museum of American Art for seven and a half
years, has resigned to become director of the Jewish Museum in San
Francisco. She is the fourth top curator at the Whitney to resign
since Maxwell L. Anderson became the museum's director in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old Jewish Museum, which does not have its own
collection but exhibits and has an education program, is planning a
major expansion. An old power plant adjacent to the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art is to be renovated into a 60,000-square-foot
museum, with construction scheduled for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The architect is Daniel Liebskind, a native of Poland who is
completing an extension to the Jewish Museum in Berlin and has been
chosen to build a modern addition for the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because ``From van Eyck to Bruegel: Early Netherlandish Painting
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' has attracted close to 200,000
visitors since it opened Sept. 22, the show has been extended
through Jan. 17.

YOUNG LIKELY TO HEAL FULLY FROM RARE INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bryant Young's freakish double-bone snap was the
result of a few normal events on the football field that combined
to create a one-in-a-million injury.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, athletic trainers and coaches who have seen the
videotape of the injury Monday night said the conspiracy of
circumstances included:
</P>
<P>
   _ The pressure of Young's 291 pounds pushing down on his right
leg at the end of the play.
</P>
<P>
   _ His cleated foot that dug into the soggy turf at Candlestick
Park and held his lower leg like a vice.
</P>
<P>
   _ A crushing blow at mid-shin, where the shock was absorbed
directly by the two lower leg bones, breaking both the fibula and
the larger tibia.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is rare among all athletes, including football
players. Doctors say they occasionally see the double-bone breaks
of the lower leg among downhill skiers and motorcyclists.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Young, sports medicine specialists say, is
that the bones are cleanly broken and likely to heal fully, though
not necessarily as fast as doctors for the San Francisco 49ers
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a football injury,'' said Dr. James Garrick,
director of the Center for Sports Medicine at St. Francis Medical
Center. ``First of all, you don't see that many fractures in
football. That's because it's the joints (at the knee and ankle)
that usually give. You have to get hit just exactly right.''
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics kept by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, lower leg injuries of all types are fairly uncommon,
at least in college football.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA tracks football injuries at 100 Division I, II and III
schools. Of 1,795 injuries in games last year, 21 percent were knee
injuries, 18 percent were ankle injuries and 14 percent were
shoulder injuries. Lower leg injuries comprised just 4 percent of
the injuries, and the survey's director said most were bone
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee and ankle are joints, and every time the players
move, they're using them as a pivot point,'' said Dr. Randall Dick,
the NCAA's senior assistant director of sports sciences, who
oversees the survey. ``The shoulder is used in blocking and
tackling. It's a point of contact that's going to be at risk on
every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower leg is not a joint so it can't be twisted or
sprained. The only thing that can happen is that it can be bruised
or broken. That's what happened. It's not really as much in play as
the joints are.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick said the only way the tibia or fibula could be snapped is
if the bones are held tightly in place, and exposed to extreme
force. In this case, the force came from teammate and linebacker
Ken Norton Jr.'s helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically you've got two hard things hitting each other,''
Dick said. ``The helmet is going into the shin bone. If the shin
bone is held firm _ if the guy is planted _ really it's just like a
baseball going through a window. One is harder than the other. The
window is static, the baseball is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the arms, the lower legs are one of the few areas on a
football player's body not protected by pads. Trainers said they
have rarely if ever seen football players wear shin pads, like
those worn by soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a 300-pound mass rolling up on you, there's
not much you can do,'' said Dr. Cindy Chang, a physician for
several university teams. ``I don't think there's any type of brace
that could prevent that type of injury. Basically it is a traumatic
injury that happens in the game of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Young's cleats _ which provided critical traction on
a soggy field Monday night _ may have also helped lock his leg in
place just as Norton crashed into him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see if his cleats were very long,''
said Joe Callan, who coached high school football in San Francisco
for 26 years. ``Clearly he planted so hard that his foot stuck in
the ground. There was nowhere for his leg to go but to break.''
</P>
<P>
   Callan said the California Interscholastic Federation limited
the length of cleats a decade ago to help high school football
players avoid injuries, especially knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors see several encouraging signs for Young: He apparently
suffered no ligament damage, and his parallel bone breaks are
clean. If the bones had shattered into several pieces, they would
have been slower to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice things about bone is that it heals
completely,'' said Dr. Gordon Matheson, director of sports medicine
for the Stanford University athletic department. ``When it comes to
ligaments and other soft tissues, they heal by scarring. Bones heal
by completely replacing with normal bone material. There's not a
different kind of scar tissue ... the tissue is exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garrick said the team doctors' prediction that Young's
recovery would take eight or nine months sounds overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibial fractures are notoriously slow to heal,'' Garrick said.
``It's a big bone, and it doesn't have a great blood supply in the
center of it. That usually slows the healing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrick said Young should ease into his recovery: ``He's in a
business that puts an incredible amount of demand on his leg _ it's
not like you and me walking from the parking lot to our offices. If
you want to make a full recovery, you've got to be well-healed and
ideally fully rehabilitated before you even think about playing
again.''

 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The premise was simple enough. Now that I am closer
to my second childhood than to the first one, would I be able to
find any spaces as dark, dank and nurturing as the poolrooms of my
adolescence?
</P>
<P>
   It was in these vaguely disreputable parlors, up stairways or
below street level, that at the age of 15 I found refuge from the
purposefulness of school, from dreams of glory and fears of
failure, and though I probably didn't realize it, from the looming
rituals of sex and courtship. Once you walked into places like the
long defunct one on Burnside Avenue in the Bronx, you were
immediately comforted by the notion that your parents would not be
happy if they knew you were there.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite like running away to join apache dancers in
Marseilles, or visiting a joss house, but the poolroom had an
unmistakable yet acceptable touch of the sinister that was so
alluring back then, when we were in a hurry to grow up and used
forged draft cards to buy beer. We were exploring various sins, and
the pool hall was indeed an academy of more than just billiards.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of the old haunts, the place on Burnside had
cuspidors, brass or chrome bowls on the floor that were also known
as spittoons. Men walked in to take numbers. Almost everybody
smoked and put out the cigarettes on the floor. A lot of people
were passing through before graduating to jobs, college, women, but
some stayed longer. We knew who the lifers were, and we were not
quite sure whether we were impressed or scared by them.
</P>
<P>
   The man who ran the place was a muscular, big-bellied man named
Ralph, who wore a sleeveless undershirt I used to associate with
the actor Burt Lancaster but today would make more sense on the
model Kate Moss. He dispensed wisdom and lore. He would tell us
about wonderful hustles in which sharks who were on the lemonade _
that is, people who were hiding their own true speed by pretending
to play worse than they could _ suckered fishes into high-stakes
games. He would tell us about the guy in thick glasses who
attracted attention by holding out a 10-dollar bill and asking for
change for a 5. He would tell us about the legendary Ralph
Greenleaf, who played in the `30s. I am particularly grateful to
him for repeatedly telling me that I was never going to be any
good, that I had no heart and that all things considered I should
concentrate on my schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   In those days we would visit pool halls in many boroughs,
watching games of eight ball, nine ball, pocket apiece, captivated
by fierce matchups. Downtown, in more ornate places like Julian's
on 14th Street and McGirr's on Times Square, where women, then
known as girls, would rack up the balls at the start of each frame,
we watched games in which losers paid out with thick wads.
</P>
<P>
   And we learned lessons that went beyond applied geometry and
vector analysis to human nature. We learned about who we could
trust a lot and who we should trust less. We realized that some
people who could win when they had nothing riding on the game often
lost when the stakes went up, while others did much better for
money than for fun. We also learned that there were people who used
a lot of English on their stories, and that just because this kind
of thing was fun to listen to, you didn't have to believe all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was then. What about now?
</P>
<P>
   The search centered on Greenwich Village, the East Village and
Chelsea, where the Yellow Pages showed a relatively large
concentration of billiard parlors, though far fewer than there used
to be. The first stop was Fat Cat at 75 Christopher Street, just
off Sheridan Square. It was promisingly subterranean, as cut off
from the world as a mine. But there were patches of Day-Glo light,
two Ping-Pong tables. At two of the eight pool tables being used,
pairs of young women played against each other. At two other tables
men were playing with women on what appeared to be dates. Back in
the '50s, this was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there were no longer any overhead strands of beads
with which one kept score. Raising your stick and moving 3, 4 or
maybe even 10 beads over to mark a run used to be a matter of
delight, accomplished with a flourish. Now, players just rotated a
dial on the end of the table with their thumbs to keep track of the
balls they sank. It's much harder to rub it in this way than by
flicking the overhead markers so that everybody in the place can
see what was what.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no one seemed to bang the heels of their sticks on the
floor to signal appreciation of an opponent's good shot. Finally,
the CDs on the jukebox played all the time. When pool rooms had
spittoons, they did not have jukeboxes. A friend accompanying me on
this exploratory ramble was young enough to advise me that the
music was being performed by the artist formerly known as Prince,
the Fine Young Cannibals and the Eurythmics.
</P>
<P>
   We played eight ball. My stroke had disappeared over the
previous four decades, but I was sure it would come back. I told
myself it was like riding a bicycle. At least I didn't rip the
felt. We played for a while and then wandered over to SoHo
Billiard, off Houston Street at 298 Mulberry St., a ground-floor
establishment with big picture windows.
</P>
<P>
   We asked for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking or non?'' asked the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that is what he asked. I tried to picture Ralph from
Burnside Avenue asking, ``Smoking or non?'' I couldn't do it. It
turned out that the lower pit was the nonsmoking area and the upper
tier was for smokers. Though neither of us smoke, we decided that
in an effort to recapture the days when we went to pool halls in
order to flirt with risk and danger, we would shoot on one of the
upper tables and take our chances with the second-hand smoke. Of
course we were in the minority, as there were seven tables being
used in the non area and only six in smoking. One of those six was
a family group, two moms and two young boys of about 8 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the nonsmoking pit one player, a man who appeared to be of my
cohort, was wearing a derby hat and another sucked on an unlit
cigar. A few others wore suspenders. The suspicion arose that they
may have been lifers, but none of them seemed to be playing well
enough. Perhaps this was a hustlers' convention, in which everyone
was on the lemonade, hiding his own true speed. Probably, they were
just patzers like me.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bar in addition to the music, and among the soft
drinks available was kiwi-flavored soda water. At a nearby table,
one player asked his friend what he could get him from the bar.
``Well, since I am a person of color,'' said the man, taking aim at
the cue ball, ``you can get me a Heineken.''
</P>
<P>
   The surroundings were pleasant, but I thought my stroke would
come back quicker if we found someplace more sinister and less
wholesome. We headed uptown to Julian's Famous Pool Hall at 138 E.
14th St., which in my day had been to pool what the Moulin Rouge
was to the cancan. Surely, there we would find the atmosphere we
craved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Julian's was closed. It was over. The gold lettering on the
second-floor windows showed that before the hall lapsed its owners
had sought to exploit its authenticity in the nostalgia market. The
sign said, ``Photo Shots and Film Location.'' There were other
signs that said ``Warning: Poison,'' presumably to deter potential
trespassers or literate vermin.
</P>
<P>
   We turned northwest, to Broadway Billiards at 10 E. 21st St. It
was quite busy. Men, women, music, no overhead beads. Some people
brought their own cues. There was a bar with television sets
showing sporting events and sports chat. No one seemed to be
escaping from anything. There was a prominent sign that said, ``No
Gambling, No Profinity, No Yelling.'' No one was visibly
disobeying. As in the other spots, people were playing with their
friends, and no strangers came by asking for a game, as was common
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   My game kept improving. I was losing by less. I liked rubbing
the blue chalk on the cue stick. Memories came back. Undone
homework assignments. Wasting hours. Wasting days. We signed off.
Maybe we could still find something a little less tame, though
truthfully, hope was fading.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Chelsea Billiards at 54 W. 21st St., where things
were even more up-market. Some of the tables had beige rather than
green felt. Regulars could store their cue sticks in lockers.
Stylish jackets with the club logo were on sale for $175. But there
were photos of great old pool players, including the legendary
Ralph Greenleaf.
</P>
<P>
   We looked around but did not play, and headed to the last stop,
the Billiard Club at 220 West 19th Street. This was pretty much
like Chelsea Billiards, maybe even more so, with a polished brass
plaque out front that said, ``Established Aug. 1988.'' There were
overhead fans and a lot of neo-old-fashioned wood trim that made it
look like somebody's idea of a gentlemen's club, only this one also
had women. Most of the male players wore ties, though some had
loosened them. Many looked as if they had put in full days of
merging and acquiring and zeroing in on opportunity with their
Bloomberg machines.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if they were all having a good time, but as for me,
I really didn't find what I was looking for.

   In June, a first edition of Galileo's 1610 ``Sidereus Nuncius''
fetched more than $380,000 at a Christie's auction. The amount
surprised observers who were shocked that even an eager collector
with deep pockets might pay that kind of money for the historical
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more surprising is that booksellers Patrick Ames
and John Warnock are offering the same volume for $25.
</P>
<P>
   And buyers won't have to worry about breaking bindings or
tearing delicate pages, because the rare books Ames and Warnock
sell are digital.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock, co-founder and CEO of desktop-publishing-software firm
Adobe Systems, and Ames, former publisher of Adobe Press, the
company's book-publishing arm, joined forces several years ago to
find a digital means of capturing rare books and manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock keeps an extensive private library, so the partners
first aimed their digital cameras at his 350-year-old collection of
Shakespeare's sonnets, creating high-resolution images of the
pocket-sized volume.

   They used Adobe Acrobat software to build an interface with the
electronic archive that allows a user on almost any personal
computer to ``page through'' the Bard's book, zooming in to read
the text or examine the aged paper.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, after years of weekend experimentation, Ames
and Warnock took $2 million of their own money and founded Octavo
in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The startup began to market ``digital rare books'' on CD-ROM in
May _ at prices that would make Christie's collectors choke on
their cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 to $75, frugal bibliophiles can add first-edition works
from authors such as John Milton, Isaac Newton, Andreas Vesalius,
and Benjamin Franklin to their collections.
</P>
<P>
   To compile such a list, Octavo is not only tapping Warnock's
impressive collection, but also signing licensing agreements with
libraries, which receive royalties in exchange for the loan of
valuable volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Octavo's mission, Ames explains, is to conserve rare
works for future generations of readers. In fact, the digital
images that Octavo archives are much higher resolution than today's
technology can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason you would need a higher resolution,'' Ames
says, ``is if you want to look at the molecular structure of the
paper or something.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as possible, Octavo's editorial policy is to photograph
each book ``as it is,'' says Ames. The company makes no attempt to
clean up the warped pages and water stains that have accumulated
over centuries. Indeed, Octavo goes to great lengths to ensure that
what the camera sees is what the customer gets.
</P>
<P>
   A computer cannot recognize the text in the digital images _
they are only graphics files _ so in some editions Octavo embeds
live text invisibly in the files, enabling readers to perform word
searches. Octavo's editors make a separate pass through these text
files just to make sure that the electronic typesetters have left
the typos in. &QL;

   The ``intelligent workplace'' at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pa., has without question the best view on campus.
Built atop an existing building, it commands an almost 360-degree
panorama and, equipped with state-of-the-art office technology, is
an unusually pleasant place to work.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a place with a tough job: to prove that an initial
investment in a ``smart'' facility not only benefits workers but
also saves money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase office is a collaborative effort of Carnegie
Mellon's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics (CBPD) and
the Advanced Building Systems Integration Consortium, made up of
government agencies and manufacturers of building and office
products and systems.
</P>
<P>
   The project tests new technologies and hopes to demonstrate that
these systems together as an integrated whole can result in
significance savings over a building's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got a tough sell. ``People are willing to pay money
for a better car environment, where they spend maybe one or two
hours a day, but collectively they are less willing to spend money
to improve the work environment, where we spend 10 hours a day,''
says CBPD's director, Volker Hartkopf. ``We question that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carnegie Mellon project maximizes use of natural light and
ventilation in the workplace. When the outside temperature and
humidity fall within a certain range, a computer tells building
occupants to open their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's humid in Pittsburgh, but not hot, just warm, and
opened windows are all we need (for ventilation),'' Hartkopf said
one day this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer also controls light redirection louvers outside the
windows. When the windows are closed, water flowing through the
mullions separating the window panes provides heating and cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Ventiliation comes from personal modules at each desk; the units
tap into an air supply under the floor and allow each worker to
control temperature and flow rate _ even to generate masking noise.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the personnel and organizational changes that are
increasingly common in today's workplace, layouts, walls,
electrical wiring and phone lines are all easily reconfigured.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring system, for instance, is a network of consolidation
boxes under removable floor panels; it provides access to every
point in the space within 30 centimeters, and does so for less
money than a conventional wiring system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a company relocating your headquarters, you could
even take the wiring along with you,'' points out research
assistant Sila Berkol.
</P>
<P>
   Berkol points to studies that show that this kind of up-front
investment in a work environment pays for itself over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   Lower energy costs and infrastructural versatility are only part
of the picture: the subsequent reductions in medical insurance
costs and absenteeism and increases in productivity and employee
retention along can be enough. Not to mention the many other less
easily measured benefits that result from a work force that likes
being at work. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Web searches often evoke a two-part reaction. First: Wow, that
was fast! Followed sadly by: But none of this is what I want.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning-quick online searches typically lead Web users into
piles of documents that are, to be kind, of dubious reliability.
Unlike the carefully catalogued stacks in a library, the Web often
appears to be untouched by human judgment.
</P>
<P>
   This chaos has been the price Web users pay for an open system
to which anyone can contribute. But it is an unnecessary price,
says Jon M. Kleinberg, a professor of computer science at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg has devised an approach for sifting the contents of
the Web that could go a long way toward solving what he calls the
Web's ``abundance problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg's technique relies on the premise that despite the
jumbled appearance of the Web, critical thinking is in fact woven
throughout it. Every time a page's creator includes a link to
another site, that is a vote of confidence in the linked-to page.
Thus a rough measure of a site's value can be derived by counting
how many other sites are linked to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is explicitly annotated with precisely the type of
human judgment that we need in order to formulate a notion of
authority.'' says Kleinberg.
</P>
<P>
   But this measure needs to be refined, because if it were used
alone, the Yahoo search directory and the Netscape homepage would
come out near the top every time. ``We need a way to throw those
pages out,'' Kleinberg explains.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Kleinberg applies a second level filtering that
assigns higher value to pages that include lots of links to other
sites that are themselves relevant to the search.
</P>
<P>
   By viewing the Web through its linkages and not merely by key
words, Kleinberg's search algorithm solves another common search
problem.
</P>
<P>
   A conventional Web search on the word ``jaguar,'' for example,
generates an unsorted roster of sites _ most related to the sports
car or to an obsolete computer with the same name. Information on
the jungle cat that inspired these brands, however, is harder to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg's system automatically groups hit lists into
``communities'' of sites that reference one another, in this case
providing a list subdivided by those related to cars, computers and
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg developed the algorithm while at IBM's Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, Calif., which still owns it. For now,
the enhanced searching tool remains experimental, but IBM
researchers are shopping it around to companies that run online
search services, including Alta Vista operator Digital Equipment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread availability is ``inevitable,'' says Prabhakar
Raghavah, manager of computer science principles at IBM Almaden.
``This is a great idea whose time will surely come.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture this: you're an animated whirligig, three spinning tiers
of starfish-like forms, adrift in an arid dreamscape bathed in
pulsating sound. You dance a flirtatious duet with an abstract
creature, traverse a flock of beings behaving madly, break free of
the boundaries of your hilly world.
</P>
<P>
   Across three screens in a space the size of a small multiplex
movie theatre, your computer-generated alter ego leads a playful,
kinetic existence.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to a more familiar reality _ as the next viewer
is handed the Nintendo-style gamepad and with it control over
Rebecca Allen's interactive art installation, ``The Bush Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   This work-in-progress, unveiled in its three-screen format this
summer at SIGGRAPH, the international digital graphics conference,
in Orlando, Fla., combines the traditional West African belief that
the human soul can replicate in an animal in the bush, with
computer technology representing a human on screen as a ghostly
pixel presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to experience a computer-generated bush, a
world that's alive, with familiar, fluid motions and unfamiliar
characters with their own feelings, their own likes and dislikes
influencing their behavior,'' explains Allen, chair of the
department of design at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her ambition required a technological leap beyond standard
computer character animation, in which each movement must be
painstakingly specified; in Allen's work, movement emerges
spontaneously from the interaction of characters' programmed
``personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   To express her vision, Allen recruited computer science and
design students to develop a new programming tool called Emergence.
</P>
<P>
   She describes this software system as ``a behavior scripting
language that lets you set up relationships between artificial life
characters in a real-time, interactive 3-D world generated with
PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Artificial life programs more primitive than hers have already
been used to create crowd scenes in Disney animated feature films.
And a language like Emergence may well be the medium in which
Hollywood's artificial actors of tomorrow are routinely created.
</P>
<P>
   Devising her own virtual palette and brushes is nothing new to
Allen. After graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, she
did graduate work as a member of MIT's Architecture Machine Group
(forerunner to the Media Lab) and has been developing software
tools from scratch for state-of-the-art computer equipment for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Supported in part by a three-year grant from Intel, Emergence
has evolved from a single syntax with commands for ``love'' and
``avoid'' to complex instructions for dozens of character
parameters.
</P>
<P>
   It has also evolved from a single-screen world (which debuted in
October 1997 at Madrid's ``Art Futura'' festival) to a networked
version capable of ultimately supporting eight screens for a
full-immersion environment.
</P>
<P>
   Emergence runs on PCs with Windows NT, but don't expect to see
it used on home systems. The relatively simple version shown at the
Orlando installation involved some 70 different characters, evenly
divided between animal-like figures and ``smart'' plants, and was
generated using the latest, fastest Intel Xeon processor chips,
with two processors per screen (one for graphics and one for
character behaviors).
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Allen has no desire for people to kick back in
their living rooms and ``play'' Emergence. Her professional
experience in the commercial game world has convinced her of the
importance of public installations of digital art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush Soul'' isn't a game; you don't compete for points or
find extra lives,'' she notes. ``This is an experience. It's
crucial for it to be in a public space, where other people can
comment and add a social dimension to viewers' interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she chose to create a world of abstract, rather than
representational, characters, she responds, ``For expressing the
spiritual I wanted a look like (Wassily) Kandinsky, like early
20th-century abstraction. I didn't want my characters'
personalities to be instantly recognizable. I didn't want to make
`The Bush Soul and the Seven Dwarfs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Look for it in a public space near you. Having already been seen
live or on tape in England, Spain, the Netherlands, the United
States and Canada, ``The Bush Soul'' could turn up anywhere. &QL;

   High-tech investors have long considered agriculture to be a
losing proposition, scorning it as a backwater in favor of
fast-growing biotech sectors focused on human health.
</P>
<P>
   But the budding success of the first generation of genetically
engineered crops _ and projections that growth will skyrocket over
the next several years _ is rapidly catching the attention of
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, Burrill &AMP; Co., a San Francisco investment
house, is raising a $100 million war chest earmarked for new
agriculture startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a huge amount of money for ag biotech. There hasn't been
much money going into this sector at all,'' says Roger Wyse, the
former dean of the University of Wisconsin's College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences, who is directing Burrill's investments.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by such corporate giants as Bayer and Hoechst, the
managers of the fund see plenty of opportunity in this underfunded
field.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the interest is clear. Big agricultural
chemical producers like Monsanto and DuPont and seed suppliers like
Pioneer Hi-Bred International have looked into their farmers'
almanacs and concluded that biotech is the future.
</P>
<P>
   The ag giants are already selling seeds for herbicide-resistant
soybeans and insect-fighting corn.
</P>
<P>
   First commercialized several years ago, these genetically
engineered crops are proving to be blockbusters. And the projected
growth numbers are staggering. Analysts predict that biotech crops
will be worth $7 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are now looking for the next batch of genes to further
engineer crops. Research groups are busily developing biotech
plants that will be designed with ``output'' traits to, say, pack
in more protein or more starch.
</P>
<P>
   A third wave of biotech crops is on the drawing board that will
be engineered to produce nutritional supplements or raw materials
for industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
   But fulfilling such dreams is going to take extensive knowledge
of plant genes. Which is where the startups hope to come in. The
sudden influx of venture capital and the promise of more to come is
fueling a slew of new plant biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the startups are borrowing well-tested genomics
techniques (methods for identifying genes and their functions) from
the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, several established biotech
players from the health care arena are already leveraging their
know-how into plant biotech.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-based gene mapping firm Genset has sold rights to its
technology for agricultural applications to a Los Angeles startup
called Ceres. San Francisco's AxyS Pharmaceuticals, a gene and drug
specialist, says it could be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you're going to see a huge number of startups,
probably 20 to 30 new companies,'' says John Ryals, founder and CEO
of Paradigm Genetics, a new plant biotech firm based in Research
Triangle Park, N.C. ``It's a wide-open opportunity right now.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There is a ``substantial risk'' that the world will
plunge into recession next year, according to a gloomy new forecast
from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The sister organization to the International Monetary Fund warns
that sharp stock market falls in the U.S. and Europe, or a
continuing pause in international capital flows, could bring global
growth to a halt in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even taking a more optimistic outlook, the developing countries
face their worst growth prospects since the Third World debt crisis
nearly 20 years ago, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Controversially, the new report also recommends that some
developing countries should restrict or tax ``hot money'' capital
flows to safeguard against future crises.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's chief economist, concludes
that the recent crises reveal fundamental weaknesses in the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a single car has an accident on a bend in the highway,
one might infer something about the driver or his car. But when, at
the same bend, there are accidents day in and day out, the
presumption changes _ there is probably something wrong with the
road,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank welcomes the recent U.S. interest rate cuts and
Japanese fiscal package but calls for further measures to avert a
deep global slump.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a worsening recession in Japan and slower growth in
the U.S. and Europe if share prices suffer a sharp correction make
prospects for 1999 precarious, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
   It forecasts that global growth will nearly halve from 3.2
percent in 1997 to 1.8 percent in 1999, and puts a high probability
on zero growth next year. The crisis-ridden Asian economies are
likely to have seen an 8 percent drop in GDP this year, with no
growth in prospect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries will be hit hardest. Brazil, Indonesia,
Russia and other countries, accounting for a quarter of world
demand, have suffered a decline in GDP per head this year.
</P>
<P>
   The report argues for an expansion in demand, a better social
safety net, and injections of public funds for banking reform in
the crisis countries.
</P>
<P>
   It estimates that the cost will amount to 20 to 30 percent of
their GDP. ``Continuing financial support from the international
community is vital,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes out in favor of restrictions on the more
volatile short-term capital flows in future to reduce the risk of
repeat crises. &QL;

   LONDON _ The Puget Sound, a stretch of water that cuts inland
from the northwest Pacific coast of the United States, is Boeing
country. From Everett in the north, on through Boeing Fields and
downtown Seattle, to Renton at the southern tip of the Puget, the
familiar logo of the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer
dominates the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Seattle has other household names and other big employers
_ Microsoft and Starbucks, the coffee people, come to mind. But
when Boeing sneezes, the Puget shakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it was still reverberating from Boeing's stunning
announcement that it intends to shed 48,000 employees _ a fifth of
its work force _ over the next two years and cut back production
savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has caught a bad dose of the Asian flu and its work force
is paying the price for the collapse in air travel and hence demand
for passenger jets in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects will be felt not just in Puget Sound. Boeing is
a big spender in the U.K. as well, where it buys (pounds sterling)
1.4 billion-worth of supplies a year from 200 component firms
including Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, GEC Marconi and Smiths
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, some 90,000 direct and indirect jobs are said to
depend on Boeing orders.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those job cuts were already in the pipeline.
Nevertheless, the scale of the additional reductions, coupled with
a warning that profits would be $500 million lower next year than
forecast, caught the aerospace industry and Wall Street on the hop.
</P>
<P>
   Production of Boeing's entire model range, with the exception of
the new 100-seater 717, will be cut back. Output of the 747 Jumbo
jet, Boeing's biggest profit earner, will fall from 3.5 a month now
to two in 1999 and just one a month the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the New Generation 737, the workhorse of most
airline fleets, is also being trimmed back by more than 10 percent,
while the 757 and 767 lines will slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian downturn has not yet materialized in cancelled,
delayed or deferred orders. In fact Boeing has lost just three
orders in the region so far _ and that followed the collapse of
Philippines Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide deliveries this year are on target to reach 550 and
are forecast to increase to 620 next year. Boeing expects to
deliver all 84 aircraft on order from Asian airlines in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the market falls off a cliff. Harry
Stonecipher, Boeing's chief operating officer, said Wednesday:
``Options are not being exercised and there is zero market growth.
It is not a pretty picture, nor is it improving. We think this
situation will take between two and five years to work through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Not everyone in the aviation industry is convinced by Boeing's
explanation. Over the last decade, the work force at Seattle has
gone up and down like a fiddler's elbow _ more because of Boeing's
inability to match production capacity to customer demand than
because of any collapse in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The last big jobs cull took place in the early 1990s when the
work force was trimmed by 20 percent. But just as Seattle was
recovering from that, Boeing unveiled a hugely ambitious program to
double production and, until last year, it was taking on workers at
the rate of 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boeing hit the buffers in late 1997 when it had to cut back
production of the New Generation 737 because of acute bottlenecks
on its assembly lines. The resulting financial mayhem and penalty
payments to airlines drove the company into its first loss in five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A rival aerospace executive said: ``When I heard the news from
Seattle I could not believe it. Boeing is blaming the Asian crisis
for its troubles but the reality is that it has been too greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug McVitie, managing director of the Arran Aerospace aviation
consultancy, agrees: ``I'm not sure all of this can go down to the
situation in Asia. They overstretched themselves and left very
little margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's problems are compounded by the fact that it is losing
market share to its European rival Airbus Industrie, in which
British Aerospace has a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Toulouse-based consortium has scooped half the
market for new orders, which explains its air of confidence and
rapidly growing production lines. Airbus has increased production
by 25 percent this year to 230 aircraft and expects to raise output
to 290 aircraft in 1999 and 320 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Airbus forecasts that the world's airlines will require
13,600 new aircraft of 70 seats or more over the next 20 years,
worth a total of $1,200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian market is important. It accounts for 20 percent of
world airline traffic and is forecast to grow at a faster rate than
any other part of the world except for China in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Adam Brown, vice-president of forecasting and strategic
planning at Airbus, thinks the impact of the Asian crisis has been
overdone. He estimates that the areas of Asia that are in decline
represent only 7 percent of the world airline market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If air travel in all these areas were to come to a complete
standstill for a year, total world air traffic would show hardly
any decline at all. Also, despite the severe short-term problems
facing the Asian airlines, the fundamentals underlying the region's
great potential for sustained long-term economic growth remain
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be some months before Boeing's U.K. suppliers feel the
full backdraft from the cutbacks in Seattle. Meanwhile, at least
there is the consultation of knowing that Boeing's loss is Airbus
Industrie's gain. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time for holiday shopping. Why not first stop at a
bookstore and give yourself a treat? This is a good season to catch
up on reading. It's also good for rambling around the neighborhood
of a writer many readers are only now beginning to catch up with:
the brilliant social satirist Dawn Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Her glittering novels, especially those set in New York, offer a
rare opportunity to reflect on the dependence of cities and books
for mutual survival. Take home a stack. You'll thank me.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who died in 1965, would have been 102 years old on Nov.
28. This is a shocking milestone, for Powell's voice is among the
freshest in contemporary letters. Her writing flourished in the
1940s and '50s, but only recently has she begun to receive her full
due. The campaign to rescue Powell from oblivion was begun by Gore
Vidal and led by Tim Page, the chief music critic for The
Washington Post, author of a new biography on Powell and a former
music critic for The New York Times. It has been a miracle of
modern literary life.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of Powell's 15 novels are in print, more than at any
point in her stressed-out lifetime. Published by Steerforth Press,
the handsome paperback editions feature atmospheric New York
cityscapes bordered with dusky, metallic colors. The voice that
emerges from those covers is as sharp as their design. Powell's
tone is comic but her themes are profound. Collectively, her books
paint a panorama of the energies a great city marshals to corrode
as well as nurture people's dreams. They also attest to one woman's
triumph over dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why anyone in New York worries about good
neighborhoods,'' she said. ``They never see their neighbors anyway
so it might as well be a bad neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``A Time to Be Born'' by Dawn Powell (1942)
</P>
<P>
   A native of Ohio, Powell spent most of her life in Greenwich
Village. In a letter to a friend in the late 1950s, Powell writes
about a niece who came to New York but declined her aunt's
invitation to visit because it would have conflicted with a
scheduled tour of the Village. ``I was so startled to think I
almost prevented them from seeing mysterious Greenwich Village that
I didn't think to say, as an acquaintance suggested, `But dearie,
your Auntie Dawn IS Greenwich Village.'''
</P>
<P>
   Powell may exaggerate, but her unspoken retort was not an
overstatement. Late in her life, The New York Times Magazine
published a picture of Powell in a local antiques store. Life
magazine posed her in some Village coffeehouses for an article that
never ran. And her books offer the most luminous portrayal of life
downtown in the era between Edna St. Vincent Millay and the
Stonewall uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Village has changed dramatically since Powell's death. Rents
have skyrocketed. The Loews movie theater on Greenwich Avenue, the
Women's House of Detention, the Brevoort Hotel and other landmarks
are barely memories. Bohemia dispersed long ago to the East
Village, Soho, Tribeca and beyond. Most catastrophically, the
bookstores that once lined Eighth Street and Fourth Avenue have
dwindled to a small fraction of their former number.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thanks to preservation laws that did not exist in
Powell's day, much of the neighborhood's physical character remains
intact. Blocks of low-rise buildings let in lots of sky. West of
Avenue of the Americas, the Manhattan grid remains happily
scrambled. West Fourth Street still crosses West 10th Street. Most
of the buildings Powell lived in still stand. And the place retains
its image as a refuge from social conventions and constraints.
Powell's novels and the city illuminate each other: the desire for
refuge is a pivotal idea in her writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be some place along the route, a halfway house in
time where the runners may pause and ask themselves why they run,
what is the prize and is it the prize they really want,'' Powell
reflects in her novel ``The Wicked Pavilion.'' ``What became of
Beauty? Where went Love? There must be havens where they may at
least be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich Village offered Powell refuge but not security.
Perhaps she didn't want that. She wasn't a stranger to comfort.
From the early 1940s through the mid-'50s, she occupied a duplex in
a doorman building on a good block of 10th Street, complete with a
top-floor maid's room that she used as a writing studio.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not one for putting down roots. Her diary is
peppered with periodic descriptions of moves from one apartment to
the next, and this nomadism corresponded to something in her
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, she wrote in her diary: ``Homes are bad places. Either
they are so comfortable that no other place else could offer as
much sheer convenience, yet psychic and family connections are such
that you can never enjoy these comforts _ this cozy study filled
with invisible foes, interruptions, responsibilities, worry,
hatred. Or else you have no comfortable place in your home to work
and in spite of privacy and other ideal personal relations are
unable to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   She thought of herself as ``a permanent visitor'' in New York.
``My Home Is Far Away,'' the title of one of her most
autobiographical novels, conveyed a perpetual desire for
displacement. To write, she would sometimes hole up at seaside
hotels, like the Traymore in Atlantic City, N.J., or the Half Moon
in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Summers were often spent in a tumbledown
cottage on Long Island's North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Powell could be romantic about squalor. In ``The Wicked
Pavilion,'' she tracks one of her characters as he makes a
nocturnal visit to a dilapidated house way out in Queens (she had
College Point in mind) that he had shared years before with two
pals who were seeking their private Bohemia, a simulation of Left
Bank Paris. Here, isolated from worldly distractions, the trio
devoted themselves to art.
</P>
<P>
   Powell never lived in College Point, but a few years after the
publication of this book she found herself virtually homeless. In
1958, when her building went co-op, Powell and her husband, Joseph
Gousha, had to give up their apartment. Powell was in her early
60s. Her husband, an advertising executive, had recently retired.
For two years, the couple lived in sublets and cheap hotels.
Possessions went into King Arthur Express Storage. Mostly books,
plus: ``One hall desk, oak. Doll head in carton and dolls.
Secretary desk. Three straight chairs. One large dirty rug. Three
small dirty rugs.''
</P>
<P>
   When her husband became mortally ill, Powell found an airless
flat with a deceptively impressive Fifth Avenue address. Later,
with financial help from a friend, Powell moved into a penthouse
apartment in a prewar high-rise on the corner of Christopher and
Bleecker Streets. (I briefly sublet this place in the late 1970s,
long before I'd heard of Dawn Powell.) The elegant reprise was
short-lived. Two years after she moved in, Powell was interred in a
mass grave on Hart Island, New York's potters field.

 &HT;    ARE HIGH-TECH EXECUTIVES COOL, OR JUST COLD?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Saturday, Dec. 5.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the giant TV screen at the Microsoft antitrust
trial Wednesday, chairman Bill Gates was shown denying knowledge of
a potentially devastating lawsuit by Sun Microsystems Inc. _ even
though he'd written that Sun's Java programming language ``scares
the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a Sun executive took the stand to downplay and chuckle at
e-mail and other evidence that Sun employees wanted to use Java as
``a way to attack the evil empire'' of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The double-speak at the trial exposes the underbelly of an
industry whose executives cultivate a super-cool, super-casual
image. Even as they publicly seek partnerships to create the next
``killer app,'' privately the executives are at their keyboards,
tapping away at strategies to wipe out each other's latest
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may wear jeans and T-shirts,'' said William Kovacic, a
visiting law professor at George Washington University in
Washington. ``But they've got knives in their belts, guns under
their shirts and brass knuckles on their fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration and competition are intertwined in the emerging
high-tech industry. Microsoft, for example, may dominate 90 percent
of the operating-system market, but it still must work with
independent software developers if it wants them to write programs
to run on new products.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer Co. may compete with Microsoft by selling its own
operating system, Mac OS, but it has to team up with the software
giant to market popular software such as a Mac Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real convergence,'' said Frederic H. Dickson,
director of research at Branch, Cabell &AMP; Co., a Richmond, Va.-based
brokerage firm. ``No one knows what the final solution will look
like, ...not the chip-makers, software developers or the hardware
guys. So they've got to collaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial has revealed, however, these collaborations don't
always stay friendly. In 1994, for example, Netscape Communications
Corp.'s co-founder James Clark e-mailed a Microsoft official, ``We
want to make this company a success, but not at Microsoft's
expense. We'd like to work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1996, the relationship had soured, according to America
Online Inc. executives, who traded e-mails about a Gates offer:
``Gates delivered an uncharacteristically blunt query: 'How much do
we have to pay you to screw Netscape? This is your lucky day.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in recent years, AOL, Netscape and Sun each have played
footsie with Microsoft, teaming up on projects ranging from AOL's
use of Microsoft's Internet browser to talk that Microsoft might
invest in Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this month, the trio sprung news of their own collaboration:
AOL announced a $4.3-billion deal to buy Netscape that includes a
three-year agreement under which Sun will market Netscape's
business software. The alliance is considered the greatest threat
yet to Microsoft's operating monopoly, as well as to corner the
booming e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like everybody against Microsoft, `` said
Robert Litan, a Brookings Institution scholar and former Justice
Department official. ``But there's still a lot of jockeying going
on.''

   Perhaps most surprising in this world of former nerds is the
crude language that conjures up images of gangsters.

   Apple senior executive Avadis Tevanian Jr., testifying in
November at the antitrust trial about perceived threats by
Microsoft to force Apple to abandon its Quicktime software to play
back video clips, described a lunchtime exchange between a Sun
executive and a Microsoft official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you asking us to kill playback? Are you asking us to knife
the baby?'' asked the incredulous Sun executive. ``Yes,'' the
Microsoft official responded. ``We want you to knife the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Business scholars say these colorful exchanges, in conversations
and e-mail messages, also indicate that industry leaders may not be
as savvy as they pretend to be.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1995, for example, AOL and Netscape wanted to unite
against mighty Microsoft. AOL Chairman Steve Case referred to the
Redmond, Wash., software giant company as ``the common enemy,'' and
agreed with Netscape co-founder Marc Andreesen's assessment that
both companies should ``resist the Beast from Redmond that wants to
see us both dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Netscape wasn't able to strike a deal with AOL to exclude
Microsoft, even though Case clearly was sympathetic to their
position. In the end, AOL decided to include Microsoft's Internet
browser on its site.

   ``This industry likes to paint itself as the omnipresence of
genius where you've got boy wonders becoming billionaires,'' said
Kovacic. ``But we're seeing that some of these people have no more
insight than the guy selling mufflers.''

<P>
   Some financial analysts fear the public airing of the industry's
dirty laundry will make executives wary that future partners will
disclose private negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not completely stifle innovation,'' said John J.
Puricelli, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, a St. Louis-based
brokerage house. ``But it could slow it.''

   _ From ``The Wicked Pavilion'' (1954)
</P>
<P>
   Powell hardly lived as a hermit. She and Gousha spent much of
their time and income dining out, and it showed. Powell was plump.
But she relished the social spectacle far more than the food. In
her diary, she seldom raves about dishes. Instead, there are
snippets like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``November 3, 1952. Ethel regarded her first drink politely,
allowing it to simmer before her for several minutes, as if it was
merely a formality like a service plate to be taken away untouched
when something she really wished would be served. However, just as
the other ladies were ordering a second round she suddenly dashed
off her potion in one gulp and by dinner time was quite as tight as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Wicked Pavilion,'' Powell wrote a whole book about a
restaurant. The Cafe Julien, a kind of Grand Central for the book's
characters, is based on Powell's favorite hangout, the Cafe
Lafayette, on the ground floor of a hotel that was on University
Place between Eighth and Ninth Streets. Reginald Marsh painted a
picture of the place to illustrate the jacket of the book's first
edition. Remember cafe curtains?
</P>
<P>
   The Lafayette was the haven's haven, a mixture of new and
familiar faces where Powell found provisional stability amid urban
flux. The cafe turned out to be nearly as impermanent as a dust
jacket. The hotel was torn down in the 1950s to make way for a
concrete apartment block, the ugly Brevoort East.
</P>
<P>
   To read about the other restaurants Powell frequented is to
return to a time before American cooking became inventive. For
culinary adventure, you ate Italian, Chinese, Spanish and so on.
You can taste the period's flavor at Powell's surviving Village
haunts, places like El Faro, at Horatio and Greenwich Streets, and
Grand Ticino on Thompson Street. At the Ticino, writers used to
stow their manuscripts in shelves that still hang above the tables.
</P>
<P>
   For fancy nights out, Powell and Gousha headed uptown _ to the
Rainbow Room, the 21 Club, Tavern on the Green or the St. Regis
Hotel. But if I were giving a dinner in Powell's honor, I might
hold it at Grange Hall. The restaurant wasn't around in her day,
but it has an archetypal Village location. The heartland cuisine
recalls Powell's Ohio childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the best way to revisit Powell's New York would be to
drop by Chumley's, a former speak-easy with a still unmarked door,
guzzle two or three gin martinis in quick succession, and rush out
into the streets before the buzz wears off. Any city can look
magical when you're bombed, as Powell, Gousha and their friends
often were. Considering how much alcohol they consumed, it's
amazing that Powell was so productive.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fair to say that the city looks after drunks. If she'd
moved to the country, like Jackson Pollock, she might well have run
into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was not a secret drinker, nor did she condemn the usual
vices. In her diary, she deplores ``the hypocrisy of blaming X's
downfall on alcohol, women and social climbing, when these were
precisely the things that enabled him to become a success in the
first place.'' Viewed from our present puritanical perspective, she
and her pals seem enviably free from guilt or shame.
</P>
<P>
   But some reviewers were put off by Powell's reluctance to be a
moral judge. What Vidal termed her Petronian neutrality was often
taken as cynicism. Powell professed surprise at this reaction. She
believed she was defending love and beauty from the forces arrayed
against them: arrogance, betrayal and competitiveness, to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   September 29, 1959. The Coney Island Sunday Crowd around
Washington Square . . . Girls carrying on fight. One walking ahead.
Other shouts ``I tell you I'm sick _ I don't feel good _ I'm
sick.'' The other one pushes on. ``Okay, you're sick. Eat a
hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``The Diaries of Dawn Powell: 1931-1965''
</P>
<P>
   If there's to be a commemorative plaque, Page suggests it should
be placed at 106 Perry St. Powell wrote or began several of her
best novels there. But I propose that they rename the Washington
Square Arch in her honor. The Dawn Powell Arch. She was very fond
of this City Beautiful souvenir. On walks, she would stroll down to
the arch, take in the light and eavesdrop on conversations. Then
she might walk back along Eighth Street, perhaps stopping for a
milkshake before she returned home and poured the day's first
drink.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the Dawn Powell revival is driven by something more
than the pleasure of discovering a forgotten first-rate writer.
There is also the fear that the city she wrote about won't be
around much longer in a form Powell would recognize, i.e., a New
York that can't sustain writers capable of chronicling it. In the
essay that sparked the revival, published in 1987 in The New York
Review of Books, Vidal already delivers last rites.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to agree with Vidal when you walk around the Village
today and note the scarcity of bookstores. Of the few that remain,
only Three Lives &AMP; Company (another spot that opened well after
Powell's death) projects a proper bibliophilic fervor. It's
fabulous that we'll soon be able to download books into palm-size
computers, but the experience won't be the same as letting your
eyes graze over the covers of books that a literate manager has
arranged in a shop window.
</P>
<P>
   The physicality of Powell's books is as eloquent as a
skyscraper. A shelf of them is a skyline. They are palpable
tributes to the towering city of work. The diaries document this
repeatedly: Powell goes out into the streets, into bars, theaters
and other people's houses, returns home with images, chunks of
dialogue, fashions them into a city on the page, sends her
portrayal back into the world, awaits reviews, musters her spirits
against disappointing sales, meditates on her unpopularity, sallies
forth and begins again. The process was itself a magic wheel
turning, each spin animating city and author alike.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's diaries offer written proof that the city was never
comfortable for writers, and perhaps shouldn't be. A self-created
observer, Powell did not oppose change. In her last novel, ``The
Golden Spur,'' a young man, savoring his first day in New York,
stands on a sidewalk and watches wreckers pull down an old
department store. He asks the gentleman beside him why the event
has drawn such a big crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The man replies: `` `In the first place, this was a splendid old
landmark and people like to see the old order blown up. Then there
is the glorious dirt and uproar which are the vitamins of New York,
and of course the secret hope that the street will cave in and
swallow us all up.'
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan looked down uneasily at the boards underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   `Dear old Wanamaker's.' His companion sighed. `If I had paid
their nasty little bill, perhaps they would never have come to
this. Well, mustn't get sentimental.' ''

 UNDATED: get sentimental.' ''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a selection of sites in Dawn Powell's beloved
Greenwich Village where she lived, wrote, strolled and cavorted.
</P>
<P>
   1. EL FARO, 823 Greenwich St., at Horatio Street. When Powell
ate here in the 1940s, exotic food consisted of Spanish, Italian
and Chinese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   2. 106 PERRY ST. Powell wrote or began several of her best
novels at this address, where she lived from 1926 to 1934.
</P>
<P>
   3. 95 CHRISTOPHER ST. Powell's last residence, 1963 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   4. CHUMLEY'S, 86 Bedford St. (between Bleecker Street and
Seventh Avenue). A former speakeasy and watering hole for thirsty
spirits in Powell's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   5. GRANGE HALL, 50 Commerce St., at Barrow Street. Although not
around during Powell's time, this dining place, in a peekaboo
cul-de-sac, evokes the mood of Bohemian Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   6. GRAND TICINO, 228 Thompson St. A onetime literary haunt where
hungry writers parked their manuscripts in shelves that still hang
above the tables.
</P>
<P>
   7. WASHINGTON SQUARE ARCH. A favorite Powell site where she
would eavesdrop on the chatter of the city.
</P>
<P>
   8. CAFE LAFAYETTE (demolished), University Place between Eighth
and Ninth Streets (currently site of the Brevoort East apartment
building). A hangout where the author held court and which she
called the Cafe Julien in her fiction.
</P>
<P>
   9. 35 E. NINTH ST. Powell wrote some of her most powerful novels
during her sojourn here from 1942 to 1958.
</P>
<P>
   10. 9 E. 10TH ST. Powell's home from 1934 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   11. THREE LIVES &AMP; COMPANY BOOKSTORE, 154 W. 10th St. Although
Powell died before this bookshop opened, it projects the ambiance
of a time when the area around Eighth Street and Fourth Avenue was
a mecca for small bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   12 43 FIFTH AVE., at 11th Street. Despite the impressive
address, Powell lived in an airless flat here from 1960 to 1963.

`SHATTERED IMAGE': DOUBLE IDENTITIES, LUSH SCORE, FALLING BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an experimental filmmaker abruptly goes mainstream, it can
be something of a shock. And when that breakthrough turns out to be
an entertainingly pulpy dilution of the same themes that have
obsessed the director for decades, one is almost tempted to
question the seriousness of the work that came before.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Shattered Image,'' the first American movie by Raul
Ruiz, the Chilean-born, Paris-based director who has long been a
favorite on the film festival circuit, leaves an ambiguous
impression. The movie, which aggressively parodies the Alfred
Hitchcock of ``Vertigo'' and ``Marnie,'' may be a tongue-in-cheek
spoof. Or it could be an homage. Ruiz probably wanted it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shattered Image,'' like a number of Ruiz's earlier films,
explores the multiple identities of characters who might be
figments of each other's imaginations or might be people leading
parallel lives. When we first meet the film's central character
Jessie (Anne Parillaud), she is a gaunt, raven-haired gamine
dressed in black who lures a man into a bathroom stall in a chic
Seattle cafe and shoots him to death.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later Jessie is jolted awake. She has fallen asleep on
the plane to Jamaica where she and her new husband, Brian (William
Baldwin), are spending their honeymoon. The just-married Jessie is
auburn-haired, trembling and fearful. When the couple step out of
the plane, the half-familiar face of a strange man waiting at the
airport galvanizes her with a flash of acute paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   That honeymoon threatens to be ruined by Jessie's conviction
that the same man who once attacked her and left her so traumatized
that she attempted suicide, has followed her all the way to the
Caribbean. The movie continually switches back and forth between
the frightened new wife and her homicidal Seattle alter ego, a
professional killer who stashes the newspaper clippings of her
unsolved crimes in the suitcase that contains her deadly arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie goes along, the two Jessies' lives become a series
of interlocking dreams, as one keeps waking up into the life of the
other. Underlining the surrealism is the ever-changing content of a
painting on the wall of the couple's hotel room. The two Jessies'
love lives also have disturbing similarities. Moments after the
homicidal Jessie has sex with a stranger in an empty gallery at a
Seattle aquarium, the film views the honeymooners making love
through a fish tank.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters who appear in Jamaica have alter egos in
Seattle. The most sinister is Paula (Lisanne Falk), a cold, slinky
blonde who is staying in the same hotel and whom Jessie begins to
suspect of conspiring with Brian either to murder her or to drive
her mad. Some scenes seem built around old-movie references:
everything from ``The Lady From Shanghai'' to ``Midnight Lace.''
Gluing them together and enhancing the Hitchcockian mood is a lush
cut-rate imitation of a Bernard Herrmann film score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shattered Image'' might have achieved a dark romantic
eloquence had its screenplay, by Duane Poole, invested its stock
characters with personalities that transcended their classic
Hollywood prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   But Poole, who used to write and produce television movies for
Aaron Spelling, can't do any better by his characters than have
them speak in flat melodramatic cliches. If Ms. Parillaud and
Baldwin share a voluptuous screen chemistry, Ms. Parillaud's mousy
voice and thick French accent rob her performance of some crucial
magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   As romantic screen couples go, they're in the same league with
Cliff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold from Brian DePalma's
``Obsession,'' a movie that was even more in love with Hitchcock
than this one.
</P>

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After World War II, Jewish citizens who had survived the war by
hiding in forests returned to Poland. There they found their homes
destroyed, synagogues burned and their businesses taken over by the
government.
 &HT;    They were told that their families had all been killed or lost
in Siberia.
 &HT;    What were Polish Jews doing in Siberia, you may wonder? Early in
the war, the German-Russian pact gave Polish Jews a choice of
remaining Polish citizens under Russian rule or becoming new
Russian citizens. Those who decided to remain Polish citizens were
quickly sent by the Russian government to the far-away lands of
Birobidzhan and Siberia.
 &HT;    By being sent to these far-away lands they were inadvertently
saved. But when the war ended, the Russians would not allow Polish
Jews to leave Russia.
 &HT;    I, however, know of one Jew who escaped. It's an unbelievable
story.
 &HT;    During the war a group of Polish partisans had broken out of the
Nazi war camps. These partisans consisted of a few Jews and former
Polish officers. They organized a resistance force that used to
harass the German army.
 &HT;    On one of their missions an old rabbi was found starving. He had
been left for dead by the Nazis. One of the Catholic partisans took
mercy on the man and nursed him back to health. The rabbi was given
the job of cooking and praying for the safety of the fighting men.
Strangely, for the rest of the war this group of partisans suffered
few casualties.
 &HT;    When the war was over the group broke up. Some went back to
Poland; others traveled to Latvia. Others became wandering people
with no homeland.
 &HT;    As the Russian government clamped down on the people, depriving
them of their freedom, the group decided to flee. A plan was made
to leave the Russian territories by night.
 &HT;    An informant told the partisans, ``You must cross the river in
the winter when it's iced. When you reach the other side of the
river you'll be entering no-man's land. There you will find a hut.
This hut is used by a lone Russian soldier who is in charge of
preventing border crossings by all unauthorized people. His job is
to shoot at anything moving.
 &HT;    ``However, at 1 o'clock in the morning he leaves his hut and
walks a few miles to the next hut, where he meets another soldier.
There the soldiers exchange reports and supplies. Then he returns
to his watch. The complete trip takes him approximately two hours.
 &HT;    ``During the time he is gone, you can warm yourselves in his
hut, but you must be out of there by the time he returns.''
 &HT;    This group of brave men consisted mostly of younger people. The
older ones had decided to remain behind in the Russian territories,
giving up hope. The only old man willing to travel was the rabbi.
 &HT;    A heated argument broke out. ``Let's leave him,'' said one. ``He
can find food in one of the towns. We really do not need to be
slowed down by an old, frail man. We have done our share.''
 &HT;    A religious Christian partisan exclaimed, ``If we leave him, we
are all doomed. I will not leave without him.''
 &HT;    Reluctantly they included the rabbi. It was the most miserable,
snowy night you could imagine. A blizzard came roaring in. Sure
enough, the leader was correct. The old man could not keep up with
the rigorous climbing and running.
 &HT;    The blizzard increased and more than once they had to stop to
carry the old rabbi. As light as he was, he now was a big burden,
slowing down the entire group. More than once, they would argue if
they should leave him behind.
 &HT;    It was almost one o'clock in the morning when they reached the
hut, half buried in the snow. They could smell the fire and warmth
coming from within. They waited and waited for the soldier to
leave. It seemed like forever.
 &HT;    Finally, the soldier left. Almost frozen to death, the group
fell into the hut, each trying to get their icy hands and
frostbitten feet closer to the fire.
 &HT;    The old rabbi moved away from the group. He opened a small bag
and took out a rusty menorah. Then he took a small piece of string,
or cotton, rolled it into a wick and proceeded to fill the menorah
with some grease or oil that he somehow had with him in a small
bottle.
 &HT;    The very act of what was taking place put everyone into a
trance. Not a word was uttered, nor could a sound be heard. In a
spell, everyone watched what the rabbi did.
 &HT;    In a barely audible voice the rabbi began the blessings for the
lighting of the menorah. Then, incredibly, he picked up the
menorah, placed it by the window of the hut, lit the menorah and
began to sing an old Jewish song, ``Rock of Ages,'' which speaks of
God's miracles for his people.
 &HT;    The leader jumped out of his stupor and yelled, ``Put out the
light. You will bring the Russian soldier. Soon we will all be
caught and shot.''
 &HT;    The rabbi tried to explain that it was the first night of
Chanukah and that he had kindled the light in order to keep the
commandment of remembering the miracle of Chanukah. ``No,'' said
the rabbi. He would not extinguish the flame. ``It must burn
one-half hour. This is according to the ancient Hebrew law.''
 &HT;    Suddenly the door of the hut was flung open. A tall Russian
soldier holding a tommygun yelled at the startled group to put
their hands in the air.
 &HT;    The soldier approached the old rabbi, looked at the menorah, and
said to him in Russian, ``I, too, am a Jew. I have not seen a
menorah for six years.'' He kissed the rabbi's beard and broke into
tears.
 &HT;    The soldier proceeded to tell the group, ``After I left the hut
I suddenly remembered that I had left some reports in a drawer. As
I was returning I saw a light coming from the hut. I couldn't
believe my eyes. There it was, a menorah in the middle of no-man's
land, in the middle of a blizzard right in my hut.''
 &HT;    The soldier told the group that they were safe and proceeded to
take out a large bottle of vodka, giving each one a drink.
 &HT;    ``It's good that I was on guard. Another guard would have killed
all of you! Come. I will show you how to cross the border. Remember
me, Rabbi. Pray that I have the miracle of Chanukah and will be
able to leave the army safely and be with my family.''
 &HT;    The little group followed the soldier out across the border.
Somehow they made it to freedom and then they all went their
separate ways.
 &HT;    The old rabbi went to Israel. He told this story to fellow
survivors who, in turn, told it to me as a small boy when I was at
the Yeshiva.
 &HT;    On Chanukah, Jews celebrate the miracle of their nation's
successful revolution against the Greek occupation and religious
persecution. This took place in Israel 200 B.C.
 &HT;    History reports that a handful of Jewish freedom fighters,
called Maccabees, waged a successful war for freedom. With the
ousting of the enemy, the temple was reclaimed and services were
reinstituted.
 &HT;    The main menorah, a seven-stick candelabra, was kindled.
Miraculously, the flame burned for seven days without being
replenished with oil, hence the commemoration became known as the
Festival of Lights.
 &HT;    The distribution of gifts between children and friends is a
symbol of friendships and thanks to God for the miraculous time.
The message of the lights is a time-honored holiday of freedom for
all people.
 &HT;    On Sunday, Dec. 13, the first night of Chanukah begins with the
lighting of the menorah. A happy Chanukah to all.

SWISS GIVE US SOMETHING TO CONSIDER ON DRUG POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who have not been there, and some who have, picture
Switzerland the way that Ernest Hemingway described it
three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down
than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built
on the cuckoo clock style of architecture,'' wrote Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   And the citizens of Switzerland are usually thought of as
practical people, more upright than broad-minded on issues of
morality, politics and lifestyle, a people not given to the ready
embrace of cuckoo ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How came it, then, that the staid people who dwell in that place
of snowcapped mountains, placid lakes and unimposing architecture
went to the polls last weekend and voted on the outlandish notion
of legalizing ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Swiss sensibly rejected that cuckoo idea
overwhelmingly. That was predictable. Even the proponents of the
constitutional amendment to legalize drugs, those who collected the
100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, knew it wouldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them were relieved that it didn't because they
really were not wed firmly to the idea of taking prohibitions off
the sale and distribution of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What they were really seeking was freedom to use such soft drugs
as marijuana, which is not a cuckoo idea by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, really, is total legalization of drugs on a conceptual
level. It is worth talking about, particularly in the context of
pointing out how current drug policy is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Certainly not in the United States.
Contrary to a lot of misinformation, it has not happened in the
Netherlands. In fact, the closest it has come to happening anywhere
in the world has been in Switzerland. And it was rejected there by
76 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   If it wouldn't fly in Switzerland, it wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in a Central Texas summer of becoming public
policy in the good old U.S. of A. After all, the practical,
conservative Swiss already have demonstrated that they are far more
progressive on the subject of drugs than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That became abundantly clear last year when Swiss voters
overwhelmingly endorsed state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. The Swiss sensibly concluded that it would be more
profitable to their society to provide the addicts with what they
need and allow them to be productive citizens than to leave them no
choice but to obtain their drugs from criminals and commit crimes
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there is a considerable body of American
public opinion that even rejects methadone distribution to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although full decriminalization of drugs in Switzerland, the
United States or any other country doesn't appear to be in the
cards, discussion of the notion needs to continue as a counterpoint
to the failing policies of pouring increasing millions into
minimally productive interdiction efforts, incarcerating thousands
on minor drug offenses, and building more jails and prisons to
contain the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that clash of extremes can evolve more understanding of
the need to emphasize and fund treatment and to de-emphasize
punishment for relatively minor drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the successful initiatives in Washington, Alaska,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada derived some of their driving force from
the general discussion of drug decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   The standard argument for decriminalization is that it would
take the profit out of drug trafficking and reduce the crime and
violence associated with it. That may or may not be true. The fact
is that drug trafficking is profitable because people in this
country and around the world crave drugs to fill a void in their
lives, some existential need that is not satisfied by their work,
their personal relationships or their systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Decriminalization may take some of the crime out of drug use,
but it would likely be no more effective in reducing addiction than
the repeal of prohibition on curbing alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's worth talking about because as real drug policy, it
is no more cuckoo than what now masquerades as the war on drugs.

COLLECTIBLES AND BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time of year in video lends itself to boxed sets,
commemorative editions and other collectibles. It also brings on
some big books.
</P>
<P>
   Two large, specialized volumes from Visible Ink Press go along
with the 1999 edition of ``Video Hound's Golden Movie Retriever,''
with reviews of 23,000 films. ``Video Hound's World Cinema'' covers
800 foreign films, and, for those to whom a film's size matters,
``Video Hound's Epics: Giants of the Big Screen'' assesses 200
representives of the colossal from ``Doctor Zhivago'' to ``Samson
and Delilah.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatter still, ``Movies Unlimited 1999 Video Catalog,'' from the
mail order company in Philadelphia, lists 40,000 titles of all
kinds, both film and television. ``The Hound,'' as it's called in
video circles, is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Movies Unlimited sells videos and must compete with Internet
services like Amazon.com. Irv Slifkin, a Movies Unlimited
spokesman, said that while the company was about to put its catalog
on line, it still sells 100,000 catalogs a year (information:
800-523-0823).
</P>
<P>
   Paper or Web, Slifkin and other dealers confirm some trends
relevant to the gift-giving season. First, the studios are issuing
more commemorative re-releases of famous films, some in wide-screen
versions with extras added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Chinatown,'' ``The Exorcist,'' ``American
Graffiti,'' ``Animal House'' and ``The Searchers'' are available in
new editions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some major discontinued titles, most of them off the
market for years, have been reissued. Among the most requested,
Slifkin said, are Mel Brooks' ``The Producers,'' with Zero Mostel
and Gene Wilder; ``The Night Stalker,'' the television movie with
Darren McGavin; Sam Peckinpah's ``Straw Dogs,'' with Dustin
Hoffman; Ernest B. Schoedsack's ``Mighty Joe Young'' (in
anticipation of the release of the remake), Peckinpah's ``Cross of
Iron,'' and Morton Da Costa's ``The Music Man,'' with Robert
Preston and Shirley Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, Anchor Bay has brought back four of ``the
discontinued'' as a set, all of them Hitchcocks: ``Notorious''
(1946), with Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Claude Rains; ``The
Paradine Case'' (1948), with Gregory Peck, Alida Valli and Charles
Laughton; ``Rebecca'' (1940), with Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine
and Judith Anderson, and ``Spellbound'' (1945), with Bergman and
Peck.
</P>
<P>
   Also in a slipcase are three noir films by Akira Kurosawa, who
died in September. ``High and Low'' (1962), about a businessman
(Toshiro Mifune) who raises ransom money to rescue the kidnapped
son of his chauffeur, is back on video after a long period out of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960) also stars Mifune, confronting
corruption as he maneuvers the corporate ladder. The third film of
the set, ``Stray Dog'' (1949), about a detective (Mifune again)
tracking his stolen gun and a killer through postwar Tokyo, is
classic noir.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best set of the year, ``Les Vampires,'' Louis
Feuillade's 1915 silent classic about a gang of diabolical
criminals who terrorize the Parisian bourgeoisie, has never been
available. Irma Vep is up to her neck in evil, and the car chases
never exceed 30 miles an hour.

   Recent Releases
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap
</P>
<P>
   In a remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills hit, twin sisters separated
at birth are reunited at a summer camp, in this case 11{ years
later. Alternating British and American accents, Lindsay Lohan
plays both girls with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Having managed a no-fault divorce with no custody problems,
their parents (Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid) went their
separate ways with one offspring apiece. Dad is a Napa Valley wine
grower and Mom designs bridal gowns in London.
</P>
<P>
   Neither parent realizes it when the girls switch places, and
both seem ripe for a reunion in a lavish, super-cute film that,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, invites one to ``suspend
disbelief and enjoy the story's good cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Disney. $22.99. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release

shoot. With no other choice of transportation, she boards a clanky
puddle jumper piloted by the raffish Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford).
</P>
<P>
   During a thunderstorm the plane goes down and the two are
stranded on an uncharted speck of an island. Fortunately, they have
come fully outfitted to get a well-equipped workout while evading
pirates and still look great in an ``escapist romance for the

   His parents try to shield him from the experience, but
9-year-old Mendel Trotzig (Thomas Jungling Sorensen) is aware of
his family's suffering during the Holocaust. Resettled in Norway,
the Trotzigs find themselves in a cool Christian land where Mendel
grows from a guarded boy into a daredevil whose reckless behavior
covers his fears.
</P>
<P>
   But the Holocaust lives on in his dreams and taints his
perceptions in a film whose ``anecdotes and images are so vivid
that you can feel the boy changing and toughening with each new
experience'' (Stephen Holden).

   Sour Grapes
</P>
<P>
   In his first feature film, Larry David, the co-creator of
``Seinfeld'' sticks closely to a series formula. Two cousins, Evan
(Steven Weber) and Richie (Craig Bierko), go to Atlantic City,
where Richie wins a slot-machine jackpot with two quarters borrowed
from Evan.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately the bickering starts between the two, with warfare
spreading throughout the family the way crazy escalation did on the
show. ``David's strong comic voice here is at least as conspicuous
as his film's visual flatness, and it's the former quality that
counts'' (Maslin).

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Forsythe, the American choreographer who has
been artistic director of the Frankfurt Ballet in Germany since
1984, is a prodigious talent but no prodigal son.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to come home. But he does drop in occasionally to
create new works and restage old ones for major American ballet
companies. More rarely, he visits with his own troupe, now
officially billed as Ballett Frankfurt on its tours, and shows off
a more anarchic side of his highly organized choreography.
</P>
<P>
   There is no contradiction here. Much of Forsythe's work is about
order and disorder. This theme, spectacularly enhanced by a
leitmotif of death and rebirth, races through ``Eidos: Telos,'' the
raucous full-evening piece that he has chosen for Ballett
Frankfurt's appearance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, its first
visit to New York in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The work has its considerable cerebral overload but the
apocalyptic ending or new beginning, depending on your view, is
well worth the wait. Within the darkening storm of Forsythe's
eclipse-prone lighting design, a violinist with an electronic
device is joined by three trombonists blasting out their
long-awaited crescendo. The world before us seems to break apart.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is augmented by the vibrations generated by two lines
of brightly costumed dancers as they repeatedly touch two sets of
cables strung across the stage. When they disappear, Dana
Caspersen, whose exceptionally recited monologue dominates the
previous and second act, returns to the center. Bare-breasted until
now, she crawls out of her saffron skirt as if hatching from an
egg. Nude and knock-kneed, she is no longer identified with a
mythic Persephone but becomes a distorted, even grotesque creature
emerging into a world without creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw ``Eidos: Telos'' in Montreal in 1995 shortly after
its German premiere, I did not catch the full intensity of its rage
against death. Yet for all its moments of pure dance (there are
many), the piece is chiefly about this explosive ending, a
catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Wave Festival at the Academy (30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort
Greene) where ``Eidos'' is to be performed through Friday night and
at matinees Saturday and Sunday, seems to be just the right place
for such an experimental work.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe, nonetheless, does not play by familiar rules. He does
not aim to please, and this production, both highly rewarding and
exasperating, does not fit into neat categories of American dance.
</P>
<P>
   Even the title, as described in the program note, has several
levels of meaning. Essentially it can be translated from the Greek
as ``Form: The End.'' For all the choreography's conceptual
structure ( Forsythe provides diagrams in the program to suggest
how he composed it with input from the dancers), ``Eidos'' is not
pure form.
</P>
<P>
   There is an Expressionist tinge here, rooted in the idea that
body language betrays or reveals emotion. Those used to Forsythe's
experiments with classical technique, especially his off-balance
toe work in ballet companies, may be disconcerted by the pieces he
creates for his own troupe. Often using spoken words, they do not
always rely on dance alone and their dramatic subtext can be made
up of visual non sequiturs.
</P>
<P>
   That Forsythe can still choreograph brilliant neoclassical
ballets in Frankfurt is also true. Last October, the hit of San
Francisco Ballet's season at City Center was a restaging of his
``Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude,'' a ballet that splendidly
explored the classical vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eidos'' was created ``in choreographic association with the
ensemble,'' as the program credit says and Forsythe has apparently
given the dancers choices about what kind of movement has gone into
portions of the fixed choreography and when they can perform it.
</P>
<P>
   Any collaborative process has its strengths and weaknesses and
at worst, the part where the dancers look most natural is the least
interesting. But the most powerful formal passages, one suspects,
may be all Forsythe. The highlight is the stunning ensemble at the
end of Act II when men and women, all in long skirts with bustles
to provide an arched look, waltz into dissolving patterns and line
dances.
</P>
<P>
   This hallucinatory vision is ruptured by a distancing effect.
Antony Rizzi, already seen as an outstanding dancer in Part 1,
delivers a scatological diatribe about finding himself in the land
of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   That world is evoked earlier by Ms. Caspersen, an American like
Rizzi, who recites a text she wrote, inspired by ``The Marriage of
Cadmus and Harmony, '' a book about Greek myths by Roberto Calasso.
Her verbal imagery, like her flailing animal-like postures on all
fours, is visceral: she sees herself as a Persephone who is a
spider woman, burrowing in and out of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dragged down to Hades every six months, Persephone can return to
earth only at springtime. Here, as anywhere, her fate is to say
hello but also an inevitable goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caspersen's performance is extraordinary, uninhibited but
disciplined. And when she stuffs yellow cellophane into a suspended
light projector, this rage is just right. Forsythe has never been
shy about polishing up punk-style theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Less convincing is his incorporation of ``Self Meant to
Govern,'' a piece he choreographed in 1994 and which has become the
first of the three parts in ``Eidos.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it is an exposition of the way Forsythe can
dislocate conventional ballet steps and positions while stylizing
the movement with extreme isolations of parts of the body. The fact
that the six dancers wear socks gives them a slippery ride along
the floor cloth on the stage. But after some time, the
traction-free trajectories, spliced in with rubber-legged collapses
to the floor become less interesting than Thom Willem's music. A
Dutch composer whose electronic chords often provide a basic beat
for Forsythe's works, Willem is in a more expansive mood here.
Maxim Franke is the violinist who produces the jagged melody
onstage and Christian Dembowski, Daniel Scherf and Mike Tetzner are
the trombonists at the side of the stage who break up the monotony.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzi, Christine Burkle, Jacopo Godani, Francesca Harper, Tamas
Moritz and Andrea Tallis are the earthy excellent dancers who may
or may not take their cues from a metronome and four clock faces
set on the floor. There is also a digital clock in the rear, whose
numbers work backward to a countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Time is the tenous link among the three sections. In the third,
the ensemble is more expansive, placed in ever-changing spatial
compositions until its ritualistic play with the cables onstage
prepares the final explosion.

ANTIQUES: A SOCIETY FAVORITE'S MANY TALENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christian Berard may not be a household name in the
United States, but in the 1920s and '30s he was the Paris
equivalent of Andy Warhol: a tortured, drug-taking but
multitalented artist, versatile in many fields and a darling of
society.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Decors Imaginaires,'' a current show of his gouaches at
Rainbow Fine Art through Dec. 19, and seven drawings for sale in
Sotheby's Dec. 9 auction of ``Dance, Theater, Opera'' designs,
Berard is ripe for rediscovery. He was unbelievably facile, as good
an easel painter as he was a creator of theater sets and costumes,
fashion illustrations for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and murals for
friends' houses.
</P>
<P>
   This ability has confused art critics trying to evaluate him,
but his paintings are in the collections of the Museum of Modern
Art, the Menil Collection in Houston and the McNay Art Museum in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Berard was born in Paris in 1902, the son of the city's official
architect, and died in 1949. His prodigious talent was recognized
at an early age, says a 1988 biography by Boris Kochno. Berard
studied with the painters Maurice Denis and Edouard Vuillard and
had his first gallery show in 1925. His paintings were soon bought
by influential collectors, including Gertrude Stein. In 1926 he did
a portrait of Coco Chanel, who became a friend, and he went on to
inspire other couturiers, including Christian Dior and Elsa
Schiaparelli.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Roth of Sotheby's described the appeal of Berard's
work: ``It was the lightness of his touch. He had a sensitive,
beautiful line. One doesn't learn this; you are born with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1930 Berard designed his first theater sets, at the
Comedie-Francaise for a Jean Cocteau play, ```La Voix Humaine,''
the first of many collaborations with Cocteau. In 1931 Berard
became a designer for a new incarnation of the Ballets Russes,
formed in Monte Carlo with George Balanchine as choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Diaghilev, the original Ballets Russes impresario, who
died in 1929, had tried to rid theater of its artifice. Diaghilev's
genius was in finding unknown artists in the fields of art, music,
design and choreography and combining their talents in a
Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art. Balanchine also employed
artists, among them Joan Miro, Alexander Benois and Andre Derain as
well as Berard, who did the sets and costumes for Balanchine's
``Cotillon'' in 1932. That year he began painting the gouaches at
Rainbow Fine Art (15 E. 82nd St., Manhattan).
</P>
<P>
   As Linda Hardberger, curator of the Tobin Collection of Theater
Art at the McNay Museum, said: ``Instead of hiring outside people
to do sets and costumes afterward, Diaghilev made it a
collaborative process from the beginning. He used real painters to
do scenery. The music and dance were reflected in the costumes and
sets. It was a holistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard was a great charmer. Called Bebe for his cherubic face,
he was a bear of a man and, evidently, very good company. His
friends included Elsa Maxwell, the cafe society hostess in New
York; Jean Hugo, the great-nephew of Victor; a popular architect,
Emilio Terry; Salvador Dali, and members of French society like
Vicomte Charles de Noailles and Prince Jean-Louis de
Faucigny-Lucinge. He painted decorative screens for friends and
portraits of fellow talents like Cecil Beaton and Horst P. Horst.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked on interiors with Jean-Michel Frank and the
Giacometti brothers. Rainbow Fine Art is selling the Berard
gouaches with exceptional examples of furniture by his peers,
including a 1928 Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann lady's desk in rosewood; a
circa-1936 round table with gilt patina by Frank; a Eugene Printz
lacquer table with a double tray in a semicircle, and a Giacometti
bronze gueridon, or stand, in the form of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Berard's popularity worked against him. In a catalog
for a Berard retrospective in Marseilles in 1973, Gaston Defferre
wrote: ``By demanding too much of its enfants terribles, by never
wanting any party to be without them . . .Paris, its high society,
its snob coteries, its designers thought they were serving
greatness, when in fact they were doing it a disservice. Berard
gained nothing from this but an unfortunate reputation for
frivolity.'' He added, ``Berard was the innovator who got the
theater out of its rut.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Berards in Sotheby's sale, the first that the auction
house in New York has devoted to costume and set designs since
1986, is the sketch of an angel done for Jean Giraudoux's 1943 play
``Sodom and Gomorrah.'' There are also five Berard illustrations
for a special edition of ``Gigi,'' Colette's novel. The sketches
once belonged to Kochno, a Russian ballet librettist who was
Berard's companion. The estimate for each is $1,000 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Other lots in Sotheby's sale include a painting of a harem woman
dancing in a skimpy outfit of yellow, purple and orange chiffon.
Dated 1911, it is by Leon Bakst and based on his costume design for
the Odalisque in ``Scheherazade,'' a modern ballet Diaghilev
produced for the Ballets Russes in 1910. It is estimated at $40,000
to $60,000. Baksts are sought after by Baron Hans Heinrich
Thyssen-Bornemisza and by Robert Tobin of San Antonio, two
important collectors of theater art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, Diaghilev asked the Russian painter Natalia Gontcharova
(1881-1962) to design costumes for the Ballets Russes' ``Coq
d'Or,'' based on a Pushkin story. It was her first work for the
company, and the sketches are in a primitive style, reflecting her
love for Russian folk art. (Estimate: $4,000 to $8,000 each.)
</P>
<P>
   Diaghilev also commissioned sets and costumes from Maurice
Utrillo (1883-1955) for the slapstick 1925 ballet ``Barabau.'' This
is thought to be the first full-length ballet Balanchine
choreographed and the only work Utrillo did for Diaghilev.
Utrillo's watercolors, one for a male costume, the other for a
female one, are estimated to bring $8,000 to $12,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   A man wearing a red suit is framed by white birches on the edge
of an idyllic lake in an Alexander Benois gouache decor for a 1930
Paris production of ``Sadko,'' a takeoff of a Russian fairy tale.
Estimated at $6,000 to $8,000, it looks like a finished painting.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sale is a Joseph Urban gouache for the 1912
production of the ``The Tales of Hoffmann.'' Urban (1871-1933) was
an Austrian architect who immigrated to the United States before
World War I and designed 55 productions for the Metropolitan Opera,
as well as furniture and architecture, including the New School for
Social Research and Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach mansion commissioned
by Marjorie Merriweather Post.
</P>
<P>
   The gouache in the sale was, the catalog says, part of Urban's
first work for the Boston Opera, which was so successful that it
established him as a stage designer in America.
</P>
<P>
   The sale also includes a rare Giorgio de Chirico costume design
for Apollo in Euripides' ``Bacchantes,'' which Alexandre Iolas
produced in Athens in 1937. But it doesn't have the wit or grace of
a Berard.

`HIP-HOP AMERICA': FROM UNDERGROUND MUSIC TO FASHION STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been more than two decades since hip-hop first surfaced on
the mean streets of New York, and in those 20-odd years, it's
evolved from a spontaneous form of neighborhood entertainment _
small groups of kids break dancing and grooving to local
partymasters rapping to mixes of old records _ to a worldwide,
multimillion dollar business, encompassing not just music but
fashion, videos, movies and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In his knowledgeable, opinionated and often fascinating book
``Hip-Hop America,'' Nelson George, the author of the critically
acclaimed book ``The Death of Rhythm and Blues,'' chronicles the
evolution of hip-hop, from its inception with artists like
Grandmaster Flash and Kool Herc through its current state in the
wake of the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. He
anatomizes hip-hop's post-modern esthetic, situates its development
within a social and political context, and provides the lay reader
with quick, knowing sketches of some of its most influential
producers (including Rick Rubin, Teddy Riley, Dr. Dre and Puff
Daddy).
</P>
<P>
   George does not pull his punches. He suggests that the mid-90's
feud between East Coast and West Coast rappers ``wasn't a feud at
all, but a figment of the paranoid minds in the Death Row camp.''
He complains that ``there is an adolescent quality to hip-hop
culture that makes it clear that most of its expressions are aimed
to please teen-age boys.'' And he challenges the myth that hip-hop
was, in its earliest days, ``solely African-American created,
owned, controlled and consumed,'' arguing that ``without white
entrepreneurial involvement hip-hop culture wouldn't have survived
its first half decade on vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   George writes with the ardor of a longtime hip-hop fan (and
close associate of many of the people who played a formative role
in its development) and the analytic detachment of a critic, and
his book is animated by a passion for the music and frustration
with its often insular point of view.
</P>
<P>
   While George laments the misogynistic outlook of groups like 2
Live Crew and argues that ``many folks raised on hip-hop have
bought into a very limited view of life'' defined almost solely by
the dogma of the streets, he is also quick to take issue with those
who have lumped together highly disparate artists under the
umbrella of gangsta rap and dismissed it as a nihilistic effort to
appeal to angry suburban teen-agers by trading on black
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Gangsta rap, George argues, was a response to the crack epidemic
of the '80s and the socioeconomic plight of the black underclass
under Reaganomics, and it played upon the familiar pop-culture
tropes of rebellion and revenge while mirroring the alienation of
inner-city youths. He contends that the growing number of young
black men in prison during those years (one 1990 study estimated
that one in four African-American men between the ages of 20 and 29
was behind bars or on probation) created a ``dispassionate view of
violence'' among many urban blacks and popularized a prison-based
credo predicated upon ``suspicion of women, loyalty to the crew,
adoption of a stone face in confronting the world, hatred of
authority'': many of the very values embraced by the gangsta rap of
Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre and N.W.A.
</P>
<P>
   As the crack epidemic has receded in the late '90s, gangsta rap
has also waned, but its West Coast version (as packaged by Dr. Dre
and Suge Knight), George says,will endure ``as an essential part of
the historical memory of Southern California in the '80s and
'90s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the Beach Boys spoke for an idealistic vision of the
area in the '60s,'' he writes, ``and the Eagles presented a
cynical, mellow view in the '70s, the recordings from the
Compton/Long Beach axis tell the story of the poverty, guns and
despair that everyone noticed after the 1992 riots _ riots that had
been happening on CDs all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Although groups like Public Enemy have tackled politics, hip-hop
has never been an overtly ideological form; its practitioners,
George points out, are ``not social activists by training or
inclination,'' but ``entertainers whose visibility and
effectiveness as messengers are subject to the whims of the
marketplace.'' Indeed, the central tenets of hip-hop (rebellion,
aggression, materialism) have not only struck a chord with a mass
audience of teen-agers, but have also proven to be remarkably
successful marketing tools for a host of products from clothing to
liquor to soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   After Adidas and Run-D.M.C. made a $1.5 million deal in the
mid-'80s, the alliance between hip-hop and fashion took off. By
1996, George reports, Tommy Hilfiger had become the No. 1 apparel
company traded on the New York Stock Exchange, ``due primarily to
his embrace of hip-hop and the large suburban audience excited by
that urban prep look.'' At the same time, as music videos and shows
like ``Yo, MTV Raps!'' spread the latest, up-to-the-minute hip-hop
fashions to the world, cinematographers and stylists began to play
a more and more important role, transforming what was ``once an
underground music based on beats and rhymes'' into ``the most
image-driven part of pop music.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such changes, George does not foresee hip-hop becoming
co-opted and compromised the way soul music was in the '60s. He
argues that the social conditions that forged hip-hop _ poverty,
drugs, deteriorating schools _ continue to be problems, and that
hip-hop continues to reflect and internalize ``our society's
woes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike so many other underground cultural expressions,'' he
writes, ``hip-hop has managed to remain vital, abrasive and edgy
for two decades. The culture's connection to the African-American
working and underclass, people usually without a media voice,
enables it to communicate dreams and emotions that make outsiders
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   When even Sony Playstation features a gentle childlike rapper,
it doesn't fatally undercut or mitigate the force of roughneck
M.C.'s like Mobb Deep or Wu-Tang. Somehow hip-hop survives even the
crassest commercialism or, at least, it has so far.''

BUG'S WORD: YADANYAFOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Dialogue and voices have always played a critical
role in animated movies, and that has never been more true than in
today's enormously competitive market. Consider this unforgettable
line from ``A Bug's Life,'' which has set box office records in its
opening weekend. As Tuck says so notably to Roll, ``Yadanyafoo!''
</P>
<P>
   How's that? Mike McShane, the actor who did the voices for this
pair of pill bug acrobats, repeated, in his peculiar barking tone,
``You know, Yadanyafoooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this crowded season, ``A Bug's Life,'' produced by Pixar
for the Walt Disney Co., rocketed out of the starting blocks over
the Thanksgiving holiday. It earned $46 million over the long
weekend, the most ever for the time period.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has been applauded for its animation techniques,
created on computers, and its endearing story of how a group of
circus bugs help deliver an ant colony from the menace of a gang of
grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the filmmakers, the voices were critical to the movie's
off-center humor. Some well-known actors, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
Dave Foley, Phyllis Diller and Kevin Spacey, played main
characters, but many lesser-known actors played important parts and
shaped their characters by ad-libbing to get the dialogue just
right _ even when the dialogue comes from no known language family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very proud of our voices, but it's something we
really work at,'' said John Lasseter, the director of the film.
``We look at lots and lots of actors and what we'll do is take a
performance from a movie and just take the audio and put it against
some drawings. When you take away the visual of an actor, what do
you have? Some people are not as good as you thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a process that also allows for serendipity. Take Heimlich,
the rotund performing caterpillar. In the animation process, Pixar
first develops a sketched-out version of the movie using
storyboards; animators frequently provide the voices just to test
out the plot twists and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ranft, the head of Pixar's storyboard department, said that
one of the animators suggested that the caterpillar would sound
funny if he had a German accent. Almost instantly, Ranft said, he
started blurting out Heimlich's lines with a heavy accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just popped out of my mouth,'' Ranft said. ``Ohhhh, I et
too much. Oh, my schtomach!''
</P>
<P>
   Once Pixar began work on the real movie, a number of actors
auditioned for Heimlich's voice, but Lasseter said he was not
satisfied, so he ended up making a tape that was half Ranft's voice
and half a professional actor's. He played the tape for his wife,
he said, and she giggled every time Ranft did a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the part the next day,'' Lasseter said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck and Roll, acrobatic brothers, evolved enormously after
McShane was chosen as their voice and began to transform them into
cheerful performers almost completely oblivious to what was
happening around them, reflected in their ability to chatter with
great sincerity but no discernible meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice started out as Hungarian and we all agreed on that,
but then it rapidly devolved into gobbledy-gooseky,'' McShane said.
``It was nonsense, but there was a beginning and an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of their interaction involves the older brother, Tuck,
scolding his sibling nonsensically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuck is older by a few milliseconds, we decided, and he's the
bossy one,'' McShane said. He added that he was aided by his
training in improvisational comedy, in which he had to do entire
scenes talking gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't plan on the dialogue turning into gibberish, but
when we played around with it that's who those guys were,'' McShane
said. ``They're performing bugs, after all.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

   Hollywood generally believes you're supposed to laugh over the
holidays, or at the least enjoy some light entertainment. And who
better to deliver such a pleasant frisson than Chris Columbus
(left), the director of ticklish fare like ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and
``Home Alone''?
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Columbus' offering for the season is ``Stepmom,''
an adult drama that stars Ed Harris, Julia Roberts and Susan
Sarandon, and opens on Christmas Day. Columbia Pictures, which has
had a decidedly mediocre year, is placing great hopes on this $50
million picture. But be forewarned, keep some Kleenex handy _ a lot
of Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' is reminiscent of ``Terms of Endearment,'' but
without loopy characters like Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine
and their antics. It is an earnest examination of how a divorced
couple, Harris and Ms. Sarandon, and their children come to terms
with the father's girlfriend, then wife, played by Ms. Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which does have some decidedly comic touches, follows
their emotional journey from one wrenching moment of truth to
another and then goes into emotional overdrive when Jackie, the
mother, discovers she has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She has to come to terms with the role the stepmother will play
in the lives of her children, while Ms. Roberts' character, Isabel,
who has said she never wanted children, has to make her peace with
the fact that she will always play second fiddle to Jackie in the
minds of her stepchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus ends the film with a dedication to his mother, Irene
Columbus, who died of cancer several years ago. He said he first
saw the script, initially titled ``Goodnight Moon'' and written by
Gigi Levangie, a couple of months after his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `I don't want to go there.' It was too hard, so I
passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later the script went through some rewriting by Ron Bass, and
Columbus saw it again. This time, he said, he was more prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work out my own personal demons and this seemed like
a way to do it,'' he said, adding, ``It's not necessarily a
goodbye, but certainly this is a picture I made for my mother. It's
about loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus, who started as a screenwriter (``Young Sherlock
Holmes,'' ``Heartbreak Hotel'' and ``Gremlins'') said he did a
great deal of rewriting of ``Stepmom.'' But he said the writing
became unusually collaborative, with the main actors all
contributing enormously to shaping the dialogue in some important
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an unusual proposal scene, in which Harris uses a
piece of thread tied around Ms. Roberts' finger in asking her to
marry him, came from Harris and Ms. Roberts, Columbus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed had gone to this wedding for the weekend during rehearsals,
and he just came back with this speech scrawled on about 10
cocktail napkins,'' Columbus said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few movies could be more different than ``Saving Private Ryan''
and ``There's Something About Mary,'' but both demonstrate why this
has been such an unusual year in the movie business. Supposed niche
films have tended to do best, with the greatest financial successes
enjoyed by films made on more moderate budgets rather than
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   According to Exhibitor Relations, which collects box office
data, total domestic box office receipts are likely to set a record
this year, with slightly more than $7 billion expected, up from
$6.36 billion last year, the old record.
</P>
<P>
   The total for the first 11 months of the year stood at $6.35
billion, up 9 percent from the same period last year. Foreign
receipts are likely to come in at about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean it has been the most profitable year.
``Godzilla,'' which cost upward of $200 million to produce and
market, earned just $136 million domestically. Even ``Armageddon,''
the year's leader with $202 million in domestic revenues, may not
be hugely profitable because it also cost some $200 million to
produce and distribute. There has not been, in short, anything like
the hugely profitable ``Titanic'' or ``Lost World'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several less expensive films did make a profit. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' cost about $65 million to produce and has earned
$190 million, while ``There's Something About Mary,'' starring
Cameron Diaz, cost some $25 million and has taken in $172 million.
Similar profitable surprises have been ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Rush
Hour'' and ``The Water Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthier when it's spread around on a lot of smaller
movies rather than focused on one or two movies,'' said Terry
Press, the head of marketing for Dreamworks, which produced
``Saving Private Ryan.'' ``It's only when the nasty head of
profitability rises up that you have the problem because most
movies still cost too much to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabebian, the president of Exhibitor Relations, said:
``This is good for the audience, even if profits for the industry
are down. There are a lot of good films, a lot of crowd pleasers,
not just one or two. These are movies for the people.''

WITH DREXLER, HOUSTON MAY NOT HAVE A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JORGE L. ORTIZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After a 15-year NBA career that included a world
championship, 10 All-Star Game selections and the honor of being
chosen as one of the 50 greatest players of all time, Clyde Drexler
had a pretty clear notion what he wanted to do in retirement:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be on about the 10th green right now, heading out the back
nine, trying to shoot a 72.''
</P>
<P>
   The dreams of relaxed accomplishment on the links were
interrupted when his alma mater came calling. The University of
Houston Cougars, who went a combined 20-36 in the last two years,
desperately needed a savior.
</P>
<P>
   In glided Drexler, taking over the program with nary a coaching
day in his resume.
</P>
<P>
   The results so far have been stunning, and they go far beyond
the 3-2 mark the Cougars bring into Thursday night's game against
the University of California at Berkeley (2-1) in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   After inspiring nothing but apathy for years, Houston has sold
out the 8,479-seat Hofheinz Pavilion for the season, including 24
new luxury boxes (at $15,000 per season for three years).
</P>
<P>
   Though still predicted to finish at the bottom of the Conference
USA standings, the Cougars and their charismatic coach are suddenly
the object of countless newspaper stories. And one of the nation's
top junior college players, George Gervin Jr., better known as Gee,
decided the once-moribund program was just the place for him after
Drexler came on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of an impact as I expected Clyde to have, as much of a
positive as I knew he would be for us, there's no way I saw it
coming,'' Houston athletic director Chet Gladchuk told the Houston
Chronicle. ``I'm still amazed at what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly the result of Drexler's desire to give back to the
school from where his career took off. He even has a couple of his
old Phi Slamma Jamma cohorts on staff, assistant coach Reid Gettys
and strength and conditioning coach Michael Young. Another former
Cougars (and Rockets) teammate, Hakeem Olajuwon, has bought one of
the luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program was in dire straits,'' said Drexler, who signed a
four-year deal for a total of $1.2 million, a fraction of his
yearly salary as a player. ``It was a nationally recognized
program, and to have it not remain respectable was tough to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism ran rampant last March when Houston tabbed Drexler,
and there's no certainty he'll make the transition to the bench as
easily as his contemporary Larry Bird did with the Pacers. But just
like Bird, Drexler commands instant respect from the players
because of his Hall of Fame credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's even had to tell them not to be too awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they're almost afraid to play in front of you because
they don't want to look stupid,'' said Drexler, 36. ``So you have
to get them to relax and play their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports history is littered with names of star players who failed
as coaches or managers. The physical abilities that made them so
successful mean nothing on the bench, and the competitive spirit
that drove them only augments the frustration of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Handing a downtrodden program _ one that also lost its top two
players from last year's 9-20 squad _ to a neophyte coach who knew
nothing but success as a player would seem ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
   However, Young, a journeyman player as a pro, believes his good
friend is up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde will know what he can reasonably expect from his guys,''
Young said. ``He's not going to demand or expect more than his
players can deliver, but they are expected to deliver as much as
they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler is taking his return to school quite literally. He
intends to sign up for a couple of courses next spring to start
making up the 30-40 credits he said he still needs to complete his
degree in education. As the coach, Drexler figures he should set an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``By finishing what I started, I can make a statement,'' he
said. ``I want the kids to know not going to school is not an
option.''

   Snow fell at elevations as low as 1,000 feet Thursday in the
northern Cascades of Washington as the coldest air mass of the
season invaded the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Alaska. On
Friday, the cold air mass will carve out a cold upper-level trough
of low pressure over the West, setting the stage for a variety of
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will develop across
parts of southern California as a potent jet stream disturbance
swings inland on the southern flank of the trough. Snow is possible
in the mountains east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy snow will fall on parts of
the northern and central Rockies as the cold, upper-level trough
swings east from the Great Basin. Snowfall may be enhanced over the
mountains near Salt Lake City as air moistened in transit over the
Great Salt Lake is forced to rapidly rise. Broken areas of light
snow will spread onto the high plains of eastern Montana and the
western Dakotas as a compact jet stream disturbance moves overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, some with moderate
to locally heavy rains, will speckle the middle Mississippi,
Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys as a jet stream disturbance draws
relatively humid air northward from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of morning fog and variable clouds will dull parts of
the region from the upper Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes to
the central Appalachians, though unseasonably mild weather will
persist. Spotty, light showers will develop gradually from west to
east.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: PLUNGE INTO DROUGHT
</P>
<P>
   There is more to the developing drought across the Middle
Atlantic States than a lack of rain. In order to assess drought,
the amount of precipitation must be weighed against the amount of
water that is lost through processes like evaporation. Many days
this autumn have been sunny, breezy and relatively warm, three
conditions that quicken the rate of evaporation of moisture from
the ground and bodies of water such as reservoirs and lakes. Thus,
during the last 60 days when precipitation has been sparse,
evaporation rates have been high, causing a rather dramatic plunge
into drought.

SWISS GIVE US SOMETHING TO CONSIDER ON DRUG POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who have not been there, and some who have, picture
Switzerland the way that Ernest Hemingway described it
three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down
than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built
on the cuckoo clock style of architecture,'' wrote Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   And the citizens of Switzerland are usually thought of as
practical people, more upright than broad-minded on issues of
morality, politics and lifestyle, a people not given to the ready
embrace of cuckoo ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How came it, then, that the staid people who dwell in that place
of snowcapped mountains, placid lakes and unimposing architecture
went to the polls last weekend and voted on the outlandish notion
of legalizing ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Swiss sensibly rejected that cuckoo idea
overwhelmingly. That was predictable. Even the proponents of the
constitutional amendment to legalize drugs, those who collected the
100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, knew it wouldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them were relieved that it didn't because they
really were not wed firmly to the idea of taking prohibitions off
the sale and distribution of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What they were really seeking was freedom to use such soft drugs
as marijuana, which is not a cuckoo idea by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, really, is total legalization of drugs on a conceptual
level. It is worth talking about, particularly in the context of
pointing out how current drug policy is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Certainly not in the United States.
Contrary to a lot of misinformation, it has not happened in the
Netherlands. In fact, the closest it has come to happening anywhere
in the world has been in Switzerland. And it was rejected there by
76 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   If it wouldn't fly in Switzerland, it wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in a Central Texas summer of becoming public
policy in the good old U.S. of A. After all, the practical,
conservative Swiss already have demonstrated that they are far more
progressive on the subject of drugs than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That became abundantly clear last year when Swiss voters
overwhelmingly endorsed state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. The Swiss sensibly concluded that it would be more
profitable to their society to provide the addicts with what they
need and allow them to be productive citizens than to leave them no
choice but to obtain their drugs from criminals and commit crimes
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there is a considerable body of American
public opinion that even rejects methadone distribution to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although full decriminalization of drugs in Switzerland, the
United States or any other country doesn't appear to be in the
cards, discussion of the notion needs to continue as a counterpoint
to the failing policies of pouring increasing millions into
minimally productive interdiction efforts, incarcerating thousands
on minor drug offenses, and building more jails and prisons to
contain the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that clash of extremes can evolve more understanding of
the need to emphasize and fund treatment and to de-emphasize
punishment for relatively minor drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the successful initiatives in Washington, Alaska,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada derived some of their driving force from
the general discussion of drug decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   The standard argument for decriminalization is that it would
take the profit out of drug trafficking and reduce the crime and
violence associated with it. That may or may not be true. The fact
is that drug trafficking is profitable because people in this
country and around the world crave drugs to fill a void in their
lives, some existential need that is not satisfied by their work,
their personal relationships or their systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Decriminalization may take some of the crime out of drug use,
but it would likely be no more effective in reducing addiction than
the repeal of prohibition on curbing alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's worth talking about because as real drug policy, it
is no more cuckoo than what now masquerades as the war on drugs.

`HI-LIFE': NOT YOUR FATHER'S CHRISTMAS MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas is a peculiar season. Psychologists warn
that expectations roused by its warm image so often clash with the
harsh reality of life that depression is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie ``Hi-Life'' is the sort of Runyonesque comedy of
urban life and love that simultaneously nourishes the fantasies of
the hopeful and compounds the misery of the disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Roger Hedden in his filmmaking debut,
``Hi-Life'' is contrived to a fare-thee-well. But it has some
genuine laughs, tried-and-true seasonal elements (Dickensian
carolers, Christmas trees and other decorations, plenty of warm
reds) and a first-rate cast that is like a reunion of old friends.
</P>
<P>
   As its plot plays out on a single night late in the Christmas
season, its decent protagonist, Ray (Campbell Scott), the bartender
at the Hi Life on Manhattan's Upper West Side, sets out to call in
his many good-hearted loans to raise the $900 he thinks his sister,
Susan (Moira Kelly), needs for an abortion. The putative father to
be (for a third time) is her putative actor boyfriend, Jimmy (Eric
Stoltz). But in fact, Susan knows the money is meant for an
abortion for Jimmy's sister, Maggie (Daryl Hannah), who happens to
have broken Ray's heart. Susan knows because Jimmy told her so.
</P>
<P>
   But as the worthless Jimmy knows, the $900 is really intended to
pay his gambling debt to the bartender-bookmaker Fatty (Charles
Durning), who is threatening a beating. Fatty assigns his pal Minor
(Peter Riegert) to escort Jimmy to make sure the money arrives
safely that night, but Minor has other plans. He assigns his
girlfriend's son Ricky (Carlos Alban) to hold up Jimmy and him at
gunpoint so that he can keep the money for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the softhearted Ray is making the rounds of the
bars and restaurants where his many friends work, accompanied by
April (Katrin Cartlidge), an Englishwoman who is one of his regular
customers and is bolder than Ray when it comes to calling in his
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, before the night is over, everybody will wind up in
the Hi Life, matters will sort themselves out and relationships
will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the long history of Christmas movies, ``Hi-Life'' ranks far
from the top of the tree, but those who believe in Santa Claus
(even if, as here, he turns out to be Jewish, hates kids and is a
heel) can bask in its sentiment.
</P>

`LITTLE VOICE': SHE'S PAINFULLY SHY, BUT HER MIMICRY IS NEAR
PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Production notes are at the end of article.) 
(js) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' revolves around the enchanting notion that
beneath the mousiest exterior may lurk a spectacular diva festival,
one that sounds like heavenly lip-synching at a karaoke bar. But
this is no sham. The film (like the play on which it is based)
originated as a showcase for the uncanny Jane Horrocks, and she
produces these fabulous sounds for real. Ms. Horrocks' phenomenal
mimicry of musical grande dames from Marlene Dietrich to Marilyn
Monroe, lavishing special loving care on Judy Garland, makes a
splendid centerpiece for the otherwise more ordinary film built
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Though the world suffers no shortage of Judy Garland imitators,
Ms. Horrocks' title character is a little different. She's much too
wispy. She's so painfully timid that she hides behind her bangs.
When not repeating dialogue from ``The Wizard of Oz'' or cooing
like Marilyn, she doesn't often speak. And she has to be quite
literally dragged out of bed by the film's colorfully sleazy
supporting characters before she will reveal her talents as a
singer savant in front of strangers. ``The girl with the greats
queuing up in her gullet!'' is how a club owner (Jim Broadbent) in
a northern English town pitches Little Voice to an audience about
to have its socks knocked off.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written and directed by Mark Herman (``Brassed
Off''), expanding upon the play by Jim Cartwright that was written
specifically to show off Ms. Horrocks' eerily perfect
impersonations. And it doesn't have any doubt about what made
Little Voice so reticent. Blame it on Mari, her blowsy mother,
played by Brenda Blethyn as a motor-mouthed, aging party girl who
could cow any daughter into a silent streak. Bawdily outspoken Mari
taunts Little Voice and anyone else who'll listen to her, including
(albeit reluctantly) a low-life talent agent named Ray Say (Michael
Caine, in a flamboyantly scuzzy role).
</P>
<P>
   One night, apparently for lack of anything better to do, Ray is
dragged home drunkenly by Mari. And a duel of record players
ensues. While Little Voice is luxuriating upstairs in the music she
adores (``That's Entertainment''), her mother downstairs is
prompted to blast Tom Jones at spitefully high volume. Then Ray
notices that fuses have been blown and that the amazing sounds
coming from upstairs must be live. It's at this pregnant moment
that Ms. Horrocks belts out ``The Man That Got Away,'' doing it so
beautifully (and singing to a photograph of her late father, the
family's original music lover) that strife in the household
temporarily disappears. Suddenly Ray and Mari are in harmony,
sharing a single goal: to exploit Little Voice to the fullest and
ride her coattails as far as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``Little Voice'' turns into something of an old
standard. It gives Little Voice a nice young man who is her shy
soulmate. (Apparently Ewan McGregor is an actor who can do
anything, even turn a meek telephone installer into a serious
charmer.) It gives the nice young man pet pigeons (``It can be
boring to the nonenthusiast,'' he explains.) whose caged status is
meant to echo the heroine's. It even has the nice young man say:
``Flyin' free. They like it. You should try it sometime, L.V.''
Convenient parallels are not likely to go unflogged here, in a
screenplay that has Ray Say coaxing Little Voice to go public by
telling her an inspirational story about a bluebird.
</P>
<P>
   A cast like this and the thrill of occasionally hearing a
dead-on ``Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Mrs ... Norman ... Maine!''
do a good deal to offset the material's heavy hand. Despite being
required to deliver stagey monologues in conversational tones,
Caine and Ms. Blethyn add humor and spice. While he becomes the
epitome of show-biz seediness, she flounces outrageously and
delivers her lines with obvious glee. (``Give us your lips, you,
and double me palpitations!'')
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Horrocks, who not only did all her own vocals but also
performed the film's concert scenes singing live before an
audience, gives a poignantly lovely performance whether blossoming
onstage or cowering in bed. If the film watches Little Voice
outgrow her fears but never delves into why she sings a sultry
``Hey, Big Spender!'' and ``I Wanna Be Loved by You'' while
thinking of her father, that must be a much less simple story.
</P>
<P>

IN WINTER, THERE'S BEAUTY IN THE BERRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roses still bloomed recently, the small pink blossoms of ``The
Fairy,'' an occasional perfect yellow rose on the ``Golden
Showers'' climber, and not long ago three deep pink, scented
beauties on the ``Zephirine Drouhin.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last were quickly snapped off by my wife and brought
inside, adorning our living room from a vase. I hate to cut
flowers, but those were doomed, for cold was coming, as this is not
really a time for roses. What is it that, post-foliage, is the
bee's knees?
</P>
<P>
   Why, it's the berries.
</P>
<P>
   The berries of autumn are botanically and ornamentally the fruit
of summer. They provide interest from fall through, in some cases,
late winter and early spring. They look lovely in the landscape;
they are fetching in interior arrangements. Many attract birds.
</P>
<P>
   We have a lot of autumn berries, though for the most part I did
not plan it that way.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly did not plan to have berries on our Euonymus
fortunei ``Emerald Surprise'' for the very good reason that I did
not plant our four. They were here when we moved in nearly 10 years
ago. But I am glad to have them. They form very hardy evergreen
shrubs and even vine up, and help hide, a chain-link fence. Amid
the green and creamy white leaves nestle quarter-inch, pale orange
berries emerging from fleshy whitish casings. I like them, but I
wouldn't call them beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   For beautiful, you cannot deny beautyberry. I have two, both
sporting the most incredible electric, metallic purple berries,
about three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   One is Callicarpa japonica, and the other is supposed to be
Callicarpa dichotoma, which is reported to be smaller but in this
case seems to be bigger, leading me to suspect it is really
Callicarpa americana. Anyway, they are roughly the same, one being
three feet high and four feet wide and absolutely festooned with
clusters of berries, the other a good seven feet high by three feet
wide, and not as well-berried. They are next to each other and draw
the eye from across the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The other excellent show we have comes from several
cotoneasters, about which I also am confused. (I hereby resolve,
firmly, to compile a detailed, accurate, thorough plant list this
winter, and I shall not misplace it!)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, to help tie our long, shallow roadside bed together, I
spotted four Cotoneaster apiculatus, known as cranberry cotoneaster
for the color and size of the berries, at intervals along the bed.
These are now thick with berries on branches 18 inches high and
spreading horizontally like fish bones.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that I had intended these four-foot-wide plants to be
Cotoneaster adpressus, which I don't think would have worked as
well, then decided I really had gotten praecox, but now believe
these to be apiculatus. I vaguely recall a mixup at the nursery,
but since I didn't jot things down at the time, the facts have
dissolved into the ether of my mind. On the other hand, I do have
an apiculatus out back, and it does not seem to be of similar
habit, that one being smaller and more contorted. There is another
cotoneaster by the pool, spreading six feet and sprawling onto a
concrete walkway. Its red berries are sort of lost in burgundy
leaves, and I have not bothered to identify this plant.
</P>
<P>
   I know just what the holly is that finally is sporting some
berries this year. It is Ilex meserveae ``China Girl'' and has been
pollinated by an adjacent ``Blue Prince.'' These are out back in
the Lucy Garden. Lucy is our 120-pound Newfoundland dog, and that
should explain some of the difficulty growing things in her special
plot. Shade and maple roots explain the other difficulties. The
``China Girl'' is now two feet high and two feet wide and has
glowing, reddish pink berries about three-eighths inch in diameter.
Eventually, it and the male will fill the small area off the deck
in front of some sunroom windows. It will make a nice winter
accent, the berries amid glossy, deep green leaves, perhaps dusted
with snow.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice plant is Euonymus alata ``Compacta,'' winged
euonymus or burning bush. As it drops its flaming red foliage, its
quarter-inch berries, red with orange tones, become apparent. They
hang singly from four-sided branches, the ``sides'' formed by corky
ridges. The ``Compacta'' is the right one for a house lot like
ours. We have two at the head of the driveway. butting against
peonies.
</P>
<P>
   A not-so-choice plant is Rosa multiflora, which sports orangy
berries, about three-eighths of an inch in diameter. These have
spread across our back hill, and one I let go next to an otherwise
civilized planting has become a seven-foot-high, 10-foot-wide,
sprawling fountain of prickly horror. Still, they provide cover for
birds, and it is lovely to see a bright red male cardinal bouncing
up and down on a cane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other berries.
</P>
<P>
   Lily of the valley, Convallaria majalis, still has a few
three-eighths-inch pale red berries sticking up on stalks maybe
eight inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Two yews, Taxus x media ``Hicksii,'' have fleshy, translucent
red berry cones. Ours are six feet high and four feet wide. They
grow upright and are almost architectural. The berries are about
the size of a pea, open at one end, with a naked seed visible
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``berries'' are found on some sprawling junipers out back.
These are blue and not really berries, of course, but then neither
are the yews. But I include them as berries anyway, as I do the
rose hips on the now naked canes of the climbing rose ``Golden
Showers.'' The hips now are green and tomatoey red/orange, one to
one-and-a-half inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent cold nights put an end to it, there still were
occasional blooms, reminding us that summer flowers bring fall
showers of berries.

</P>
<P>
   Though considerably outnumbered, some bully-boy grasshoppers
intimidate a hard-pressed colony of ants into providing food. One
eager beaver of an ant named Flik comes up with a mechanized seed
gatherer but, after innocently causing havoc, gets sent away to
keep him from causing further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Still determined to help his fellows, Flik meets a troupe of
insect entertainers who maintain they can knock 'em dead. Flik
brings them back to the colony, where it is hoped that is exactly
what they will do to the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, though, the bugs were referring to their
prowess as performers, not their combat skills. The grasshoppers,
who party hard Mexican style, aren't impressed. But young Flik and
his new friends lead the ants to a revelation: There are a lot more
of them than there are of the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The grasshoppers send the ants scurrying, but the
scuffling is cartoon style. &QL;

<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;

<P>
   FOOTNOTE This is a computer-animated film by Pixar, which made
``Toy Story.'' The film follows ``Antz,'' the first ant epic of the
season, but this adventure is lighter and more geared to small
children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 They will be thoroughly involved with the movie, and
there is nothing that should upset them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 Just right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 Younger children in this group will be caught up. Many
of the older ones will have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats Movie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of E.G. Daily, Tim Curry, Christine Cavanaugh,
Kath Soucie, Tara Charendoff, Cheryl Chase, others &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely out of the Lipschitz Maternity Arts Building, the
aggressively self-involved newborn Dylan Preston (Dil) Pickles has
the Rugrats (his siblings and their neighborhood pals from the
Nickelodeon show) in an uproar. So when it's suggested that he be
returned to the baby store, no one objects strenuously.
</P>
<P>
   With Grandpa asleep at his baby-sitting post (he slept through
Pearl Harbor, Dil's mother notes later), the Rugrats start out in a
talking wagon called Reptar. One swift mishap later and everybody
winds up in a mattress truck that crashes in the forest. The media
descend. A rumor circulates that the children have been shipped to
Tokyo in a crate. There's a drooling wolf and a group of creepy
baboons from the Banana Brothers Circus, who hijack a train and
crack it up in the same stretch of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The lost little ones trod on gamely, do much soul searching and
look for somebody, anybody, in a wizard's pointed hat who will
grant them their wish to go home. Parents search, as does Angelica,
the Pickles' cranky older sister, who's dragged through the
underbrush by an ardent bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Dad Pickles, a part-time inventor who can burst into
tears faster than the tots, joins the hunt in his homemade plane,
which resembles a pterodactyl. It's left to the bloodhound to take
on the wolf.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE There is plenty of rough and tumble but nothing too
scary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE In keeping with other animated films, this one employs
some big names _ Beck, Jakob Dylan, Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson _
to chime in on some snappy tunes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 This is a busy and talkative movie with some ruminative
passages here and there. Very little ones won't keep up with the
finer points, but that may not matter much, given the appeal of the
characters and story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 They'll love it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 Rugrats fans will be solidly locked into the action
and repartee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP Hey, these are the Rugrats. Many teen-agers will
still be interested (and not a few adults).
</P>
<P>
   Babe: Pig in the City &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mary Stein, Mickey Rooney, with
the voices of E.G. Daily, Danny Mann, Glenne Headly, Steven Wright,
James Cosmo, Ralph Ross, others &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by George Miller &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   With Farmer Hoggett (Cromwell) in traction after a fall down a
well, the suits from the bank show up to repossess the family
spread. Since Babe the pig is remembered for his sheepherding feats
in the hit forerunner of this sequel, Mrs. Hoggett (Ms. Szubanski)
figures he might be a pretty good draw in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Having inadvertently caused Hoggett's accident, Babe, sweet soul
that he is, wants to do anything he can to make it up to the other
animals. But on arrival in the big town (a visually arresting but
huge and threatening amalgam of New York, Los Angeles and other
cities), a drug-sniffing dog targets Babe, which lands Mrs. Hoggett
in custody and leaves the pig on his own in a weird neighborhood
that resembles Venice.
</P>
<P>
   There he takes up residence in the Flealands Hotel, which teems
with dogs, cats and monkeys all keeping a low profile lest they be
turned in by the animal-hating opera lover across the canal. In
relatively short order, Babe plays harmonica for a chimpanzee
minstrel show, is anointed leader of the animals by a pit bull whom
he saves from drowning and organizes a revenue-generating disco at
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the opera lover blows the whistle, and the animals are
rounded up by a police squad not that concerned by possible
brutality charges. That sets up the day to be saved by Mrs.
Hoggett, who has her case dismissed and, tethered to a long elastic
cord, bounces about scattering the city's elite.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Various incidents _ Hoggett's accident, the pit bull's
near drowning, a duck caught in a shooting gallery, the rounding up
of the animals by the police _ have a violent connotation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 ``You can't soft-pedal, especially with kids,'' Miller,
the director, says in the production notes. The film has an
unusually dark side for a G-rated film, which may disturb some very
young children. But much will just pass over their heads. That
said, they will enjoy the animals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 Most children this age should understand the film and
not be too taken aback by the unsunnier turns of events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 By this age, the film's content and tone shouldn't be
a problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP Chris Noonan's ``Babe'' charmed many adults. This
film won't, and it has limited appeal for teen-agers.

 &HT;    A glimpse of things on society's fringes
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gadjo Dilo,'' the title of the third installment in Tony
Gatlif's Gypsy-themed trilogy, translates as ``crazy outsider.''
Which is precisely how a young Parisian named Stephane (Romain
Duris) strikes the Gypsy community he joins in snowy Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane is on a mission _ to find the mysterious Gypsy singer
whose voice once entranced his late father. While traipsing through
the wintry countryside, playing his father's tape to anyone who'll
listen, Stephane encounters an elderly Gypsy named Izador (Izador
Serban). He's very friendly. And very, very drunk. Izador
``adopts'' Stephane and soon the ``crazy outsider'' is living the
Gypsy life, which, as presented here, offers lots of music, dance
and vodka.
</P>
<P>
   However, the darker side of being a Gypsy is also portrayed. To
the rest of the world, these colorful wanderers are the ``crazy
outsiders,'' not to be trusted or welcomed (in fact, the Gypsies
were right there with the Jews on Hitler's hit list.) Near the end,
Stephane experiences firsthand how a misunderstanding mixed with
bigotry can become combustible.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an engaging patchwork that's often more effective
as an anthropological tract than a full-fledged narrative. Scenes
seem self-contained and barely interconnected. The closest the
picture comes to a cohesive plot is the growing attraction between
Stephane and the sultry Sabina (Rona Hartner.) She's the tribe's
designated ``scarlet woman'' _ it has something to do with running
off to Belgium with an inappropriate companion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once you accept Gatlif's hang-loose style, the material's
intrinsic interest takes hold. We become privy to everything from
the community's celebrations and traditions to its colorful curses
(the subtitles are definitely NC-17.) Most of all, we get a glimpse
of the Gypsies' ancient and inviolate isolation _ an isolation
that's made them targets, true, but has also made them survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadjo Dilo''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Romain Duris. Directed by Tony Gatlif. Not rated, but
there are sexual situations and NC-17-rated subtitles. 1 hour, 37
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: For those with a little gypsy in their soul.

 &HT;    Nothing idyllic about this life down on the farm
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Inheritors'' starts with one murder and ends with another.
In between, it's occasionally a stirring tale of peasants finding
their self-worth. It's also a mystery. And a sex comedy. What it
isn't is a consistent piece of filmmaking. Though engaging and
well-acted, it never quite seems to figure out its own tone.
</P>
<P>
   The first murder is of a tightfisted farmer named Hillinger. His
passing isn't mourned in the surrounding countryside, least of all
by his long-suffering farmhands. These virtual slaves suffer one
last bit of abuse, as the farmer, in his will, takes pains to
belittle each of them _ much to the delight of the other wealthy
farmers, who assume the dead man's property is now up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Instead, Hillinger bequeaths it to his seven workers,
with a clause that explains this seemingly generous gesture: ``I
hope they beat each other to death when they fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the peasants unite, led by the strong, sexual Emmy
(Sophie Rois) and the cheerful orphan Lukas (Simon Schwarz). Though
the local gentry sneer at them as ``one-seventh farmers,''
ownership turns out to be transformative. First they find the
courage to oust their former foreman (Tilo Pruckner), who tries to
maintain steely control. And when his share of the farm must be
bought out, his former underlings work doubly hard to raise the
funds. (They're secretly helped by other farm workers, inspired by
this vicarious taste of freedom.)
</P>
<P>
   In its middle section, ``The Inheritors'' is full of sweet
moments of newly discovered liberty. The workers have to adjust to
this awkward new concept of ``free time,'' and some of them even
summon the nerve to sit in the front pews of the church, like the
other landowners. But as the established farmers, led by the
glowering Danninger (Ulrich Wildgruber), plot to wrest the land
away from them, the film takes increasingly melodramatic turns. The
ending plays out with a bleakness that seems unrelated to the bulk
of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Inheritors''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Simon Schwarz, Sophie Rois. Written and directed by
Stefan Ruzowitzky. In German with English subtitles. Unrated, but
contains nudity, sexuality and violence. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An interesting tale of farm life that goes in too
many directions.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AMERICAN HISTORY X,''  &LR; starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong
and Beverly D'Angelo. Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes).
Flawed but gut-slugging, renounced by its director yet still a
showcase for his effective style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead
who develops a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And
its toughest images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing,
presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials,
spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and
versatility, Norton plays a savage, racist killer who learns the
error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally effective plot
devices and trying to protect his younger brother (Furlong).
Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BABE: PIG IN THE CITY,''  &LR; starring Magda Szubanski and
four-legged friends. Directed by George Miller. (G, 95 minutes).
Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout, remains
a cute little porker in this elaborately ambitious sequel. But once
he and his mistress head for the city, they must contend with many
discouraging urban sights, including Mickey Rooney in a purple
clown suit. And once he winds up at the eccentric, creature-filled
hotel that is the film's main setting, the film turns rougher than
its G rating suggests. Had this ``Babe'' been made first, it
wouldn't have prompted a sequel of its own (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A BUG'S LIFE,''  &LR; featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz,'' too. With the same anthropomorphism
that gave Lasseter's ``Toy Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued,
visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage
while also incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of
nature. And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial
expressions that make this type of animation more and more
invitingly lifelike all the time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``CELEBRITY,''  &LR; starring Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Joe
Mantegna, Winona Ryder and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Woody
Allen (R, 113 minutes). Following in the footsteps of ``La Dolce
Vita,'' Allen presents a New York in which the only thing worse
than being famous for nothing is not being famous at all. At the
center of it all he places Branagh as a journalist with all the
Allen tics but none of the filmmaker's comic flair. The bitter
breakup at the center of the film (with Ms. Davis as the
journalist's beached wife) is regularly upstaged by guest-star
segments, a few of which stand out in witty relief against an
otherwise weary backdrop. Charlize Theron dazzles as a capricious,
headstrong model, and Ms. Griffith plays a pampered movie diva with
aplomb. Best of all is Leonardo DiCaprio's brief, wicked appearance
as a bad-boy wonder (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``CENTRAL STATION,''  &LR; starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliviera and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough, bravura performance is one of the year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``DANCING AT LUGHNASA,''  &LR; starring Meryl Streep, Brid Brennan,
Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack. Directed by
Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the
other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from
Brian Friel's delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the
play's intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also
gained a good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint
rural charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five
unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the
return of their gently eccentric brother from many years'
missionary work in Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this
beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter
these characters' lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ELIZABETH,''  &LR; starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes,
Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur
(R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen
Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays
the monarch as if her principal responsibilities were being
bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave
of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman
Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, it's
historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of
Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and
one dance scene reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds
up imagining the queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman,
afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ENEMY OF THE STATE,''  &LR; starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology wiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics add an
additional touch of class (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GODS AND MONSTERS,''  &LR; starring Ian McKellen and Brendan
Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a
performance that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the
year, McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing
the gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).

 &HT;    BRITISH TV TO PAY LEWINSKY FOR INTERVIEW
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (e) Entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Monica Lewinsky has agreed to tell all to Britons in
early January in a paid-for-TV appearance to be broadcast on an
independent station based in London.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal signed in California late Wednesday night, the former
White House intern embroiled in a sex scandal with President
Clinton agreed to be paid 400,000 pounds -- about US$670,000 -- for
a one-hour, no-holds-barred interview on Britain's Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   The station announced the deal Thursday and said the interview
will be conducted in the United States sometime in the next few
weeks by Jon Snow, a widely known interviewer in Britain. It is
expected to be aired early next year.
</P>
<P>
   David Lloyd, the station's head of news, current affairs and
business, expressed triumph in announcing the deal after a month of
trans-Atlantic negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real coup for Channel 4,'' Lloyd said. ``Jon Snow is
one of the most respected broadcast journalists in Britain, and his
questions to Monica Lewinsky will be both tough and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the negotiations confirmed the amount to
be paid Lewinsky, who required the station to keep the financial
details secret.
</P>
<P>
   By paying Lewinsky, Channel 4 officials said they believe they
will be assured of her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say what you like about the journalism of it, but it
does give us a certain amount of freedom,'' said spokesman Martin
Stott. ``As far as we're concerned, there are no editorial limits
to what we can ask her. And Monica Lewinsky has placed no limits on
where we can go with this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The station, which purchased worldwide rights to the interview,
intends to recoup much, if not all, of what it pays Lewinsky by
selling the special to TV markets around the world. Even though the
Monica story has been covered in the British media with inescapable
and sometimes tawdry thoroughness, Channel 4 officials are
convinced the topic remains a rich mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective this is a commercial deal,'' Stott said.
``Our initial conversations with broadcasters around the world lead
us to believe that there is a massive amount of interest in Monica
Lewinsky with her telling the story in her own words to the
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The source familiar with the negotiations said Lewinsky had to
get clearance from Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr before she
could agree to the interview. Her immunity agreement included a
no-talk provision.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast in Britain will follow an interview conducted by a
U.S. network, reportedly ABC featuring Barbara Walters, to be
broadcast in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Channel 4 interview will be produced by Mentorn Barraclough
Carey, the large independent production company behind a searing
three-part series titled ``The Clintons -- A Marriage of Power.''
</P>
<P>
   With her and her family's legal bills and other debts related to
the Clinton affair well in excess of $2 million, Lewinsky and her
representatives have been actively marketing her story to British
broadcasters, who think nothing about paying for such an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance on an American network would be for free, because
major U.S. networks don't pay for interviews. The Lewinsky camp has
been fielding interview offers for some time, including ones from
Oprah Winfrey and Roseanne Barr, but both foundered.

 UNDATED: housekeeper (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``HAPPINESS,''  &LR; starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip
Seymour Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not
rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his ``Welcome to
the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores
loneliness in his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous touches _
none more so than its title _ come easily to ``Happiness,'' and so
do the dark secrets that would surely have brought it an NC-17
rating. No point in cataloging this film's perverse details: What
emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban
characters seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to
make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally
dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a
three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy
portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a respected
doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``HOME FRIES,''  &LR; starring Drew Barrymore. Directed by Dean
Parisot (PG-13, 105 minutes). An absurdist satire of sex, sibling
rivalry, Oedipal ties, homicidal jealousy, fast food and
helicopters in the American heartland, ``Home Fries'' isn't funny
enough in its particulars to make you break up laughing, but at
least it tries for a sophistication beyond the typical gross-out
Hollywood comedy. Most of the humor comes from the collision of
caricatures that suggest refugees from ``Tobacco Road,'' reinvented
for a '90s version of the classic '70s sitcom ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman.'' Ms. Barrymore, who is winsome throughout, plays a very
pregnant server at a burger outlet who falls in love with the
stepson of her recently deceased married lover (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,''  &LR; directed by and starring Roberto
Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to
find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his
risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly
entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks
with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the
maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines
as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and
no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MEET JOE BLACK,''  &LR; starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and
Claire Forlani. Directed by Martin Brest (PG-13, 170 minutes).
Hopkins zestily plays a noble tycoon in this otherwise somnolent,
emotion-free, nearly three-hour (!) weepie. And Pitt appears
blankly as Death with blond highlights, serving as a kind of
personal afterlife trainer to the tycoon, whose number is up. Ms.
Forlani plays the big man's beautiful daughter in a story based on
``Death Takes a Holiday.'' In a suffocatingly lavish film that
cries out for a trip to the cutting room, virtually every character
is allowed to overstay his or her welcome, with Pitt especially
diminished by the watching-paint-dry pace. The story drags on so
slowly that there's room for a subplot about party planning, and
several scenes establish how much Death loves peanut butter
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``PLEASANTVILLE,''  &LR; starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon,
Joan Allen, William Macy, Don Knotts, J.T. Walsh and Jeff Daniels.
Written and directed by Gary Ross (PG-13, 116 minutes). This
cleverly executed fantasy, with a back-to-the-future trip into the
small-town, squeaky-clean paradise of a 1950s television show,
tends toward the black and white, visually and otherwise. The
missionary zeal with which teen-agers from the 1990s try to awaken
benighted '50s types from their slumber is an attitude that wears
thin. But in the meantime there are witty tricks integrating color
into black-and-white images, and nice little touches abound. The
cast is poignant and amusing, with Ms. Allen especially touching as
a pre-feminist housewife who's the prime recipient of '90s
hindsight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``VERY BAD THINGS,''  &LR; starring Jon Favreau, Christian Slater,
Cameron Diaz and Daniel Stern. Directed by Peter Berg (R, 100
minutes). A film that means to make the most of black-humored
misanthropy had better be funnier than this mirthless exercise in
witlessness and sadistic humor. Five dull middle-class buddies
accidentally kill a prostitute while at a bachelor party in Las
Vegas, and that's only the beginning of the fun. While it's
possible to share the screenplay's eagerness to see these
unappetizing guys wind up dead, the direction reveals so little
point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies. Ms.
Diaz, so cleverly funny in ``There's Something About Mary,'' plays
a wedding-obsessed ninny this time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``WAKING NED DEVINE,''  &LR; starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and
Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings, and who unite the town's
cast of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning
career directing television commercials means that everyone here is
an amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the
septuagenarian stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for
all they're worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The
Full Monty,'' but it knows how to coax laughs from making a
spectacle of elderly gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE WATERBOY,''  &LR; starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates and
Fairuza Balk. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG-13, 91 minutes). The
team behind ``The Wedding Singer'' looks like honorary Farrelly
brothers with a comedy that, like ``There's Something About Mary,''
is both cheerfully outlandish and genuinely endearing. Sandler
plays an amazing 31-year-old freshman who morphs from
water-distribution engineer to sports hero, and he succeeds in
doing to football whatever he did to golf in ``Happy Gilmore.''
There's a lot more innocence to his happy-idiot antics here than
there is in many a film made specifically for children. Ms. Bates
is a great hoot as the waterboy's overprotective mama, perfectly in
tune with the film's sneaky sense of fun (Maslin).

 &HT;    Arkansas baker has a gift for pie _ and fans all across America
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DE VALLS BLUFF, Ark._ You've heard of gardeners who talk to
their plants? Mary Thomas talks to her pies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the undisputed pie queen of eastern Arkansas, runs the
Family Pie Shop, an out-of-the-way bakery in this blink-and-miss-it
town between Memphis and Little Rock. She works long hours alone,
which probably explains why she talks to herself and, on occasion,
converses with the pastry.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of nights before Thanksgiving, she opened the oven door
and glared at half a dozen egg custard pies that weren't baking
fast enough to suit her. ``Get done now,'' she instructed them as
if they were children dragging their feet getting ready for school.
``Y'all are holding up the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, she returned to her flour-dusted countertop. There
were crusts to roll, custards to mix, sweet potatoes to peel _
dozens of holiday orders to fill. This time of year, people will go
over the river and through the woods to get their hands on a good
pie.
</P>
<P>
   Pie has always been one of this country's favorite desserts,
derived from the English but by now as American as you-know-what.
Southern cooks have put a distinctive exclamation point on this
tradition. When you think about the pies associated with this
region _ bourbon pecan pie, Mississippi mud pie, buttermilk lemon
chess pie, to name a few _ you'd have to admit that Southerners
have a weakness for desserts that talk loud and smile big. We like
the last course to have personality.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders are amused by our tendency to go over the top when it
comes to pies. Jane and Michael Stern, the New England couple who
wrote the book on road food, know exactly where to go when they
crave a wedge of something seriously sweet. As they put it, ``We
have eaten Key lime pies in Florida and wild blackberry pies in
Oregon, blueberry pies in Maine and sour cream raisin pies in Iowa,
but the place we like eating pies the best is the South, where love
of sweets (is) a regional obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why people who have never before been to Arkansas know
to stop by Thomas' bakery. Some years back, the Sterns were driving
down U.S. 70, across the flat, chocolatey soil of the Delta, when
they happened upon the Family Pie Shop. They listed it in one of
their guidebooks, and salivating travelers haven't stopped
detouring off I-40.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is whipping meringue when the screen door flies open and
in walks a couple headed from Houston to Indianapolis for
Thanksgiving. ``We just love to eat,'' say Morton and Marie Large
(no wisecracks, please) as they shovel into a chocolate cream pie.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the screen door whaps again and Terry
Presley of Huntsville, Texas, appears with a cooler and an order
for three pies and six fried pies. She's doing research of a sort.
``I pride myself on my pies,'' she says. ``I mean, I never use a
frozen pie shell, because if you aren't going to make a crust,
what's the point? You're just making pudding. I'm here because my
brother told me that this place makes a better coconut pie than I
do. I told him, `Thanks a lot _ how do I get there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder anyone finds the place. The bakery is behind
Thomas' modest brick home, in a cinderblock building that used to
be her husband's workshop. The only clue that it's a business is
``PIE SHOP'' spray-painted on the wall in uneven letters, looking
less like a sign than a polite act of graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there's a cramped dining room with three stools, two
card tables and a church calendar. The kitchen, on the other side
of a pass-through window, has a plastic garbage can full of sugar
and a battered black stove that looks like it ought to be in a
living-history museum. Thomas bought it used from a school
cafeteria 20 years ago; it keeps the room so warm that her glasses
keep sliding down her nose, making her look like she's always
raising her eyebrows over something. When she's busy, puttering
around the concrete floor and muttering to herself, every available
surface seems to be covered by pies in various stages of assembly.
The biggest sellers are coconut cream, sweet potato and Karo-nut,
the term she and many other Arkansans use for pecan pie (as if
there were a tree that produced nuts and syrup).
</P>
<P>
   Thomas grew up in a sharecropping family of 13 children and has
been cooking for a living most of her 64 years. She worked for
decades at Craig's, a barbecue joint across the street from her
house, where she became well-known for her pies. In 1977, she and
her husband, a cook on Mississippi River paddlewheelers, opened the
bakery. He died five years later, and she has run the business
since then by herself, with help from her daughter, Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them have something of a road-food roadblock going on
U.S. 70. Joyce and her husband now manage Craig's, selling mama's
pies and referring customers across the road to the bakery. Mama,
of course, just happens to know a good place for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   One of their best customers, not surprisingly, was a certain
governor. ``I've seen Bill Clinton out there in front of Craig's a
hundred times,'' Thomas says. ``He'd sit in his limousine and send
one of his people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her customers, though, are not just passing through.
They're local people who are just as busy, in their way, as a
governor or a traveler who has to make Memphis by nightfall. Thomas
knows who pays her bills. ``I make pies for ladies who work in
factories and don't have time to make pies,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But there's at least one working lady in town she doesn't make
pies for: herself. Thomas will nibble at peach cobbler, but she
never much liked pie. She'd rather eat cake.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did she fashion a career out of making other people's
pies?
</P>
<P>
   She breaks into a grin and runs her thumbs across her
fingertips. ``Money, money, money,'' she says. When you grow up
sharecropping, what you want out of life more than anything else is
a piece of the pie _ and she doesn't mean sweet potatoes.

   Asking Mary Thomas for a recipe is like pumping a three-star
general for information about troop strength. Her lips are zipped.
One time, she remembers, a Memphis reporter drove over to De Valls
Bluff, Ark., on an apparent mission to reveal the secrets of the
Family Pie Shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her she could keep asking slick questions all day long,
but I wasn't going to be tricked,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And she still isn't talking. The only secret we learned was that
she uses shortening, not butter, in her indescribably flaky crust.
Fortunately, other pie makers are more forthcoming.

   Irene Wassell, food editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,
grew up in a family of dedicated pie eaters where it wasn't
uncommon for the six of them to polish off three pies in one
sitting. This recipe, from her book ``Best of Irene Wassell,'' is a
Depression-era pie that her mother made when chocolate and coconut
weren't always
</P>
<P>
   plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 3/4 cup plus
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided use
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk, divided use

   1 (9-inch) pie crust, baked
</P>
<P>
   Place egg yolks in a small bowl, and the whites in the small
bowl of an electric mixer; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy skillet, heat 1/2 cup sugar until it melts and is a
light caramel color. Slowly pour about 1 cup of the milk into the
melted sugar. The sugar may crystallize; stir and continue heating
until the sugar dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy saucepan, combine remaining 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup
sugar, the cornstarch and salt. Stir until cornstarch dissolves.
Add caramelized sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring, until
mixture thickens.
</P>
<P>
   Dip a few spoonfuls of the thickened mixture, one spoonful at a
time, into the egg yolks and mix well. Stir egg yolk mixture into
thickened mixture. Cook slowly 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from
heat and add butter and vanilla; stir until butter melts. Pour into
baked pie crust.
</P>
<P>
   Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 2
tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Spread evenly on
top of pie filling and bake at 350 degrees until golden brown,
about 10 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons for the name. First, it's one of those
crustless pies that miraculously forms its own shell while baking.
Second, it's one of those recipes, such as Scripture Cake, in which
each ingredient can be found in a Bible verse. (Except for vanilla
extract, which apparently does not appear in the Good Book.) From
the Georgia Agriculture Department cookbook ``The Best of Georgia
Farms.''

Blend thoroughly. Pour into a 10-inch pie plate that has been
greased and floured. Bake for 60 minutes. A crust will form on the
bottom, with pie filling in the center and a coconut topping above.

   The South's most famous pie has to be pecan. Some chefs try to
make it less cloyingly sweet by using darker syrups or cutting down
on the syrup altogether. Other chefs take the opposite tack and
pile on the yummy stuff. Tim Patridge, director of the food and
beverage program at Morris Brown College, falls into the second
group with this family recipe, which he remembers from his Georgia
childhood. And, please, no chopped-up nuts. ``I use pecan halves,
not those chopped-up things that get caught in your teeth,'' he
says.

TOSHIBA AND FUJITSU ANNOUNCE JOINT VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Raising the stakes in the race to develop the next
generation of computer memory chips, Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.
announced a joint venture Thursday that they said should allow both
companies to reduce costs and development time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aim to have one plus one equal three,'' Kazunari Shirai,
senior vice president of Fujitsu, said at a news conference
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will invest more than 30 billion yen, or $250
million, to jointly develop technology to manufacture dynamic
random-memory access chips. They expect the new technology to be
incorporated in manufacturing microprocessors and other types of
computer chips whose functions go beyond those of a plain memory
chip, saying its diversification beyond personal computers was
``essential'' given the high costs of development.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement immediately spurred speculation that the venture
might lead to a merger, a suggestion the two companies did not
immediately dismiss. Toshiba is making drastic moves, by Japanese
standards, to reorganize its bloated business empire, including
some small mergers; Fujitsu realigned its business a few years ago
and is now the most profitable Japanese high-technology company.
</P>
<P>
   Koichi Suzuki, vice president in charge of Toshiba's
semiconductor group, said there were no plans for more extensive
ties but noted the intense competition that has eroded and in some
cases even erased profit margins across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term megacompetition has been used quite often recently,''
he said. ``If such factors do prompt it, we will consider'' a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the rising need for cost-efficient
development processes drove them together. Suzuki said that IBM and
Siemens had also been invited to join the venture, but that they
declined.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred engineers from both companies will work to create a
1-gigabit memory chip using 0.13 micron processing technology at
Toshiba's Advanced Microelectronics Center.

   FBC-SEC-CHAMPIONSHIP _ ATLANTA _ The SEC championship game has
served as a springboard to the national championship in the past,
and it appears to be the same this year. Tennessee is unbeaten and
ranked No. 1 in the nation and will secure a spot in the national
title game with a victory over Mississippi State. In the first SEC
title game in 1992, Alabama used the SEC title as a springboard to
its last national championship. Florida advanced to the national
title game after winning the SEC title, losing to Nebraska in '95
and defeating Florida State in '96. Tennessee had its shot at a
national championship after winning the SEC last year, but lost to
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. A look at the SEC title game and its

   CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Trying to outline an agenda for the
106th Congress of cutting taxes, fixing schools and preserving
Social Security, Republican leaders of the House and Senate could
not avoid the I-word Thursday. ``Is there a question other than on
impeachment that we could maybe (answer)?'' wondered Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott as reporters asked repeatedly about
coming developments in the congressional investigation of President
Clinton. ``No,'' replied a voice from the journalistic horde
crowded into Lott's Senate office. ``Nuts!'' laughed House
Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, who clearly indicated that he
would like the thorny issue settled before he officially replaces
Newt Gingrich when the new Congress convenes Jan. 6. (Dart, Cox

   POLMONEY _ WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission prepared
Thursday to reject its staff's recommendation that 1996
presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole repay millions of
dollars in federal matching funds. The formal vote will be next
Wednesday or Thursday, but a daylong debate made it clear that
there are enough votes to block approval of the finding that Dole
and Clinton used party-paid TV ads to evade spending limits. The
impending decision illustrates the weaknesses of the current system
of policing campaign finance. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   LIVESTOCK-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ More than 30 states _ including

That's how close NASA came to launching shuttle Endeavour Thursday
morning. NASA hoped to try again early today (FRIDAY) to launch
Endeavour after a last-minute cockpit alarm caused launch
controllers to scrub a pre-dawn lift-off Thursday, space agency
officials said. Endeavour's mission is to rendezvous with an
unmanned Russian power station that is already in orbit to begin
construction of the $60 billion International Space Station. Launch
Director Ralph Roe stopped the countdown as time ran out on a
narrow 10-minute window in which the shuttle must launch each day

window by between one and two seconds,'' Roe told a news

promise a legal challenge if the school system decides to proceed.
School officials say no decision has been made, and they're still
gathering information on the pros and cons. If Brookville goes

chaplain. The idea pushes the envelope about religion in the

flags festoon every street. Trucks blare music and rhetoric day and
night. Staccato blasts of firecrackers signal a candidate's arrival

bemoan ``vote-buying'' estimated at $50 a voter or more. And
doctors, teachers, old folks, laborers -- people of all ages and
pursuits -- walk away from giant political rallies hoarse and
exhilarated from participating in one of the world's most exuberant
democracies. Officially, the Taiwanese will go to the polls on
Saturday(Dec. 5) to decide the makeup of the 225-member national
legislature, as well as elect mayors and city council members in
their two biggest cities. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

EDITORIAL: THE ESPY VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's acquittal by a jury on
corruption charges was not unexpected. The criminal case brought by
independent counsel Donald Smaltz was based on Espy's acceptance of
sports tickets, plane trips and luggage from food companies that he
regulated. But the value of the gifts totaled about $35,000, and
there was no evidence that Espy had made decisions favorable to the
companies because of the gratuities he received.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statutes that prohibit government officials from
accepting gifts do not require the showing of any quid pro quo. But
Espy argued that the gifts came from longtime personal friends,
which is allowed under the gratuities law. The tangle of
circumstances and the seemingly incidental value of some of the
favors worked against the prosecution. Indeed, the defense was so
confident in its position that it called no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict does not mean that investigating Espy's conduct was
not proper and necessary or that he should not have been forced out
of office. But the trial's outcome does call into question how well
Smaltz conducted the investigation, which has cost $17 million over
four years. While he has achieved multiple convictions and $11.5
million in fines and penalties, they mostly involve those who gave
the gratuities. This case will probably be used by critics of the
Independent Counsel Act to justify changes to the act to limit the
time and cost of such investigations. Such reforms will have to be
fully debated by Congress, balanced against the need to maintain a
way to hold high-ranking officials accountable for their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, who was forced to resign from the Cabinet in 1994, brought
these troubles on himself when he apparently adopted the attitude
that he could ignore the federal gratuities law. Before joining the
Clinton administration he spent six years in the House, where gifts
and favors from special interests flowed freely. Carol Browner, the
head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified at the trial
that Espy said he thought the ethics code that applies to the
executive branch was ``a bunch of junk.'' Others in the
administration find themselves under similar legal scrutiny because
they also seem to believe that the law did not apply to them.

 &HT;    They'll take tree lights now, memories later
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you move, you break things, no matter what the signs say on
the big moving vans.
</P>
<P>
   The little boys in our family didn't care about the Spode
plates, for which their mother grieved, but they are plenty put out
because a whole box of Christmas ornaments crashed. They came to
the country on Thanksgiving hoping to trudge through woods, which
we now have in short supply, and spot a Christmas tree. But what is
a tree without Christmas pretties?
</P>
<P>
   Their mother very practically mentioned popcorn and cranberry
chains, but I could see in their young faces the shine of silver
and gold and red and green glass ornaments and chains of lights.
Their mother at their age held out for Christmas lights that
bubbled and twirled. Now I looked at the boys and decided I didn't
care if I had any kind of light on Sweet Apple's tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go to the basement and look for stuff,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   And they went with alacrity. It was dusty, and many an old angel
was stained and warped. But they touched everything I hauled out of
the ornament box with a kind of reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving us this?'' the little one whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the lights and all the glass ornaments except
. . .'' I faltered. There is a red bird with a woozy tail that has
always been on my tree. ``Except,'' I said, ``the very old ones. I
want to keep the ones that people gave me or my children made when
they were your size.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a deal, they said. The ones I cling to aren't the
spectacular ones, of course. They're homemade and saggy with age.
An owl we've had for years, a frowzy dwarf with a Christmas wreath
over his shoulder, little felt animals made by children's hands.
There is a tiny music box that never made music. The older one, who
can fix anything, puttered with it a moment and, lo and behold, it
tinkled out a Christmas
</P>
<P>
   carol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it,'' I said. ``You deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The old angel we bought at Kress's at 10th Street during World
War II surfaced, and I clutched it to my heart. It was a funny
Christmas, that old one, with people we loved fighting overseas,
and rationing, and not many Christmas doodads in the stores. The
angel wasn't a grand one, a sort of token angel glued to a paper
cone, which would fit over the topmost branch of the tree. But we
thought she was lovely, and she has been on every Christmas tree
we've had since, getting more ragged and dusty as the years have
gone by.
</P>
<P>
   The little boys were interested in the candleholders that pinch
on tree branches like clothespins. Could they have them?
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, I said. Someday, when I have retired from the
Christmas tree fete and feel they are old enough to light the
little stubby candles safely. I held one in my hand and thought of
the old friends who pulled them out of their attics and sent them
to me when they learned that I was going to live in a log cabin. We
have a custom of lighting the candles with a bucket of water nearby
_ and only for the duration of one verse of ``Silent Night.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an angel with a broken arm and a Santa backed up to a
black stove. They were gifts from our neighbors when I fell off a
ladder and went through Christmas with my arm in a sling. The Santa
was my husband's, a reminder that he kept the fires going in the
chilly cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Everything reminded me of other years and other people, but the
little boys were content with strings of lights wound around rolls
of newspaper, with glass ornaments and a string of gold tinsel.
They said their thanks as they raced up the basement stairs, and I
called my thanks after them. It's good to have an excuse to sit in
the dusty basement and remember.

BUSH SAYS HE WON'T PLAY GOD WITH PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush may or may not long to be president
of the United States, but there is one role he is sure he doesn't
want _ playing God with people's religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Methodist, walked the tightrope between politics
and religion Thursday on his return from a highly publicized trip
to Israel, which had renewed interest in his views about the road
to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior
is my salvation, and I believe that,'' Bush replied to a question
about his religious beliefs at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``It's not the governor's role to decide who
goes to heaven. I believe that God decides who goes to heaven, not
George W. Bush,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a similar question five years ago, Bush said
people who do not accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior
cannot go to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, which upset many Jews, were recently revived in
recent national media reports about the governor, who now is
considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush runs for president, a decision which he insisted again
on Thursday is still up in the air, the support of Christian
fundamentalists, who share Bush's personal religious beliefs, could
be crucial in early Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor was in Israel earlier this week,
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a
major voice against anti-Semitism, said he expected Bush to clarify
his 1993 remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush said he has ``shown people that I'm a tolerant
person. And my job as governor is to use my office to promote
dialogue and discussion and mutual understanding and mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got great respect for the other religions of the world,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said Bush planned to make similar
statements in a letter to Foxman on Thursday, but the governor
declined to release copies of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returned to Austin Wednesday afternoon after an 11-day
overseas trip, had a low-key response to criticism directed at him
by Vice President Al Gore, a potential presidential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in remarks to the Democratic Leadership Council in
Washington on Wednesday, questioned the claims of Bush and other
Republicans who promise to govern with ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Compassion' is more than a pretty word. There is a long road
between rhetoric and results,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``fully jet-lagged'' when he first heard of
Gore's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing a response from his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes,
the governor added, ``What part does he object to _ the
conservative part or the compassionate part?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would define ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush
replied: ``Making sure every child can read, making sure that we
encourage faith-based organizations ... when it comes to helping
neighbors in need, making sure that our neighborhoods are safe,
making sure that the state of Texas recognizes that people from all
walks of life have got a shot at the Texas dream but, most
importantly, making sure that government is not the answer to
people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to Israel with three other Republican governors was
sponsored by the National Jewish Coalition, a Republican-oriented
lobby that backs the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. It followed a family vacation in Italy and a side trip
to Egypt, where the Texas governor had dinner with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he went to the Middle East to ``listen and learn.''
His meetings in Israel included sessions with Netanyahu, President
Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and opposition party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited the strategic Golan Heights and, he said,
learned a lot about the security needs of ``our strong friend and
ally, Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the group tried unsuccessfully to meet with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he saw ``wonderful business opportunities'' in Israel
for Texas business people. But he played down the implications of
his visit for a potential presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his round of dinners with presidents and other
high-level figures in the Middle East made him want to change his
own title, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to get on an exercise machine. I haven't
decided yet, and now is not the time to decide whether I will or
will not seek the presidency.'' &QL;

 &HT;    HEALTH: Tight-fitting sleepwear OK for kids, safety agency says
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sleeping in oversize T-shirts could create a firetrap for
children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warns. But
snug-fitting cotton pajamas, previously considered dangerous,
should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the agency advised the public that
flame-resistant pajamas were the only safe garments children should
wear to bed. However, those standards were relaxed this year, after
the commission decided that the way pajamas fit is more important
than the fabric they're made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``By fitting close to the skin, you don't have oxygen underneath
that feeds the fire,'' said Ken Giles, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, up to 300 children are burned by being near a flame _
a space heater, kitchen range or candle, for example _ while
wearing loose-fitting sleepers, the safety commission said. Hence
the warning about loose T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Flame-resistant fabrics, such as polyester, stop burning when
removed from a flame, prompting the agency's earlier warning about
fabric types. Cotton was one fabric the commission used to warn
against, because it can burn rapidly. But Giles said that is not
the case if the cotton garment is tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any burn injuries with snug-fitting cotton,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new regulations, manufacturers have begun using
new tags on snug-fitting sleepers, indicating they meet federal
safety standards. Labels that say ``Not Intended for Sleepwear''
should still be followed, the agency said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Toyota Camry zoomed up behind us on Interstate 5,
hung hard on our tail as though we were in a Nascar race, swerved
suddenly to pass on the inside, then cut sharply back into our
lane. Orest Wilson, a Washington state trooper, braked hard to
avoid a collision. It was a good way to catch his attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' he said. ``Did you see what that
knucklehead just did?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel of his unmarked Chevrolet Lumina, he sounded like
any driver who had been shoved around on the road _ except he could
take action. He flipped down the sunvisor, into which police lights
were set, switched on the siren and pulled the Camry over. He wrote
the driver up for three moving violations. The total fine was $565.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Wilson was getting to do what most drivers only wish
they could. He was an angel of justice, just waiting for someone to
display the kind of aggression that leads most people to mouth
words they would not ordinarily use. He rarely had to wait more
than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the first five troopers to serve a three-month
rotation on the Washington State Patrol's Aggressive Driver
Apprehension Team _ Adapt, for short _ which was started in June.
Seventeen states, including New York and New Jersey, have
established similar programs, most of them in the last year. All
involve the use of unmarked police cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never usually see driving like that,'' Wilson said as he
returned to cruising speed on the inside lane. ``They see a marked
car, everyone's driving the legal speed. Down the road, out goes
the halo, in comes the pitchfork.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He put his foot down on the pedal, the souped-up engine surged
smoothly up to speed, and he was following a Chevy Malibu at 90
miles an hour as it veered back and forth across five lanes of
heavy suburban traffic. He was about to pull the transgressor over
when a marked patrol car came into sight on the shoulder. The
Malibu braked hard and moved to the inside lane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' Trooper Wilson said. ``There's the halo, hands at 10
and 2, speed one mile under the limit. Well, guess who's been
following you for the last three miles ...'' He flipped on his
lights and siren. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson made 10 to 15 such stops a day during his rotation, and
he would have made far more if the paperwork didn't take twice as
long as the actual stop, or if he didn't have to wait for the
regular patrol to arrive to arrest the drivers with suspended
licenses or outstanding warrants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two days of riding with him, an observer noted that most of
the cars he stopped were small economy models: Escorts, Neons,
Civics, Rabbits, Cavaliers _ not the vehicles one might expect to
be driven most aggressively. ``Rather like small dogs snapping at
big dogs?'' his passenger suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got it,'' the trooper replied. ``It's not the car, but the
attitude that's the problem _ the idea that `I'm No. 1. What I'm
doing is more important than what you're doing. I'm the only one
that matters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though word is out on local highways that unmarked patrol cars
are on the prowl, it's still too early to tell how effective they
are. ``We need a full year of statistics first,'' said Sgt. Gary
Gasseling, the supervisor of the Adapt program. ``What we're doing
right now is reinstituting the fear factor out there: letting
violators know that the car right beside them could be a police
car. That makes them think about how they're driving. It's really
driver retraining, a mix of education and enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The unmarked patrol is not looking for just plain speeding, not
unless a driver is going more than 20 mph above the limit. ``We
leave that to the marked cars,'' Trooper Wilson said. ``We're
looking for multiple violations, the kind of driving that's either
endangering or likely to endanger others. I know they call us the
`road rage unit,' but that's when the car is intentionally used as
a weapon. We're aiming to stop aggressive driving before it reaches
that stage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Escort raced across four lanes to an exit, then wavered
before pulling over as Trooper Wilson declared his presence. ``That
makes me mad,'' he said as he stopped on the shoulder behind the
Escort. ``They've been driving like homicidal maniacs, and then
when the lights and siren are right behind them, it's: `What? You
mean me? Innocent little me?''' He got out of the car grim-faced;
the Escort driver was in for a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, the trooper keeps perfectly cool. ``The
only time I lose it is when kids are involved in a crash,'' he
said. ``That upsets me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were no children in the collision that occurred on the
second day a reporter rode with him. Just a 40-year-old woman and
her 18-year-old daughter. They had been in the fast lane going
north on the interstate, swerved to avoid a car that cut in front
of them, lost control, bounced and rolled over the grass median.
Their car was then hit, broadside, by a minivan traveling south.
Their bodies now lay beside what was left of a Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the southbound lanes were closed while uniformed
troopers did the lengthy on-site examination required for all fatal
crashes, and traffic backed up for miles. To get out of the jam,
frustrated drivers were crossing the median and turning into the
fast lane of the northbound traffic. Trooper Wilson picked them off
as they made the turn. Each would pay a $337 fine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it's just common sense that you wouldn't want to
turn into a lane of traffic traveling at 70 miles an hour,''
Trooper Wilson said grimly. ``There's going to be another crash
here. I guarantee it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It happened just a couple of minutes later, but not in the way
he'd expected. A car had angled out of the line of stalled traffic
to make a U-turn on the median just as a motorcylist was riding
along illegally on the shoulder. One could see the impression of
the biker's body on the driver's door of the car, a Hyundai whose
license plate frame read ``How's my driving?'' above the plate
number, answered by a vulgarity below it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice plate holder,'' said Trooper Wilson, coolly sardonic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biker would live, though the medics said they doubted he'd
walk again. ``I have no sympathy,'' the trooper declared. ``You
recognize that bike? He was on the shoulder five minutes back, when
I was writing up another ticket. I warned him to get back in
lane.'' He shrugged, tight-lipped. ``That's the end of aggressive
driving for him.''

RELIGIOUS LEADERS' DOCUMENT RIDICULES AUSTIN, TEXAS, AS BEING IN
DENIAL ABOUT ITS RACISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ This Texas capital city, sometimes ridiculed for its
quirky liberalism, is actually in denial about its innate racism,
according to a remarkable document issued by the white mayor and
signed by 25 religious leaders of different races.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Austinites can no longer deny the reality of racist
laws, institutions, customs and conditioned reflexes,'' according
to the boldly worded ``Commitment to Racial Reconciliation''
drafted by local religious leaders representing a diverse spectrum
of faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be recognized that the continuing reality of racist
attitudes and practices still plagues our community in the present
and will curse our future unless we abandon them now,'' the
three-page statement continued.
</P>
<P>
   Signers of the statement, which was released this week, pledged
to ``repent and seek forgiveness for racist beliefs, attitudes and
behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sterling Lands, a black pastor at the Greater Calvary
Baptist Church and one framer of the statement, said racism must be
understood in terms of ``the superior group versus the perceived
inferior group'' while ``ignorance and greed is the driving
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the statement, written after Mayor Kirk Watson asked
religious leaders to help heal racial divisions, has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it was ever intended to say that white people
hate black people or anything like that,'' Watson said. ``Instead,
I think it is a call that we need to recognize that there still is
racial prejudice and there is racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, an anti-affirmative action group blasted the
declaration as ``divisive and horribly misnamed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From reading this document, one would think we are currently
living in the 1950s where there was rampant and immoral government
enforced racial segregation,'' said Marc Levin, executive director
of the group, Campaign for a Color-Blind America.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, a 1998 graduate of the University of Texas, said the only
``overtly racist'' laws in Austin are those that impose racial
quotas in favor of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown did not immediately respond when asked
if he had any comment on the Austin statement.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the statement was variously praised as a breakthrough
or berated as ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great misconception that Austin is a liberal city ...
It's true a white person knows very little of what a minority
experiences in this red-neck Bubba land,'' commented one e-mail
signed ``me,'' after the Austin-American Statesman invited readers
to post comments on its Website.
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail that closed with, &UR;  &LR; ``it'll all be sorted out when
we die anyway,'' expressed a commonly heard frustration: ``So,
what's the point? ... You live like a racist, you get labeled a
racist. You don't live like a racist, you get labeled a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Negative reactions, in particular, are evidence that many whites
in the community do not see racism for what it is, said Larry
Bethune, the white pastor of the University Baptist Church. The
struggling church, a pioneer in fighting racial segregation during
the 1940s, made news earlier this year for welcoming openly gay
Baptists into its fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history whose effects remain and one of the biggest
problems in dealing with that is the denial by many that such a
problem exists. I think that's been confirmed by a lot of the
reaction I've heard on talk shows and have seen on Web pages,''
Bethune said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said Thursday he had no regrets about issuing the
document or seeking help from religious leaders on a such a touchy
subject rooted in morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly think it is very difficult to lead on issues like
that when you're raised a white male in Texas. Let's face it,''
said Watson, an attorney and environmentalist who was elected mayor
just last year. He said he's intrigued that some people are
reacting to the statement by demanding measurable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious community appreciates and understands you're not
going to get a measurable result. It addresses issues of hope and
forgiveness and those sorts of issues better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement points out that the city's racial segregation is
most obviously symbolized by Interstate 35, which divides the
disadvantaged east side where most blacks live from the western
half of town where more prosperous whites live. The document
focuses attention on white sins, drafters said, because it defines
racism as racial prejudice combined with power.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he decided to seek some form of reconciliation to
help heal wounds of racial discord from the 1997 city council
election.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he sought to ease bitter feelings still lingering after 80
Austin police and mostly black teen-agers clashed at a 1995
Valentine's Day party in east Austin. Police were cleared of
brutality allegations but Watson and others negotiated a settlement
with the party-goers. It included scholarships, job training and a
review of police training.
</P>
<P>
   Former City Councilman Eric Mitchell, who is black, was not
impressed by the statement of racial reconciliation. He called
Watson an ``insincere political opportunist'' Thursday on the local
``Sammy and Bob'' talk radio show, which specializes in redneck
schtick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying the context in which it is offered sort of damages
the dialogue,'' said Mitchell, who lost re-election to another
black candidate in the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell blamed his defeat on racism after earlier insulting his
opponent Willie Lewis with a racial epithet similar to calling
someone an ``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the only politician who signed the racial
reconciliation document, which many say was meant to be a statement
of spiritual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who still says white leaders in the city wanted to
silence him for being too strong an advocate for his black
constituents, had also accused liberal environmentalists on the
city council of being racist. &QL;

BUSH AGAIN DOWNPLAYS PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday his recent
trip to the Middle East did not push his presidential ambitions one
way or the other and that he remained undecided on whether to seek
the Republican nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought to downplay talk about whether he would run for
president, but the three-day trip to Israel, followed by some
veiled criticism from Vice President Al Gore, has done nothing to
squelch the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided yet,'' Bush said a day after returning to
Texas. ``Now is not the time to decide whether I will or will not
seek the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly re-elected governor said he wants to enjoy the
holidays, finish his inauguration speech and prepare the
state-of-the-state address he will deliver to the Legislature next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I've got a job to do as governor of this
state,'' Bush told a news conference. ``My job is to get a
legislative agenda through.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said repeatedly he would not decide about running for the
presidency until sometime next year. He is widely viewed as the
leading Republican candidate, with some polls showing the eldest
son of former President George Bush defeating Gore _ the
presumptive Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   During the whirlwind tour, Bush and three other Republican
governors met with Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and top Israeli Cabinet ministers. Additionally,
he talked to opposition Labor leader Ehub Barak, and toured
Jerusalem's walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The governors also took a helicopter tour with Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, but they canceled a trip to a contested West Bank
Jewish settlement, reportedly after being advised to do so by the
U.S. Embassy. The settlements are a major issue of controversy in
effects to reach a lasting peace between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was organized by the National Jewish Coalition, a
Republican lobbying group whose views on the peace process are
similar to Netanyahu's conservative government. Bush said the group
tried to arrange a meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
but Arafat was in the United States at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to listen and learn, and I learned a lot. I
learned a lot about the history of Israel and the history of our
particular religion and the history of religions that are now the
dominant religions of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the trip personal, offering no hint as to what his
policy on the Middle East would be should he become president.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this issue or any other issue related to Israel, the
appropriate time to develop and lay out a comprehensive foreign
policy will be when and if I decide to run for the presidency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush doesn't yet consider himself a presidential
candidate, he was treated like one Wednesday by Gore, who
criticized the governor's and other Republicans' claims of being
``compassionate conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassion is more than a pretty word. There is a long road
between rhetoric and results,'' Gore said in a keynote address to
the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore is entitled to every opinion he wants to have,'' Bush
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What part does he object to _ the conservative part or the
compassionate part?'' Bush asked.

 &HT;    TNT's `Houdini' robs its subject of any magic
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real magic would be if TNT turned ``Houdini'' into a movie worth
watching.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when Fox specials show us how a rabbit is pulled from
a hat, ``Houdini'' reveals how a network can take what looks like
an after-school special and turn it into prime-time entertainment.
It transforms the rich, spooky life of our most celebrated magician
into a simple-minded, simply ridiculous biography. It's the kind of
magic that makes viewers disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth be damned,'' Houdini narrates at the start, and
writer/director/executive producer Pen Densham (1996's ``Moll
Flanders'') takes his subject at his word. Despite clumsy nods to
Houdini's complex ego, his wife's complex alcoholism and the
magician's complex relationship with magic, ``Houdini'' is
satisfied with a paint-by-number portrait that, basically, tells us
Houdini had his faults.
</P>
<P>
   It's old-fashioned that way and even a little edgy _ if you're a
9-year-old looking to kill time before doing homework. The early
magic scenes _ a young Houdini pulling a thread and needles from
his mouth _ are indeed magical, enjoying the advantage of not
having to be real.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not 9 _ say, you're 10 _ you might already assume
that Houdini, like the rest of us, wasn't perfect and hope for
something more.
</P>
<P>
   The movie alternates between a radio broadcast seance held by
the magician's widow (Stacy Edwards) in an effort to reach Houdini
in the great beyond and the unfolding of the magician's life. That
life is a classically inspiring rags-to-riches tale, and Johnathon
Schaech (``That Thing You Do'') as Houdini plays his part with all
the eager-beaver emoting of the lead in your high school play.
</P>
<P>
   Those early years, in which Ehrich Weiss (who adopted the stage
name Harry Houdini from a book he read) and his brother Theo (Mark
Ruffalo) begin a magic act in New York City, are full of such
time-honored slogans as ``Stay in school!'' and ``Take a chance!''
</P>
<P>
   Houdini ignores the first but holds tight to the second.
Struggling as an unmemorable magician, he gets his break in the
form of advice from an agent named Martin Beck, played as if born
for the role by George Segal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen everything. You have to jerk them out of their
seats,'' Beck tells Houdini, pushing him toward the kind of
death-defying illusions that would mark his career and end his
life.
</P>
<P>
   When Houdini follows this advice by becoming an escape artist, a
pleased Beck tells him afterward, ``See my lawyers tomorrow.
They'll give you a contract you won't get out of so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie shows Houdini's rise and fall _ a rise to
international renown and a fall laid by his audience's
expectations, as well as Houdini's consuming crusade against
mediums who claim to talk to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The movie never decides whether to enhance or debunk the
magician's self-created myth, so it ends up doing neither. By the
end, you just wish ``Houdini'' would make itself disappear.

   SUNDAY 1:01 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (6-6) AT NEW YORK JETS (8-4)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Kitna, who last week started in place of an
ineffective Warren Moon, guided Seattle to a thrilling
come-from-behind 20-18 victory over Tennessee. Don't look for those
types of heroics against the Jets. Before last week's start, Kitna
had started just two games in two years in Seattle. His head will
be spinning by the time he's finished looking at all the defensive
combinations that Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick will
throw his way. The Jets have hit their stride with a multiple
offense that features a rejuvenated Curtis Martin at running back
and two big weapons in receivers Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne
Chrebet. Johnson has a sore hamstring that could limit him in the
game. But it won't stop the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK 31-13.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO (7-5) AT CINCINNATI (2-10)
</P>
<P>
   By the time the game rolls around, the Bills will have had a
week to accept those two awful calls by the officials that led to
their loss to New England last Sunday. Having the opportunity to
beat up on a team like Cincinnati should take some of the sting
away. The Bengals got the practice week off to a rousing start.
Defensive back Tremaine Mack was sentenced to 365 days in jail for
driving under the influence of alcohol in October and is gone for
the season. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell has been inserted back into
the starting lineup, replacing a two-game experiment with Paul
Justin. Justin is back to No. 3, behind Jeff Blake. The Bengals are
in no shape to contend with the angry Bills. BUFFALO 23-10.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (8-4) AT NEW ORLEANS (5-7)
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goes into this game without either of its starting
cornerbacks. Kevin Smith is out for 2-3 weeks with a back injury
and Deion Sanders has a fractured big toe on his left foot. Things
are so bad for the Cowboys battered secondary that they went out
and re-signed cornerback Larry Brown this week. Brown was Super
Bowl MVP for the Cowboys three years ago, left the team to sign a
free-agent contract (five years, $12.5 million) with Oakland in
1996 and was waived by the Raiders last year. Brown will earn
$76,000, plus a playoff bonus if the team makes it. The Cowboys,
23d in the league in pass defense, have given up 984 yards and nine
touchdowns passing in the last three games, so they can use any
help they can get. The Saints, still clinging to fading playoff
hopes, won't be able to beat Dallas. Coach Mike Ditka is talking
about playing rookies, a sure sign that they're waving the white
flag in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS 19-7.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (5-7) AT JACKSONVILLE (9-3)
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Tony Boselli is listed as doubtful with a sprained
ankle. Boselli had trouble walking earlier in the week, so there's
a good chance he won't be pushing any Lion defenders around Sunday.
The bad news for Detroit is that Ben Coleman is a capable
replacement. Coleman replaced Boselli last year when he was out
four games with another ankle sprain. The Lions are coming off 10
days rest, after having beaten Pittsburgh with the help of that
botched overtime coin toss on Thanksgiving Day. But they'll be
hurting in the secondary, because free safety Mark Carrier is out
with a strained left foot. The Lions still have an outside chance
of making the playoffs, but the Jaguars will put a damper on their
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE 28-12.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (2-10) AT ATLANTA (10-2)
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler practiced this week for the
first time since spraining his ankle on Nov. 22 against the Bears
and expects to play against the Colts. The Falcons average 27.1
points a game when Chandler plays. Last week was the first time the
Falcons have won without Chandler at quarterback in the last two
years. Running back Jamal Anderson has been crucial, also.
Indianapolis running back Marshall Faulk has a chance to have 1,000
yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving this season. He accounts
for 45.8 percent of the Colts net yards and he leads the league in
total yards from scrimmage (1,823). Faulk needs to average 54 yards
receiving in his last four games to reach the milestone. The
Falcons have already clinched a playoff berth, but don't expect
them to take it easy on the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA 33-20.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND (7-5) AT PITTSBURGH (7-5)
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe has been resting his broken right index finger this
week. He needed to. The Patriots have relied upon late touchdown
passes by Bledsoe to pull out victories in their last two games.
New England's rushing attack has averaged just 85 yards in the last
two games. The rookie running back Robert Edwards has been doing a
slow slide. In his first six games he rushed for 483 yards and six
touchdowns. In his last six games he has rushed for 222 yards and
one touchdown. Things don't get any easier against Pittsburgh,
which is No. 9 in the NFL against the run. Last year in the
playoffs, the Patriots shut down Jerome Bettis and dared
quarterback Kordell Stewart to beat them. Pittsburgh won, 7-6. Look
for the Patriots to deploy the same strategy. This time they'll
win.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND 25-17.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (5-7) AT WASHINGTON (3-9)
</P>
<P>
   Redskins president John Kent Cooke said he'll wait until after
the season to decide what to do about Coach Norv Turner and General
Manager Charlie Casserly, if he still owns the team by then. A
group of seven investors has bid $650 million, according to
published reports. If that group is successful, it's unlikely
they'll keep Turner, who is 29-46-1 in five years as Redskins
coach. Running back Terry Allen could return from a sprained ankle
that has sidelined him for four weeks. Unfortunately, it's not in
time to help Turner. In San Diego, Coach June Jones is trying to
get the word interim removed from his title. But the Chargers have
to win impressively in their last few games for that to happen.
Quarterback Craig Whelihan can still help Jones, but he has got to
do better than the five interceptions he threw against Denver last
week. The Chargers have scored 20 points just once this year and
the Redskins are 5-0 against San Diego all-time. San Diego won't
need much to change their history against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO 19-7.

   SAN FRANCISCO (8-3) AT CAROLINA (2-10)
</P>
<P>
   The loss of defensive tackle Bryant Young, who broke the tibia
and fibula against the Giants on Monday night, leaves a gaping hole
in the middle of the 49ers defense. A few of the players are still
shaken by the sight of Young breaking his leg. But San Francisco is
good at making adjustments and focusing on the task at hand. The
49ers are a game back of the Falcons in the NFC West and can't
afford to falter now. The Panthers were stunned by the Jets last
week and won't recover this week. Running back Fred Lane has been
suspended for making an obscene gesture to the fans at Giants
Stadium. His absence won't have any effect on the lowest-ranked
rushing offense in the NFL (72.2 yards a game). He'll be replaced
by Tshimanga Biakabutuka, the 1996 first-round pick, who has 50
yards and 14 carries this season.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO 38-10.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4:15 p.m. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK GIANTS (4-7) AT ARIZONA (6-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have spent the week in the desert. Presumably, they
haven't been wandering around trying to find their offense, which
they left in San Francisco. New York failed on three scoring
opportunities inside the 49ers 25 yard line on Monday night. The
Cardinals are a reminder of just how far the Giants have fallen.
New York smashed Arizona, 34-7, earlier this year and have gone 1-4
since. Meanwhile, the Cardinals are talking about making a playoff
run. They have a one-game lead on Detroit, Tampa Bay and New
Orleans for the final NFC wild-card spot. The Cardinals signed
kicker Chris Jacke, the former Packer, to replace Joe Nedney who
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee after a kickoff
against the Chiefs last week. Jacke has made 77.2 percent of his
field goals. The Giants will be left high and dry in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA 27-19.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY (5-7) AT DENVER (12-0)
</P>
<P>
   The last time these two teams played, the Chiefs lost their
composure on the Broncos' final touchdown drive and committed five
personal fouls. Linebacker Derrick Thomas drew a suspension for
yanking on the facemask of Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe. Chiefs
owner Lamar Hunt said the team had disgraced itself and the city.
This has always been a bitter rivalry. In the last four games the
two teams have played, Chiefs players have been fined, dismissed or
suspended. Don't expect things to have cooled down much in this
game. Add to that Denver's unblemished record and run for an
undefeated season and you've got a volatile mixture. The Chiefs
didn't have any answers last time and they don't have any this
time.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER 36-11.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (8-4) AT OAKLAND (7-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders jumped out to a 7-3 record and now they've hit the
skids. This is a scary scenerio for the Raiders, because they can
remember 1995 when they got out to an 8-2 record and didn't win
another game. The signs of trouble are there. During halftime of
their loss to the Redskins last week some Raiders players were
tearing into each other. Quarterback Jeff George, who has been
plagued by a torn groin muscle much of the year, was moving stiffly
in the game last week and was yanked. He didn't complain. George
called it quits for the season Wednesday. The Dolphins will be
without right guard Kevin Donnalley (arthoscopic knee surgery). It
won't hurt. Miami is in the groove right now, tied with the Jets
for first place in the AFC East. They won't lose ground this week.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (5-7) AT TENNESSEE (6-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers have dim playoff hopes, while the light is flickering
on Ravens coach Ted Marchibroda's tenure in Baltimore. Tennessee is
in much better shape for this game than the Ravens, who will be
without receiver Michael Jackson (shoulder and foot injuries) and
Jermaine Lewis (sprained ankle). The Ravens had averaged just 14
points a game, until they broke out with 38 against Indianapolis
last week. They'll revert to their old form against the Oilers. In
the last meeting between the two teams, Oilers running back Eddie
George rushed for 121 yards and quarterback Steve McNair scored the
game's only touchdown on a 40-yard scramble in a 12-8 Tennessee
victory. The Oilers have the Raven's number.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT 8:20 P.M. GAME
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (3-9) AT MINNESOTA (11-1)
</P>
<P>
   As if things couldn't get any worst for the Bears, quarterback
Erik Kramer, who had been plagued by shoulder problems all year,
had surgery on his rotator cuff on Wednesday and is out for the
season. The rookie Moses Moreno will take over for Kramer. Moreno
started last week against Tampa Bay and was 18-of-41 for 153 yards
and one touchdown. But the Bears had only 69 yards rushing. The
Vikings aren't going to cry for Chicago. They have their own woes.
Running back Robert Smith is out 2-3 weeks with a sprained knee.
The bad news for Chicago is that his backup, Leroy Hoard, is just
as good. Hoard is third on the team in touchdowns with eight.
Against Dallas last week, the Vikings scored five TDs of 50 yards
or more all on drives under 3 minutes. The Bears are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA 45-9.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY 8:20 P.M. GAME
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BAY (8-4) AT TAMPA BAY (5-7)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's having to breathe the Vikings' fumes in the NFC
Central or maybe it's just the knowledge that he'll be able to
coach anywhere he wants at the end of the season, but Green Bay
Coach Mike Holmgren is getting punchy. How else to explain his
expletive-laced response to a heckler as he and the team were
leaving the field at the half of last week's game against
Philadelphia? Holmgren apologized Monday. The Packers had a
lackluster first half performance against the Eagles. Maybe that
was what irritated Holmgren. Well, the Bucs are just the tonic that
he and the Packers need. Tampa Bay will miss linebacker Hardy
Nickerson (viral infection of the heart) for this game more than
they did last week against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BAY 26-16.

BRITAIN UNDER PRESSURE TO CUT INTEREST RATES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In theory, Britain will be standing alone when the
European nations that cut interest rates on Thursday band together
in a single currency, the euro, in 29 days. In reality, though, the
message from the rate cut on Thursday was that economic waves do
not stop at the Channel.
</P>
<P>
   First, the rate cut to 3 percent in Germany, France and most
other euro-zone countries was widely depicted by analysts here as
likely to increase pressure on the Bank of England to cut its
benchmark rates _ already twice the European average _ when its
monetary-policy committee members meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the pressure will be to make the cut greater than
previously expected, in part to avoid strengthening the pound,
which would further damage Britain's battered exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first reaction to the rate cut on the London foreign
exchange market Thursday was to strengthen the pound against the
German mark _ precisely the market reaction that exporters fear,
because it makes their goods more expensive and increases
competition from cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange rate against the mark eased only when dealers
concluded that Britain's forecast rate cut _ initially expected to
be a quarter of a percentage point, would be a half-point instead,
bringing the Bank of England's benchmark repurchase rate down to
6.25 percent from 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That will leave the British rate more than twice as high as the
prevalent European rate when the euro is introduced on Jan. 1 in
electronic trading. At that time, British exporters say they will
be watching closely to see how the markets price the pound against
the euro _ the common currency of Britain's biggest trading area in
the European Single Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows whether the euro is going to be a strong or a
weak currency,'' one economist said. But Thursday's rate cuts were
likely to prevent the euro from ``going through the roof,'' as one
analyst put it.
</P>
<P>
   The British government says Britain's membership in the euro is
contingent on a referendum after the next election, which must take
place before May 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England's goal in setting interest rates is to
maintain inflation at 2.5 percent. But in recent months, as the
same threat of global slowdown that prompted Thursday's rate cut
swept over Britain, many industries blamed the bank for their
problems, saying the high interest rates designed to hold down
inflation also squeezed consumer and corporate credit, slowing the
economy at a time when it needed a boost. Since October, the bank
has lowered rates twice from a high of 7.5 percent amid widespread
forecasts of low growth, if not recession, in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with that, blue-chip companies have issued profit
warnings showing wider trouble, not just in Britain's depressed
manufacturing industry but increasingly in the service sector once
viewed as the nation's prime engine for growth. All that has
inspired calls from industrialists and economists for further rate
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling, though, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply's index _ a barometer of the service industry _ fell below
50, to 49.1, for the first time since the survey was created two
and a half years ago. A rating above 50 indicates an increase in
manufacturing; a number below that indicates a shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   And a separate survey by the Confederation of British Industry
employers' association said the volume of retail sales in November
was the lowest since March 1995.

BUSH SAYS HE WON'T PLAY GOD WITH PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush may or may not long to be president
of the United States, but there is one role he is sure he doesn't
want _ playing God with people's religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Methodist, walked the tightrope between politics
and religion Thursday on his return from a highly publicized trip
to Israel, which had renewed interest in his views about the road
to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior
is my salvation, and I believe that,'' Bush replied to a question
about his religious beliefs at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``It's not the governor's role to decide who
goes to heaven. I believe that God decides who goes to heaven, not
George W. Bush,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a similar question five years ago, Bush said
people who do not accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior
cannot go to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, which upset many Jews, were recently revived in
recent national media reports about the governor, who now is
considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush runs for president, a decision which he insisted again
on Thursday is still up in the air, the support of Christian
fundamentalists, who share Bush's personal religious beliefs, could
be crucial in early Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor was in Israel earlier this week,
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a
major voice against anti-Semitism, said he expected Bush to clarify
his 1993 remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush said he has ``shown people that I'm a tolerant
person. And my job as governor is to use my office to promote
dialogue and discussion and mutual understanding and mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got great respect for the other religions of the world,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said Bush planned to make similar
statements in a letter to Foxman on Thursday, but the governor
declined to release copies of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returned to Austin Wednesday afternoon after an 11-day
overseas trip, had a low-key response to criticism directed at him
by Vice President Al Gore, a potential presidential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in remarks to the Democratic Leadership Council in
Washington on Wednesday, questioned the claims of Bush and other
Republicans who promise to govern with ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Compassion' is more than a pretty word. There is a long road
between rhetoric and results,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``fully jet-lagged'' when he first heard of
Gore's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing a response from his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes,
the governor added, ``What part does he object to _ the
conservative part or the compassionate part?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would define ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush
replied: ``Making sure every child can read, making sure that we
encourage faith-based organizations ... when it comes to helping
neighbors in need, making sure that our neighborhoods are safe,
making sure that the state of Texas recognizes that people from all
walks of life have got a shot at the Texas dream but, most
importantly, making sure that government is not the answer to
people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to Israel with three other Republican governors was
sponsored by the National Jewish Coalition, a Republican-oriented
lobby that backs the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. It followed a family vacation in Italy and a side trip
to Egypt, where the Texas governor had dinner with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he went to the Middle East to ``listen and learn.''
His meetings in Israel included sessions with Netanyahu, President
Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and opposition party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited the strategic Golan Heights and, he said,
learned a lot about the security needs of ``our strong friend and
ally, Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the group tried unsuccessfully to meet with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he saw ``wonderful business opportunities'' in Israel
for Texas business people. But he played down the implications of
his visit for a potential presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his round of dinners with presidents and other
high-level figures in the Middle East made him want to change his
own title, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to get on an exercise machine. I haven't
decided yet, and now is not the time to decide whether I will or
will not seek the presidency.'' &QL;

Commission officially designated a 650-mile route through the west

frontier forts of both the ruined and restored variety from the

SWISS GIVE US SOMETHING TO CONSIDER ON DRUG POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who have not been there, and some who have, picture
Switzerland the way that Ernest Hemingway described it
three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down
than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built
on the cuckoo clock style of architecture,'' wrote Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   And the citizens of Switzerland are usually thought of as
practical people, more upright than broad-minded on issues of
morality, politics and lifestyle, a people not given to the ready
embrace of cuckoo ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How came it, then, that the staid people who dwell in that place
of snowcapped mountains, placid lakes and unimposing architecture
went to the polls last weekend and voted on the outlandish notion
of legalizing ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Swiss sensibly rejected that cuckoo idea
overwhelmingly. That was predictable. Even the proponents of the
constitutional amendment to legalize drugs, those who collected the
100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, knew it wouldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them were relieved that it didn't because they
really were not wed firmly to the idea of taking prohibitions off
the sale and distribution of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   What they were really seeking was freedom to use such soft drugs
as marijuana, which is not a cuckoo idea by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, really, is total legalization of drugs on a conceptual
level. It is worth talking about, particularly in the context of
pointing out how current drug policy is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Certainly not in the United States.
Contrary to a lot of misinformation, it has not happened in the
Netherlands. In fact, the closest it has come to happening anywhere
in the world has been in Switzerland. And it was rejected there by
76 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   If it wouldn't fly in Switzerland, it wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in a Central Texas summer of becoming public
policy in the good old U.S. of A. After all, the practical,
conservative Swiss already have demonstrated that they are far more
progressive on the subject of drugs than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That became abundantly clear last year when Swiss voters
overwhelmingly endorsed state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. The Swiss sensibly concluded that it would be more
profitable to their society to provide the addicts with what they
need and allow them to be productive citizens than to leave them no
choice but to obtain their drugs from criminals and commit crimes
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there is a considerable body of American
public opinion that even rejects methadone distribution to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although full decriminalization of drugs in Switzerland, the
United States or any other country doesn't appear to be in the
cards, discussion of the notion needs to continue as a counterpoint
to the failing policies of pouring increasing millions into
minimally productive interdiction efforts, incarcerating thousands
on minor drug offenses, and building more jails and prisons to
contain the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that clash of extremes can evolve more understanding of
the need to emphasize and fund treatment and to de-emphasize
punishment for relatively minor drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the successful initiatives in Washington, Alaska,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada derived some of their driving force from
the general discussion of drug decriminalization.
</P>
<P>
   The standard argument for decriminalization is that it would
take the profit out of drug trafficking and reduce the crime and
violence associated with it. That may or may not be true. The fact
is that drug trafficking is profitable because people in this
country and around the world crave drugs to fill a void in their
lives, some existential need that is not satisfied by their work,
their personal relationships or their systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Decriminalization may take some of the crime out of drug use,
but it would likely be no more effective in reducing addiction than
the repeal of prohibition on curbing alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's worth talking about because as real drug policy, it
is no more cuckoo than what now masquerades as the war on drugs.
</P>

IMPEACH (Washington) - Next week's planned vote on whether to

them) who are considered ``swing'' votes, leading Democrats have

MURDERER-TEACHER (Tempe, Ariz.) - Arizona State University,

will reassign him to other duties, probably individual research.

 &QL; 
PRIUS-AUTO (Phoenix) - The little Toyota Prius hardly seemed worth
a second glance, parked at the curb with a dozen sleek and exotic
examples of electric cars and trucks. But ordinary as it may
appear, there's a critical difference between Prius and the other
electric vehicles being demonstrated Wednesday in downtown Phoenix.
This is the world's first mass-produced car with hybrid power _
part gasoline engine and part electric motor _ providing the
benefits of low emissions and high gas mileage in a real-world
vehicle that can be driven anywhere. With PHOTO. By BOB GOLFEN.

AUTO-COLUMN (Undated) - Here's a small Oldsmobile that's worth a

BUSH SAYS HE WON'T PLAY GOD WITH PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  EDITORS: also moved on religion wire as BUSH-RELIGION 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush may or may not long to be president
of the United States, but there is one role he is sure he doesn't
want _ playing God with people's religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Methodist, walked the tightrope between politics
and religion Thursday on his return from a highly publicized trip
to Israel, which had renewed interest in his views about the road
to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior
is my salvation, and I believe that,'' Bush replied to a question
about his religious beliefs at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``It's not the governor's role to decide who
goes to heaven. I believe that God decides who goes to heaven, not
George W. Bush,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a similar question five years ago, Bush said
people who do not accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior
cannot go to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, which upset many Jews, were recently revived in
recent national media reports about the governor, who now is
considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush runs for president, a decision which he insisted again
on Thursday is still up in the air, the support of Christian
fundamentalists, who share Bush's personal religious beliefs, could
be crucial in early Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor was in Israel earlier this week,
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a
major voice against anti-Semitism, said he expected Bush to clarify
his 1993 remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush said he has ``shown people that I'm a tolerant
person. And my job as governor is to use my office to promote
dialogue and discussion and mutual understanding and mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got great respect for the other religions of the world,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said Bush planned to make similar
statements in a letter to Foxman on Thursday, but the governor
declined to release copies of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returned to Austin Wednesday afternoon after an 11-day
overseas trip, had a low-key response to criticism directed at him
by Vice President Al Gore, a potential presidential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in remarks to the Democratic Leadership Council in
Washington on Wednesday, questioned the claims of Bush and other
Republicans who promise to govern with ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Compassion' is more than a pretty word. There is a long road
between rhetoric and results,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``fully jet-lagged'' when he first heard of
Gore's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing a response from his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes,
the governor added, ``What part does he object to _ the
conservative part or the compassionate part?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would define ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush
replied: ``Making sure every child can read, making sure that we
encourage faith-based organizations ... when it comes to helping
neighbors in need, making sure that our neighborhoods are safe,
making sure that the state of Texas recognizes that people from all
walks of life have got a shot at the Texas dream but, most
importantly, making sure that government is not the answer to
people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to Israel with three other Republican governors was
sponsored by the National Jewish Coalition, a Republican-oriented
lobby that backs the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. It followed a family vacation in Italy and a side trip
to Egypt, where the Texas governor had dinner with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he went to the Middle East to ``listen and learn.''
His meetings in Israel included sessions with Netanyahu, President
Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and opposition party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited the strategic Golan Heights and, he said,
learned a lot about the security needs of ``our strong friend and
ally, Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the group tried unsuccessfully to meet with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he saw ``wonderful business opportunities'' in Israel
for Texas business people. But he played down the implications of
his visit for a potential presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his round of dinners with presidents and other
high-level figures in the Middle East made him want to change his
own title, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to get on an exercise machine. I haven't
decided yet, and now is not the time to decide whether I will or
will not seek the presidency.'' &QL;

had warned wardens and others on Monday of Gurule's possible gang
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, a $5,000 reward was posted by Crime
Stoppers of Texas for information leading to Gurule's capture and
Gov. George W. Bush, recently returned from an overseas trip,
expressed deep concern over the killer's escape.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald
confirmed Thursday that Gurule has ``suspected but not confirmed''
ties to the gang. Another spokesman, Larry Todd, added that
officers now are attempting to question ``real or perceived members
of the gang in the `free world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Gurule is a Mexican Mafia member, it is possible members who
have been released from prison could support him in his flight from
police. The Corpus Christi convict has no gang tattoos, but
authorities said that doesn't necessarily mean he is not a gang
member.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on gang affiliation may be an indication that
authorities quietly are backing away from their often-stated
assertion that Gurule most likely remains in the 17,000 heavily
wooded acres that adjoin the state's death row prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every passing day,'' Fitzgerald said, ``we are
readjusting our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   While dog searches and flyovers by heat-sensing equipped
helicopters continue, authorities are faced with the fact that so
far, all their efforts had been futile.
</P>
<P>
   As Fitzgerald prepared to abandon the state's de-facto press
center, a log cabin on the Ellis Unit campus downwind from the
prison pig farm, he expressed optimism that a planned Saturday TV
broadcast of the escape's re-enactment on ``America's Most Wanted''
would shake loose new leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get a lot more eyes,'' he said. ``The more people
aware of the situation, the better off we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush expressed concern over Gurule's
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why a death row inmate escaped and still is at large ... Yes,
this concerns me a lot,'' he said. Asked if he thought the escapee
had outside help, the governor responded: ``That's what I want to
know and that's what Texans want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Justice Board Chairman Allan Polunsky this week
announced formation of a fact-finding commission to determine
answers to that and other questions concerning the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, convicted of killing two men during a 1992 Corpus
Christi robbery, was the only one of seven condemned killers to
succeed in breaking out of death row before dawn last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The captured inmates have been placed in administrative
segregation, a high-security setting in which they are allowed to
leave their cells for only an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, responding to claims made Wednesday in Houston by death
row opponents, said the inmates had not been denied visits from
their lawyers. ``We are not denying anyone their rights,'' Todd
said. ``As far as I know, there have not been any requests from
lawyers to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he said, if independent physicians want to examine
the inmates, they must contact TDCJ institutional director Gary
Johnson for permission. Todd said the inmates were found to be in
good physical condition by prison medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Houston physician Dan Wirt, who spoke at a Texas Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty rally, charged that prison officials were
brutalizing the captured would-be escapees.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said the men were being questioned, but denied that they
were being abused.

`LA SEPARATION' EXPLORES LOVE GONE STALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of recent French films deal with the disintegration of
romantic love in ways American movies don't:
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Jacquot's ``Seventh Heaven'' explores the power struggle
within a marriage with wry humor and delicate, almost
imperceptible, emotional shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Vincent's ``La Separation,'' made in 1994 but just
reaching U.S. art houses, takes a slice-of-life look at a
disintegrating bond and the pain and anger the split produces. It
has a brusque, raw urgency and sophisticated subtleness.
</P>
<P>
   And it features intense, fully dimensional performances by
Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil, who play Anne and Pierre, an
unmarried couple with a 15-month-old son named Loulou.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening scene, they seem content. Then they attend a
Roberto Rossellini film (and the irony that the film's star, Ingrid
Bergman, left her husband to marry Rossellini is not lost) and Anne
rebuffs Pierre's touch. This insignificant action signals the first
sign of trouble in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Anne tells Pierre the truth: she's in love with
another man. After much pressing from Pierre, who pleads, ``What
did I do wrong?'' Anne impatiently tells him, ``Nothing specific.
Just a lot of little things.'' She finally tells him that her new
love ``listens to me, pays attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre falls apart in the face of Anne's casual disinterest and
lashes out at her in a fury. He vows to take Loulou. He threatens
to kick her out. Calm turns to chaos and the pair bicker and
tensely reconcile, upping the ante until there's no place left to
turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Separation'' ultimately finds a quieter, if still tenuous,
resolution. Dan Franck's script asks some intriguing questions:
Does Anne embark on an affair to wake Pierre from his remoteness?
Can two people who have acted with desperation and cruelty resume
life again on a new, better level?
</P>
<P>
   These issues are explored simply and intimately, thanks to the
cast. Auteuil can be a chilly, almost repugnant, actor but he
brings a real agony to Pierre. His desperate appeals push Anne, who
is disgusted by him, further away. The bright, restless Huppert,
who has the tougher job because she must react to Auteuil's
explosive rages, conveys a crazy-making confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though they exhaust us with their dramatics and their inability
to move beyond pain, they slowly let us see that they're more than
capable of finding a civilized peace and a new understanding that
will ease their heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   La Separation. Directed by Christian Vincent. Written by Dan
Franck. Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Daniel Auteuil. Phaedra Cinema. 88
minutes. Unrated with strong language. In French with English
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

DIVIDED OVER THE FAMILY CHRISTMAS REUNION 
 FOR USE FRI., DEC. 4, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: It's that home-for-the-holidays season that's supposed
to bring us joy, but it's really tough this year. Both sets of
parents live fairly close and want us with them for the holidays.
My wife thinks we should go to her family's celebration, but I say
let's be with my mom, who is alone this year for the first time. I
know my wife doesn't like Mom, but I think she's being callous and
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I suspect this problem has been going on for a long
time, but this is the year it's chosen to roost. It sounds as
though neither of you has worked out the ``where do we spend
holidays'' blues. You have been able to finesse it so far, but
finesse time is over. If you had started with a plan, you wouldn't
be in today's pickle.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get to it: With both families close by, holidays and
weekends can be negotiated by spending Christmas Eve with one and
Christmas Day with the other. Do a Thanksgiving/Easter tradeoff.
One year you can give one family first choice and the next the
other set of in-laws. Scheduling may be a pain in the neck, but it
can avert hurt feelings, nagging and fights.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed for you this year is your mom's status. She's
lonely, sad and needy. Your wife is afraid she'll never see her
folks on holidays again. You may view it as a temporary change, but
odds are that neither your mom nor your wife is looking at it that
way. What to do now? Sit down with your wife and work out that
holiday/weekend schedule which will reassure everyone. You don't
even have to stress your mom's special needs right now if your
schedule shows your willingness to be fair and open to both your
wife's and her parents' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're so close to Christmas Day, you may even be able to
negotiate a special, one-time-only joint celebration for both sides
of the family, and if you're really lucky, everybody will have such
a great time it may become an annual event!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for 12 years and
unhappy for the last 5. We've talked divorce, but we decided to
stay together for the sake of the kids. If we have agreed that's
the only reason we're still married, is an affair legal?
</P>
<P>
   DR.JOY: Trust me, nobody stays together for the sake of the
kids. People stay together because they're afraid to be alone, or
because it's cheaper to support one household than two, or because
they're afraid of losing contact or status or money or friends, and
sometimes because they really care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   People who say they are staying together for the sake of the
kids are kidding themselves. Kids are almost always aware of the
tension, the whispers, the fights, the secret phone conversations
and the lies.
</P>
<P>
   So let's face it: Neither of you is staying together for the
kids. To pretend that you are uses them as chess pieces and more
importantly allows both of you to ignore your real feelings, so
nothing will get resolved. You and your spouse must sit down and be
honest with yourself first and then with each other about what each
of you wants and what each of you is willing to offer in return.
</P>
<P>
   Because you do have children in common, you will always have a
bond with each other, so the more honest you can be now, the better
your long-term prospects for calm and dignified interaction and
THAT is for the sake of the kids as well as one another.
</P>
<P>
   As for an affair, no-fault divorce has made affairs less
dangerous if both of you can agree and a great deal more dangerous
if you can't. The point is an affair is only going to complicate
matters now. Work on your marriage or junk it, but don't lie to
yourself or to each other about why you're together. And involving
someone else in this mess is just plain nasty!
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I hate my body and there's lots of it to hate. I've
tried every diet known and I still look like the Titanic. My
husband nags me, my mother chides and I eat and eat and eat. Short
of having my mouth glued shut, is there any good way for me to lose
weight?
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: From the sound of it, you are a professional dieter.
You know better than almost anybody how to lose weight, but the
problem is keeping it off. To do that, you need a better
understanding of why you eat, what you eat, when you eat, how you
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you have to understand is that you can't lose
weight for anybody but yourself. When it's just you and that jelly
doughnut, eyeball to eyeball, there is no amount of Mom or husband
that is going to keep you from blinking. It's you and only you. Ask
yourself if you are eating to assert your independence? Or to put a
buffer between you and the world? Is your weight giving you an
excuse for not finding a job or friends or clothes or being sexual?
</P>
<P>
   Start writing down everything, and I mean everything, before you
put it in your mouth. The very act of writing it down will force
you to ask yourself whether you really want it and help you
document when, why and how you eat. And put a picture of yourself
thin OR heavy on the refrigerator door for motivation (a naked
photo is best if there aren't kids around). Wait a half-hour to eat
whatever you were thinking of engulfing. Keep only good stuff _
that means non-fattening _ in the house, so you and your family
won't snack on trash. Think about getting out of the house. When
we're bored we are more likely to think about food.
</P>
<P>
   We put on weight when we take in more calories than we burn and
lose weight when the opposite is true. The former means better
eating habits, the latter means exercise. Exercise not only makes
you feel more in contract of your body and your life, but it gets
you away from the demon refrigerator and helps you metabolize food
more efficiently. If you think this is an argument for less dieting
and more exercise, you've read me loud and clear.

COOKIE RECIPES YIELD HOLIDAY TREATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For many, it wouldn't be Christmas without
Christmas cookies. ``Nothing represents the spirit of loving,
nurturing and giving more than a homemade cookie,'' notes Rose Levy
Beranbaum in her book ``Rose's Christmas Cookies,'' which has been
delighting holiday bakers for the last eight years. Besides coming
from the heart, cookies are sweet and comforting and associated
with many holiday memories. Among the 60 special recipes in
Beranbaum's collection are her favorites for celebrating this
enchanting time of year in style.
</P>
<P>
   To speed cookie-making chores this holiday season, you can
create dozens of different cookies _ drop, rolled, bar, ice box and
more _ from a basic butter cookie. Released just in time for
yuletide baking this year, ``One Dough Fifty Cookies'' by Leslie
Glover Pendleton (William Morrow; $13), will give you the master
dough and blueprint for producing more than four dozen cookie
choices with different textures, shapes and flavors in a short time
during the hectic holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most amazing part of this trick is that the cookies taste
and look completely different from each other,'' writes Pendleton,
a former food editor of Gourmet magazine. ``No one will suspect you
have taken a shortcut.'' Recipes in the book range from those
suitable for gifts and entertaining to variations kids will enjoy
at lunchtime. Tempting possibilities include recipes such as
Shattered Chocolate Balls, Chocolate Marzipan Pinwheels, Spiced
Peanut Currant Cookies, Orange Marmalade Walnut Pillows, Apricot
Stars and Malted Milk Buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Each batch of dough makes enough to prepare two different cookie
recipes or a double recipe of one cookie. If you don't have time to
make more than a single cookie recipe, freeze half of the dough to
use another time. You can also make plenty of the dough in advance
of baking day and store it, well-wrapped in layers of plastic wrap
and foil, in the refrigerator up to one week or in the freezer up
to three months.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the way you decide to go, be sure to allow time for
the dough to come to room temperature before mixing or forming.
There's no excuse for not turning the kitchen into a cookie
workshop with this easy concept.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot-off-the-press book to help satisfy this season's
cookie cravings is ``125 Cookies to Bake, Nibble and Savor'' by
Elinor Klivans (Broadway Books; $25). It's a gem and has a section
titled ``Especially for Holidays'' that contains such
yummy-sounding creations as Eggnog Bars; Gingerbread People; Sugar
Cookie Cutouts; Holiday Lebkuchen; and Orange, Cranberry and
Toasted Almond Bars, to name a few. But there's much more in this
volume that you'll want to try for festive celebrations and
gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous recipes _ among them Chocolate Chubbies, Chocolate
Truffle Squares, New York Bakery Almond Raspberry Tall Bars,
Caramel Cashew Triangles and more _ made me want to run into the
kitchen and get baking.
</P>
<P>
   Klivans, a former pastry chef and author of two other dessert
cookbooks, said cookies are her family's legacy. Her childhood
centered around cookies, and before she was old enough to read a
recipe, she stood on a special stool so she could reach the counter
and help her mother pat out cookies. She carried a box of her mom's
cookies to every holiday party, and her dad's birthday ``cakes''
always consisted of platters of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Klivans baked cookies (to serve with ice cream) for 12 years as
a pastry chef at a restaurant. ``Those years of cookie baking gave
me a chance to experiment with new ideas and try many of the
recipes that I had clipped and saved for years,'' she said.
</P>

   She encourages everyone to make cookies, as they are the easiest
desserts to bake. Even a first-time baker or someone who isn't
familiar with baking can bake cookies because they are so simple,
she pointed out. Cookies are also ideal for baking, freezing and
mailing. ``Most cookies have the low moisture content required for
successful freezing, take up little space in the freezer, wrap
easily for freezer storage and defrost quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some bakers and pastry chefs, Klivans advocates freezing
cookies, as she can bake and freeze them when she has time. Be sure
to cool the cookies before wrapping, she advised. Careful packaging
is the key to keeping them at their best. ``Plain cookies,
brownies, bars, truffles, small tarts and individual cakes should
be individually wrapped in plastic wrap, then placed in a metal or
rigid plastic container and covered tightly. If cookies aren't
sticky, wrap several together or wrap cookies in pairs,'' she
suggested, adding that she also packs cookies in attractive metal
tins and freezes them, ready to deliver for gifts. The cookies
won't get frosty this way because the air isn't touching the
cookies or bars in the container, she added. Also, this kind of
packaging allows you to take out and defrost only what you need.
Figure that defrosting will require about 30 to 60 minutes _ and
only unwrap the cookies when they are completely thawed.

   Klivans, who lives in Camden, Maine, is currently in the midst
of baking 1,200 cookies (a dozen different kinds) for a holiday
cookie-sampling party for her book. In conjunction with this and
Christmas by the Sea in Camden, there is a cookie walk (at the same
time) to benefit the town library. Twenty volunteers are baking
three dozen each of 20 different cookies from the book. People in
the community can sample and then purchase a combination of their
favorite cookies to take home for $7 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Among Klivans favorites in the book are the Chocolate Truffle
Bars, Chocolate Chip Bars, Dark Chocolate Truffle Macaroon
Sandwiches, Pecan Cinnamon Twists, Cherry Orange Flaky Flats and
Morning Glory Tea Cakes.

   You probably have some cherished childhood or adult memories of
baking holiday cookies. I know I do _ and I'm including a couple of
my favorite recipes today along with several from the three books
mentioned above. Wherever you're a novice or pro at the cookie
game, these selections are bound to rate raves.
</P>
<P>
   You might find these renditions so good that you could eat the
entire recipe _ and that may necessitate making another batch.
Whatever you decide, happy holiday baking. &QL;

CHOCOLATE CHUBBIES
</P>
<P>
   I've had versions of this half-brownie, half-cookie at bakeries
around the country. It's crisp on the outside, fudgy on the inside
and loaded with chocolate chips and pecans. It's my choice for
finest chubby.
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces
(see Note)
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups (9 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in middle of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Put butter and unsweetened chocolate in a large heatproof
container set over but not touching, a saucepan of barely simmering
water. Stir mixture over hot water until butter and chocolate are
melted and smooth. Remove from hot water and set aside to cool and
thicken slightly, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stir flour, baking powder and salt together. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put eggs, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl of an electric mixer
and mix on medium speed until fluffy and lightened in color, about
1 minute. On low speed add chocolate mixture, beating until mixed.
Add flour mixture and mix just until mixed and dough is smooth.
Stir in chocolate chips and pecans. Batter will be thick and hold
its shape when dropped onto a baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Place rounded tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart on prepared
baking sheets (you will have 2-inch mounds).
</P>
<P>
   Bake one sheet of cookies at a time in preheated 350-degree oven
about 10 minutes or until tops feel crusty when touched gently.
Reverse baking sheet after 5 minutes to ensure that cookies bake
evenly. Watch carefully at end of baking time. Bake second sheet of
cookies. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a
wire rack to cool completely. Makes 24 cookies.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Cool melted chocolate and butter mixture until it thickens
slightly. This produces a thick batter that holds its shape and
makes a plump cookie, a generous 1/2-inch thick when baked.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze, place bottoms of 2 cookies together and wrap in
plastic wrap. Put wrapped cookies in a metal or plastic freezer
container and cover tightly. Label with date and contents. Freeze
up to 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, thaw wrapped cookies at room temperature. Serve within
3 days.

SHORTBREAD ROUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Every Christmas, I look forward to the holiday cookies that my
friend Rosalee Glass bakes. Her cookie tins hold the classics that
I remember from my childhood _ nut cookies coated with powdered
sugar, chocolate-covered bars and these thick, buttery shortbread
rounds. Glass thinks she adapted her recipe from an out-of-print
edition of the ``Joy of Cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Position oven racks in middle and lower middle of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on
low speed 15 seconds. Add powdered sugar and beat on medium speed
until butter and sugar are blended together. Add vanilla. Decrease
speed to low and mix in flour mixture until dough looks smooth and
holds together.
</P>
<P>
   On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin,
roll dough out to 1/3-inch thickness. Using a round pastry cutter 2
inches in diameter, cut out circles and place on prepared baking
sheets about 1-inch apart. Gather together dough scraps, roll them
and cut out more circles.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven about 18 minutes or until
edges and bottoms of cookies are golden. Reverse baking sheets
after 10 minutes, front to back and top to bottom, to ensure
cookies bake evenly. Cool cookies on baking sheets 5 minutes, then
transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Makes 24 cookies.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Use cold butter so a firm dough forms. The first time I
prepared these cookies, I used very soft butter. Resulting dough
was so soft cookies spread over sheet and baked into one giant
wafer.
</P>
<P>
   Use a ruler to measure 1/3-inch thickness. Cookies actually
taste different, if they are rolled thinner; it's not a bad taste,
but not as good as Glass's cookies.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze, place bottoms of 2 cookies together and wrap in
plastic wrap. Put wrapped cookies in a metal or plastic freezer
container and cover tightly. Label with date and contents. Freeze
up to 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, thaw wrapped cookies at room temperature. Leftover
cookies can be covered with plastic wrap and stored at room
temperature up to 4 days.

EGGNOG BARS
</P>
<P>
   At our house instead of drinking eggnog, we toast the holidays
with these Eggnog Bars. The cream cheese filling is just as velvety
as any liquid eggnog, while rum and a sprinkling of nutmeg add the
traditional touches.
</P>
<P>
   NUTMEG GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST:
</P>
<P>
   2 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   EGGNOG FILLING:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces cream cheese, softened 3 to 4 hours at room
temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   l large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark rum
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in middle of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Line a 13x9x2-inch pan with heavy foil, letting foil extend over
ends of pan. Butter bottom and sides of foil.
</P>
<P>
   For Nutmeg Graham Cracker Crust, put graham cracker crumbs,
cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl and mix together. Add melted
butter and stir until crumbs are evenly moistened with butter.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer crumbs to prepared pan. Using your fingers, press
crumbs evenly over bottom and 1/2-inch up sides of foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake crust in preheated 325-degree oven 8 minutes. Cool crust
while you make filling.
</P>
<P>
   For Eggnog Filling, put cream cheese in a large bowl of an
electric mixer. Mix on low speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
Blend in sugar and flour. Add egg and egg yolk and blend until
smooth. Stop mixer and scrape sides of bowl. Mix in vanilla, rum
and whipping cream.
</P>
<P>
   Pour filling into crumb crust. Sprinkle nutmeg evenly over top.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 25 minutes, or until
filling looks set when you give pan a gentle shake.
</P>
<P>
   Cover pan loosely with paper towels and cool 1 hour at room
temperature. Discard paper towels and refrigerate 1 hour. Cover
with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly in refrigerator, at least 6
hours or overnight. Makes 12 bars.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: These bars taste rich, so I make them thinner than most
bars; they are about 3/4 inch thick. To sprinkle batter evenly with
ground nutmeg, grate a piece of whole nutmeg directly over top of
batter. A light coating of nutmeg equals 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg called
for in filling. To double recipe, use 2 pans and double
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze, use a spatula to slide each bar off foil. Wrap
individual bars in plastic wrap. Place in a metal or plastic
freezer container and cover tightly. Label with date and contents.
Freeze up to 1 month.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, thaw wrapped bars in refrigerator 5 hours overnight.
Store bars in refrigerator up to 5 days. Serve cold.

UNCLE HOWIE'S EXTRAORDINARY BUTTERSCOTCH CHIP BARS
</P>
<P>
   It's an official tradition. Every time I write a new dessert
book, my Uncle Howie concocts a new variation of my mom's famous
Extraordinary Chocolate Chip Cake that appeared in ``Bake and
Freeze Desserts.'' In this version, Uncle Howie uses butterscotch
chips to change the texture from a cake to a dense, fudgy bar.
After telling me about the recipe, my uncle called to see if I had
baked it yet, but I hadn't. ``You haven't tried this? Make it right
away,'' he urged. I did and chalked up another success for my
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (12 ounces) butterscotch chips
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in middle of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Put flour and brown sugar in a large bowl of an electric mixer
and mix on low speed 15 seconds. Add butter and mix until butter
pieces are size of peas, about 1 minute. You will still see loose
flour. Mix in egg. Mixture will look dry. Rub any lumps out of
baking soda and gently mix into sour cream. Stir in sour cream
mixture and milk just until batter is evenly moistened. Stir in
butterscotch chips. Batter will be thick. Spread evenly in prepared
baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven about 50 minutes. To test for
doneness, gently press your fingers on top. Middle should feel
slightly soft and egdes firm. Insert a toothpick in center. When
toothpick comes out with a few crumbs clinging to it, bars are
done. Cool thoroughly in baking pan on a wire rack. Makes 16 to 20
bars.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: These bars have a firm butterscotch-fudge consistency, if
served cold. At room temperature they are soft and more like a
cake. If the bars bake just until a toothpick comes out sticky,
they have a moist, dense texture and deflate slightly as they cool.
If baked until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs clinging to
it, they have a texture similar to that of a brownie.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze, cut either 2 to 3 large pieces or 16 to 20 individual
pieces. Slide a thin metal spatula under bars to loosen any sticky
butterscotch layer from bottom of pan, then remove from baking pan.
Wrap large pieces in plastic wrap, then in heavy foil. Wrap
individual bars in plastic wrap, place in a metal or plastic
freezer container and cover tightly. Label with date and contents.
Freeze up to 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, thaw wrapped bars in refrigerator. Unwrap and serve
cold or bring wrapped bars to room temperature about 1 hour before
serving. Leftover bars can be covered with plastic wrap and
refrigerated for up to 5 days.

THE MASTER DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   This recipe provides enough dough to make two variations of
cookies. If you want to make one batch of cookies, freeze the
unused half of the Master Dough for another time.
</P>
<P>
   4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, softened slightly
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt (use 3/4 teaspoon if using salted butter)
</P>
<P>
   3 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   4 3/4 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   When using a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a paddle
attachment:
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and salt. Add egg
yolks and vanilla and beat until smooth. Add flour gradually,
beating on low speed until incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   When using a food processor fitted with a steel blade and with a
bowl capacity of 11 cups or more:
</P>
<P>
   In food processor, blend flour, sugar, butter (cut into small
pieces) and salt until mixture is crumbly. Add yolks and vanilla.
Blend mixture, scraping bowl occasionally, until it forms a dough.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Do not allow butter to soften too much, as resulting dough
will also be soft and harder to work with. Margarine is not
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Use a common sense when mixing in additional ingredients. Coarse
ingredients will be chopped by blade in a food processor, and
should be stirred in by hand in a seperate bowl.

CHOCOLATE MARZIPAN PINWHEELS
</P>
<P>
   Marzipan is slightly sweeter than almond paste and will give the
chocolate part a crisper texture, but either can be used here.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 recipe Master Dough (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   7 ounces (about 2/3 cup) marzipan OR almond paste, broken into
small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon egg white
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   Measure 1/2 cup firmly packed Master Dough and transfer to a
bowl. Add marzipan, cocoa, egg white and almond extract. Beat with
an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. This will take a
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Roll remaining Master Dough out between 2 sheets of wax paper
into a rectangle measuring about 10x15 inches. Roll out chocolate
dough between 2 sheets of wax paper to same size.
</P>
<P>
   Remove top sheet of paper and invert chocolate dough onto plain
dough, pressing together lightly. Remove top sheet of paper and
starting with a long side, roll dough up tightly, jelly-roll
fashion, using paper to help. Continue to roll and compress log in
paper until it measures about 19 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Chill 2 hours, or until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Using a sharp knife, slice log into 1/4-inch thick slices.
Arrange slices 1/2 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake cookies in preheated 350-degree oven 15 to 20 minutes, or
until pale golden. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool. Makes
about 7 dozen.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Another way to form these doughs is to roll plain dough
into 2 rectangles, sandwich chocolate layer in between and cut
dough into sticks using a pizza wheel. Or try rolling logs in
chopped almonds.

<P>
   3 cups pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 oven rack in middle of oven.

pour condensed milk on top. Arrange reserved pecan halves, smooth
side up, in 5 long rows, starting 1 inch from each long edge and
spacing 1 1/2 inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and, using an angled
spatula, press down nuts so they adhere to chocolate. Return pan to
oven and continue baking 20 to 30 minutes or just until milk
bubbling up between nuts in center of pan is pale golden. Do not
overbake or nuts and crust will be bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Cool completely in pan on a wire rack. Invert onto a large
cookie sheet and peel off foil. Reinvert onto a cutting surface and
cut cookie lengthwise into 5 strips (each about 2 inches wide,)
cutting in between rows of pecans, and then crosswise into 10
strips (about 1 1/2 inches wide.)
</P>
<P>
   Store in an airtight food container at room temperature or in
freezer. Will keep at least 2 weeks at room temperature, several
months frozen. Texture is best up to 5 days at room temperature or
frozen and thawed. Makes 50 bars.

MOM'S COCONUT KISSES
</P>
<P>
   This cookie is so easy to make, in fact, that it's ideal to make
with kids. No doubt they will think that these kisses look like
toasted snowballs.
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups freshly shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   1/2 of a 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   Place 2 oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven.
</P>
<P>
   With an ice pick or nail and hammer, pierce 3 holes at one end
of coconut. Drain liquid and reserve, if desired, for another use.
</P>
<P>
   Bake coconut in preheated 400-degree oven until shell cracks,
about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap coconut with a towel to keep shell from flying about, and
use a hammer to crack open shell. Separate coconut meat from shell
and, using a small paring knife, peel dark outer shell from white
coconut meat. Discard outer skin.
</P>
<P>
   With a fine shredding disk of a food processor or hand shredder,
shred coconut meat. Do not grate coconut as shape of finished
cookie will be flatter.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, using a wooden spoon, mix all ingredients
together until well blended, but do not add all of condensed milk
until you check consistency. Mixture should be moist and hold
together. If necessary, add up to 2 extra tablespoons condensed
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Use a rounded cookie scoop, or a scant tablespoon and your
fingers, to form 1-inch mounds of mixture about 1 1/2 inches high.
Place about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 15 to 20 minutes or until most
of each cookies's surface is light golden. There will still be
white spots. For even baking, rotate cookie sheets from top to
bottom and front to back halfway through baking period.
</P>
<P>
   Use a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner to transfer
cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Store in an airtight food container in refrigerator or freezer.
Will keep 2 months refrigerated or several months frozen. Makes 2
dozen cookies.

BE A SMART COOKIE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a successful holiday cookie-baking spree this
season, heed these tips shared by cookie cookbook experts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Measure ingredients carefully. No shortcuts here. Don't try to
substitute ingredients or change the amounts or you may end up with
a poor end result and wonder why. If a recipe calls for cold
butter, don't use soft butter. It could make a big difference in
the texture of the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use unsalted butter if you want to control the amount of salt
in the cookies. You need only a small amount of salt to bring out
the flavor of the butter.
</P>
<P>
   _ For ease, use a heavy-duty electric mixer or food processor to
make most cookie doughs. You can also mix by hand, but in some
cases it will be a workout.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rely on the microwave oven for softening or melting butter,
chocolate and other ingredients, but watch carefully to avoid
burning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preheat the oven at least 15 minutes prior to baking cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oven temperature is extremely important. Check it with an oven
thermometer, which is a wise investment for any baker. Just a few
degrees off can bring disappointment _ and sometimes disastrous
results.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't grease cookie sheets unless the recipe specifies. Let
sheets cool in between baking batches. A hot sheet can change the
character and shape of the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be aware that dark-surfaced cookie sheets can cause cookies to
brown and crisp faster. Shiny heavy-gauge aluminum cookie sheets
are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ If cookies are not baking evenly, rearrange and rotate the
cookie sheets in the oven halfway through the baking time.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to baking times, use a timer _ never guess.
Watch cookies carefully to avoid overbaking. Check them several
minutes prior to the minimum baking time specified in the recipe.
It won't hurt to open the oven _ the cookies won't fall. In a
matter of a minute or two, cookies can go from golden to burned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always underbake cookies as they continue baking after being
removed from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cool cookies completely before wrapping and storing for best
possible texture. Store crisp cookies separately from soft ones.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are planning to keep cookies for more than a couple of
days, store them, well-wrapped, in the freezer. (Many cookie
experts are not big on freezing cookies as they taste best fresh).
But remember, frozen cookies are best served and eaten within a
month _ two at the most. &QL;

MANDELA MEETS WITH FUGITIVE PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In a move that outraged opposition
parties and baffled the police and foreign affairs officials,
President Nelson Mandela met quietly on Wednesday with the Rev.
Canaan Banana, the former president of Zimbabwe, who is a fugitive
after being convicted last week in Zimbabwe of sodomy and assault.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela did not advise the police or Interpol before the
meeting, which his office said Banana had requested.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's office said Zimbabwe had been advised of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Zimbabwe said his government was ``never
officially informed'' and would seek extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Banana, president from 1980 to 1987, was found
guilty on 11 counts of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent
assault in incidents that involved bodyguards, chefs and gardeners
at his official residence while he was in office.
</P>
<P>
   He fled, apparently to Botswana, before his court-appearance
date and an arrest warrant was issued. An Interpol official in
South Africa said Thursday that he believed Banana was trying to
reach Chile; he said he learned of Banana's presence here from news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's office gave no details of the meeting. A spokesman for
Mandela, Parks Mankahlana, called the meeting a sensitive matter
and said Mandela had met Banana ``in a private capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very tight spot here,'' Mankahlana said. ``What is
illegal in Zimbabwe is not necessarily illegal in South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African laws against sodomy were struck down in
October by the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, George
Charamba, was quoted by Reuters as having pointed out that Banana
was also convicted of assault, which is a crime here.
</P>
<P>
   In its terse statement noting the meeting, Mandela's office
said: ``The principled stand of South Africa on matters pertaining
to the respect for independent judicial processes both in our
country and abroad, and for international law, remains unchanged.
The president's firm view is that justice should run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Front called the meeting a ``political blunder,''
and the National Party accused Mandela of making ``a deliberate
decision to undermine the judicial system of a neighboring country
by aiding and abetting a person found guilty of a serious crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Zimbabwe and South Africa are strained over
the war in Congo and a contest of wills between Mandela and Mugabe
for moral leadership in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela flouts international opinion when it suits him. He
visits and maintains cordial relations with the Libyan leader, Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, and surprised his own foreign affairs department
three years ago by saying that South Africa would recognize China
instead of Taiwan.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW WATER-QUALITY STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Wis., N.Y., Calif., Texas)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The Clinton administration on Thursday issued
standards for public water supplies intended to control previously
unregulated deadly microbes as well as cancer-causing compounds
that can result from chemicals disinfecting the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're escalating our attack on the invisible microbes that
sometimes creep into the water supply,'' President Clinton said in
a speech here overlooking the Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, the first water-quality standards to be issued
under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996, will cost local
water-treatment authorities an estimated $1 billion a year, adding
a few dollars a month to a typical household's water bills, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that hundreds of thousands of illnesses from
bacterial pathogens would be avoided each year, potentially saving
hundreds of lives, and that the risks of bladder cancer and other
illnesses would also be reduced. The states have two to five years
to put the new rules into effect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced the new rules here after touring a
nearby water-treatment plant. While it is somewhat unusual for
technical regulations like these to be announced by the president,
the White House has long recognized that keeping the nation's
drinking water clean is one of the most popular of environmental
causes. The law that requires the new rules passed both Houses of
Congress almost unanimously during the 104th Congress, the first to
be controlled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency issued them after two years of
negotiations among environmental groups, local governments, and
other interested parties, and there is little controversy about
them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new rules addresses contamination from microbes like
Cryptosporidium, an organism carried by animal wastes that causes
intestinal ailments when people drink contaminated water. The
illnesses, while often unreported, can become serious or even
fatal, especially in people whose immune systems are weakened by
the AIDS virus, by chemotherapy, or for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly publicized outbreak in Milwaukee five years ago,
thousands of people were hospitalized and several dozen died from
exposure to Cryptosporidium. Similar outbreaks elsewhere helped
propel Congress to rewrite the drinking-water laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulation, communities will have to upgrade their
water-filtration systems to remove more of the common bacteria,
viruses and protozoa that environmental scientists have called one
of the greatest remaining health problems in the nation's
drinking-water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The other rule is meant to correct a problem with the
traditional system of treating drinking water with chlorine to
disinfect it. While the disinfectants are effective in controlling
microorganisms, they react with natural organic substances in the
water to form byproducts that have been found to cause cancer in
laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   This regulation requires drinking-water systems to remove more
of the organic matter from water before disinfecting the water, and
sets stricter standards for the amounts of chlorine and
disinfectant byproducts that remain after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also disclosed details of grants of nearly
$800 million to communities across the nation to upgrade water
systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About $47 million will go to New York state; California will
receive $87 million and Texas will get $62 million under the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the Republican chairman of the
Senate Environmental Committee, called the rules among the most
important to deal with drinking water in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves, Mr. President, that divided government can produce
for the American people if we work together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were a few signs and chants calling for
impeachment in the crowd that lined Clinton's route and among those
who heard him speak, people were generally friendly toward him. The
audience at the historic fort, packed with schoolchildren, cheered
most loudly when he spoke of environmental causes as issues that
would dominate policy decisions for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The only allusion to his political travails among those
traveling with the president was a veiled one from Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I. He called on Clinton to pursue an ``aggressive''
agenda for the next two years, saying, ``This nation cannot afford
a stagnant government.'' And Kennedy, who is likely to cast a vote
on impeachment before the year is out, said he would ``stand with
you and fight.''

TAIWANESE IDENTITY AT STAKE IN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fifteen million Taiwanese voters go to the polls
Saturday in an election that could shape both the future of
Taiwanese politics and the breakaway province's relations with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are all 225 seats in the national legislature, mayoral
posts in Taiwan's two biggest cities and city council slots. If the
ruling Kuomintang Party (KMT) regains the mayor's office in the
capital of Taipei and strengthens its slim majority in the
legislature, it will consolidate its 49-year hold on power and
continue its slow warming of relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 10-year-old opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) keeps the Taipei mayorship and increases its seats in the
legislature, it would pose an increasing threat to KMT rule. It
would also signal growing pro-independence sentiment in a de-facto
nation that China has considered a ``renegade province'' ever since
anti-communist KMT officials set up a government in exile in Taipei
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the high drama of Taiwan's first direct presidential
elections in 1995, when an angry China fired missiles across the
Taiwan Strait and the United States sent aircraft carriers to the
area to cool tempers. But lacking such pyrotechnics, this election
campaign has been colorful.
</P>
<P>
   First came the release of a purported taped conversation between
the incumbent mayoral candidate in the southern port of Kaohsiung
and his alleged mistress. This week, a bloody brawl broke out
between a candidate from the Taiwan Independence Party and one from
the DPP, when the former accused the latter of being a lackey of
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, 10 people, including a Presbyterian minister,
were arrested on suspicion of buying votes with jugs of cooking oil
and $15 cash handouts in a mountain tribal community, and with
wristwatches for the disabled in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre gimmicks such as striptease, superhero costumes, and a
bicycle rally have dominated the campaign, and personalities have
overshadowed issues. Even restrained 75-year-old President Lee
Teng-hui joined in the carnival dressed on occasions as King
Arthur, a tribal chieftain, and a baseball team captain. In the
rural south, he donned a straw hat and rode a power tiller.
</P>
<P>
   But the raucous campaign also reveals the liveliness of Taiwan's
democracy _ one of the newest and freest in Asia _ and the first in
Chinese history. It has also proven, analysts say, that Beijing
cannot stifle democratic aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is proof that Taiwan is a true democratic society. We are
a very important window for promoting human rights and democracy in
the PRC (People's Republic of China),'' said Sisy Chen, former
spokeswoman for the DPP and president of the New Rising People
Foundation. ``It is impossible to push Taiwan back to PRC
authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic politics has become a main theme. Candidates have battled
to prove their ``Taiwanese-ness'' and loyalty to Taiwan over China,
underscoring the emergence of a uniquely Taiwanese identity in a
tiny island-state that has measured itself for half a century
against the behemoth of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, therefore, carry significance not only for the
future of domestic politics, but also for the chances and desire
for a peaceful reunification of Taiwan and China _ perhaps under
the ``one country, two systems'' model adopted for capitalist Hong
Kong's return to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee race has been for mayor of Taipei. The ruling
party's Ma Ying-jeou, a former justice minister and Harvard Law
School graduate, is challenging the charismatic incumbent Chen
Shui-bian, the star of the populist DPP who worked his way through
a Taiwanese law school and promotes his native ancestry against
Ma's mainland roots.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of people in Taiwan are considered native
Taiwanese, while 20 percent fled the mainland in 1949 or are
descended from those who did. Chen's camp adopted the slogan,
``Tawainese vote for Taiwanese.'' Ma can barely speak Taiwanese,
but President Lee _ a native Taiwanese himself _ defended his party
colleague this week, declaring, ``We are all new Taiwanese, whether
our ancestors came here 400 or 500 years ago, or 40 or 50 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Various polls show consistently that Taiwanese identity and
independence sentiment are ``defensive ideologies'' that people
adopt if they feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, for example, after President Clinton announced
in China that the United States does not favor Taiwan independence,
support in Taiwan for independence rose. But according to New
Rising People Foundation surveys, only about 30 percent of people
want a vote on independence under any circumstances. But 80 percent
would support a referendum if the United States and China were to
demand that Taiwan accept reunification under a ``one country, two
systems'' model.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sisy Chen, ``Everyone who wants to be mayor of
Taipei _ even a mainlander like Ma _ put a big emphasis on: `I love
Taiwan, I'm Taiwanese.' '' Beijing, she said, ``should pay more
attention to how Taiwanese identity has become a coherent ideology
in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have complained, however, that ethnic and personality
politics have blotted out livelihood issues such as free
kindergarten and medical treatment for toddlers and pensions. ``Ma
and Chen are like stars. It's like, do you want to vote for Whitney
Houston or Celine Dion?'' Chen scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high in this tight race. If Chen wins, he will be
in a stronger position to run for president in 2000. If Ma wins, he
will wrest back a key foothold for the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Bau Tzong-ho, chairman of the political science department at
National Taiwan University, says the Taipei elections will set the
stage for party politics and establish new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will maintain a cautious course with Beijing. DPP
party leaders feel that they do not need to declare independence
because Taiwan is already separate from China. For the KMT, though,
Taiwan must wait for China to become more democratic before the two
sides can reunite as did Germany and East Germany did.

TEXAS FORTS TRAIL WINDS DOWN BACK ROADS TO LONE STAR TURNING
POINTS

<P>
   MENARD, Texas _ The jagged ruins of Presidio San Luis de Las
Amarillas, originally built by the Spanish, are impressive, even as
they are battered by torrential rains. Although many people think
of the history of Texas as a narrative centered on American
settlers, Indian tribes and Bob Wills' music, Spain's was a
powerful presence, and these ruins serve as a reminder. In the
1930s, there was an attempt to restore the 18th-century fort to its
past glory, but the residents of Menard eventually built a golf
course around it instead.
</P>
<P>
   Now the grubby parking lot in front of the presidio lies
adjacent to the ninth tee of a 499-yard par-five. Though it may
seem incongruous to see a moss-covered old fort and a golf cart
side by side, that's just the way it is on the Texas Forts Trail.
You get a lot that you would expect _ and a lot more you wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   TALE OF THE TRAIL: Thirty years ago, the Texas Historical
Commission officially designated a 650-mile route through the west
central part of the state as a historical path to be known as the
Texas Forts Trail. The trail includes the Spanish presidio, eight
frontier forts of both the ruined and restored variety from the
19th century, and highlights of the communities that have sprung up
around them. It commemorates the legacy of cavalrymen and pioneers
who drew a line in the dust and offered to fight anyone who made
the mistake of trying to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is just one of 10 special ``heritage tourism'' routes
the THC hopes to bring to the public's attention over the next
several years; as a source for day- or week-long outings, it serves
as a reminder of not only the Lone Star State's military heritage
but also its quirky geographic beauties. The serpentine path twists
along tiny farm roads and past mighty lakes and leads to
fascinating museums, old-fashioned country stores and restaurants
that beckon with down-home comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   If highly fragrant road kill, slow-moving farm machinery
dominating one-lane roads and the occasional unnerving golf course
get thrown into the mix, well, think of it this way: The original
trailblazers had their obstacles to overcome, too.
</P>
<P>
   WAGONS HO!: The best way to begin a Texas Forts Trail jaunt is
to pick up the phone: Call the THC office in Austin and ask for the
handy brochure, which includes a map of 45 numbered points of
interest, as well as a well-written, concise history of each place.
The first stop on the map is Lake Fort Phantom Hill, just north of
Abilene; the last is Abilene State Park, just south of the same
city, marking the conclusion of a circuitous route along back roads
and one sole stretch of highway between Fort Worth and Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   Trail followers needn't feel they must travel by the numbers and
can, in fact, commence at any point along the way; adventurers from
Fort Worth-Dallas may want to kick off with Lake De Leon at No. 21,
because it is an easy drive west on I-20 before turning south on
Farm Road 2461.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the Forts Trail might be best enjoyed on a series of
two-day outings. At no point are travelers farther from Fort Worth
than a six-hour drive. If, however, you are determined to go
everywhere and see everything in one marathon jaunt, then four or
five full days are really required.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny roads and their inevitable delays are partly
responsible, but so is the fact that the Texas Forts Trail simply
includes lots of intriguing places.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER ROADSIDE ATTRACTION: Although different points along the
trail will appeal to different personalities, even an accidental
tourist will not want to miss these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Fort Griffin (Point 5), 15 minutes past Albany, not only boasts
some of the most fascinating historical structures, but also serves
as home to the official Texas State Longhorn Herd. Steaks on the
hoof graze along the partially restored fort parade ground,
serenely interrupting their cud-chewing to smile for the camera. Be
warned: Lots of trail stops are in wild country, and it is always
advisable to be careful where you walk. But at Fort Griffin,
there's something to fear besides snakes: The longhorns' digestive
systems are obviously efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Belknap (Point 10) is more upscale than Griffin, and with
its sandstone buildings was reported to have been one of the
prettiest forts on the frontier. It is also somewhat more
predictable, though, lacking the cow equation. The views from
certain points in Possum Kingdom State Park (Point 14), though not
quite equal to those of Big Sur on the California coast, are
spectacular, and merit a stop or two.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   De Leon (Point 23) is a charming little place with streams,
bridges and fishermen's cottages that comes as a welcome respite
from its fairly dull surrounding countryside. On a recent visit,
some of the town's buildings were festooned with colorful art
hyping a peach and melon festival. This part of the trail also
encompasses Lake Leon and the Proctor Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   As the traveler moves along the trail past Comanche and its fine
old courthouse, the time and space between attractions lengthens,
providing a nice opportunity to muse about what you've seen and
what's to come. Where do some of these names come from, for
instance? Scalp Creek seems pretty obvious, but could early pioneer
literati have named the towns of Bronte and Desdemona? (Bronte was,
in fact, named for English author Charlotte. Desdemona, though, was
named for a founding father's daughter. We can only hope she wasn't
also the reason for her hometown's nicknames _ Hog Town and Hog
City.)
</P>
<P>
   Potential boredom can also be held at bay by studying the
quantity and variety of road kill. The narrower the roads, the more
plentiful the dead animals lying alongside them. A few deer, some
armadillos, a possum or two, and, apparently by legislative decree,
one squashed skunk each mile.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lake Brownwood State Park (Point 28) looms, a site
almost as nice as its counterpart, Possum Kingdom. The town of
Brownwood, too, is a pleasant surprise, with a 1902 Romanesque
Revival jail and an especially inviting picnic area, complete with
waterfall, just on the east edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   After another longish stretch of nothing in particular, you'll
find yourself in the area around Brady (Point 29), site of
spectacular Indian battles. Your favorite memory, though, may be
the Lone Star Bar-B-Q on U.S. 87 South. Seven dollars will buy you
a plate piled with brisket, chicken, ribs, sausage, goat or pork
chops, all prepared in huge smokers outside the
unremarkable-looking restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be in Menard before your Lone Star meal is fully
digested. Presidio San Luis de Las Amarillas (Point 32) and its
companion golf course are followed in close order by Fort McKavitt
(Point 33), which at its peak in the 1870s contained 35 buildings
and which is now gradually being reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Some attractions along the way are considered so obvious they
aren't even listed among the trail's designated 45 stops. For
example, San Angelo's Fort Concho, built in 1867, is often
considered the state's unofficial fort showplace, and no wonder.
Every visit introduces something new and interesting among the 23
original and restored structures.
</P>
<P>
   The fort's infirmary is noteworthy; restored to an approximate
version of its original form (one interior staircase is now
straight rather than circular), the infirmary has an excellent
medicine-bottle exhibition. Equally illuminating, though far more
uncomfortable to look at, is the surgical saw that amputated
appendages of wounded troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Also unnumbered on the map but not to be missed are several
sites in Abilene's downtown area. The Grace Cultural Center
(housing the Abilene Fine Arts Museum and Children's Museum), the
Abilene Historical Museum and the old Paramount Theatre are all
worth a lingering look.
</P>
<P>
   MARKING THE SPORT: There's no denying that only diehard history
buffs will want to pause and gawk at all the historial markers
crammed along the historic trail, leaving dull stretches aplenty
for many of us. Most roads are narrow, and even moderate rainfall
renders them muddy. The countryside aromas often identify regional
crops _ peanuts around De Leon, decaying road kill near Menard.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you decide there surely are better trails to
travel, just as you're convinced the Comanche should have told the
white settlers they could ``have'' Texas and welcome to it, then
you turn a corner and there is the swell of Possum Kingdom Lake or
De Leon's painted downtown, or even the quiet dignity of a presidio
surrounded by a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   That's the moment it is possible to understand why so many men
and women were willing to fight, suffer and even die for the right
to make Texas their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the moment you realize that whoever at the Texas
Historical Commission mapped out the Texas Forts Trail knew exactly
what he or she was doing.

TURNER PRIZES TO INNOVATIVE ARTISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The $33,000 Turner Prize was awarded in London this week to
painter  &UR; Chris Ofili &LR;  for a painting dotted with blobs of elephant
dung. The artist said he procures the material from the London Zoo.
``It is pretty straightforward,'' Ofili said. ``It comes out of the
elephant's arse, it dries up and is ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize is given every year to British artists younger than
50. Ofili's main competitors were sculptor  &UR; Cathy de Nonchaux &LR; , who
made female genitalia in suede, and video artists  &UR; Tacita &LR; 
 &UR; Dean &LR;  and  &UR; Sam Taylor-Wood &LR; . Dean's video showed Hungarian women in
a steam bath; Taylor-Wood shot a couple breaking up in a crowded
restaurant.
</P>

   ``Oh, man, thank God,'' Ofili said upon winning. ``Where's my
check?''

   &UR; QUESTIONING THE GOP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Can a Republican be a rock 'n' roll fan?'' asks the latest
issue of the rock magazine Request. Essayist &UR; Geoffrey Himes &LR; ,
obviously a subjective Democrat, writes that members of the Grand
Old Party, particularly members of the right wing of that party,
clash ``with the integrationist, nonconformist, working-class and
sexually exultant tendencies of rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Himes deems all Republicans segregationists, saying that ``every
time a European American performer incorporates a  &UR; Bob &LR; 
 &UR; Dylan &LR; esque lyric or a Stratocaster guitar solo, they are resisting
the still-powerful pressures to keep black and white cultures
separate. ... Without this race-mixing, you wouldn't have rock 'n'
roll.'' He draws similar conclusions about class.
</P>
<P>
   He blames rock critics for failing to point out the political
messages in the music. ``We've done a pretty poor job of it if rock
'n' roll fans still think they can be conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Adding to this round of GOP-bashing (did the magazine
editors know about the election results before these issues went to
press?), the newest Penthouse includes a cartoon essay that
attempts to answer the question, ``Do Republicans make love?''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. The latest issue of George magazine, which apparently had
a pre-election deadline, says  &UR; Newt Gingrich  &LR; is the ninth most

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CLAIMS IT BUILT A BETTER JAVA MOUSETRAP
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not a crime under the antitrust laws to take
a competitor's technology and make a better version, even if the
competitor's business from that technology drains away, Microsoft
Corp. argued in federal court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer asserted that after Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
Java programming language failed to deliver on its claims,
Microsoft improved the version it had licensed, mightily impressing
the trade press and the software development community.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining James Gosling, Sun's chief scientist and
Java's creator, attorney Tom Burt presented an e-mail message that
Gosling sent his colleagues at Sun after attending a 1996 Java
conference at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really scary thing at the meeting was how much effort
they're putting into it 12 months after they licensed it,'' Gosling
wrote, referring to the Microsoft-written code built into the
company's Internet Explorer browser, known as a Java virtual
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, on the whole they were doing a respectable job,''
Gosling conceded on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's claims that Java, which works with operating systems
other than its dominant Windows, was not viable seemed to
contradict videotaped testimony Wednesday from Bill Gates in which
the company's chairman said he viewed the technology as a
``threat'' to Windows' future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Burt had initially argued that Java posed a dire threat
to Microsoft's Windows franchise, he switched gears on Thursday to
portray Java as a flawed technology that had never met its promise.
To make his case, he cited Sun's once highly confidential documents
that described Java's inadequacy as a ``write once, run anywhere''
substitute for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   When Burt repeatedly asked Sun's Gosling about Java's
shortcomings, Gosling repeatedly replied that the ability to run
Java everywhere was a ``goal'' that Sun sought to attain as it
constantly upgraded its software.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is
presiding over the case without a jury, chided Burt for posing
``cumulative'' questions to Gosling, Burt said he was seeking to
prove that Java posed ``competition for the hearts and minds of
(software) developers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Achieving portability of code across computer platforms is
tough, but our goal is to make that as easy as possible,'' Gosling
noted.
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps, Tod Nielsen, who heads Microsoft's
relations with the outside developers, argued that it was
technically impossible to write a software program that will run
without changes on a host of computer platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out the promises were bigger than the facts,''
Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to back up Burt, Nielsen contended that the Java
version it built from scratch for Windows is technically better
than Sun's original version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of letting the cancer patient die, we have a cure, and
the cure is Windows,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the proceedings, Gosling, somewhat of a cult
figure in the Java development community, told a reporter that he
had bought his first suit, a fashionable model with blue stripes,
for his appearance in court as a government witness. On Monday,
before taking the stand, Gosling had sat unrecognized among the
spectators wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sandals.

   On the courthouse steps, Tod Nielsen, who heads Microsoft's
relations with the outside developers, argued that it was
technically impossible to write a software program that will run
without changes on a host of computer platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out the promises were bigger than the facts,''
Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to back up Burt, Nielsen contended that the Java
version it built from scratch for Windows is technically better
than Sun's original version.

<P>
   ``Instead of letting the cancer patient die, we have a cure, and
the cure is Windows,'' Nielsen said.

   During a break in the proceedings, Gosling, somewhat of a cult
figure in the Java development community, told a reporter that he
had bought his first suit, a fashionable model with blue stripes,
for his appearance in court as a government witness. On Monday,
before taking the stand, Gosling had sat unrecognized among the
spectators wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sandals.

   The $33,000 Turner Prize was awarded in London this week to
painter  &UR; Chris Ofili &LR;  for a painting dotted with blobs of elephant
dung. The artist said he procures the material from the London Zoo.
``It is pretty straightforward,'' Ofili said. ``It comes out of the
elephant's arse, it dries up and is ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize is given every year to British artists younger than
50. Ofili's main competitors were sculptor  &UR; Cathy de Nonchaux &LR; , who
made female genitalia in suede, and video artists  &UR; Tacita &LR; 
 &UR; Dean &LR;  and  &UR; Sam Taylor-Wood &LR; . Dean's video showed Hungarian women in
a steam bath; Taylor-Wood shot a couple breaking up in a crowded
restaurant.

</P>
<P>
   ``Can a Republican be a rock 'n' roll fan?'' asks the latest
issue of the rock magazine Request. Essayist &UR; Geoffrey Himes &LR; ,
obviously a subjective Democrat, writes that members of the Grand
Old Party, particularly members of the right wing of that party,
clash ``with the integrationist, nonconformist, working-class and
sexually exultant tendencies of rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Himes deems all Republicans segregationists, saying that ``every
time a European American performer incorporates a  &UR; Bob &LR; 
 &UR; Dylan &LR; esque lyric or a Stratocaster guitar solo, they are resisting
the still-powerful pressures to keep black and white cultures
separate. ... Without this race-mixing, you wouldn't have rock 'n'
roll.'' He draws similar conclusions about class.
</P>
<P>
   He blames rock critics for failing to point out the political
messages in the music. ``We've done a pretty poor job of it if rock
'n' roll fans still think they can be conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Adding to this round of GOP-bashing (did the magazine
editors know about the election results before these issues went to
press?), the newest Penthouse includes a cartoon essay that
attempts to answer the question, ``Do Republicans make love?''

 &HT;    Former women execs at BankAmerica resign after its merger with
NationsBank
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six of the 10 top ranked women executives at the old
BankAmerica have resigned since NationsBank, now part of the new
BankAmerica, announced in April that it would merge with the
California banking company.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle said Wednesday that women from the
old BankAmerica were being singled out for discrimination. The new
BankAmerica denied the charge. None of the women could be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Does Chief Executive Officer Hugh L. McColl's team discriminate
against women? ``I don't believe that's the case,'' said Lehman
Brothers analyst Diane Glossman.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco paper reported a former female BankAmerica
executive, who was not named, presented the newspaper with a
five-page memorandum claiming ``the entire generation of female
executives created during (the past 25 years) has been wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   The two top-ranked women who resigned, Kathleen J. Burke, who
headed human resources, and Cheryl A. Sorokin, the corporate
secretary, were principal officers of the old BankAmerica. No women
are now part of the six-person management team that heads the new
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   But only two male executives from the old BankAmerica are on the
new six-person team, and former NationsBank executives hold the
majority of other senior slots in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the board of directors, which is the highest
management group in the company, (you see that) 4 of the 19
directors are women,'' said BankAmerica spokesman John Keane.
``That would place the new Bank of America fifth among the largest
50 companies in the nation with women on their boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Another BankAmerica spokesman, Richard Stilley, named several
women in top jobs at the new company, including Adelaide A. Sink,
president of the Florida bank.If that unit were independent,
Stilley said, it would be the 10th largest bank in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The four top women executives from the old BankAmerica who
stayed with the new company have been demoted, the San Francisco
paper said. That's an allegation ``I'm going to quarrel with,''
said Stilley.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that the other female executives ``have good jobs
with a much larger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The published reports used anonymous sources and generalized
about the management team in a very unfair fashion. Most of the
female executives cited in the report were offered very important
positions in the new company,'' he said.

 &HT;    Cable convention shows serious side
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Is this a cable TV industry trade show or a
carnival? It has been hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor of the big industry get-together called
the Western Show, you can race cars in a big video game display,
watch the Radio City Hall Rockettes dance or shake hands of a Bill
Clinton look alike.
</P>
<P>
   It all looks like great fun _ and for the cable TV operators who
are the target of this carnival _ it is.
</P>
<P>
   But for the programmers who are hawking their shows, the
theatrics are a serious business. That's especially true this year,
with cable TV operators leery of adding new channels since they're
paying more for the ones already on their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These channels are too expensive,'' complained Lynne Bueing,
the vice president for programming at Los Angeles operator Falcon
Cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Despite grumbling by both operators and programmers, the
industry still managed to have a good time and even poke fun at
itself during the three days of the Western Show which ends here
today.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it was hard to board an elevator without first
being brushed down for lint by some merry promoters of the E!
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a holdup,'' said Falcon general manager Terry
Eagleton, watching businessmen standing in front of the elevators
with their arms over their heads. She took the stairs instead and
there was a long line of people behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the giant cardboard statues of Rockette dancers
greeting attendees in several hotels. One woman who accidently
backed into one yelped and jumped five feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``My god, I thought she was alive,'' gasped a frightened Rosanne
Merckleson, a Control Data publicist. She soothed her jangled
nerves with a big helping of candy at the HBO channel booth.

 &HT;    Operators, programmers square off
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Once upon a time, cable TV operators and
programmers were underdog comrades united in an epic struggle
against network television, which controlled 90 percent of all
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Western Show is any example, operators and
programmers are comrades no longer. Operators here at this big
industry trade show are openly complaining about the rising cost of
the channels they air, even threatening to yank some from their
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising programming costs is one of the industry's most
volatile issues,'' says Robert Stengel, a principal of industry
consultant Continental Consulting Group. ``Operators used to pay
almost nothing for programming. Now it eats up 25 percent of their
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this struggle between operators and programmers more
evident than in Atlanta. Operators Cox Communications, based in
Atlanta, and MediaOne, with operations in the city, are strongly
resisting an effort by Turner Broadcasting to raise the price of
carrying its popular TNT channel by between 5 percent and 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies will talk publicly about the dispute, but
negotiations have become so heated that top Cox Communications
executives have threatened to pull TNT off some of its systems.
Turner Broadcasting executives dismiss the threat as a negotiating
ploy, saying TNT is well worth the rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   But other operators point out MediaOne recently cut struggling
channel Court TV from some of its systems. Channels are rarely
discontinued once started _ until now. Top executives of Turner
Broadcasting and Cox Communications met here at the Western Show _
which closes today _ to try and settle their differences. The
meeting reportedly resolved little, if anything.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute between operators and programmers is
diverging interests and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For programmers, the emphasis is on producing better and better
shows. They smell blood and opportunity as network television
viewership continues to decline, with much of the loss going to
cable.
</P>
<P>
   To attract more viewers, Turner Broadcasting, for example, spent
$100 million to buy the syndication rights of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, has paid hundreds of millions
for some key rights to NFL football games. It has passed part of
the cost to cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne and Cox Communications swallowed that increase but
neither are happy about it. They and other operators argue their
industry cannot afford rising programming costs right now.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is twofold. One, the top operators are spending
billions of dollars to build digital networks that can provide not
only television but telephone service and high-speed access to the
Internet. MediaOne alone has spent $5.5 billion so far on such
efforts in cities nationwide, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many operators are trying to moderate price increases to
subscribers. Federal price regulation is scheduled to expire March
31 and operators don't want to do anything that would prompt
Congress to enact new restraints on their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Says Matt Bond, Tele-Communications Inc.'s executive vice
president for programming, ``Our programming costs are rising 10 to
15 percent a year while we're trying to hold rate increases to
subscribers to between 4 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't continue to do this,'' says Bond. ``At some
point we'll have to start trimming our channel lineup, eliminating
those that aren't worth the money.

 &HT;    Medicaid change will help rural facilities
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's Medicaid program has expanded its rules
governing physician assistants, paving the way for more medical
services in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Medical Assistance, which runs the
federal-state Medicaid program for more than 1 million low-income
Georgians, has decided to reimburse care by physician assistants in
what are designated ``remote sites,'' in medically underserved
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will improve access to medical care in rural
areas,'' said Mark Trail, deputy commissioner at DMA.
</P>
<P>
   Trail cited the South Georgia town of Willacoochee, where a
medical clinic's closing in August was the subject of a
Journal-Constitution article.
</P>
<P>
   In closing the Willacoochee clinic, its operators blamed a
Medicaid policy that blocked payment for physician assistants' care
at a private clinic, other than those designated as a hospital
outpatient center or a ``rural health center.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the clinic's patients were Medicaid
recipients. The closing left the community without medical
services, except for a single physician in his 70s, who is close to
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are having to travel out of town to see doctors,''
Jerome Crosby, a vice president of Peoples Bank in Willacoochee,
said Thursday. The clinic, he said, ``is a needed service, just
like water and sewer.''
</P>
<P>
   A former physician assistant at the clinic said he, along with a
doctor and another PA, plan to reopen the double-wide trailer
facility as soon as the Medicaid change takes effect. ``All we have
to do is get the go-ahead from Medicaid,'' said PA Bobby Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Access to health care has become a growing problem for many
rural communities. Some towns are threatened with losing their
hospital to financial problems. And if medical services dry up,
local jobs and industry are imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   In Willacoochee and such rural areas, PAs have helped fill a
medical void, though they can practice medicine only under the
supervision of a doctor. But while they must be available by phone
as a PA works, doctors generally don't have to be physically
present during those services.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Georgia Medicaid rules came under fire as too
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Willacoochee clinic was receiving
Medicaid reimbursements for PAs because it was labeled a hospital
outpatient center. But the clinic lost that designation when a
local hospital decided to close it in March. Tucker and another PA,
Arlene Gottlieb, and their supervising doctor, Dr. Robert Bowman,
opted to keep the Willacoochee clinic open themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, they were told the Medicaid payment would be cut
off, under a rule for private clinics that required a doctor to be
on the premises at all times. Bowman could only be present 10 hours
a week.
</P>
<P>
   DMA adhered to the policy despite Medicare, the federal
insurance program for the elderly, and private insurance paying for
services by PAs at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Trail said the new rule on remote sites would require a
physician be physically present only 25 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven areas, including Willacoochee, are designated remote
sites. In order to qualify, a clinic has to be in a medically
underserved, nonurban area.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid policy change, though, could take two months to be
implemented. Glenda Yawn, manager of the Willacoochee senior
citizens center, said many seniors are now traveling 30 miles to
get medical care. But when the double-wide trailer reopens, Yawn
said, ``the whole town will be happy.''

 &HT;    Barnes' priorities: Taxes, education, transit, training
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov.-elect Roy Barnes told members of the Georgia
Industry Association he wanted them ``to make money and pay taxes''
so he could educate Georgia students to be ``better employees for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday to the prelegislative conference of the GIA at
Cobb Galleria, Barnes said improved education, including expanded
technical training, is among his top priorities as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this upcoming session, I will create a commission _
either by legislation or executive order _ that will review where
we are in education and ask some hard questions about what needs to
be changed or done,'' said Barnes, who plans to chair the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he intends to begin creating ``a seamless education
system'' that will allow high school students who plan to become
skilled tradesmen, rather than attend college, to take courses in
advanced technical schools while still attending high school.
</P>
<P>
   The technical school credits would count toward a high school
diploma, and the students would still be considered high school
students so they could compete in sports and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't complete this during this session, but we are going
to begin,'' said Barnes, who stressed Georgia's education system
must continue to improve from preschool to adult if it is going to
compete successfully in the national and world economies.
</P>
<P>
   Also high on his initiatives, said Barnes, is the establishment
of a regional transportation authority to deal with air quality and
transportation issues in metro Atlanta. This authority would be
empowered to coordinate transportation in the region, including the
possible building of a west-east commuter rail system along the
northern arc of I-285.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot overemphasize the importance of coming to some
agreement on what are the limits of growth (of metro Atlanta) and
what infrastructure is needed to support growth,'' said Barnes.
``We cannot afford to stop growing in Atlanta, but that is what is
going to happen if we don't come to a consensus about a
transportation and air quality policy in the metro region.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he also plans to propose a three-year moratorium on
the payment of unemployment taxes by employers because the fund is
currently overfunded.
</P>
<P>
   This would amount to about $1 billion in savings for companies,
which Barnes said they could use to expand business growth and
employment.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Mercy Makhalemele found out she was
HIV-positive when she was pregnant with her second child. She was
23, had been married for five years, and was faithful to her
husband. She cried all the way home from the prenatal clinic, but
was too afraid to tell anyone for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally did tell her husband, he beat her to the
ground, knocking her against a lighted stove and badly burning her
wrist, she said. Then he threw her out of the house, refusing to
believe that he had given her the virus. The next day, he went to
the shoe store she managed. With everyone watching, he shouted at
her to collect all her things, he would have nothing to do with
someone with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Her employers dismissed her that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story,'' she told a women's group gathered for a luncheon
in Durban recently, ``is not just my story. If you talk to other
women, you will hear 90 percent the same. It will not be 50
different stories. Rejecting us is not going to solve the problem
of this disease. It's just going to cause stress. So please, just
accept us. `'
</P>
<P>
   Across sub-Saharan Africa, the AIDS epidemic is everywhere. In
several countries, one out of four people are now infected with the
virus and will probably die within 10 years. The disease is
flooding hospitals, changing the face of work places and producing
hundreds of thousands of orphans. But go to a village and ask if
anyone is suffering from AIDS and the answer will likely be no,
there is only malaria or tuberculosis or diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find anyone who publicly admits to being
HIV-positive. Many go to their graves with their secret, so great
is the stigma attached to AIDS. Discrimination against people with
HIV exists to some degree in most countries around the world. But
experts say the problem is particularly severe in Africa, where
little has been done to study or attack the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   The shame that people feel and the treatment they suffer at the
hands of their communities has far-reaching consequences for
efforts to fight the spread of the virus and treat the sick,
experts say. For one thing, it keeps people from wanting to find
out whether they have AIDS, and it encourages even those who know
they are HIV-positive to act as everyone else does, and perhaps
even spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a mother who is trying to hide her HIV status may
be unwilling to try infant formula to help prevent transmission to
her child if other mothers in her village are breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of discovery can also keep people from seeking services of
any sort. In South Africa, facilities earmarked for AIDS patients
often stand virtually empty even though the help they offer is
desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Richard's Bay, on the coast north of Durban, the town's six
largest employers have converted an old farmhouse into a nine-bed
AIDS hospice open to any of their 10,000 employees, many of whom
live in shacks. The building is surrounded by flowering gardens and
services include counseling for families, free meals and visits
with traditional healers if they are wanted. But despite a local
HIV infection rate estimated at 30 percent, the compound is rarely
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a huge disgrace to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS that
people will suffer all sorts of discomforts rather than associate
with a facility that is clearly known to be for people with AIDS,''
said Jenny Rogers, who designed the hospice.
</P>
<P>
   Those people who do come forward, even to tell their families,
face daunting prejudice. In some rare cases, they have been stoned.
But most often they are simply rejected by their families or
isolated, their utensils and bedclothes kept separate from everyone
else's, their needs suddenly last on the list. Some are thrown out
of their churches and hounded from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Makhalemele was making her plea for tolerance, a
19-year-old boy was alone in a Durban hospital suffering from
tuberculosis. A few weeks before, she had taken her pitch to the
boy's rural village and, inspired by her courage, the young man had
told his neighbors that he too was HIV-positive. Later that day,
his neighbors had gathered around his house and, hissing and
pointing, had forced him to leave. His horrified family also wanted
nothing to do with him, though efforts at reconciliation were under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also argue that the isolation that AIDS victims
experience can even hurt their family or community economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have perfectly normal people who cannot continue to
contribute to society anymore,'' said Jean Louis Lamboray, a policy
adviser for UNAIDS, the United Nations agency that deals with AIDS.
``If they have a shop, they lose their customers, they lose their
suppliers and soon they are out of business. That's the typical
story, 1,200 times over.''
</P>
<P>
   While the way people with AIDS are treated varies from country
to country across the continent, the discrimination seems to be
somewhat worse in southern Africa, which has among the world's
fastest rising rates of infection but few effective AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even to the north in Uganda, which is often held up as a
model country because it has an aggressive AIDS education and
prevention campaign, secrecy remains an issue. A 1993-4 survey of
more than 700 clients who had been in counseling sessions at an
AIDS services group found that more than 60 percent had not told
their spouse or regular partner. The clients urged the organization
to find an out-of-the-way location so that people could attend
without being identified. Experts say that discrimination continues
even now.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study in the southern African country of Zimbabwe found
that only one out of 10 people caring for someone with AIDS was
willing to admit that they were nursing someone with the disease.
Patients themselves were only slightly more likely to reveal their
status. Sixty-five percent had told no one.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, Peter Busse, head of the National Association
of People Living With AIDS, estimates that fewer than 100 of the
country's three million HIV-infected people are completely open
about it. ``When something like World AIDS Day comes around, we
have trouble finding 20 people to go on television and radio
shows,'' he said.

NASA READIES ENDEAVOUR FOR SECOND LAUNCH ATTEMPT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA late Thursday readied the shuttle
Endeavour for a second launch attempt early Friday after a
momentary hydraulic problem prevented its six-member crew from
lifting off on a mission to begin orbital assembly of the new
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle was to launch well before dawn from NASA's Kennedy
Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's ground control teams early Thursday were forced to
postpone Endeavour's liftoff when they could not resolve the cause
of a brief drop in hydraulic pressure. The unusually brief
launching period expired before the problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
   The scrub broke a string of 18 missions in which the shuttle has
lifted off once the countdown had reached the point where a shuttle
crew had climbed aboard. The string dated back to November 1995.
The Endeavour was 19 seconds from blasting off.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty arose when the astronauts activated the shuttle's
hydraulic systems with five minutes left in a countdown that had a
3 minute, 42 second launch period. A momentary drop in pressure in
the system that steers the shuttle triggered an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Launch and flight control teams at Kennedy and the Johnson Space
Center in Houston were unable to resolve the problem in time to
beat the clock. Flight controllers at Johnson, however, seemed
satisfied Endeavour was safe to fly but could not get their
colleagues in Florida to make a timely restart of the countdown
clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to launch with something we didn't
understand,'' said Ralph Roe, NASA's launch director at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The launch period for Endeavour is precisely timed so the
shuttle and its 25,000-pound space station module can reach an
orbiting component launched by the Russians on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded in the shuttle's payload bay is the Unity module, a
33-foot long cylinder with a half-dozen docking ports that will
inter-connect a future U.S. laboratory module, airlock and power
generating gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-built Zarya module, a much larger spacecraft
designed to provide propulsion, electrical power, guidance and
ground communications, awaits the shuttle crew's arrival in an
orbit just over 240 miles high.
</P>
<P>
   Once aloft, the Endeavour crew plans to rendezvous with Zarya.
Using the shuttle's robot arm and at least three long spacewalks,
they will then join the two components.
</P>
<P>
   The flight is scheduled for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five launches are envisioned over the next six years to
fully assemble an orbital complex that will sprawl to the size of
two football fields placed side by side. &QL;

 DURBAN: shows,'' he said.

   Experts say that lack of education about the disease,
superstition and conservative religious beliefs all contribute to
the discrimination people with Aids face. But some experts say that
Aids arouses such passionate responses because it encompasses two
subjects that are highly taboo in many parts of Africa: sex and
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a culture that knows about death, but we don't discuss
it,'' said Noerine Kaleeba, who works for UNAIDS helping
communities develop AIDS programs. ``We don't discuss sex either.
With us, you can have sex as long as you don't let us know. There
is a whole language for discussing sex, but it is very subtle _ a
child could be in the room and would never know that is what you
are talking about it. But a person who has AIDS, every time you
look at this person you must confront sex and death. These are the
things that make it too difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kaleeba argues that to some degree, however, the stigma is
self- imposed. The fear is sometimes greater than it should be and
counseling can go a long way to helping families accept those that
are infected.
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS sufferers complain that church groups are often
leading the charge in isolating those with HIV. Even before she was
diagnosed with the virus, Musa Njoko was asked to leave her church
choir in a township on the outskirts of Durban. She had swollen
glands and asthma and people were whispering about her having ``the
Big A,'' she said. But since she had only had two boyfriends, she
did not believe it was possible. For weeks after she was diagnosed
she did not leave the house. Church members came to visit but would
not enter her room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Njoko says that people still call saying that she is
bringing shame on her family for speaking out about the disease:
``They say isn't it enough that you have AIDS, do you have to
damage your family too?''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Saila, who has been hired to work for a UNAIDS program
that sends HIV sufferers to work in various companies to teach and
counsel about AIDS, says that he is often hounded when he is at
home with his family near Bloomfontein. His mother remains furious
at him for going public about his condition. She allows him to stay
home, but refuses to give him any money. ``She says food is enough
for you,'' he said. ``The rest belongs to the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Makhalemele gave birth to her daughter in 1994, none
of the midwives would sew her up. Four hours went by before an
aunt, also a nurse in the hospital, who came by to visit, read her
chart and did the work. The aunt did not know, however, that Mrs.
Makhalemele still had dressing inside of her and a massive
infection followed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makhalemele told her husband she was HIV-positive largely
because her baby daughter was so sick she felt she needed to be
honest with him. After he threw her out, it was the child's
pediatrician who took her in, giving her work as a maid. Though she
was grateful, she was also humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to become a maid,'' Ms. Makhalemele said. ``It
was not my dream. I had to swallow my pride. I needed money for
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, her husband got sick and a blood test showed
he was HIV-positive. It was only then that he admitted that he had
infected her and wanted her back.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both he and her daughter have died. Mrs. Makhalemele
is now employed by the National Association of People Living with
HIV/AIDS to go around the country talking to people in a campaign
to promote ``disclosure and acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is not advocating what she calls ``reckless''
disclosure. When she spoke to the women's group recently, she was
accompanied by a shy young woman named Princess who is also
HIV-positive and wants to volunteer with Ms. Makhalemele's
campaign. But her boyfriend has threatened to kill her if she goes
public. He already has a new girlfriend and does not want her to
know about his HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makhalemele is counseling Princess to go slowly. She
recently stopped more than a dozen young people from taking part in
an AIDS awareness television show because she felt they did not
truly understand the consequences of going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not for everyone,'' she said. ``It is a very serious
thing to do.''

 &HT;    Rumors about Rudolph have residents riled
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Dogs bark at unusual hours of the night. Food is
missing from houses. Residents report prowlers.
</P>
<P>
   That and other evidence convinces federal investigators that
Eric Robert Rudolph, suspect in the Olympic Park and Birmingham
abortion clinic bombings, remains in the rugged hills of western
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday at Andrews Memorial Park,
investigators said there's no information ``of any significance''
to conclude Rudolph has fled the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we develop such evidence or information, our focus
remains here in western North Carolina, and the Nantahala Forest,''
said Terry Turchie of the Southeast Bomb Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters used for survelliance, as well as medical and
transportation needs, will be used less on Wednesdays and not at
all Sundays to appease local churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   That is welcome news to Adelle Parker, a library assistant in
Andrews. ``They're so noisy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound in this mountain burg, like the one over the
weekend: Supposedly, a decaying body had been found in the forest.
Parker said she watched the news but never saw anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it fit, too,'' she said. ``A male. No one knew who he was.
And it was near the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   On its noon broadcast, a Winston-Salem, N.C., television station
_ WXII, an NBC affiliate _ reported receiving a letter ostensibly
signed by Rudolph. The author said he was innocent of federal
charges and that he was the target of an operation that was costing
the taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a member at Waco but escaped before the fire,'' the
letter read in part.
</P>
<P>
   The letter had an Asheville postmark and the author indicated
copies had been sent to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, ``60
Minutes'' and two North Carolina newspapers. WXII officials said
copies were turned over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A federal agent said the task force knows about the letter but
added: ``It ain't Eric Rudolph.

COMMENTARY: DIGGING THE GRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat wants everybody to understand his plan. Almost
every day he or one of his top men says it: On May 4, 1999, he will
declare the creation of an independent state of Palestine covering
the whole West Bank and whatever of Jerusalem he chooses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We understand him, all right: he is trying to leap over the
final round of talks with Israel. Nobody expects those talks to be
finished and the boundaries settled by May 1999. The final talks
deal with life-and-death issues like secure borders for Israel.
Arafat wants to settle borders himself, for Palestine and for
Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man knows Israel would never accept a Palestine he
prefabricates. It would decide how much frontier security Israel
has; guess. So he knows that if he runs to meet his May 4 mirage
and declares it real and alive, the chances for peace that had
recently seemed likely would be replaced by the probability of war.
Palestine in May could become Palestine never.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it bluff, a trick, or a sick man's willingness to gamble his
people's future against his last days of glory? Not likely. Israeli
officials believe, and so do I, that he counts on most of the
nations of the world, including America, to give silent or stated
acquiescence to un-negotiated Palestinian independence, despite the
repeated promise against change without full negotiation, despite
what Arafat's self-chosen borders would cost in blood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis believe the past five years of negotiation will
lead to an independent Palestine. It would have been guaranteed by
the Palestinians' passion for nationhood, their willingness to
fight for it, the enormous concessions of land and self-government
made by the previous Israeli government, and the decision by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to accept land for peace
on the condition of Israel's own definition of its security.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians are fatally underestimating Israeli
determination not to have an Arab-drawn Palestine imposed on them.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations last week Dore Gold, Israel's
representative, said with total clarity that if Arafat went through
with a unilateral declaration of independence Israel would be free
to take all necessary steps, ``including the application of Israeli
rule, law and administration'' to all Jewish settlements and
security areas on the West Bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, Netanyahu gave the same warning in one word. He
paused so I could write it down: annexation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October came the U.S.-Israel-Palestinian conference in Wye,
Md., and the agreement for an additional 13 percent withdrawal by
Israel, to be followed by the final negotiations. They were
supposed to deal with the gut issues of Palestinian nationhood _
secure borders, water, protection for Jewish settlers, Jerusalem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things seemed to be going along pretty well _ which meant Israel
turned over more territory, Palestinians accepted it, and waited
for the other agreed slices. Total agreement to date: Arafat
control of the Palestinian population and 40 percent of the land.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Wye, the stepped-up drive started for a May 4 Palestine
stuffed down Israel's throat before the end of the critical final
talks. On Wednesday, Palestinian musclemen invited TV cameramen to
a demonstration that turned into a near-lynching of an Israeli
soldier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tape sickened all Israel _ including members of the Cabinet.
They knew that if Israel accepted the public beating of Israeli
soldiers on Israeli territory, the question would not be
Palestinian sovereignty someday, but Israeli sovereignty right now.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Thursday, Israel said no more land transfers to Palestinians
unless Arafat formally withdraws his May 4 plan, and acknowledges
Israel's statement at Wye that it will not release from prison the
men Palestinians were demanding freed _ captured Hamas killers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14 President Clinton will visit Gaza, a great triumph
for Arafat. Israelis and Palestinians know that if Clinton remains
silent or wobbly about Arafat's forced-birth plan, he will be
siding with or rationalizing what Israel cannot accept. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fruit of his visit would be a betrayal of all Israelis and
Palestinians who will die because Yasser Arafat is already digging
their graves.

BUSH WON'T BE SWAYED BY DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE TO GRANT 30-DAY STAY IN
EXECUTION OF CANADIAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, returning from an 11-day
overseas trip and finding himself in the middle of an international
controversy, indicated Thursday that he will not be swayed by
diplomatic pressure to grant a 30-day stay to a Canadian national
scheduled to be executed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
had requested the stay after meeting with Canadian officials, Bush
said he would take no action until he had received a recommendation
from the State Board of Pardons and Paroles concerning the case of
Joseph Stanley Faulder, who has been on death row for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has had sufficient time to review Mr. Faulder's
(clemency) petition in detail and should not require additional
time to examine the issues raised in the petition,'' he said in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the 1969 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,
which states that foreign nationals, at the time of their arrest,
must be informed of their rights to contact their government.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, who was convicted of the 1975 robbery-murder of an East
Texas woman, was never informed of that right and the Canadian
government did not learn of his conviction in Texas until 15 years
later. His lawyers last week filed their final appeal with the U.S.
Supreme Court, but Bush's office has become the focal point of a
diplomatic effort to spare Faulder.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy has asked Bush to lift
Faulder's death sentence and last week was joined in that effort by
United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson. Albright
then interceded with her request for a 30-day stay of execution and
offered to send State Department officials to Texas to brief the
governor on the implications of the Vienna treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I receive the board's recommendation, I assure you that
I will consider carefully those same issues when I review Mr.
Faulder's request,'' Bush said in his letter to Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the parole board, said the panel
can consider the issue of consular notification in reviewing
Faulder's case, but he was noncommittal about the weight it would
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider any and all issues that are brought to our
attention,'' he said. ``The most important thing I can say is we
will deliver our recommendation to the governor in a timely
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While the board members are deliberating Faulder's fate in
secrecy, they are awaiting the outcome of a court battle over the
constitutionality and legality of their review procedures.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, state District Judge Paul Davis issued a temporary
restraining order against the board's practice of non-public
deliberations and voting. Ruling in a class action suit filed by
Faulder's attorneys, Davis said the parole board's actions are in
violation of the state constitution and the state Open Meetings
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The effect could be to force the board to hold a public meeting
to consider Faulder's case _ and the cases of all death row inmates
who petition for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales immediately appealed to the Court
of Criminal Appeals, arguing that a judge in a civil case had no
jurisdiction in a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave no hint Thursday that he was inclined to stop
Faulder's execution and he suggested that he did not expect such a
recommendation from the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor can't commute a death sentence
without a recommendation of the board, but he can grant one 30-day
reprieve on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like to me that if that option (reprieve) is
granted to me it makes any sense,'' he said. ``They (the parole
board) have had ample time to look at the issue already. It's not
as if the commutation request came at the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case raises the same Vienna Convention issues that the
state confronted when the Mexican government objected to the
execution of Irineo Montoya Tristan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the courts, not the governor, should resolve any
constitutional issues involving international treaties and death
row inmates. He said the courts reviewed the consular notification
issue in the Montoya case and have also addressed it in the Faulder
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I will uphold the laws of the state of Texas
regardless of the nationality of the person involved,'' he said.
``People can't just come into our state and cold-blood murder
somebody. That's unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bush came under pressure to commute the death
sentences of convicted murderers Karla Faye Tucker and Henry Lee
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was executed in February, the first woman to be put to
death in Texas since 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Bush commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison in June, saying
questions raised about his case convinced him to do so. &QL;

'90S GAME IS WIN NOW: GET ROCKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days ago, Tom Hicks was in his private jet, somewhere
over Kentucky, headed west for the Texas motherland. By air phone,
he was talking about a pending emergency, which had nothing to do
with his flight. Or, for that matter, the state of pitching in
Arlington after the Randy Johnson rejection 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy told me we were second on his list, but he was torn
between a baseball and a family decision,'' said the Rangers owner.
``When he chose Arizona, he chose family. I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks then mentioned, ``Bud.'' No, not the long-neck variety,
but Bud as in Selig, commissioner of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called an emergency meeting of the owners for Thursday
\Rin Chicago\S,'' said Hicks. ``We truly have an emergency in
baseball. The dividing line grows wider and wider between the teams
that can spend and the teams that can't spend. It's down to a mere
handful of us in both leagues who are now active in free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   That owners' meeting was yesterday. Selig's concern over the
haves and the have-nots is certainly legitimate, but there is no
known solution, outside of blowing up the players' union. But the
players' union owns all the dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, by the way, went as far as saying, ``I'd love to be a
part of baseball trying to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's an owner who this week alone saw his salary offer of
$50 million turned down by Randy Johnson. And some 30 minutes after
his conversation with me, the Hicks air phone was ringing again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Doug Melvin, seeking permission from Hicks to
sign Rafael Palmeiro to a $45 million contract. The approval came
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is a ``player.'' The Rangers are ``players.'' When Hicks
purchased the team last January, this was predicted. Baseball life
as we've always known it in Arlington _ just doing enough, but
never pushing the bottom line _ changed instantly because of Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the sale of the team didn't happen two years earlier. If
so, we wouldn't now be having a
how-do-the-Rangers-get-Roger-Clemens debate. The Rocket-ship would
already be parked in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is obviously sincere in his worry about the overall
welfare of baseball. There is and will continue to be a negative
impact on all 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if only the strong can survive and prosper, what's a
Tom Hicks going to do? And what does the local fandom want him to
do? The answer to both is go for the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why in the same week Bud Selig is calling an emergency
meeting on the disparity between rich and poor teams, Hicks had
nearly $100 million in contract offers on the table to two players.
For at least 20, if not more, of the 30 teams, that would be
financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and team president Tom Schieffer also became very touchy
this week over criticism of another ticket-price hike for fans.
Schieffer even asked some local writers to stop by his office,
where he tried to show a projected financial loss of up to $14
million for the Rangers in 1999. In Minnesota, Kansas City,
Pittsburgh and on and on, those teams simply stopped the spending,
and ordered payroll cuts. They have no hope of making payroll ends
meet by generating money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks knows he does, starting with a TV sports network he will
launch. Which is why his commitment to winning in Arlington doesn't
wane.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Hicks, the Rangers are on a fast track in the
free-agency market, although the current talent on the team still
will run out of rail before it can become a Yankees-type winner.
</P>
<P>
   This prompts some to think in small-brain baseball terms _ that
a rollback in priority is necessary. In other words, be docile,
build with the farm system, and wait a couple of years to see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but go tell that to a loyal fandom just hit with the third
ticket-price increase in three years. Tell it to the TV and radio
sponsors being asked to pay top dollar. Tell it to that corporation
that will soon pay about $10 million a year for naming rights at
the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the 1970s, either in baseball or in Arlington. The
one and only objective is to work on the fly in pulling together
the three key elements to winning _ farm system, free agency and
trades. There are Doug Melvin's marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, it's about winning now with an eye on the
future. But fewer concessions can actually be made to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, is why I'll flip-flop my initial opinion on
trading Pudge Rodriguez for Clemens. A very tough call, yes. But
Clemens makes the '99 team better, and also the 2000 team better.
</P>
<P>
   Hold your breath, Mr. Melvin, and do the deal. The price of
winning is excruciating, but only those who can and will pay the
price, do the winning.
</P>

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CLAIMS IT BUILT A BETTER JAVA MOUSETRAP
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    Eds: Adds words ``an implementation of'' to 2nd graf.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not a crime under the antitrust laws to take
a competitor's technology and make a better version, even if the
competitor's business from that technology drains away, Microsoft
Corp. argued in federal court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer asserted that after an implementation of Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language failed to deliver on
its claims, Microsoft improved the version it had licensed,
mightily impressing the trade press and the software development
community.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining James Gosling, Sun's chief scientist and
Java's creator, attorney Tom Burt presented an e-mail message that
Gosling sent his colleagues at Sun after attending a 1996 Java
conference at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really scary thing at the meeting was how much effort
they're putting into it 12 months after they licensed it,'' Gosling
wrote, referring to the Microsoft-written code built into the
company's Internet Explorer browser, known as a Java virtual
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, on the whole they were doing a respectable job,''
Gosling conceded on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's claims that Java, which works with operating systems
other than its dominant Windows, was not viable seemed to
contradict videotaped testimony Wednesday from Bill Gates in which
the company's chairman said he viewed the technology as a
``threat'' to Windows' future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Burt had initially argued that Java posed a dire threat
to Microsoft's Windows franchise, he switched gears on Thursday to
portray Java as a flawed technology that had never met its promise.
To make his case, he cited Sun's once highly confidential documents
that described Java's inadequacy as a ``write once, run anywhere''
substitute for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   When Burt repeatedly asked Sun's Gosling about Java's
shortcomings, Gosling repeatedly replied that the ability to run
Java everywhere was a ``goal'' that Sun sought to attain as it
constantly upgraded its software.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is
presiding over the case without a jury, chided Burt for posing
``cumulative'' questions to Gosling, Burt said he was seeking to
prove that Java posed ``competition for the hearts and minds of
(software) developers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Achieving portability of code across computer platforms is
tough, but our goal is to make that as easy as possible,'' Gosling
noted.
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps, Tod Nielsen, who heads Microsoft's
relations with the outside developers, argued that it was
technically impossible to write a software program that will run
without changes on a host of computer platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out the promises were bigger than the facts,''
Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to back up Burt, Nielsen contended that the Java
version it built from scratch for Windows is technically better
than Sun's original version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of letting the cancer patient die, we have a cure, and
the cure is Windows,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the proceedings, Gosling, somewhat of a cult
figure in the Java development community, told a reporter that he
had bought his first suit, a fashionable model with blue stripes,
for his appearance in court as a government witness. On Monday,
before taking the stand, Gosling had sat unrecognized among the
spectators wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sandals.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CLAIMS IT BUILT A BETTER JAVA MOUSETRAP
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    Eds: Adds words ``an implementation of'' to 2nd graf.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not a crime under the antitrust laws to take
a competitor's technology and make a better version, even if the
competitor's business from that technology drains away, Microsoft
Corp. argued in federal court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer asserted that after an implementation of Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language failed to deliver on
its claims, Microsoft improved the version it had licensed,
mightily impressing the trade press and the software development
community.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining James Gosling, Sun's chief scientist and
Java's creator, attorney Tom Burt presented an e-mail message that
Gosling sent his colleagues at Sun after attending a 1996 Java
conference at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really scary thing at the meeting was how much effort
they're putting into it 12 months after they licensed it,'' Gosling
wrote, referring to the Microsoft-written code built into the
company's Internet Explorer browser, known as a Java virtual
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, on the whole they were doing a respectable job,''
Gosling conceded on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's claims that Java, which works with operating systems
other than its dominant Windows, was not viable seemed to
contradict videotaped testimony Wednesday from Bill Gates in which
the company's chairman said he viewed the technology as a
``threat'' to Windows' future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Burt had initially argued that Java posed a dire threat
to Microsoft's Windows franchise, he switched gears on Thursday to
portray Java as a flawed technology that had never met its promise.
To make his case, he cited Sun's once highly confidential documents
that described Java's inadequacy as a ``write once, run anywhere''
substitute for Windows.

'90S GAME IS WIN NOW: GET ROCKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days ago, Tom Hicks was in his private jet, somewhere
over Kentucky, headed west for the Texas motherland. By air phone,
he was talking about a pending emergency, which had nothing to do
with his flight. Or, for that matter, the state of pitching in
Arlington after the Randy Johnson rejection 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy told me we were second on his list, but he was torn
between a baseball and a family decision,'' said the Rangers owner.
``When he chose Arizona, he chose family. I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks then mentioned, ``Bud.'' No, not the long-neck variety,
but Bud as in Selig, commissioner of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called an emergency meeting of the owners for Thursday
\Rin Chicago\S,'' said Hicks. ``We truly have an emergency in
baseball. The dividing line grows wider and wider between the teams
that can spend and the teams that can't spend. It's down to a mere
handful of us in both leagues who are now active in free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   That owners' meeting was yesterday. Selig's concern over the
haves and the have-nots is certainly legitimate, but there is no
known solution, outside of blowing up the players' union. But the
players' union owns all the dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, by the way, went as far as saying, ``I'd love to be a
part of baseball trying to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's an owner who this week alone saw his salary offer of
$50 million turned down by Randy Johnson. And some 30 minutes after
his conversation with me, the Hicks air phone was ringing again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Doug Melvin, seeking permission from Hicks to
sign Rafael Palmeiro to a $45 million contract. The approval came
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is a ``player.'' The Rangers are ``players.'' When Hicks
purchased the team last January, this was predicted. Baseball life
as we've always known it in Arlington _ just doing enough, but
never pushing the bottom line _ changed instantly because of Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the sale of the team didn't happen two years earlier. If
so, we wouldn't now be having a
how-do-the-Rangers-get-Roger-Clemens debate. The Rocket-ship would
already be parked in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is obviously sincere in his worry about the overall
welfare of baseball. There is and will continue to be a negative
impact on all 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if only the strong can survive and prosper, what's a
Tom Hicks going to do? And what does the local fandom want him to
do? The answer to both is go for the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why in the same week Bud Selig is calling an emergency
meeting on the disparity between rich and poor teams, Hicks had
nearly $100 million in contract offers on the table to two players.
For at least 20, if not more, of the 30 teams, that would be
financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and team president Tom Schieffer also became very touchy
this week over criticism of another ticket-price hike for fans.
Schieffer even asked some local writers to stop by his office,
where he tried to show a projected financial loss of up to $14
million for the Rangers in 1999. In Minnesota, Kansas City,
Pittsburgh and on and on, those teams simply stopped the spending,
and ordered payroll cuts. They have no hope of making payroll ends
meet by generating money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks knows he does, starting with a TV sports network he will
launch. Which is why his commitment to winning in Arlington doesn't
wane.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Hicks, the Rangers are on a fast track in the
free-agency market, although the current talent on the team still
will run out of rail before it can become a Yankees-type winner.
</P>
<P>
   This prompts some to think in small-brain baseball terms _ that
a rollback in priority is necessary. In other words, be docile,
build with the farm system, and wait a couple of years to see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but go tell that to a loyal fandom just hit with the third
ticket-price increase in three years. Tell it to the TV and radio
sponsors being asked to pay top dollar. Tell it to that corporation
that will soon pay about $10 million a year for naming rights at
the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the 1970s, either in baseball or in Arlington. The
one and only objective is to work on the fly in pulling together
the three key elements to winning _ farm system, free agency and
trades. There are Doug Melvin's marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, it's about winning now with an eye on the
future. But fewer concessions can actually be made to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, is why I'll flip-flop my initial opinion on
trading Pudge Rodriguez for Clemens. A very tough call, yes. But
Clemens makes the '99 team better, and also the 2000 team better.
</P>
<P>
   Hold your breath, Mr. Melvin, and do the deal. The price of
winning is excruciating, but only those who can and will pay the
price, do the winning.

GENETIC BASIS FOUND FOR RAPID DETERIORATION OF SOME HIV PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered why some people who are infected with
the AIDS virus have a rapid downhill course, becoming gravely ill
and dying within a few years, while most infected people live for
years without major symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The key is a gene that acts like a molecular rheostat, turning
up or down the activity of another gene that produces a protein the
AIDS virus uses as a doorway to enter cells. A normal variant of
the rheostat gene turns out to accelerate the onslaught of the AIDS
virus in about a fifth of people whose HIV infection progresses
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   About one person in 10 has the gene variant, which is described
in a report in Friday's issue of the journal Science. As a result,
said Dr. Stephen J. O'Brien, the head of the group that discovered
the gene's effect, ``if they get infected with HIV, they'll go
fast.'' O'Brien is chief of the laboratory of genomic diversity at
the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the discovery might help them devise treatment
strategies, but not actual treatments for HIV. O'Brien said the
discovery's immediate importance was in evaluating AIDS vaccines,
because it was important to know a group's genetic susceptibility
in deciding if a vaccine slowed the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, researchers say, the result is most significant as a
harbinger of the future of disease research. It fleshes out a
picture of HIV infections that illustrates how a gene that appears
to have no obvious relationship to a disease can determine the
outcome of the complex battle between the body, with all its cells
and organs, and a disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is leading the way,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treating AIDS patients have long been interested in the
unpredictable nature of the disease. While, on average, the time
from infection with HIV to disease is about 10 years, there are
people at either end of a wide spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with HIV come to the clinic and could live for more
than 15 years and be healthier than you or I,'' said Dr. Sunil
Ahuja, an AIDS researcher at the University of Texas Health Science
Center in San Antonio. Or, he said, ``they could die two or three
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   With just a few years of concentrated effort, AIDS researchers
have discovered genetic variations that normally have no
consequence, yet can cause the most striking features of infections
with HIV
</P>
<P>
   First they found genes that act like ``a molecular condom,''
Ahuja said, protecting people from becoming infected. Then they
found genes that determine whether people who are infected will be
long-term survivors, those lucky 5 percent of infected people who
go for more than 15 years without becoming ill.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have a gene that puts people at the other end of the
spectrum, making them quickly succumb to HIV. And soon to appear,
one group says, is research showing a gene that determines whether
an infected woman will pass on HIV to her fetus.

 UNDATED: her fetus. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, said Dr. John Moore, a researcher at the Aaron
Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, scientists had an
advantage in their studies.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the epidemic, thousands of patients have
volunteered to be followed closely, providing cells for genetic
analysis and medical records that would allow researchers to
correlate their disease progression with their genetic inheritance.
Those large groups of patients were the key to discovering the
relationships of genes to the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is all but useless, Moore said, to look at an individual and
ask why that particular person did, or did not, have a rapidly
progressing infection. Scientists need to look at close to 1,000
individuals to see if a particular genetic pattern persists in
people with particular disease patterns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current discovery builds on recent research showing that
CCR5, a protein on the surface of cells, can act as a doorway for
HIV. Then, about a year ago, Ahuja discovered genes that control
the CCR5 gene, the so-called CCR5 promoter genes.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further investigation, O'Brien and his colleagues,
including Dr. Maureen P. Martin and Dr. Mary Carrington, discovered
that there were 10 genetic sites within the CCR5 promoter that
varied from person to person, and each site had two possible
genetic forms. That meant there were a total of 1,024 possible
normal genetic variations of the gene.
</P>
<P>
   But, O'Brien said, when they looked for the variations in a
group of 2,400 people, ``mercifully, only four were common.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and his colleagues next examined genetic and medical
data from 700 people who had been infected with HIV. Close to 15
percent had progressed rapidly to severe illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Of them, 10 percent to 17 percent had a particular variant of
the CCR5 promoter gene, the investigators found. The investigators
expect that other, as yet undiscovered genes, will explain why the
others deteriorated so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he saw the growing understanding of how genes
determine the course of an HIV infection in terms of an epic
struggle between the virus and the human body.
</P>
<P>
   As a swarm of billions of viruses try to invade cells, they
require collaboration from the body _ its cells, enzymes and
molecular pathways that facilitate the course of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, the body can throw up a roadblock and slow or
prevent the viral attack. And at any stage, genes that control
cellular functions that may seem only tenuously connected to
infection with the AIDS virus can take on key roles.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth K. Kidd, a professor of genetics and psychiatry at
Yale University, said the AIDS scenario was typical of diseases in
general.

GRAND FINALE FOR A FAILED EXPERIMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Western Athletic Conference preparing for its last
football game as a 16-team global conglomerate, it seemed logical
to play this one partly for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young coach LaVell Edwards, whose team will play Air
Force in the third and final championship game tomorrow, praised
the short-lived expansion league as being innovative and open to
new concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played the first of these things back in '96, the idea
was evidently to find the two guys with the least amount of hair,''
said Edwards, whose coaching opponent then was Wyoming's Joe
Tiller, now at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' he said, ``I see they've changed the format to
where they just picked the two oldest guys.''
</P>
<P>
   While flattered at this comparison, Air Force's Fisher DeBerry
quickly clarified the issue by saying, ``Well, I ain't as old as
/he'' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there seemed a sentiment that the Cougars and
Falcons _ the most nationally visible teams throughout much of the
league's history _ were the perfect duo for the last title game.
</P>
<P>
   And a certain nostalgic air this week carried an ironic twist:
The schools to whom the name ``WAC'' means the most are mostly
those who will form the Mountain West Conference next year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight teams remaining in next year's WAC, only two _
UT-El Paso and Hawaii _ were members at the start of the 1990s, and
only one (UTEP) can trace its membership back to the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Any tears shed about this over here in the Central time zone are
unlikely to be induced by nostalgia ... and will dry quickly as
soon as somebody comes up with a TV contract and a locked-in bowl
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards and DeBerry, who have spent 56 years either as
assistants or head coaches at their respective schools,
unquestionably represent the WAC at its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way to end this,'' Edwards said,
``than with BYU and Air Force _ two schools that have meant a great
deal to this league over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edwards arrived at BYU as an assistant in '62, the Cougars
were running the single wing with a famed tailback named Eldon
``The Phantom'' Fortie. When Edwards became the head coach 10 years
later, he ran an offense that featured the nation's leading rusher,
Pete Van Valkenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned to the pass ... creating a ``Quarterback
Factory'' (Gary Sheide, Gifford Nielsen, Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon,
Steve Young, Robbie Bosco, Ty Detmer, John Walsh, Steve Sarkisian)
and 25 years of highlight films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen this league grow over the years into something I
think we can all be proud of,'' said Edwards, who personally
distinguished the WAC by winning a national championship in 1984.
``It's grown into a very exciting conference _ we helped kick off
the Fiesta Bowl, and got the Holiday Bowl started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certain people are meant to be in a place at a certain
time, and maybe Fisher and I are examples of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Ken Hatfield, the man who hired
him as an assistant 19 years ago, DeBerry has improbably turned a
military institution with rigid academic standards into a national
presence. Further, he accomplished it with a presumed-extinct
wishbone that has blossomed into the multipronged spread option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a member of the WAC has meant a great deal to us over
the years, and we are grateful for the experience,'' he said. ``I
would just like to think that we have given something back.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a failed experiment's grand finale is a perfect match: the
league's best passing team against the best rushing team, and a
clash of the two top defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to be here,'' Edwards said, ``except for one
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the wishbone.'' \Ntagtop:Whit Canning, (817) 390-7760

</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Karl Benson said a sellout crowd is expected at Sam
Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas for the WAC title game. This is due
partly to the fact that BYU brings a lot of fans and also that the
stadium capacity has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``When BYU played here two years ago, they brought about 20,000
and we had a record crowd over 42,000,'' Benson said. ``Some of the
seats have been removed since then, and current capacity is about
36,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both schools have sold their 10,000 allotment, and BYU's sales
are going about as they did in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson also used the occasion to reflect wryly on the breakup of
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have national exposure in a good time slot \Rnoon, Central
time\S on ABC, so this is a real plus,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,
neither the WAC nor the Mountain West will likely be able to
duplicate this in the near future. For one thing, neither will have
a championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the league's bowl situation has remained fuzzy throughout
the year, both teams in the title game have accepted the bids they
were offered: The Cougars will play Tulane in the Liberty Bowl on
Dec. 31, while the Falcons will be part of a Christmas doubleheader
(Aloha-Oahu) in Hawaii.
The Buzz
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Cougars are often a slow-starting team while
Air Force is fond of getting the early jump, BYU linebacker Rob
Morris said the problem has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about us,'' he said. ``We hired a guy to come over
to the dorm and blow a bugle every day at dawn.''...
</P>
<P>
   The presumably pass-happy WAC produced six 1,000-yard running
backs this year _ Mike Anderson (Utah), Jaime Kimbrough (Fresno
State), Ronney Jenkins (BYU), Marques Brigham (Wyoming), Basil
Mitchell (TCU) and Rodnick Phillips (SMU). But for the first time
in several years, there was nary a 1,000-yard receiver. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii closed an 0-12 year with losses to Northwestern (47-21)
and Michigan (48-13), then fired coach Fred vonAppen, whose
three-year tenure produced a 5-31 slate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Wading through a brutal 12-game schedule without a break, SMU
came up 5-7. Included in the adventure were losses to Tulane
(11-0), Air Force (10-1), Arkansas (9-2), Wyoming (8-3) and
Colorado State (8-4). The other two losses _ to Rice and Ole Miss _
were in overtime.

US WARNS MIDEAST LEADERS ABOUT THREAT TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week before President Clinton travels to Israel
and Palestinian territory, the Clinton administration is warning
both Israeli and Palestinian leaders not to set back a delicate
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The warning followed Yasser Arafat's declarations that he will
create an independent Palestinian state in May and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's threat to stop troop withdrawals in
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are alarmed by the increasing rhetoric by
both men, while still holding out hope that violence will subside
in the Mideast and peace talks will go on as planned during a
marathon session at Maryland's Wye Plantation in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wye River accords include a clear set of commitments which
both sides agreed to fulfill ... and implementation should proceede
without any new positions,'' White House spokesman David Leavy said
Thursday in a clear criticism of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy then criticized Arafat, saying ``We are against all
uniteral actions, incuding a unilateral declaration of statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Other US officials said it is too early to know whether the fury
will calm and troop withdrawals will continue from the West Bank.
They said Israel will be put to the test as it completes the next
pullout before President Clinton visits the region.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's cabinet has said that Palestinians must vow not to
call for an independent state in the spring and must publicly say
that Israel never agreed to free Palestinian prisoners who attacked
Israelis. Otherwise, the West Bank withdrawals will cease.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the Gaza Strip Thursday, Arafat said
Netanyahu's cabinet had violated its agreement with ``an attempt to
avoid honest and accurate implementation of what was agreed upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath declared the Israeli
conditions ``null and void.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, in Israel, Netanyahu said ``lynch mobs''
incited by Palestinian leaders had imperiled the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The latest jolts to the peace process came after Wednesday's
fatal stabbing of an Arab man in Jerusalem and the beating of an
Israeli soldier near Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu shook up many supporters of the peace process with a
threat to stop troop withdrawals unless Arafat publicly abandons
his calls for an independent state next May.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu continued to play to his right wing Thursday, inviting
the tough-talking leader of the National Religious Party, Education
Minister Yitzhak Levy, a chance to join his inner circle of
national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Netanyahu called the beating of the Israeli
soldier ``organized, orchestrated, planned in advance and fomented
by the Palestinian Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were uneasy about the
escalating rhetoric by both Netanyahu and Arafat, who had spoken of
each others as partners in peace after the excruciating peace talks
with Clinton in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that they still pressuring both sides to
honor the promises they made in the Wye agreement. ``We're working
to get this thing done and we still think it's going to get done,''
said one of the officials. All officials requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   US envoy Dennis Ross is scheduled to fly to Israel over the
weekend to try to quell the controversy and prepare for Clinton's
Dec. 12-15 visit.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who follow the Mideast said they are
concerned by the recurring violence but do not expect a significant
problem in the peace process before Clinton's visit. ``When the
Israel government has made a commitment, such as (withdrawing from)
Hebron, it's been a long and tortured and difficult proces, they
take pride in ultimately fulfilling their promises,'' said Senator
Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who has visited Israel twice
this year.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing concern about the latest violence in the
region, Reed said, ``If you collected all the front-page stories of
every paper in the country that said the peace process was falling
apart in the last few years, you could wallpaper a pretty
good-sized room.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, aides who monitor the Mideast were divided
about Netanyahu's comments. Many said that the prime minister is
trying to stave off criticism from his right wing, which accuses
him of caving in to Palestinians. One congressional aide who
follows the region called Netanyahu's linkage of Arafat's comments
and the West Bank surrender ``a very big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   At Americans for Peace Now, a Washington group that has often
criticized the Israeli government, spokesman Lewis Roth said, ``I
tend to think Netanyahu made a significant declaration.'' He added
that the Clinton administration ``is really just looking to get
through this presidential visit to the area with everything
intact.''

UNREPRESENTATIVE LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) ,
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Except for the spectacular flameout of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, both parties in the Senate and House decided
this week to stick next year with their present leaders despite
last term's stumbling and skimpy legislative history.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough political restlessness to produce minor changes
in the second leadership tier. But besides the addition of Bob
Livingston as the new speaker, the top posts remained firmly in the
hands of men who represented the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   This happened despite shock waves set off by November's
unexpectedly pro-Democratic election and the unseemly scramble to
resolve the uncontrolled political quarrel over impeachment with
some semblance of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers choose their congressional leaders for reasons that
often have more to do with personalities and the exchange of favors
than with national stature or philosophical bent. But it does seem
odd that collectively the present leadership teams are so
geographically unrepresentative of the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in both the Senate and House is led by
men with their roots in a single region, the South. Livingston is
from Louisiana, Majority Leader Richard Armey and GOP whip Tom
DeLay, from Texas, and conference chairman J.C. Watts, from
Oklahoma. In the Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott is from
Mississippi, his deputy Don Nickles, from Oklahoma, and conference
chairman Connie Mack, from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leadership is more diverse, but, with some
exceptions, heavily representative of states with smaller
populations that have little in common with the urban Northeast and
West Coast. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle is from South
Dakota, Whip Harry Reid, from Nevada, and conference chairman
Barbara Mikulski, from Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt is from Missouri,
Democratic Whip David Bonior, from Michigan, and caucus chairman
Martin Frost, from Texas. Bonior, the most liberal of the group, is
the key exception, coming from a bustling, northern midwestern
state, the eighth most populous in the country. Martin comes from
Dallas in the nation's second most populous state, and Mikulski,
from urban Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   California, the most populous state, is not represented in the
leadership of either party. Nor is New York, the third largest
state. Texas is overrepresented _ by two Republicans and one
Democrat. Oklahoma, with only 1.2 percent of the national
population, has a top GOP insider in both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, about to have the next speaker, has only 1.6 percent
of the population and ranks 22nd in size among the states.
Mississippi, with the Senate majority leader, has even less _ 1
percent of the population, for a ranking of 31st.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota's Daschle represents the tiniest constituency. His
state is 45th in size with only 0.3 percent of the population. His
deputy Reid comes from further west than the others, but Nevada
with 0.6 percent of the population is only the 38th largest state.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, this is a small power circle indeed. Does the
shortage of regional and philosophical diversity at the top of the
Senate and House matter much? Actually, it does, but mostly in
subtle ways.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties earn and keep their posts by
accommodating the often-competing needs of their colleagues. Lott,
Daschle and Gephardt are renowned for patient efforts to reconcile
differing interests and reach compromises that can move legislation
forward. Livingston has a reputation of being in that mold as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they come to these roles carrying their own biases and
backgrounds, which are bound to mark their thinking and their
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The three Texans, who come from safe districts, are the most
obvious about this, unafraid to take categorical positions at odds
with the majority of their own troops and the needs of the country.
Where they come out in backroom negotiations may differ from their
public postures, but their public postures can still have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Armey is the most insensitive, unafraid to look ignorant by
saying such things as he had been to Europe once, so he didn't have
to go abroad again.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard good politicians try, they can never be
totally objective. They are creatures of all the influences and
impulses that have affected their lives and their careers. How can
a man from Mississippi really understand the complicated economic
and cultural pressures of northern urban ghettos? How can a rural
state midwesterner ever fully comprehend metropolitan demands for
federal help for mass transit?
</P>
<P>
   The majority of these leaders are disturbingly alike.
</P>
<P>
   They get competing views from their staffs, their colleagues and
the public. And philosophically they are not identical. But in
their hearts and minds they are of a political piece.
</P>
<P>
   They are from the old, politically powerful America _ the South
and the small towns _ not from the future America _ the vast
technology-driven East-West Coast population explosion. Eventually,
we are likely to pay a price for that.

AFTER INITIAL PROGRESS, ULSTER TALKS STALL

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ After a day of negotiations and
statements that compromise was imminent, Protestant and Roman
Catholic leaders apparently failed Thursday to agree on several
important issues in the Northern Ireland peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements said Thursday morning to have been all but clinched
began unraveling Thursday evening. The damage to the effort by the
new Northern Ireland Assembly to enact the provisions of the peace
agreement approved in the spring was serious, but not necessarily
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to agree leave the effort stalled, as it has been
for months. The Assembly members were apparently close to agreeing
on governmental structures intended to give additional power to the
province's minority Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the unsettled problems, the chief obstacle _
disarming the Irish Republican Army _ remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on whether the talks would continue
Friday. But officials said that schedule was highly unlikely and
that there would be no progress for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There had been near agreement on some of the governmental
structures envisioned in the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is progress inch by inch,'' said David Trimble, the first
minister of the Assembly and the Protestant leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   His Catholic nationalist deputy, Seamus Mallon, said significant
progress had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours reports began to issue from the Assembly in the
Stormont area of Belfast that Trimble had met Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Trimble was
said to have repeated his demand for a start to disarmament before
allowing Sinn Fein to participate fully in the executive cabinet of
the Assembly and in the North-South Ministerial Council, in which
Northern Ireland and Ireland are to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' reply was not known. But he has repeatedly pointed out
that the peace agreement stipulates only that the IRA disarm before
May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to compromise today added importance to Trimble and
Mallon's planned trip this weekend to Washington to meet President
Clinton at a White House ceremony.

GENE VARIANT HASTENS EFEFCTS OF HIV, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Aids-Mutate)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About one in eight Americans carries genes that would lead them
to develop AIDS more rapidly if they were infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Other genes have been identified that protect against the
progession of AIDS, or even against HIV infection in the first
place, but this is the first time researchers have found a gene
that accelerates HIV disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of whites and 43 percent of African-Americans
carry the gene variant, called CCR5-P1. But it takes a double dose
of the gene to provide the AIDS-promoting effect, and from 7 to 13
percent of Americans have two such variants.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have two copies of CCR5-P1 develop AIDS, on average,
about two years earlier than those who don't, the researchers said.
The genetic trait may explain many AIDS cases that occur within the
first three or four years after infection; most AIDS does not
develop until after an individual has harbored HIV for 10 to 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   The gene variant was discovered by analyzing 2,400 individuals,
about 1,900 of whom had been infected with HIV for varying periods
of time and 500 who were uninfected.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding, reported in the current Science, is the latest
in a fast-evolving series of discoveries about what scientists call
``host'' factors _ characteristics of the infected individual that
determine the course of disease, for good or ill, rather than
traits of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Host factors are important in virtually every disease, even the
most deadly. For instance, not everyone exposed to the bacterium
that causes plague dies from it, nor does everyone infected with
poliovirus become paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The CCR5 gene is important in AIDS because it directs the
synthesis of a receptor protein that sits on the surface of immune
cells. The receptor's normal function is to link up with
immune-system signalling chemicals called chemokines that are
important in inflammation and healing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the AIDS virus uses CCR5 to gain entry into
macrophages, the first type of immune cell it infects in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Carrington, a National Cancer Institute geneticist and
coauthor of the new report, said the newly discovered variant may
promote AIDS by increasing the number of CCR5 receptors on the
surface of macrophages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that you end up with lots of CCR5 receptors, so
the virus has more gateways into the cell,'' Carrington said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington said the new finding probably has no immediate
usefulness for HIV-infected patients _ for instance, in determining
which ones should be treated more aggressively because they carry
the AIDS-promoting gene _ because there are probably many ``host
factors'' involved in HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV is a multigene disease,'' she said. ``What we're learning
about the genetics of HIV disease probably can be applied to other
infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C. We're further along in
understanding the genetics of HIV disease than we are with any
other.''

IN SPECIAL TEAMS, JETS MAY MEET THEIR MATCH IN SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Only a year ago, when the New York Jets
weren't this good, when their defense wasn't holding the opposition
to the second fewest points in the NFL and the offense wasn't the
sixth highest-scoring unit, they had very special special teams.
</P>
<P>
   They virtually defined the Jets' renaissance under Bill Parcells
in 1997. Leon Johnson returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown, as
well as a kickoff 101 yards. Aaron Glenn produced a 96-yard kickoff
return for a score. The opposition had little success, though: No
one scored against the Jets' special teams.
</P>
<P>
   But in Sunday's opponent, the Seattle Seahawks, the Jets face a
club that has shown Jet-like dominance on special teams. The
Seahawks have produced a league-high three touchdowns on
kick-returns, including two by the dangerous Joey Galloway on
punts. He is also their leading receiver with 48 catches, an
average of 16 yards and 6 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are now one of the league's best special teams'
units following a season in which they were probably the worst.
They then hired the Redskins' Pete Rodriguez as assistant head
coach as well as special teams' maestro.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are the last obstacle before the Jets begin their
final triad against division opponents. And the Jets, despite their
8-4 record and first-place division tie, are trying to recapture
some of the special special teams' status they have not enjoyed to
the same degree this season.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather gets cold, Parcells believes, his special
teamers will be better than the opposition's. They are tougher, he
claims.
</P>
<P>
   But so far they have not returned a kick for a score. Meanwhile,
the Jets have yielded a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown to the
Ravens' Jermaine Lewis, something they did not do at all last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Jets' failure to dominate in punt returns this year
is because they are being taken seriously. The team's revival began
in Seattle with the very first game of the Parcells' era. The Jets
exploded to a 27-3 half-time lead in their opening game last year
at Seattle, and went on to trounce the Seahawks, 41-3.
</P>
<P>
   That game set the tone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hayes, one of the Jets' leading special-teams' tacklers,
contends, ``Everybody's gunning for us nowadays, and you have to
work that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Johnson added, ``They're playing us differently this year.
You can game-plan for something, and then the other team tries
something new. Last year, for example, there weren't too many
directional punts against us.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year the object has been to try to keep the ball away
from Johnson, or to simply boot it so high he cannot return it.
Last year he fair-caught only 6 balls while returning 51 punts.
This year he has called for a fair catch 11 times while returning
only 22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Johnson has been battling a knee injury this season.
His longest punt return has been only 19 yards. He averaged 12.1
yards a return a year ago, but only 6.8 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this year's Jets are a better team because the
offense and the defense is better. Last year the special teams had
to offset more Jets' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Against Seattle, the Jets must offset Galloway, especially on
special teams. Rodriguez has tried different things to motivate the
elusive return man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in and said to Joey, `I think we can be good on punt
returns if you work on it,''' recalled Rodriguez. ``Last year he
had a turf toe and he didn't want to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a big play in preseason,'' said Rodriguez, ``and he
told me, `Hey, Pete, if it's going to be this easy I'll do it all
the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Galloway has to be primed, so Rodriguez reminds him that
the Cowboys' Deion Sanders doesn't mind returning punts, and if
it's good enough for Deion, well...
</P>
<P>
   As for the Jets, right now their kicking game is better than it
has been all season. John Kidd's arrival has not only elevated the
punting game, it has improved place-kicker John Hall's percentage
as a new holder. Kidd is punting for an average of 42.2 yards. More
significantly, his net is 5 yards higher than Brian Hansen's, whom
he replaced. And with Kidd holding, Hall has been successful on 10
of his last 12 field goal attempts. His season's average is up to
72.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Jets have become the conference's top team in
getting good position following kickoffs-as well as keeping back
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That combination, along with their proven power on offense and
defense, could be a deciding factor as the race enters its final
four games.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Not surprisingly, KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, the only Jet on the injury
list the last two weeks, was upgraded to ``probable'' from
``questionable'' with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ VINNY TESTAVERDE became the first Jet in five years to earn
the American Conference offensive player of the month award. The
quarterback led the Jets to a 4-1 record in November, starting with
a fourth-quarter comeback victory in Kansas City. For the month he
tossed 9 touchdowns to 3 interceptions. He previously was named the
player of the month in 1995 in Cleveland and 1990 at Tampa Bay.
BILL PARCELLS was not impressed: ``If you go by Wednesday's
practice, he'd be down in Toledo pitching for the Mud Hens.''
</P>
<P>
   _ KEYSHAWN JOHNSON is hosting his annual ``Key's Kids'' luncheon
at the Official All-Star Cafe on Saturday. For the last three years
Johnson has brought a number of youngsters from various New York
programs to Jets' home games. At the luncheon he will lead them in
a Jets' trivia contest. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WHILE AT THE DENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If God had truly made man in His own image, as widely alleged,
there would be no dentists. No designer in his right mind, much
less a perfect and omnipotent God, would have settled for teeth at
the top of the human eating mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Had some draftsman shown Him blueprints featuring a
tooth-equipped jaw, God would surely have said, ``Pshaw! I can do
better than that,'' and that would have been the end of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I spent two hours the other day with a mouth full of
cotton, metal, slowly hardening plastics, rubber gloves and a
variety of other people's fingers. After the usual moment of
self-pity, I tried lifting a sinking spirit the good old-fashioned
way; to wit, by looking on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose man had no teeth. Would politics be possible without
teeth flashing to mask faces terrifying with insincerity? What
would have become of the Kennedys, of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter,
Nelson Rockefeller, Teddy Roosevelt?
</P>
<P>
   Think of George Washington with his famous false teeth and
painfully clamped lips. Father of our country he may have been, but
he lacked teeth that dazzle. Isn't this why Americans have always
felt uneasy toward him, never comfortable as they feel toward
toothy rascals we constantly vote for while blinded by the glare of
their teeth?
</P>
<P>
   A world without teeth? It would mean lovers on tube and screen
preparing to kiss with no sparkling incisors and canines to bare to
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Today's entertainment lovers go at each other with widely parted
jaws and dripping teeth, like those lions on PBS that are always
chewing on poor, helpless wildebeests.
</P>
<P>
   A world without teeth? We'd be denied Dracula movies and the
radio wit of the great Fred Allen sponsored by Ipana for the smile
of beauty and Sal Hepatica for the smile of health.
</P>
<P>
   With no toothpicks pouring off the factory line, how could we
tell when the cake is done?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is thin stuff, and two hours is long. The dental
chamber, however, offered another distraction: television.
</P>
<P>
   The set, mounted at ceiling height with its greedy salesman's
eye staring down, was tuned to one of those perpetual news
channels. This day there was no perpetual news, just perpetual
olds:
</P>
<P>
   Two Congressmen spoke of their respect for the Constitution.
Snow was falling on Western mountains. Children had murdered their
parents. Parents had murdered their children. President Clinton had
let photographers show him exuding the look of leadership. Movie
stars were having children out of wedlock. Extravagantly paid
athletes said they were being ``disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to watch this for two hours, I was astonished by the
intense concentration on money. Commercial after commercial urged
viewers to turn over money to this or that bank, this or that
brokerage house, the implied promise being that the money would be
miraculously multiplied by financial wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Did banks and brokers advertise constantly _ or at all _ on TV
before the present Golden Age of Money? Beer, cars, soda pop,
aspirin tablets were TV's lifeblood in my youth.
</P>
<P>
   The typical TV addict of those years would have been hard
pressed even to say what a broker did or why a bank should be
considered trustworthy if it paid you 2 percent for your money and
lent it back at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was as depressing as a Novocaine needle to sit there awash in
all this appalling evidence that so many lives are now consecrated
to the money game. All those brokerage-house commercials! There
must now be millions and millions of people willing to let Wall
Street desperadoes handle their money.
</P>
<P>
   Money, money, money, money was apparently the perpetual news.
There were minute-by-minute bulletins from Wall Street. The Dow was
up, the Dow was down, the Dow was steadying. The Nasdaq was down,
up, down, up, down ...
</P>
<P>
   Actors posing as bankers and brokers were pleading for money and
promising happiness, which apparently would ensue once you were
chin deep in money. Was it for this that Americans died at the
Alamo? And won the battle of Midway? And heroically suffer the
consequences of faulty jaw design?

COURT OK'S MASS. SETTLEMENT WITH TOBACCO COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Superior Court judge has approved Massachusettts'
$7.6 billion, 25-year settlement with the tobacco industry,
rejecting requests by anti-smoking leaders who wanted more time for
public scrutiny of the complex deal.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex Judge Martha Sosman said she was approving Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger's request to drop his suit against Big
Tobacco becausue the deal was in Massachusetts' ``best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's multibillion suit was set to begin in February. In
the case he filed three years ago, Harshbarger was seeking $2.3
billion plus penalities for the Medicaid costs incurred by
Massachusetts for smoking related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is a critical first step toward bringing the first
visible benefits of the agreement to the people of Massachusetts in
the spring of 1999,'' Harshbarger said. The state is expected to
receive an initial $98 million payment next March from tobacco
industry funds.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, Harshbarger, who was under heavy pressure from the
public health community and anti-smoking activists to reject the
pact, announced he was giving up his suit and buying into the $206
billion settlement negotiated between a handful of attorneys
generals and Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the deal, both in Massacusetts and nationally, had
urged Harshbarger to press the state's case because they felt it
was the strongest suit filed by an attorney general and stood a
good chance of winning and inflicting significant damage to the
cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   But in her decision Thursday to accept Harshbarger's request to
dismiss the suit, Sosman said the deal exceeded the financial
remedies she would have had the power to grant the state if a jury
had found the companies liable.
</P>
<P>
   Sosman also said the settlement offers some public health
remedies, such as marketing restrictions on the industry, that the
court could not have imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made it crystal clear that this settlement is in the best
interest of the people of Massachusetts and will provide tangible
benefits to our state, to our children and to the public health for
generations to come,'' Harshbarger said. ``I'm grateful that she
agreed that the terms of this deal exceed what we might have been
able to achieve through a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosman's decision to accept the consent decree clears the way
for the tobaccco money to pour into Massachusetts' state treasurer,
but also marks what undoubtedly will be a fierce debate over on
where the money will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger and tobacco control leaders vowed a battle to make
sure the money goes to anti-smoking and related public health
programs. Even Governor Paul Cellucci, who has supported plans to
raid the state's current $66 million tobacco control program, has
said he too wants the funds to only go to public health programs.
He said it would not be used to reduce taxes.
</P>
<P>
   After the first check in March, the state will get a $263
million payment in 2000; $284 million in 2001; $341 million in
2002; $344 million in 203; $287 million from 2004 through 2007; and
$323 million in 2008 and every year afterward.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Lois Pines, who had asked the court to hold
hearings on the issue before granting the decree, said she was
disappointed over the decision, and that she believes Sosman had
made up her mind before Thursday. Pines said she plans to file a
taxpayers suit to pressure state officials to use the money only
for anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there are issues that were not before the court, so I
filed my requests so that all the folks who were not party to the
settlement could be heard,'' Pines said.

NEW YORK COURT CLEARS WAY FOR FOOD STAMP CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's top court on Thursday cleared the way
for the state to dramatically alter the way public assistance is
delivered to recipients of welfare benefits and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than paying for groceries with food coupons, recipients
will be provided with electronic swipe cards. And instead of going
to one of a handful of facilities where cash benefits are
disbursed, recipients will be able to use their card at thousands
of ATM machines.
</P>
<P>
   The state expects the change will save up to $2 million monthly
while decreasing fraud and increasing privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to a grocery store and swipe your card,'' said attorney
David M. Cherubin of Albany. ``You don't have to take out a food
coupon booklet and immediately identify yourself to everyone around
as a recipient of government benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``electronic benefit transfer system'' has been operating in
a few locations in New York and officials hoped to have the program
running statewide by last summer.
</P>
<P>
   However, two competing firms, Transactive Corp. and Check
Cashers Association of New York, claimed the state had not followed
proper bidding procedures. A lower court annulled the $125 million
Citicorp Services contract, but a midlevel panel overturned that
ruling in a decision upheld Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the competing firms
lacked legal standing and therefore had no grounds to contest the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rule of law which extended standing to all and any taxpayers
to contest the manner in which state agencies award contracts might
seriously disrupt state operations,'' Judge George Bundy Smith
wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Albany attorney Hermes Fernandez, who represented Check Cashers,
said the ruling could have a dramatic impact on state contracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really restricted who can challenge state
contracts,'' Fernandez said. ``They have really restricted the
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Madden, a spokesman for the state Office of Temporary and
Disability Assistance, said the program would begin early next year
on Staten Island and will gradually expand statewide. Madden said
the state hoped to have the entire state on the system by the
spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a win for the taxpayers and it is great for the
recipient population,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the new system will eventually eliminate food
coupons, which are often stolen, lost or traded for drugs. They
also expect the new system to provide greater security; while
stolen food stamps can easily be used, a stolen swipe card is
useless unless the thief knows the secret personal identification
number.

SECOND-LARGEST COD FISHERY IN RUIN, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England's second-leading cod fishing ground has
collapsed from years of overfishing, according to a scientific
report released Thursday, forcing regulators to consider severe new
limits on cod landings that will hurt hundreds of fishing families
from Scituate to eastern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing regulators had hoped to avoid draconian measures to save
the cod in the Gulf of Maine, which includes near-shore waters of
northern Massachusetts, because so many small-boat fishermen rely
on the dwindling cod to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   But the report from the Multispecies Monitoring Committee, a
scientific panel that surveys groundfish, made it clear that delays
in tough action have brought the Gulf of Maine cod near ruin, with
record low fish populations and five times more fishing than the
scientists suggest for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few choices for the Gulf of Maine right now and
all of them are going to have an impact on people,'' said Eric
Smith, a member of the New England Fishery Management Council,
which must decide next week how to save the cod fishery. ``It's
very, very important to the communities of Maine and New Hampshire
and northern Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Gulf of Maine fishing ground completes the
decimation of a fish species once so bountiful that Cape Cod was
named for it and Massachusetts legislators hung a sacred cod in
their halls. But, four years ago, the historically even more
abundant cod fishing ground on Georges Bank collapsed, forcing
closures and other restrictions that continue today.
</P>
<P>
   Depletion of the cod in the Gulf of Maine, which extends up to
200 miles offshore from Cape Cod to eastern Maine, followed the
Georges Bank closures as the bigger Georges Bank boats moved to the
Gulf of Maine and traditional Gulf of Maine fishermen increased
their efforts as cod prices increased.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, several environmental groups called on the Fishery
Management Council to bite the bullet and slash Gulf of Maine cod
fishing by 80 percent next year, arguing that though the cuts will
hurt fishermen, they could allow the fishing ground to recover
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is tragic, but not a surprise,'' said Peter
Shelley, senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation in
Boston. He said the new limits on fishing ``will devastate the
coastal cod fishery, but there are no alternatives. The fishery
essentially must be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen, increasingly hemmed in by restrictions on their
livelihood, called on regulators to consider the damage to fishing
communities if cod catches are deeply reduced. They said some of
the 214 small boat fishermen on Massachusetts' Cape Ann would be
forced to give up fishing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would put Massachusetts fishermen from Scituate to the
New Hampshire border out of business for good,'' said Angela
Sanfilippo of the Gloucester (Mass.) Fishermen's Wives Association.
``To say that you can go catch everything else except cod is total
madness because cod is the permanent fish,'' meaning that cod are
the economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Fishery Management Council, which meets on Dec.
9 in Wakefield, Mass. to decide how to respond to the cod crisis,
had hoped that it wouldn't come to this. For two years, fisheries
biologists have warned that the cod population was sinking rapidly,
but regulators hoped modest restrictions, such as a 400 pound limit
on daily catch, would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   In August, faced with a roomful of angry fishermen, council
members decided to delay further cod fishing restrictions in hopes
that Thursday's Multispecies Monitoring Committee report would
contain good news.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report showed that fishermen caught more than twice
the safe limit of Gulf of Maine cod this year, removing 82 percent
of the population from the sea. With sexually mature cod at record
lows, the committee recommended that next year's Gulf of Maine cod
limit should be as low as 782 tons for the year, compared to the
4,075 tons fishermen caught this year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the council's problems, the report also saw signs of
renewed overfishing on Georges Bank where cod landings exceeded the
planned catch by more than 30 percent. As a result, the council may
have to impose more restrictions in addition to existing measures
such as the closing of 6,000 square miles to groundfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said Thursday that the best way to achieve the
cutbacks in the Gulf of Maine would be to close areas much like
Georges Bank. Many fishermen oppose that approach, since it also
closes areas to catching other groundfish such as haddock that
require the same types of nets.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Hopkins, an attorney with the Environmental Defense
Fund as well as a member of the New England Fishery Management
Council, said the council had already tried the weaker measures
that fishermen preferred _ and they failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council has run out of time and excuses to not take action
to protect the Gulf of Maine cod,'' said Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith, a Connecticut state fishing regulator and
council member, said the council can't forget the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf of Maine cod situation is dire, but it means the
council has to be very deliberate in how it weighs the overarching
conservation need relative to the impact it will have on society,''
he said.

ABORTIONS INCREASE SLIGHTLY AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of substantial declines, the number of abortions
performed in the United States increased very slightly in 1996,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,221,585 abortions reported to the CDC in 1996, a
0.9 percent increase from the 1,210,883 reported in 1995 _ but
still 15 percent below the 1,429,577 peak reported in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion ratio also rose slightly, to 314 from 311 for every
1,000 live births, in part because the number of live births was a
little lower. The rate of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44
remained at 20, the lowest rate since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, half the states reported fewer abortions
in 1996 than in 1995, and half reported the same or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to predict the pattern of abortions in the
future,'' said Lisa Koonin, the CDC's chief of surveillance for
reproductive health. ``The movement was less than one percent, and
that kind of variation in health statistics can be differences in
reporting, or a leveling off after years of declines. And it's
important to put it in context by remembering that the rate of 20
abortions per 1,000 is unchanged and the lowest since 1975. But we
still have a major public health problem of unintended
pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Population experts said it would be several years before it
became clear whether the number of abortions would continue to
decline, or whether that trend had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that the 1997 abortion data will show a
significant rise, said Stanley Henshaw, deputy director of research
at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research group that
collects parallel abortion statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at the preliminary 1997 data from 26 states and
New York City, and what they show collectively is a leveling off,
maybe a small decline from 1997, and that there's not going to be
any big increase,'' Henshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate on what the numbers mean. ``It's not
easy to explain no change, which is basically what this is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The slight rise in abortions was particularly puzzling given
that there has been a sharp decline in the number of abortion
providers over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and others have said that the factors contributing to
the overall decline in abortions since 1990 may have included
reduced access to abortion, changes in attitudes about abortion, a
decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies, and changes in
contraceptive practices like the increased use of condoms by young
women and the use of long-lasting methods like Norplant and
Depo-Provera.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, 55 percent of all abortions were performed
during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, and about 88 percent
were in the first 12 weeks, the same as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And as in previous years, 9 percent of women who had abortions
were white, 80 percent were unmarried and about 20 percent were
under 20.

ELECTION SET IN INDONESIA BUT PROTESTS PERSIST

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The government announced a date for
national elections today, but any hope that this would be received
positively by student protesters was short lived.
</P>
<P>
   The government set June 7 for elections for a new House of
Representatives. It also said that on Aug. 29, four months earlier
than previously scheduled, it would convene the highest legislative
body, the People's Consultative Assembly, to elect a new president.
</P>
<P>
   But students who have been pressing President B.J. Habibie for
swifter democratic reforms continued their protests and blocked
Jakarta's main thoroughfare Thursday afternoon, demanding the
arrest of Suharto, the former President, on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Students have held protests throughout the capital almost daily
since a clash with soldiers and the police in central Jakarta
mid-November left 16 dead and scores injured. In addition to
Suharto's arrest, student demands include returning the army to its
barracks and an end to its role in political and economic affairs.

ISRAELIS RE-EXAMINE MILITARY PRESENCE IN LEBANON

<P>
   YARON, Lebanon _ While the Israeli public debates a military
withdrawal from Lebanon, Pvt. Gil Shalom, his hair spiked with gel,
strums his guitar to relieve the anxious boredom of being stationed
on a bluff here above the sporadically deadly conflict between his
fellow Israeli soldiers and the Shiite Muslim guerrillas who bomb
and run.
</P>
<P>
   Like his bunkmates, Shalom, a medic who is 19 and a great fan of
alternative rock music, alternates between feeling pride and dread
that his first tour of duty has landed him at the Tsurit army post
just inside the war zone that is southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day you get here, suddenly you feel that this is the
real thing,'' he said Thursday, a week and a half into his
assignment. ``The sirens go off, you crouch down in a rabbit hole
with your friends, and you realize deep in your stomach that you
could be one those casualties of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all we train, it's good to feel you're in a position to
do something for your country,'' he continued. ``But the guys, we
don't like to say we're afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, seven Israeli soldiers have been killed
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon. The
spate of funerals, all televised, prompted anew what has been a
cyclical re-examination of the 20-year-old Israeli occupation of
this ``security strip'' along the Israeli-Lebanese border. While
the politicians discussed military tactics and diplomatic
strategies, many Israelis asked aloud if there remained a purpose
in putting the lives of Shalom and his friends on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Defense Forces, which believe that it would be a
mistake to withdraw unilaterally from Lebanon, staged a public
relations offensive for the foreign press at an army base in Sfad,
Israel, on Thursday. With public support for their presence in
Lebanon at a low, their goal was to portray their military
operation as a success, despite the recent killings, and to argue
that unilateral withdrawal would expose the population of northern
Israel to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``To every family of a soldier killed, the loss is 100
percent,'' said Brig. Gen. Shuki Shichrur. ``But as a country, as a
state, as armed forces, sometimes we have to pay a price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tsurit army post sits high above the verdant Jordan Valley
on a wind-whipped hilltop, exposed and chilly even under the noon
sun. It lies barely over the purple line that separates Israel and
Lebanon, at the edge of the zone where Israeli troops aim to serve
as a buffer between the guerrillas and northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials contend that the guerrillas, directly backed by
Iran, and indirectly by Syria, aim to conquer Israel and make it
part of a large Muslim state. Critics, though, say the guerrillas'
main goal is to kick the Israelis out of Lebanon, and that the
conflict is kept alive by the Israeli army presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet ministers traveled here Wednesday, to the edge
of the conflict, outposts like Tsurit, which boast no heavy
artillery and see little direct warfare. They, too, spoke with
soldiers like Shalom, teen-agers who talk earnestly about serving
their country while acknowledging that they call their nervous
mothers everyday.
</P>
<P>
   After their visit, the ministers were supposed to have issued a
statement on Lebanon, but were distracted by violent events in the
West Bank and East Jerusalem. Instead, the Cabinet decided to state
a new policy on the peace effort: that carrying out of the
agreement would be frozen until the Palestinians accepted three
conditions: to abandon plans to declare a Palestinian state by May
1999; to accept Israeli criteria for the release of Palestinian
prisoners, and to halt ``acts of incitement and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said he was surprised the Israelis didn't add a fourth
condition: ``that we sing the Israeli national anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   And opposition leader Ehud Barak said the Labor Party would
withdraw its safety net of support for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's shaky coalition if a freeze is imposed.
</P>
<P>
   A world away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the officers
and soldiers in Lebanon pointed down the hill to a kibbutz within
firing range of the purple line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be here,'' Lt. Yair Perry, 21, said. ``Otherwise,
they won't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shichrur asserted that the Israeli forces have been so
successful that they have deterred the guerrillas from even trying
``to penetrate'' the Israeli border for three years. Instead, the
troops have absorbed the attacks, with 21 killed so far this year,
an inevitable loss in an average year of this particular conflict,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When armed forces fight guerrillas, it's like a strong lion
fighting a bee,'' he said. ``It's very easy for the bee to hide,
and very hard for the lion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hezbollah has lost far more men, the Israeli general
said, boasting that no guerrilla group has suffered greater losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the history of Che Guevara, of Mao Tse-tung,'' he said.

EURO-NATIONS IN SURPRISE CUT OF SHORT-TERM RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eleven European nations unexpectedly cut short-term
interest rates Thursday, a coordinated attempt to spur their
economies and ward off the ill effects of the Asian and Latin
American financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another sign that economic policy-makers and
investors still fear a global downturn. In the United States,
shares fell for the third time in four days amid concern that
Brazil is failing to take steps to avert a meltdown of South
America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 184 to close at 8879. The
index is now down 495 points, or 5.3 percent, from its Nov. 23 high
of 9374.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that US investors were reacting to developments in
Brazil rather than in Europe. Brazilian lawmakers rejected a tax
bill designed to help shrink the country's deficit, casting doubt
on whether the country will meet the requirements for gaining
international aid to prevent a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The European action gave investors an early look at how the
world will change with the arrival of the euro _ the new European
currency _ which debuts on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 nations that cut rates are the same ones that are
adopting the euro. In moving to a single currency, central banks in
each nation will transfer the authority to set interest rates to a
European Central Bank. Coordinated interest rate cuts, which are
now uncommon, will be the rule in the future, and the European
Central Bank could challenge the US Federal Reserve as the leading
player in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly going to be two strong central banks, and
there's a lot of speculation about whether the Fed or the central
bank of Europe will be the stronger of the two,'' said John
Burgess, chief investment officer for bonds at Bankers Trust Global
Investment Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cut Thursday was a surprise, though many analysts had
expected the European banks to cut interest rates later in December
or shortly after the euro begins trading in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 11 European nations cut their key short-term interest
rate to 3 percent. The holdout was Italy, which cut its rate to 3.5
percent from 4 percent. Analysts said Italy was expected to bring
its rates in line with the other euro nations in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rates before the cuts had varied throughout the region, from
3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 countries adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a uniform interest rate is a necessary step to launching
the euro. In addition, banks have been under politcal pressure to
cut rates so that Europe's high unemployment rates do not rise
further. But some central banks, particularly Germany's Bundesbank,
had argued that economic conditions were not yet right to make the
move.
</P>
<P>
   The European banks cut an interest rate that is analogous to the
US Federal Reserve's federal funds rate, the rate that US banks
charge each other for overnight loans. Lenders usually raise or
lower other interest rates in tandem with the federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian flu has gotten to Europe as well, and the banks
needed to do this to escape recession,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief
strategist at Westfalia Investments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision
Economics in Boston, predicted further interest rate cuts in Europe
and the United States because of a ``risky'' economic picture. ``I
think this is a general shift by central banks to lower rates
designed to promote growth, a major change from the religion of
fighting inflation that has characterized them for the past seven
or eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinai said US stocks were falling because they had become
overvalued. Using price-to-earnings ratios he described as
``agressive,'' he calculated that the Dow Jones industrial average
was fairly valued in the range of 7800 to 9200. The midpoint of
that range is 8500, which is still below Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our notion: that we're in a correction of the equity
market,'' Sinai said. ``It won't be 20 percent, but it could be
sizeable, five to ten percent. It simply got too rich.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the rate
cut reflected the worsening outlook for European economies. ``The
coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current
pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,'' he
said.

<P>
   CASERTA, Italy _ When a fire broke out recently in an attic of
the Royal Palace here, the flames were quickly detected and
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   But that accident reignited a simmering controversy over the way
the palace is being used that is far more difficult to stamp out.
</P>
<P>
   The Reggia di Caserta, begun in the mid-18th century for Charles
III, the Bourbon king of Naples, to rival Versailles, is one of the
most imposing palaces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dined under its gold ceilings during the Group
of Seven summit meeting held in Naples in 1994. Film director
George Lucas chose its late Baroque marble staircase for a scene in
his coming ``Stars Wars'' movie, ``Episode One: The Phantom
Menace.'' The palace has 1,200 rooms (Versailles has 700) and is
surrounded by a 250-acre park that includes a 256-foot cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Versailles, however, the palace in Caserta is not solely
a museum. Only 44 rooms are open to the public. Eight hundred rooms
are now under military occupation _ specifically, the Italian air
force's training school for noncommissioned officers.
</P>
<P>
   The museum director, the Culture Ministry and art lovers want
the military out. But the general in command at Caserta and his men
would prefer to stay, and they argue that they have no other place
to go. Local officials are caught in the middle: They want the
military to leave the palace, but they also want them to stay in
Caserta, where they provide 300 jobs and spend about $9 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional, many-sided battle being fought in Caserta,
moreover, is decades old, and far from unique. It took nearly 50
years, but the Culture Ministry finally secured an agreement with
the Defense and Finance ministries in 1997 to move an officers'
club out of the Palazzo Barberini, one of Italy's national
galleries, in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Retired officers are still having genteel lunch here under their
17th-century dining room's ceiling fresco, but the museum is
renovating a smaller 1930s villa in the back of the property in the
expectation that the officers will move someday.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, a country overflowing with art treasures and
historical monuments, countless buildings have cultural
significance. The Italian military owns or occupies some of the
finest properties, including a 14th-century convent in Perugia now
used by the army as a foreign language school. But police
academies, tax inspectors and dentists also work out of historic
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The incident at Caserta, which occurred shortly after the new
culture minister, Giovanna Melandri, was appointed, lighted a fire
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Melandri, 36, vowed to expel the military from Caserta and
from dozens of other cultural sites. She said the air force had
agreed to find a new location by Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patrimony is so rich and enormous, it would be impossible
to turn it all into museums,'' Mrs. Melandri said in an interview
in her office. ``But we have to look at improper use of historical
buildings. In Caserta, we need to find a use for the available
space that is more compatible with a museum. A military school is
incompatible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Caserta, from opposite wings of a palace spread over four
courtyards, the soldiers and the museum workers seem as compatible
as hostile neighbors in a crowded Neapolitan high rise. Vincenzo
Zuccaro, a museum public relations official, indignantly pointed
out an 18th-century vault fresco by Mariano Rossi that had to be
restored because of water damage Zuccaro said was caused by cadets'
showers above.
</P>
<P>
   The museum director, Livio Ricciardi, complained about cooking
smells from the school kitchens. But he confessed that he had no
plans or proposals on how to use the additional rooms if and when
the school moves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they'll leave soon, but when they do, we'll be at a
loss,'' he said. ``For one thing, I don't know what rooms they have
and what they look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why not, he replied, ``I've never been invited.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the school, which was established here in 1948,
said that as a soldier, he would obey orders to retreat from the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caserta is in our hearts,'' the commander, Gen. Alessio
Santicchi, said. ``Of course we would be unhappy to leave but that
is a sentimental discourse. On a practical level, if they told us,
leave so we can do this this and this, I would understand. But to
be told just to go away, that I do not understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other officers there, General Santicchi argued that the
school spends $800,000 a year to maintain its part of the building,
and is a useful tenant. He argued that the fire was detected, and
put out, only because his men were living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that if we leave, nothing will take our place,''
he said. ``It's like seeing a home turn into an abandoned house.''
</P>
<P>
   But his case is complicated by the fact that 10 years ago, the
air force decided that the palace was getting too small for the
school, and began building a $125 million complex eight miles away
in Capua, with most of the money coming from the European Economic
Community.
</P>
<P>
   It took 10 years to build, and by the time it was close to
completion, cuts in the military budget had whittled down
enrollment at the school from 2,000, to 900 today. Now, the air
force argues, Capua is too large for the school, and would be too
costly to run.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Melandri said it was the military's problem to find a new
site by Feb. 2. Santicchi noted that even if the air force chose
Capua, that site was not ready for habitation. ``They haven't built
the barracks, and that could take another year or two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caserta Mayor Luigi Falco, who said he wants to convert other
unused military buildings in town for the school, laughed merrily
at Mrs. Melandri's February deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is not a realistic deadline. It's an
Italian deadline.''

MARKET PLACE: TIME FOR A PAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late autumn rally has erased much of the stock market's
summer declines. But stock investors may have little to cheer about
for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the market reaction Thursday to a surprise cut in
short-term interest rates across Europe _ a resoundingly positive
development that should stimulate the economies of some of
America's biggest trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than extending the glee evinced by European markets,
Americans shrugged it off. They turned their attention south to
Brazil, where the government's failure to gain approval for a
fiscal austerity measure sent Brazilian stocks plunging nearly 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of yet another emerging market crisis fueled a 2
percent decline in major American stock indexes and nudged some
investors back to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. The yield
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell back to near 5 percent
for the first time in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about Brazil and several other factors could keep
stock prices under pressure for the next few weeks, financial
analysts say. After regaining nearly all of the ground they lost in
July and August, and coming within spitting distance of new highs,
the major stock-market indexes are due for a pause. Add nervousness
about the recovery of emerging markets, concern over fourth-quarter
profits and the inevitable round of year-end tax-related selling,
and many investors might opt to preserve their gains for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the same financial advisers say they are optimistic that,
barring a Brazilian disaster, investors will start the new year
confident that the stock market continues to hold the greatest
potential for long-term financial gains, sending a fresh wave of
money into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we'll continue to get some of these periodic
scares, I think we're building a very positive case for financial
assets,'' said Robert Bissell, president of Wells Capital
Management, a unit of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Given the gyrations in stock prices during the second half of
this year, a few weeks of sideways movement might not be a bad
thing. And in the longer term, many investment professionals remain
upbeat on the outlook for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the longer term, the European rate cut is a very positive
signal to the marketplace,'' said John Kim, chief investment
officer at Aeltus Investment Management, Aetna Inc.'s
money-management division. ``But questions continue to linger on
about what happens in the emerging economies. There, I think the
road will be pretty bumpy, at least in the near term.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the economy has continued to exhibit slow
and steady growth. That gives Kim and others confidence that
American companies will report reasonably strong growth in
corporate profits for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we're not going to see the bottom fall out of
earnings in the fourth quarter,'' as many had feared when they
pondered the effect of the Asian slowdown, said George Cohen, a
principal at Cohen Klingenstein &AMP; Marks, a New York money
management firm. ``I think earnings will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, companies whose businesses are closely linked to
Asia, like Boeing Co., could continue to experience problems.
Others, like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., are apparently suffering from
problems specific to their businesses, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But companies like Cisco Systems, which we own, have so much
demand that they can't deliver products fast enough to meet
demand,'' Cohen said. ``Companies like that are not affected by the
problems in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology
stocks, has risen twice as much as the Dow Jones industrial average
since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq index finished Thursday
at about 1,954, up 24.5 percent since Jan. 1. That compares with a
12.3 percent gain for the Dow industrials, which ended Thursday at
8,879.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq 100 index, of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks, has
gained 59 percent this year. Among the top 15 stocks in the index,
which account for 75 percent of its capitalization, only one _
Amgen Inc., the biotechnology company _ operates outside the
electronic technology or telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, like Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One
Investment Advisors, are more cautious about the outlook for
corporate profits. The events in Brazil, he said, are a setback.
And even though Thursday's interest rate cuts by European central
bankers are ``great news for investors around the world,'' he said,
it will not be until late 1999 or 2000 that the effect of those
cuts will work its way through to corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit too early to bring out the trumpets,'' Chan said.
``But I think these moves today will have a positive impact on
corporate profits.''

KEEPING WALGREENS ON MAIN ST.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)

 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Ill. _ When L. Daniel Jorndt, the chief executive of
the Walgreen Co., wanted to know how big the parking lot was at a
rival Wal-Mart store, he had a look for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The store is 440 yards away, a quarter of a mile'' from where
he parked his car, he exclaimed in a recent interview at the
Walgreen headquarters in this Chicago suburb. ``I've paced it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt, who is 57, is far from intimidated by the vastness of
Wal-Mart stores and their parking lots. On the contrary, he aims to
turn their size to his advantage by emphasizing the convenience of
ducking into the corner Walgreens for small purchases. Indeed,
convenience is why his company is pushing to install drive-through
pharmacies at its 2,600 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But as his inspection of the Wal-Mart lot shows, he believes
that attention to detail is the key to making that strategy work.
Never mind that Walgreen is the nation's largest drugstore chain,
with more than 90,000 employees and $15 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Name any major city, and Jorndt can tell you exactly where the
Walgreens are found, or not found, and why. One possible location
in Rye, N.Y., didn't make the cut because of concerns over a nearby
traffic signal. ``That light was just too slow,'' he said. ``By the
time it turned, people would have decided to go elsewhere.'' (The
light stayed red for 90 seconds; he wanted 30.)
</P>
<P>
   A pharmacist who rose through the ranks at the company, Jorndt
does not favor blurry vision or blurry language. He is crisp, clear
and direct. Occasionally, he pounds his fist on the desk to
emphasize a point. He says things like: ``The groceries can't fight
Wal-Mart,'' ``We want to be on the right side of the street'' and
``The strip center is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He is dead serious about that last point; his company is pulling
out of such malls, creating free-standing stores that are part
drugstore, part food mart. The new format will let it better
compete with CVS and Rite Aid drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt's office reflects his penchant for precision. His desk
looks as though it is polished hourly. Gracing the bookshelves are
photographs of his wife, Patricia, and their three children _ as
well as one of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Lean and tall, Jorndt easily turns on the charm, yet makes no
secret of his aversion to the news media. He refused to be
interviewed for a profile in The Chicago Tribune in January, so the
paper relied on recollections of acquaintances, like the
high-school quarterback who described him as a trusted blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt limited the interview for this article to 15 minutes and,
with two minutes to go, commanded: ``You've got one more
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt, the first chief executive appointed from outside the
Walgreen family, wants to more than double the chain's number of
stores, to about 6,000, by 2010. Success will be in the details.
``Our average store pushes $600 per square foot,'' Jorndt said,
referring to yearly sales. ``That's almost double the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff is equally precise. A real estate team of numbers
crunchers measures traffic patterns and population movements, as
well as age and income levels. ``America's aging,'' Jorndt said.
``And as you age, you buy more prescriptions. ``Bill Clinton's
group is hitting middle age, and this will drive prescription use
for the next 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt has charts that illustrate that aging population and
track its flight to warmer climates. So where is the company
expanding? California. Texas. Florida. Arizona. Georgia. ``This is
just the leading edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walgreen is certainly on a tear: The stock price has tripled the
last three years; earnings are up and revenues are booming, with
sales at stores open at least a year 11 percent higher than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jorndt and his researchers have also identified ``trade areas''
_ locales for Walgreens with the right demographics and the right
traffic patterns. Jorndt wants busy intersections that are
convenient for 15,000-square-foot rectangular stores, fitted with
easy-to-navigate drive-through windows for prescription pickups. He
calls such spots the ``corner of Main and Main.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on such a corner on the South Side of Chicago that the
first Walgreens was erected in 1901, selling drugs, surgical
dressings, potions, lotions and the like. And it was on such a
corner that Jorndt got his start as a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   L. Daniel Jorndt (a colleague says he won't reveal what the
``L'' stands for) grew up in Chicago, one of three sons born to a
teacher and a nurse. He went to Drake University in Des Moines,
where he earned a degree in pharmacy. He filled prescriptions for
Walgreens before being promoted to district manager, went on to
earn his MBA at the University of New Mexico and was named the
company's president in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His task now is to steer Walgreen's course through an industry
where margins are being squeezed by managed health care. Americans
have more prescriptions than ever, but drugstores are keeping less
and less in profits. ``The pharmacy isn't what it used to be,''
Jorndt said. ``Six pharmacies close every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't expand through acquisitions, he said, but will continue
to invest heavily in technology that keeps inventories low and
automates operations. The goal is to lure prescription customers
into buying more profitable nondrug products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a pack of razor blades or a stick of deodorant,
the last place you want to go is a 150,000-square-foot mass
merchant or the Mall of America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when it can, Walgreen will park a drugstore at the
corner of Main and Main, or even at the intersection of an
interstate and state highway, close to Wal-Mart's daunting parking
lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live off the crumbs on their table,'' Jorndt said with
a smile. ``They won't even feel us. We'll be like a gnat on the
rear end of an elephant.''

CLINTON MAKES WATER-IMPROVEMENT LOANS AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ President Clinton Thursday shifted his focus
from battles in Washington to the safety of the nation's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the water our children drink, Americans
cannot be too vigiliant,'' Clinton said in announcing nearly $800
million in new, low-interest loans to help states &UR;  &LR; upgrade their
water systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of thing that we ought to be doing in America
_ tending to America's business, reaching across party lines,
looking into the future, thinking about our children. I think it is
a very important day,'' said Clinton, who shared the stage with
Republican US Senator John Chafee and several of the state's
leading Democratic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here to announce the release of $775 million in
low-interest loans to 50 states and US territories to help
communities upgrade their water systems. Massachusetts will get the
fourth largest loan, $28.7 million, which is less than only
California, Texas and New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Massachusetts will get more than $1 million in
grants from an additional $93.8 million the Environmental
Protection Agency is providing to states to help them monitor
drinking water quality, enforce standards, and provide technical
assistance to local communities.
</P>
<P>
   The new, tougher standards for drinking water, and the money
that goes with them, are an outgrowth of amendments passed in 1996
to the Safe Drinking Water Act. The new regulations are aimed at
protecting the nation's water supply against cryptosporidium, a
microscopic parasite, as well as other disease-causing microbes and
potentially harmful byproducts of the water treatment process.
</P>
<P>
   A cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993 sickened 400,000
people, hospitalized more than 4,000 and caused more than 50 deaths
among people with weakened immune systems. Clinton said the new
standards are intended to ``ensure that no community ever has to
endure an outbreak like the one the people of Milwaukee suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Disinfectants used to treat such contaminants can combine with
natural organic material in water to create byproducts, some of
which cause cancer or birth defects in laboratory animals. The new
standards will require improved treatment practices in water
systems serving 140 million people nationwide, reducing exposure to
these byproducts by 25 percent, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed to bask in the friendly reception he found
in this seacoast city.
</P>
<P>
   After touring a water treatment plant, he stopped his motorcade,
got out and shook hands with some of the hundreds of people who
lined the streets. And after a speech in Fort Adams State Park, he
lingered long after the program had ended to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   However, along his motorcade route, there were signs of the
problems that awaited his return. Scattered protesters hoisted
placards that read, ``Bill Clinton, Role Model for American
Youth?'' and ``B.Clinton, A Stain on American History.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Clinton was in the company of friends. US
Representative Patrick Kennedy, a Democrat from Rhode Island,
introduced himself to the crowd as a ``staunch supporter'' of
Clinton. And in a comment filled with echoes of the White House
strategy in the current impeachment environment, Kennedy said:
``Mr. President, you've never backed down from a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to New England came as his administration is
suing the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the MWRA's
refusal to install a $180 million filtration system in its new $261
million treatment plant to be built in Marlborough. MWRA officials
dispute assertions federal law requires the filtration plant.
</P>
<P>
   The New England regional administrator for the Environmental
Protection Agency, John P. DeVillars, said, ``It's a sad irony that
on the day the president comes to New England to raise the
standards for America, the capital city of New England is almost
alone in the nation in failing to meet existing standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Governor Paul Cellucci, whose administration plans to adopt
the rules Clinton announced as soon as possible, said DeVillars's
office ``is way off-base here. They want us to spend a lot of money
that will cause our ratepayers to pay more, and it's unnecessary.''

<P>
   A management course with Shakespeare as the main text? Must be a
gimmick _ a way to pry MBA students away from stuffy case studies
for a few heady whiffs of great literature.
</P>
<P>
   But sit through Professor John O. Whitney's new class at the
Columbia Business School and you are likely to have other
reactions. Like ``How could anyone teach issues like ethics and
leadership without using Shakespeare?'' Or perhaps just ``Zounds!''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent class of perhaps 50 students, Whitney was in his
element.
</P>
<P>
   The day's reading was ``Coriolanus,'' the tale of a Roman
warrior too arrogant to rule, too warlike to be ruled (except by
his war-loving mother, Volumnia) and ultimately crushed in this
self-created vise. Whitney kept squeezing the play for lessons _
with ethics as the constant drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would Coriolanus relate to that?'' he asked, his eyes
darting about for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``Let's ask the men _ how would you like to have Volumnia as
a mother?'' A slide was projected on a screen, asking, in bold
letters, ``Did your mother ever want you to be a doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to become mired in Elizabethan times, he kept yanking
the class back to the present day, trying to give the students
something that they could use in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how this might relate to the rest of your life,'' he
urged. Or: ``When you all become CEOs, think about this
conversation.'' Or, in his course description: ``Any serious
Shakespeare scholar would have shorted Sunbeam stock'' during the
reign of Albert J. Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   The silver-haired Whitney, tanned and wearing a crisp blue
blazer, looked every inch the patrician scholar, but the twinkle in
his eye gave him away: He was having a ball.
</P>
<P>
   The topic turned to leadership, whether in business or
elsewhere, and up popped a slide asking, ``Should warriors go into
politics?''
</P>
<P>
   One student, Maureen Murphy, found a modern parallel in retired
Gen. Colin L. Powell, who, perhaps heeding the lesson of
Coriolanus, has so far decided that they should not.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Jonathan Costello, called Coriolanus ``very
Pattonesque.'' Whitney, who is 70, shot back, ``Does anyone
remember Patton?''
</P>
<P>
   There were murmurs about the movie, and he said with a laugh,
``I didn't see the movie, but I saw the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, there is a grisly scene that involves counting
Coriolanus' battle scars. ``How many wounds?'' Whitney asked, then
answered himself triumphantly, ``27!''
</P>
<P>
   And the modern parallels tumbled out. Costello suggested that at
one company where he had worked, ``your wounds were how many
projects you'd worked on.'' Whitney chimed in that at some
high-stress companies, ``your wounds were how many divorces you
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, after getting a discussion going, Whitney pulled back.
``You don't need me _ mix it up,'' he said, and then just listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them walking out of here thinking,'' he said after
class.
</P>
<P>
   The course, a second-year elective, has clearly made a big
impression on some of the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most influential class in my two years at
Columbia,'' said Rehana Farrell. ``You don't ever walk out
thinking, `What am I going to do with this information?' You walk
out going, `Yeah!' It's like a light bulb every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, Jason Kritzer is now convinced, ``wrote
contemporary issues 400 years ago.'' Referring to the heads of
Citigroup, he said, ``It's like King Lear _ I wouldn't be surprised
if Sandy Weill and John Reed were facing the same issues'' _ touchy
issues of sharing power.
</P>
<P>
   As for the course, ``a literature professor could never bring it
off,'' Kritzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney is anything but a literature professor _ or, more
accurately, he's a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to teaching here and at Harvard University, he has
written a number of books and articles _ but he has spent much of
his life in business. He founded several companies, turned several
others around and ran the Pathmark grocery chain in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The class over, he ate dinner with a half-dozen students in a
faculty dining room perched above Morningside Heights _ a ritual.
``I've wanted to teach this course for 50 years,'' he said _ ever
since falling in love with Shakespeare in college.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that Shakespeare ``has always been a guide to me,''
especially in those corporate turnarounds, and is an invaluable
resource on his sacred trio of issues: ``leading, managing,
following.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabethans were preoccupied with governance _ that's what
they talked about in the coffee houses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Pathmark, he used to pop in on stores at all
hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 one morning, he recalled, a produce manager told him,
``You're the first suit I've seen in four years.'' A parallel? Of
course. ``That's Henry V, visiting the troops. You must keep
contact with employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to retire,'' said Whitney, who now commutes weekly
from Florida, ``but I made a deal, that I could teach anything I
wanted to teach. Now I do nothing but think about Shakespeare _ my
wife is sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not, though. He will teach the course again next summer,
and is even working on a book with the same title as the class,
``In Search of the Perfect Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   What play holds the most lessons?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hard one,'' he said, pausing before saying firmly,
``Lear.'' King Lear, he said, ``made the transition to being an
imperial CEO _ he was a victim of flattery, terribly flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   And lessons certainly remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't understand Shakespeare,'' he said as the evening
wound down.

   IRVING, Texas _ Deion Sanders walked without a limp yesterday
and said ``not to count me out'' for the Cowboys' game Sunday
against the New Orleans Saints. To prepare for the possibility of
playing for the first time since Nov. 22 against Seattle, Sanders
plans to jog today to test his sprained left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, continued to conduct business as if
Sanders would not be able to return punts, if he should play. They
signed former Pro Bowl punt returner Tyrone Hughes yesterday,
watched him flawlessly catch kicks, then immediately tabbed him as
their punt returner for Sunday in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very comfortable with him back there,'' said special
teams coach Joe Avezzano, whose employers also made phone calls to
Mel Gray and Kelvin Martin about the club's punt-return duties.
``Our No. 1 priority is not to lose the game by making bad plays
bobbling the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who made the Pro Bowl as a punt returner in 1993, will
earn roughly $19,000 a game. Several factors will determine how
many games he plays, including his own ability and how comfortable
Sanders feels when he is healthy again. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said Hughes might also return kickoffs, depending on how he works
out at the position today.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes will make his Cowboys debut against the team he had much
of his success with. While with the Saints from 1991-1996, Hughes
led the league in punt-return yards in 1993, and in kickoff return
yards from 1994-96. He holds the league record for most kickoff
return yards in a season (1,791) and most kickoff return yards in a
game (304).
</P>
<P>
   Because he has been strictly a returner, Hughes, 28, has found
it hard to stay on NFL rosters. A defensive back at Nebraska,
Hughes started just seven games at the position with the Saints,
and none with the Chicago Bears in 1997. The Bears released him
following last season, and the Baltimore Ravens released him in
training camp this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said yesterday that he had spent much of his time this
fall working out in the mornings, playing golf in the afternoons,
and playing with his daughter. He said the Cowboys called him last
night, and he hopped on a plane in time to take a physical and
participate in yesterday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   He fielded about 20 punts before watching the rest of the
practice from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get into the scout-team role, but they slid me
off to the side because they didn't want me to get hurt,'' Hughes
said. ``I wanted to be able to do something, you know, not feel
like I'm stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New Orleans native said it'll be good to return to play
in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to get the tickets lined up again,'' he
said. ``I don't know how long they'll keep me. But I'm happy to be
here. With the \Rexpansion\S Cleveland thing coming up next year, I
just want to make a good impression.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith tried his luck fielding punts yesterday. The fun
didn't last long. After Smith fell awkwardly on his shoulder
following one kick, an uneasy-looking Chan Gailey whisked his star
running back off the field. Smith, by the way, would break a tie
with Marcus Allen for career rushing touchdowns with his next
score. Both have 123.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Hughes on the roster, the Cowboys waived
free-agent rookie linebacker Myron Smith, who has not played this
year.

 &HT;    FEC MAJORITY SAYS TO LET CLINTON AND DOLE OFF THE HOOK
 &HT;    420&AMP;add
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- President Clinton and former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole shouldn't have to repay millions of taxpayer
dollars to the U.S. treasury, most members of the Federal Election
Commission agreed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC staff had concluded that the Democratic president and
his Republican challenger each broke the legal spending limit in
his 1996 presidential bid by arranging for his political party to
pay for TV ads that helped him. The career lawyers and accountants
recommended that Clinton be forced to repay $7 million and Dole to
repay $17.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the FEC regulations that Clinton and Dole were accused of
breaking are too ambiguous, said four of the six political
appointees who run the commission.
</P>
<P>
   One was Democrat Danny McDonald. Three others -- Republicans
David Mason and Lee Ann Elliott and Democrat Karl Sandstrom -- went
further and said the rules are so badly written that they should
not be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   During the commission's five hours of deliberation Thursday,
Mason described the rules as ``vague,'' and Sandstrom said the
standard was ``fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal votes on pending motions to dismiss virtually all of the
findings will be conducted Wednesday or Thursday. It would take
only three members to block any repayment order.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, that would mean that spending
limits are dead,'' lamented Don Simon, general counsel to Common
Cause, a national anti-corruption group that endorsed the staff
report. ``The commissioners were appointed because it was thought
they would defend the interests of their own party, and on this
matter, they can join together and defend both.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the personal debts that such orders would load
on the shoulders of Clinton and Dole might have swayed the
commissioners against strict enforcement, said Trevor Potter, a
former chairman of the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``''The amounts were unprecedentedly large,'' Potter said.
``When the stakes are high, commissioners want to be on very firm
grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In other probes of the 1996 campaigns:
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans announced they won't include campaign-finance
charges in their ongoing impeachment probe of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce by Dec. 7
whether a preliminary probe she conducted as a result of the FEC
staff report has convinced her to ask for an independent counsel to
conduct a criminal probe of Clinton and the Democrats. Dole isn't
covered by the independent counsel laws.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   If the commission eliminates every charge of excess advertising
and polling, the repayment demands would drop to about $70,000 for
Clinton and $1.2 million for Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Then the commission will discuss whether to eliminate or trim
those remaining repayment orders, Thomas said. After that, it will
decide whether to approve a separate recommendation by its staff
that Dole refund to news media and the Secret Service more than $1
million in overcharges for traveling with Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may decide to slice the apple several ways before we are
done,'' Thomas said. If any of the staff's recommendations survive,
the campaigns can appeal to the commission itself and then to the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Utrecht, a Washington attorney representing the Clinton
campaign, said, ``I think, ultimately, the commissioners will deal
with this in new regulations for the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of adopting new regulations will begin later this
month, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, a former assistant to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., dominated Thursday's debate with repeated charges that
various FEC regulations were neither ``convincing nor
comprehensible'' or may include ``a constitutionally impermissible
standard for us to use at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff relied on ``vague standards'' and asked the commission
to apply ``a fuzzy standard,'' said Sandstrom, a new Democratic
member.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that some FEC rules are ``hardly clear,'' Thomas
told them the reason is that in the mid-1980s, he and the other two
Democrats who wanted rules with more clarity found out they
couldn't get the necessary fourth vote from any of the three
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming Thomas' explanation, Elliott described herself as one
of the Republican opponents who would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have voted to put them in the regulations,''
Elliott said.

SOME PROMINENT REPUBLICANS HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans push toward a vote to impeach
President Clinton, not only is public sentiment overwhelmingly
against them, but so are many prominent Republicans across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say there is
credible evidence that the president committed perjury and other
impeachable offenses. Moreover, they say they are duty bound to
follow a constitutionally established process and cannot be swayed
by public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who have the constitutional and historical
responsibility are us,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a Utah
Republican on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of House Republicans seem inclined to follow
the panel's lead. Most come from safe districts _ only 10 House
Republicans won their races in November with 52 percent or less _
and consequently few face repercussions from constituents by voting
for impeachment. Indeed, many Republicans face pressure to satisfy
their conservative base or what lawmakers call the subtle urgings
of a top House Republican leader, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republican governors, mayors and state
party officials are expressing reservations about the
Republican-led inquiry or outright opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut, a former three-term Republican
congressman, said in an interview on Thursday: ``Did Clinton do
something wrong and lie? Yes. But does impeaching the president
serve any public good? The answer is absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for Congress to get past this issue,'' said
Rowland, who added that the House should censure Clinton. ``They
should focus on the Asian financial crisis, Social Security,
improving the quality of life, and on being civil again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, who believes the
accusations against Clinton do not amount to impeachable offenses,
said last month: ``The rush to impeachment by Republicans has been
very, very harmful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts was equally blunt: ``I don't
think it's helping the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders, like Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a
former state attorney general, expressed doubts about how the
Judiciary Committee has conducted its investigation: ``I've been
somewhat concerned that the process is less judicial than what I
thought it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's zigzagging over the past two weeks _ into
Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices and allegations that the
president groped a White House volunteer in 1993 _ has perplexed
many party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's a new twist, it confuses people about the
mission of the Judiciary Committee,'' said Greg Brock, executive
director of the Michigan Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Republican leaders voice concern that the inquiry and
impending votes in the House not only risk drawing a backlash from
a scandal-weary public, but also may distract the party from
important legislative priorities, from tax cuts to shoring up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get this over with as soon as possible,'' said Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. ``The voters are sick to death of
partisanship. We need to move on and develop a strong offense,
based on a strong policy message.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brent Coles of Boise, Idaho, the ranking Republican in the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in an interview Thursday: ``It does
seem to me that we're talking about it way too much. Whatever the
House's job is, they must do it quickly. Get in, get out, and do it
post-haste.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republican officials who remain neutral on the
congressional proceedings take pains to distance themselves from
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the three-month inquiry into the
matter.

   ``As reprehensible and disgraceful as Bill Clinton's behavior
has been, our concentration has to be on doing what's best for
Texas, and not on that mess going on in D.C.,'' said Robert Black,
a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, said Thursday that
it is possible that the House could vote on impeachment later this
month. Livingston has said any vote would be a vote of conscience
for every member.

</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said Thursday
that the Senate was waiting on the Judiciary Committee, and was not
making preparations to receive any possible articles of impeachment
from the House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever temptation Republican senators may have to intercede,
they have kept that impulse in check. ``My responsibility is not to
come to that judgment that fast,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana,
told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why senior Senate Republicans haven't called for an
end to the proceedings, Lugar said, ``Sure, people want it done.
Toast. Over. But that can't, in a rule-of-law situation, be the
governing principle. We need to proceed deliberately, and not just
wave it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say not
only that they are obliged to pursue the accusations against the
president, but also that the case against Clinton is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that we have a mountain of sworn
testimony that points to the conclusion that the president is
guilty of various offenses, including lying under oath,'' Rep.
Charles Canady, a Florida Republican on the committee, said at a
hearing on Tuesday about the consequences of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are committee members fazed by the notion of removing the
president for his alleged offenses. ``I don't think anybody is
irreplaceable,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican. ``I
think Al Gore would make as fine a president as President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon, in an interview Thursday, said, ``To have a president
who ultimately, constantly and thoughtfully lied to us under oath
on several occasions, you need to deal with that in the most severe
terms, and that is impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Republicans off the committee lean toward impeachment
for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups have targeted moderate Republicans who have
publicly opposed impeachment and supported censure as an
alternative. Human Events, a national conservative weekly,
identified 11 Republicans in a recent issue as the ``pro-perjury
caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the lawmakers singled out, including Billy Tauzin of
Louisiana and John Edward Porter of Illinois, have adopted a much
lower profile since the newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is losing support among many of these moderate
Republicans. ``If they make the case they had substantial and
credible evidence that perjury or obstruction of justice was
committed, I would be inclined to vote for impeachment,'' said Rep.
Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Many undecided Republicans were especially angered by what they
viewed as Clinton's contemptuous replies to 81 questions submitted
by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wordsmithing in response to the questions has raised the
deception to new heights,'' said Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Maryland
Republican. ``Two weeks ago, I was more impressionable. Quite
honestly, now I'm leaning toward voting for an article of
impeachment dealing with perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many Republicans on the fence say they feel the
influence of DeLay, the House Republicans' chief vote-counter.
DeLay strongly opposes even allowing a vote on a censure, and on
Wednesday he mobilized efforts to help Republicans informally gauge
support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay right now is the prime force,'' said Rep. Peter King, a
New York Republican who opposes impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not telling people how to vote,'' said King. But then
DeLay, the third-ranking House Republican, whose nickname is ``The
Hammer,'' doesn't have to, King said. ``He's made it clear he's for
impeachment and he's from the leadership.''

 &HT;    Icicle lights melting away from store shelves
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of this year's hottest Christmas decorating items
_ icicle lights _ are evaporating from store shelves and merchants
in Atlanta and across the country have been caught off guard by
their unexpected popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They completely blew out of here yesterday,'' said Lynn
Edmondson, seasonal manager of the Alpharetta, Ga., Lowe's Home
Improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The icicle lights manufactured by several firms have been on the
market for the last two holiday seasons, but are selling like
wildfire this year, retailers said. The outdoor lights are
comprised of a series of separate short strands of lights that hang
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different look, more of a vertical look,'' Edmondson
said. ``The cascading are nice too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jule Schreffler, a spokesman at Lowe's headquarters in North
Wilkesboro, N.C., said the lights are sold out nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ordered a lot more this year in anticipation of this, but
we're out now,'' Schreffler said. ``We can't get any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael's Arts and Crafts in Kennesaw, Ga., still had some
icicle lights Thursday afternoon but they are selling out fast,
said Andrea Jennings, a Michael's floral designer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sandy Springs Kmart, which also still has some in stock,
the lights are priced from $4 for eight feet and $10 for 16 feet.
Lights that flash in different sequences cost more.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can afford to do different things out here to their
houses,'' said clerk Paula Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   At The Christmas Shoppe in Atlanta, which also has some icicle
lights, owner Edward Touwsma said from a distance the lights really
do look like icicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought three times the amount we normally do,'' Touwsma
said.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER 6
 &HT;    From sweet to shabby, two hotels run gamut
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few blocks from the burgeoning gallery district of
West Chelsea, in Chelsea proper, are two hotels that are about as
similar as Sister Wendy and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the lobby of the historic Chelsea Hotel, and you
know which one is Madonna. The Wendy of the pair is not really even
a hotel, but a nonprofit Catholic guest house.
</P>
<P>
   Known as The Leo House, it was established in 1899 by the St.
Raphael Society and has occupied this eight-story building since
1926. It has its own chapel and a priest on call, and many guests
are clerics. But The Leo House welcomes everybody, and numerous
academics, students and budget-conscious travelers (including art
curators) over the years have been pleased to find a clean, safe
place in New York that is well under $100 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect glamour or frills. The lobby furniture looks like
granny's hand-me-downs, and the rooms meet minimum requirements. A
single bedroom is just that: one twin bed, a desk, chair and
television. (Remotes cost extra.) The bathroom _ be sure to request
one with a shower, unless you want to share _ is just big enough to
turn around in. At $68 a night, who's complaining?
</P>
<P>
   There are unexpected bonuses, however. The garden in the back is
a respite of green from city concrete. The $5, all-you-can-eat
breakfast buffet _ pancakes, French toast, oatmeal, muffins, fruit
_ is enough to fill you up for the better part of the day. And this
guest house exudes a sweetness of spirit unexpected in hard-edged
New York. That is a luxury you probably won't find even in the most
hospitable of the high-end hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For an experience in contrast, check out (or into) the Chelsea
Hotel. Steeped in history of a different kind, this hotel has been
the domain of the creative spirit for a century. The guest list
twinkles with literary and musical lights: Mark Twain, Thomas
Wolfe, Arthur Miller, Virgil Thompson, Bob Dylan. On the dark side,
Sex Pistol Sid Vicious killed his girlfriend in their room, which
has been dismantled. Artists of various persuasions still call the
Chelsea home.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1882 as a cooperative apartment, it was clearly once a
looker. The wrought-iron balconies on the front and the staircase
inside are among the last vestiges of its former glory. Today, the
400-room hotel, still partly residential, exudes a shabby, bohemian
air. It's not just the art of dubious merit crammed into the lobby
and hung in the corridors, but the assortment of people who hang
out here.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its creative clientele, no two rooms are
decorated alike. Author Pete Hamill, who had occupied one suite I
visited, would probably have disapproved of its current chartreuse
and hot pink color scheme. At $150 a night, you sleep here for the
history.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Leo House, 332 W. 23rd St., 1-800-732-2438.
Chelsea Hotel, 222 W. 23rd St., 212-243-3700.

 &HT;    Gritty West Chelsea winning over art set
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aleen and Michael Pierce stood at the corner of 23rd
and 10th Avenue, looking a bit bewildered. As we waited for the
light to change, she asked a fellow tourist plaintively, ``Where
are all the boutiques?''
</P>
<P>
   Seems the Pittsburgh couple had intended to visit SoHo, the art
district that has become boutique heaven, and ended up instead in
West Chelsea, the industrial area that is fast becoming a hot new
art gallery district.
</P>
<P>
   Come back in a year or two, guys. There should be boutiques
aplenty. Signs advertising gallery space for lease are ubiquitous.
Cute little restaurants have sprouted. The sounds of hammers and
drills reverberate from apartment buildings on the edge of the
district that are clearly on their way to becoming co-ops. Can
Dolce &AMP; Gabana be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike SoHo, which took several decades to make the transition
from industrial lofts to chic shopping, West Chelsea is changing at
lightning speed. No sooner did a few major galleries, like Paula
Cooper, a pioneer in SoHo, and Matthew Marks, transform a couple of
garages into elegant white boxes two years ago, than a gold
rush-like migration began.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 80 galleries occupy storefronts and low-rise
buildings in the area running from 14th to 26th streets between
10th Avenue and the Hudson River. They include some of the most
familiar names of the contemporary art gallery scene and some of
the trendiest, all mediums, definitely serious.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is such that Carrie Przybilla, the High Museum of
Art's curator of modern and contemporary art, finds herself
spending more time in Chelsea than SoHo when she visits New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, West Chelsea is still a work in progress, a collage of
unlikely neighbors. It is not as architecturally appealing or
visually stimulating as SoHo _ yet. Call it bleak meets sleek. Auto
repair shops abut gallery storefronts. An abandoned train trestle
looms overhead. This has got to be the only place in town where you
can get your car washed (if you are nuts enough to drive in New
York) and go gallery-hopping while you wait.
</P>
<P>
   You still need to consult a map (in guides usually available at
the galleries) to find all the spread-out venues, though the
occasional limo parked in front and the new glass facades are
reliable signs. But if you fancy yourself the urban pioneer, or are
actually intent on seeing art, you will enjoy tramping up and down
these otherwise unpeopled streets.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery owners actually like West Chelsea's grit. Fed up with
the, well, commercial ambiance of SoHo (as well as the soaring
rents), they figure that visitors are going to be at least a little
serious if they make the effort to make the rounds in a
neighborhood where art is still the sole reason to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't concentrate in SoHo. I like this environment much
better,'' says Caelum Gallery owner Misuzu Takemoto, who took a
spot in the 10-story Wolf Building, formerly a book bindery, in
February.
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder that art has a way of changing places, the odor of
dead sea creatures had replaced any vestige of glue or paper during
my visit. The culprit: a vessel at Caelum constructed of dried fish
and filled with video monitors.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wild Lily Tea Room, a sliver of a space next door to Max
Protetch Gallery, is a sign of kind of commercial adjuncts to come,
then Chelsea will someday be as much a pedestrian pleasure as the
most distinctive New York neighborhoods. Inez Kim and her staff
serve tea and goodies in a long narrow room as serene and elegant
as a Japanese garden. In fact, you can see a quiet pool when you
peer into the window. Ceramic plates are shaped like lily pads, and
you can take tea in artist-made cups and pot, which are for sale as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened in here in September after looking all over town,''
Kim said. ``I chose Chelsea because of the cutting-edge galleries.
If people are interested in art, they'll be interested in food. Tea
is cultural. It has a lot of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic of the tearoom has a kinship with the irregular,
gray, rough-cut rock markers that line 22nd Street. ``7000 Oaks,''
an installation by the late Joseph Beuys, is sponsored by the DIA
Center for the Arts. The grand dame of the neighborhood and a locus
for avant-garde art, DIA set down roots in West Chelsea in 1987,
long before it was anything approaching trendy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a quiet presence, too classy to say, ``I told you so.''

   HARTWELL, Ga. _ You could say Hartwell Mayor Joan Saliba was
first in the neighborhood to have her Christmas tree up this
season. It's been up since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided seven years ago not to take it down,'' Saliba,
70, told us Thursday. ``I have a beautiful artificial tree and
beautiful ornaments, so I just put it in the corner of the living
room. I just don't light it the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to see it when they come by in July. Everyday here
is Jesus' birthday!''
</P>
<P>
   Saliba, mayor for 20 years in the town about 100 miles north of
Atlanta, says builders are catching onto her idea. ``Some new
houses here come complete with a living room closet where you can
store your tree without taking it down,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Yuletide shopping for the grandmother is also a snap. ``I just
give my kids and grandkids my credit card and tell them to go out
and get what they want for themselves and put it under the tree.
It's always a surprise to see what I give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Honor only has two stipulations: ``It has to be
gift-wrapped, and they have to purchase it here in Hartwell. I have
to support that local economy, you know!''
</P>
<P>
   `Full' speed ahead
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two weeks after author Tom Wolfe left town, his
Atlanta-based ``A Man in Full'' continues to burn up sales charts
at local bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot every day,'' Thom Bales said of sales at Border's
Books &AMP; Music, the Atlanta store where Wolfe signed 2,000 copies
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing superb. It's the No. 1 book in our store for the
holidays,'' said Sue Tierney of Barnes &AMP; Noble in Atlanta. ``It's
not only No. 1, it's an extraordinarily strong No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13 Chapter 11 bookstores around metro Atlanta, the novel has
sold 5,076 copies, according to the chain's Elizabeth Wilson.
``It's continuing to do extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans aren't the only readers who've taken to the novel.
It's No. 1 on The New York Times Bestseller List.
</P>
<P>
   Emery on the record
</P>
<P>
   He never had a hit record, but Ralph Emery is as much of a
Nashville legend as the Grand Ole Opry. The former all-night DJ and
Nashville Network talk show host has been on the inside of the
country music industry since the 1950s, collecting
behind-the-scenes tales about Loretta Lynn, Chet Atkins, Vince
Gill, Patsy Cline and a jukebox full of other artists.
</P>
<P>
   He's put his tales together in ``The View From Nashville: On the
Record With Country Music's Greatest Stars'' and is in the Atlanta
area today and Saturday to sign copies.
</P>
<P>
   The chatty memoir shares Emery's feelings about such events as
Faron Young's suicide, the messy battle over Conway Twitty's estate
and the making of the Judds. Catch him from 7 to 8:30 tonight at
Chapter 11 books at Peachtree Battle Shopping Center or noon to 2
p.m. Saturday at Chapter 11 Books in Gainesville, Ga., (Thompson
Bridge store).
</P>
<P>
   Not just another face
</P>
<P>
   ``Mona Lisa'' has nothing on Atlantan Anita Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Thomas' portrait, painted by Alabama artist Nall,
will be unveiled at the Louvre. Nall, who has done portraits of
Ringo Starr and Prince Albert of Monaco, is having the Thomas
painting included in his exhibit at the Paris museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the portrait, I'm wearing a lace antique dress and a large
straw gardener's hat trimmed with roses, lilies and cornflowers,''
said Thomas, the former jewelry designer Anita Mobley. ``And I'm
holding a Bo Peep-style staff. Bo Peep is the name my grandchildren
call me, so Nall titled the portrait after this nursery rhyme
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist, who lives part time in France with his wife, Tuscia,
met Thomas and her husband, Michael, last year on a ski trip to
Aspen, Colo. Michael commissioned Nall to paint his wife's
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen members of the Thomas clan will be on hand for the
Paris unveiling. But Thomas won't be wearing the dress in the
portrait. She will have on a blue Chanel, also a gift from her
husband.

JAPAN'S ECONOMY DOWN 2.6 PERCENT IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government said Thursday that the economy
had shrunk at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter,
signaling deeper troubles ahead for Japan as it struggles through
its worst recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although the figures were a bit worse than expected, they
offered the first indications that government money is helping as
it trickles into the economy. But the effects so far have been
slight, underscoring the challenges that Japan's leaders face in
trying to steer the nation out of recession and help steady the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has staked his reputation on the
promise that he would not let Japan's economic problems deteriorate
so badly as to cause recessions in other countries. But polls show
that consumers _ threatened by shrinking bonuses, falling overtime
pay and rising unemployment _ are gloomy, and the economic figures
show that they are spending less.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on building or renovating homes fell 9.7 percent from
July through September, compared with the 1997 quarter. And
Japanese corporations, increasingly idle, pulled back by cutting
investment in factories and equipment 14.4 percent compared with a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The government has started to carry out a $140 billion economic
package, including programs to pave roads and build bridges. Last
month it announced a second package with nearly $200 billion worth
of tax cuts, loans, investment projects and other economic
stimulants to be introduced next year. But if confidence continues
to erode, even this may be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third-quarter figures really are the 1990s in a
nutshell,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley here. ``The government attempts to offset the collapsing
demand with government spending have not been sufficient to bring
about growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists worry that a continuing cycle of spending sprees
will bury Japan in debt and ruin its future finances just as
pension costs rise and the labor force shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   Budget deficits are rising quickly. Less than two years ago, the
combined deficits of national and local governments represented 3.7
percent of the gross domestic product, and Japan was considered one
of the world's most fiscally prudent countries. But by the end of
the current fiscal year on March 31, 1999, the combined deficits
are projected to reach 9.8 percent of output.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, for the first time, the accumulated national debt
will exceed the size of the economy. The main reasons are the two
economic stimulus packages and a vast debt burden the government
took over from Japan National Railways. The accumulated debt is
expected to rise to 111 percent of the gross domestic product by
the end of March, according to figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt situation is getting really really scary,'' said
Brian Rose, an economist with Warburg Dillon Read here. ``We may
not get out of this. The economy has been bad for eight years, and
we may be waiting another eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges for the government will be raising
money in a smooth manner, without unnerving the financial markets.
To pay for the new spending package, it must increase the amount of
debt it issues every month.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would appear to be a perfect time to raise funds,
with interest rates a sliver above zero, investors are nervous
about seeing Japan flood the credit market with new bonds. Indeed,
with returns so low and risk increasing, investors are shying away
from government bonds. That means that yields on the new bonds may
have to be increased to encourage buyers. But higher yields mean
higher interest rates, which the government wants to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead may be more worrying. In 2000, Japan faces an
enormous redemption of 10-year bonds, an amount that could exceed
100 trillion yen, or $833 billion. This year, its redemptions are
expected to run not much more than $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a disaster,'' said Akihiko Yokoyama, a
fixed-income analyst with J.P. Morgan here.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that many economists do not expect
an economic recovery soon, even though in a report issued
Wednesday, the World Bank forecasts that Japan will achieve 1.4
percent growth in 2000.
</P>

<P>
   According to an economic assessment issued Thursday by the Japan
Center for Economic Research, the two most important influences on
the economy are bad debts held by banks and the excess capacity and
idle machinery in factories.
</P>
<P>
   As companies try to increase efficiency, they are more likely to
cut expenditures and dismiss workers. And as banks try to dispose
of bad debts, they are likely to be increasingly reluctant to lend,
which makes it hard for relatively healthy companies to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The Japan Center, a private research institute, said that the
government's stimulus packages might increase growth slightly next
year, but that the economy would probably shrink again in the
following two years, as the deficit grows and public spending ebbs.
Sustained economic revival will probably not come until the year
2002, the report said.

REPORT CRITICIZES AMA FOR SUPPORTING ANTI-ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators hired by the American Medical
Association say that the organization ignored its own
decision-making procedures, got swept up in politics and failed to
protect the welfare of patients when it endorsed a Republican bill
banning a specific abortion procedure last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report, the investigators said that AMA trustees
had abandoned the group's longstanding positions on abortion and
rushed to embrace the bill even though it did not meet the criteria
previously set by the association for such an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The report, part of a larger investigation of the board of
trustees, concludes that ``the AMA blundered'' in its handling of
the bill to outlaw the procedure that opponents call ``partial
birth abortion.'' The trustees had been seeking concessions from
Congress to make the bill more acceptable to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said the association ``set itself up for
accusations of playing politics'' because it announced its support
for the abortion bill on the same day it asked Congress to shield
doctors from deep cuts in Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than focusing on its role as steward for the profession
and the public health,'' the report said, ``the board got enmeshed
in operational issues of lobbying and lost sight of its
responsibility for making decisions which, first and foremost,
benefit the patient and protect the physician-patient
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a ``management audit'' by Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the
consulting company, is based on scores of confidential documents
and interviews with people at all levels of the association. The
report will be discussed next week in Honolulu at a meeting of the
AMA House of delegates, the 486-member policy-making body for the
association. At that time, some doctors will press the association
to rescind its endorsement of the abortion bill, which passed
Congress but was vetoed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators expressed no views for or against abortion.
But they cited the association's handling of the abortion bill as
an example of serious flaws in its decision-making process. The
report suggests that leaders of the association were manipulated by
Republican members of Congress, and that the trustees were
inexperienced and unable to deal with the intense political
pressures surrounding their negotiations with Congress over the
abortion bill in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the AMA became determined to cut a deal with the
Congressmen,'' the report said, ``the decision-making process began
to reel out of the control of the AMA and into the control of the
Congressmen on the other side of the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trustees negotiated directly with congressional
sponsors of the legislation, they failed to consult adequately with
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other
groups of medical specialists, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the association said they agreed with the
auditors' findings. In the culture of the AMA, ``political
considerations often take precedence over the profession's needs,''
said a panel of doctors who studied the structure and governance of
the organization, at the behest of the House of Delegates. The
investigators from Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton worked under the direct
supervision of the doctors' panel.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary self-examination was prompted by a fiasco in
which the AMA last year agreed to endorse health care products of
the Sunbeam Corp. in return for millions of dollars in royalty
payments. Stung by charges of commercialism and conflict of
interest, the doctors' group canceled the deal, and its chief
executive resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the abortion bill repeatedly cite the AMA's
endorsement as a reason for Congress and state legislatures to
impose such restrictions, and many states have done so. The federal
version was twice vetoed by President Clinton, in April 1996 and
October 1997, but it is sure to come up again next year in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make it a crime for a doctor to perform a partial
birth abortion, defined as a procedure in which a doctor
``partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the
fetus and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at a specific
late-term abortion procedure. But judges have struck down similar
language in state laws, saying it is so broad that it has the
effect of banning abortion techniques widely used in earlier stages
of pregnancy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In July, for example, Judge Richard Kopf of the Federal District
Court for Nebraska ruled that the state's ban on partial birth
abortion was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give
``fair warning'' to doctors and patients about what conduct was
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``One simply cannot ascertain from the legislative history
precisely what the Legislature wanted to ban,'' Kopf said. ``We
know the legislators wanted to ban `partial birth' abortions, but
that term is unknown in medical circles.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, an abortion rights group, said courts had blocked or
limited partial birth abortion laws in 18 states. At least six of
the laws were modeled on the federal bill endorsed by the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The audit report also makes these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Through the timing of its action on the abortion bill, ``the
AMA painted a picture of itself as primarily concerned about
protecting the financial interests of physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The trustees had ``a general sense, based on national polls,
that the American public was opposed to the partial birth abortion
procedure,'' but the AMA did not survey its members to ascertain
what would be in the best interest of patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decision to support a ban on partial birth abortion
``contradicted longstanding AMA policy'' and deviated from
positions reaffirmed by the house of delegates just five months
earlier, in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ The association ``appeared to get swept up by the high-profile
nature of the issue'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The AMA had well-established procedures to set policy in a
``thoughtful, deliberative and democratic way,'' but disregarded
them. Instead, it used a ``crisis mode of policy-setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The trustees decided that they had to take a position on the
abortion bill in May 1997, rather than wait for the house of
delegates to consider the issue at its regularly scheduled meeting
one month later.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the report says, ``many doctors were outraged.''

<P>
   HALF MOON BAY, Calif. _ Any day now, the killer waves will come
raging out of the gurgling surf off Pillar Point. There is nothing
to do but wait for them.
</P>
<P>
   The men waiting _ at this point, they are all men _ belong to a
small, exclusive club of surfers from all over the world, though a
good many live nearby, some having moved from places where there
are no waves as big as four-story buildings or as hard as granite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place like this on earth,'' said Grant Washburn,
after four hours in the rain watching waves whipped by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, a rangy 30-year-old film grip from Connecticut, lives
in San Francisco, 25 miles north of here. But these days, he spends
most of his time at Maverick's, the spot off Pillar Point where the
waves rise to 20, 30, 40 feet or more during the rainy season. For
his four hours of watching the waters Wednesday, he found one clean
wave he could ride. ``A 15-footer. Not that big, but a good one,''
he said, changing from his wet suit in the mud parking lot about a
mile from Pillar Point.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers anticipate Maverick's waves all year not because they
are the biggest anywhere. The North Shore of Oahu and Todos Santos,
off Ensenada, Mexico, claim swells just as big. But the swells here
are different. Shaped by the sea bottom, which rises here from a
depth of more than 100 feet to only a few feet, Maverick's waves
are thicker, surlier and more unpredictable than anywhere else.
They will allow a surfer to ride their backs for a good long
minute, or throw them off in two seconds. One of the best surfers
in the world, Mark Foo, died trying out Maverick's five years ago,
cementing its claim as the hardest place to surf on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Washburn and 19 other Maverick's surfers _ about a
fifth of the world's total _ have a new reason to wait for the
waves. Quicksilver, a clothing company, is sponsoring the first
``Mavericks Men Who Ride Mountains'' contest. The one-day
competition, with a $10,000 first prize for the best performance,
is by invitation only. Contestants started waiting for 24-hour
notice for the contest Nov. 1 and will continue to wait until Jan.
27, the period during which the perfect 20-foot wave is supposed to
rear its enormous head.
</P>
<P>
   Two surfers from Hawaii and two from Australia who are waiting
in Hawaii will fly in at a moment's notice. Most of the rest of the
competitors are already hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waves come in pulses,'' Washburn said. ``Today was one of
the days when you had to know what you're doing. I let 50 waves
pass. Thanksgiving was amazing. I gave up Thanksgiving dinner to be
here. I'd give up most anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a typical Maverick's surfer's attitude. These surfers are
probably more driven and more solitary than their small-wave
counterparts. They rise at the crack of dawn to spend the entire
day wet and cold, with no one to witness their glory. Nothing about
the place they cherish looks remotely inviting. There is really no
beach at Pillar Point, just rocks and cliffs. To get to the waves
requires a 15-minute hike up a slippery slope. Then, it's a
25-minute paddle to Maverick's. The water is 49 degrees, or colder.
</P>
<P>
   The star of Maverick's (which is named for a surfer's dog) is
Jeff Clark, a 41-year-old local who runs a surf shop and carves
custom surfboards. He started riding Maverick's when he was 17. For
15 years, he had the spot to himself. Then, other surfers started
trickling here.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clark is Quicksilver's contest director. He judges
the ocean condition and will decide the day of the show. As such,
he has opted out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got just a little more daylight _ I've got to see what's
out there,'' he said the other day to a caller to his shop. ``When
the waves are there, I have to drop everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has taken some heat for endorsing a contest, a move some
surfers say will spoil Maverick's exclusivity. But the harshness of
the spot naturally weeds out all but the few surfers who have
learned to finesse giant waves. Clark said he hand-picked the
contestants to assure that only veterans of big wave surfing who
know Maverick's could participate. Most are in their 30s; the
oldest is 45.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger worry here is that crowds will flock to watch the
surfers. But it takes a fine day or a hardy soul to do that, too.
The surfers are simply too far offshore to really see _ the contest
will be judged on a boat _ and it is too long a hike to try when it
rains. This afternoon, even Clark was not in the mood. The wind was
whipping the Pacific into a froth, and the sky was a Russian winter
gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really freezing out,'' he said as he plodded in his wet
suit to the cove where the surfers paddle out. ``What we're looking
for for the contest is a sunny, bright day with little wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he saw the 12-foot waves in the distance, he could
not promise he would not be out later, just because it's so much
fun to be out among the giant swells.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES JUST DON'T NEED THE ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just the other day, Joe Torre addressed a charity
luncheon and proclaimed, ``I don't want to work; I just want to
bang on my drum all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, that was a Todd Rundgren lyric. No, what Torre did say
was, ``I don't want to win 126 games. I want to win the World
Series the old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   What is ``the old-fashioned way?'' What was Torre trying to tell
us? Was he sending out a signal that nobody should be too greedy
next year?
</P>
<P>
   Was he flirting with the subversive concept that it might even
be exciting to have more competition, possibly even from the
underclass known as the small-market teams? Officer, arrest that
man for being un-American.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Torre was merely recycling the old theory by his fellow
New Yorker, Billy Loes, who once said he had no desire to win 20
games for the Brooklyn Dodgers because then everybody would expect
him to do it all over again. (Loes never did, so it never became a
problem for him.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yankees have won 125 games in one calendar year, setting
a record, and they have all their significant players coming back.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we talking about the Yankees in December? Is it
because we are compulsive knee-jerk baseball fools? Is it to avoid
dealing with Parcells and basketball lockouts and college gambling
scandals? Well, maybe. But this is also a public service, a
latter-day Paul Revere shouting out a warning: ``The carpetbaggers
are coming! The carpetbaggers are coming!'' It says here the
Yankees should forget about Roger Clemens, who has just stomped his
seven-league boots and said he wanted out of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens says the Blue Jays are not committed to winning. And
here's the sad part: Toronto is apparently going to accommodate
him, sell him off to the highest bidder. Toronto _ the biggest city
in Canada, a two-time World Series champion _ has become a
small-market team, psychologically, which only tells me baseball is
sicker than we think.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk of Clemens pitching in his hometown of Houston,
we can only assume he is not going to the Retro Real Baseball
League because pitchers have to take their turn at bat, and
Knockdown doesn't like the sound of that.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that the Rocket would accept a lot of George
Steinbrenner's dollars. How nice. In his lust to win a World Series
(did somebody say Mookie Wilson?), Clemens would allow Bernie and
Tino and Derek and Paul to score runs for him.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Roger Clemens needs the Yankees more than the
Yankees need him.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Yankees don't need Clemens at all. They've got
Wells and Cone and Pettitte and El Duque and Irabu and Mendoza, and
if they can't win with these guys, everybody should be fired. Who
needs a rent-an-ace cluttering up the top of this rotation?
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner should have learned his lesson last July when his
young but astute general manager, Brian Cashman, shied away from
Randy Johnson, who was moping his way out of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was Cashman's judgment not to give up major league
talent for renting Johnson for a few months. Needless to say, once
Johnson went to Houston, Cashman sweated out his personal nightmare
of Johnson breaking off Snappy curves in the Stadium in October,
which never happened. You can't live your life in fear. So what if
the Rocket sells his services to an American League team? The
Yankees are on a roll. They terrorized baseball for a few weeks
with their fourth-string left fielder, Shane Spencer, and when he
had a bad inning or two, Torre went to his fifth-string left
fielder, Ricky Ledee, and won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner should also consider the mood of the clubhouse. One
reason the Yankees won 125 games was that there were no hot zones,
no brooding corners. Clemens is a great competitor, works hard and
deserved his fifth Cy Young Award, but he demands a certain amount
of space. In these days of free agency, cohesion and continuity
don't count for much. Todd Hundley was shuffled off by the Mets as
soon as Mike Piazza was signed, and now the Mets are bringing back
Bobby Bonilla, who has a history of polemics. The Mets are also
talking to Rickey Henderson, one of the great leadoff hitters of
all time, but an aging egotist who caused eyes to roll in the
clubhouse during his tenure with the Yankees. There must be a limit
to how much money can be spent, how many attitudes can be stocked
in one clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Yankees try to win another with the same delightful
cast, even if they have to win it ``the old-fashioned way,''
whatever that is. &QL;

`60 MINUTES II' IS SET FOR JAN. 13 DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS announced Thursday that the new CBS News program ``60
Minutes II,'' a spinoff of the 30-year-old Sunday evening news
magazine program, will make its debut on Wednesday, Jan. 13, at 9
p.m., and will have Wednesdays from 9 to 10 p.m. as its regular
time slot.
</P>
<P>
   The new show has four correspondents: Dan Rather, the anchor and
managing editor of ``CBS Evening News''; two CBS News
correspondents, Bob Simon and Vicki Mabrey, and Charlie Rose, who
will also continue as producer and host of his weeknight interview
program for public television. The executive producer, Jeff Fager,
was most recently the executive producer of ``CBS Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   The new program faced potential competition from NBC's
``Dateline'' if the network moved that program from 8 to 9 p.m. But
in reshuffling its prime-time lineup this week, NBC did not move
the Wednesday edition of ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' and others
inside CBS News opposed an added version when the idea was first
broached, fearing it would dilute the franchise. But the original
program dependably draws such a large audience that CBS executives
wanted to extend its reach to another night.

   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ It was just past 4 on Wednesday
afternoon, the sun was no longer strong enough to penetrate the
gray overcast, and darkness meant it was time for Serbs to get home
in this part of Kosovo province, where they run the government and
the police but where ethnic Albanians make up 97 percent of the
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Two armored personnel carriers equipped with 20-millimeter
cannon sat at police headquarters, with flak-jacketed officers
keeping nervous watch, fingering their assault rifles. Three doors
away, Divna Djindjic, a Serb, hurried through the daily inventory
in the family grocery store with her husband and their two young
daughters, and the family made ready to rush home and lock the door
against the dangers they feel they can no longer avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls can't even go to school any more, it's too
dangerous,'' said Mrs. Djindjic. ``The Albanians, the terrorists,
can do anything they want now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is little combat, the war in this province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia has taken a new turn. Ethnic Albanian
rebels are spreading their influence to places they had not
controlled before NATO threats made the Serbian government withdraw
many police and army units.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the area they control without having to fight for it
allows the ethnic Albanian rebels to undercut U.S. efforts to
fashion a negotiated settlement to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This expansion is something that has not been completely seen
by the West, but we are not hiding it,'' said Adem Demaci, the
chief civilian representative of the rebels. ``We have advanced in
many, many places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, all the Albanian villages around Pristina are now
in our control,'' he said, speaking of the provincial capital.
``Our military units are preparing the ground for civilian control
of local administration, like schools and police.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats concede that they do not have a full picture of rebel
advances. But they say they are concerned that Slobodan Milosevic,
the Serbian leader who is now president of Yugoslavia, will respond
by breaking the cease-fire, and they admit to a certain
powerlessness in their attempts to keep the rebels contained by
talking with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do, really, is jawboning,'' said William Walker,
the U..S. diplomat in charge of the international monitoring
mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at some point Milosevic will react,'' he added. ``I
think they are trying to provoke him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Western governments were able to force Milosevic into
curtailing attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians by threatening air
strikes, there is no equivalent threat against the guerrillas known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. They have no military
installations to be bombed, and their fighters are typically
lightly armed militia members who spend most of their time with
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have leverage on the KLA,'' said a senior Western
diplomat. ``It is a missing element in our overall strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In this region, less than 20 miles from Pristina, Serbs are
afraid that if they travel out of their villages they will be
assaulted or kidnapped by rebels. There have been more than 200
kidnappings, and many of the victims are feared to have been
killed. But even in the largest town, Podujevo, fear closes in on
Serbs when the sun begins to fall and they retreat to their homes.
Many are leaving Kosovo altogether, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The chief official of this county, Srboslav Bisercic, said the
police are now too afraid to do more than perfunctory patrolling.
``They go from the police station behind my office, down the main
streets of town and out to the motel on the highway. Then they go
back,'' he said. ``There are 78 villages in this county and the
police don't go to any of them.''

</P>
<P>
   At the same moment Bisercic was speaking, less than one mile
away from his office ethnic Albanian civilians were helping rebel
fighters fortify their newest bunker. As the civilians filled
sandbags to protect the long bunker dug into the front yard of a
school as well as three nearby firing positions, fighters with new
uniforms, boots and rifles casually patrolled the road and stopped
cars to question those inside.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians account for more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, and most of them support the rebels' goal of
establishing a separate country.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Repa, Vujo Milosevic, 38, a Serb who was born
there, said: ``There are no problems at all between Serbs and
Albanians in our village. We work together and live together. Look,
my Albanian neighbors just helped get the tractor going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But down that road there are other Albanians who don't know
me, and that's why I can't leave,'' he said, pointing to the narrow
track, flanked by brown corn stalks poking through the snow, that
he used to use to get to the town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   Vujo Milosevic has a job in Podujevo, but he said: ``I haven't
gone to work for three days, and my children can't go to school.
There is no protection for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the town rebels frequently set up a checkpoint,
stopping cars and sometimes threatening people, residents said.
They say the checkpoint appeared recently, after police stopped
patrolling the road.
</P>
<P>
   Many, perhaps most, Serbs in Kosovo would eagerly move to other
parts of Serbia, but that would greatly reduce the government's
claim to the province. There is a law that prohibits Serbs from
selling their property to ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in this village who could afford to leave without
selling their land have gone _ all my brothers did,'' said Vujo
Milosevic, ``It's just people like me who are too poor who are
staying behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Kosovo, the emotions released by the growing fear among
Serbs is taking several forms. Despondency seems to wash over most,
as they try to think of what they can possibly do in the face what
they see as the impossible dilemma of living here in fear or
fleeing as impoverished refugees to another part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the school in Podujevo, where 266 ethnic Serb students from
the whole county are enrolled, there were panic and anger as well
as confusion about whom to blame. Last week, classes were canceled
because it was considered too dangerous to bus students, and
teachers milled around the corridors discussing what could be done
to improve safety, but there were no conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers acknowledged that NATO threatened air strikes
because it was the only way to stop government attacks on ethnic
Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But one teacher said: ``This is because NATO supports the
Albanians. It will only stop when NATO stops protecting them.'' She
said she would not give her name because that might put her in
danger.

<P>
   Specialty stores and discounters outdistanced major department
store chains in holiday sales during November, monthly results from
big retailers showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Ann Taylor, the Gap and Sharper Image saw
double-digit sales increases compared with a year ago. Same-store
sales, a more accurate gauge of a retailer's strength, increased at
double-digit levels for those companies as well. (Same-store sales
are sales at stores open for a year or more.)
</P>
<P>
   But chains like May Department Stores and Dayton Hudson Corp.
saw modest increases in same-stores sales last month, the companies
said, while another major department store retailer, Federated
Department Stores, had a small decline.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the gains at discounters and specialty
chains to efforts by those companies to focus on a core customer
group or product category.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest surprise is the strength in the apparel specialty
retailer,'' said Rick Gallagher, a vice president of the National
Retail Federation, a trade group. Because of sluggish sales at
major department stores, he said, ``a lot of people came to the
wrong conclusion that apparel wasn't selling in November.''
</P>
<P>
   John Staton, a partner in the retail strategy group at Andersen
Consulting in Chicago, said he believed the sales reports sent a
clear message to major department store companies: ``It suggests
that department stores need to think about who their customer is
and how to serve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at Ann Taylor rose 11.2 percent in November due
to demand for its career clothing, sweaters and tops. Gap, which
also includes Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic, said
same-store sales jumped 16 percent, as sales rose 40 percent in the
month. Garments high in demand this year, such as fleece pullovers
and cargo pants, were found in abundance in its stores. The Sharper
Image said same-store sales rose 17 percent, as its largely male
customers showed strong demand for products ranging from ionic air
purifiers to to soothing-sound machines.
</P>
<P>
   The National Retail Federation still forecasts a 4.5 percent to
5 percent increase in same store sales for all retailers during the
months of November and December. That should translate into a 15
percent rise in earnings, similar to last year's gains. But this
year's gains will come on the strength of discounters, wholesale
clubs and the specialty stores. Last year's increase was
attributable to strength across most of the industry, including
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   The limited interest in cold weather wear including sweaters and
flannel pajamas _ largely because of unexpectedly warm temperatures
which are about 20 degress above normal in some areas of the United
States _ has been one of the major problems for department stores
this holiday season. Federated, which owns Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, had a 0.2 percent decline in same-store sales in
November, as sales fell 1.5 percent decline in the month. May
Department Stores, a chain which includes Lord &AMP; Taylor, Hecht's,
Filene's and Foley's, said same-store sales rose 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such retailers take a bigger hit from sluggish apparel sales
because about 80 percent of their inventory is clothing.
Discounters, in contrast, have a more varied mix of products,
including some necessities like food, health care and personal care
items that need to be replaced more often than clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest discounter, said
same-store sales rose 7.6 percent; Kmart saw a 2.5 percent increase
in same-store sales and Family Dollar Stores said same-store sales
rose 6.2 percent. Dayton Hudson, had a 3 percent increase in
same-store sales with most gains attributed to its Target discount
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems department stores face, analysts said
last-minute shoppers could still help their holiday profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it all came at the last week, so it's not written in
stone,'' said Jeff Feiner, a Lehman Brothers analyst. ``This next
week is real key. If departments stores don't hit it big, you have
the indications it could be a problem.''

THE BUBBLE IS BACK, COMPLIMENTS OF THE FED  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a very strange year. Consider these events:
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old woman shakes the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A septuagenarian senator rockets into space.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks plummet for a couple of months, then turn around and set
new highs by the end of November, leaving many to wonder why they
fell so far in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., recently took some time to talk about developments in
the financial markets, and to share what he sees happening in the
year ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Based on the market's move over the last couple of months, it
seems as if Asia, Russia, Long-Term Capital and Brazil never
happened. Are the steps that have been taken to deal with these
problems the reason markets seem so much healthier?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have thrown a lot of money at a lot of problems, but
throwing money at them doesn't necessarily solve them.
</P>
<P>
   It is really hard to make the case that foreign events caused
the mighty, powerful reserve currency capital market to collapse.
It closed because American corporations are spending so much right
now on investment they are running big cash deficits. And that led
the Federal Reserve Board to throw a tremendous amount of money at
the capital markets. It is that liquidity that is helping stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When they try to explain the source of the money that is
flowing into the market, a lot of folks cite big cash balances in
money market funds and at mutual funds. Do you buy that?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The stock market has seen its capitalization increase by at
least $1.5 trillion in the last two months. You can't do that with
normal savings. There is something powerful underneath this thing,
and I would argue it is the Fed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: This all sounds rather ominous. Is the market's recovery
really that tenuous?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are the biggest bulls in the world. But the real question
the market is going to have to deal with is what happens when the
economy slows. The Fed has now reflated the equity market bubble.
The risk is that next spring they will be looking at an even bigger
bubble at a time when the economy will be slowing and profits will
still be declining. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people have recently been talking more
optimistically about profits, if not in the first half of the year,
then later on. You seem to take issue with that view.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the argument is flawed. For the last five quarters,
profits have been flat to down in the context of a Goldilocks
economy. The basis for profits is fantastically positive, and yet
they are weak.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if we will go into a recession or not next year.
But I do know we will run that risk, and will go through a period
of very, very sluggish growth, a time when investment spending will
slow. When that happens, spending, income growth, profit growth and
employment will all be weaker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the announcements of the Exxon-Mobil merger and Boeing's
production cutbacks examples of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: They sure are. So was Intel's decision to cut capital
spending by 40 percent, which it announced a couple of weeks ago. I
think we are going to see more of that. We have had the biggest
capital spending boom in history. But after a while, there is too
much of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have been a much bigger fan of the bond market than of
the stock market for at least a year. Is that still the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is. The best-kept secret in the world is how well the
30-year Treasury bond has done this year. It has had a return of
about 18 percent so far, roughly in line with the Standard &AMP; Poor's
index and much better than the average stock, which is down. I
think by the end of the year it will beat the S&AMP;P. That's unheard
of, for a bond to beat the stock market in a period of strong
economic growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is 1999 a year to buy bonds?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think bonds will outperform stocks by a country mile next
year.
</P>
<P>
   We think rates will fall, and could fall substantially, because
there is no inflation out there. A year from now, we could see
yields on the 30-year bond at 4.25 percent, possibly lower. I am
not holding back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there more money to be made abroad than at home next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Today, nobody dares look outside the United States. But the
theme for 1999 is that money will gravitate toward economies and
markets that are running current account surpluses and are not
heavily dependent on inflows of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   That may point you to Asia, where countries like Korea and
Thailand are already generating current account surpluses. Others
will start doing the same soon. Asia could be the big story in
1999.

MAN ON TRIAL FOR INJECTING SON WITH HIV TO AVOID CHILD-SUPPORT
PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill.)  (bl) 
 By JO THOMAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Mo. _ Brian Stewart, a hospital laboratory
technician, never gave his little son a birthday present. Instead,
prosecutors say, when the baby was 11 months old, Stewart secretly
gave him an injection of blood infected with HIV, hoping to kill
the boy and avoid paying child support.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, described by his doctor as a cheerful, energetic child,
started losing weight and running fevers in 1996 at the age of 5.
Shortly afterward, he was diagnosed with AIDS. Now 7, he attends
school and stays alive on a round-the-clock regimen of tube
feedings and medications. His father is on trial here in the St.
Charles County Circuit Court on charges of first-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Ross Buehler, contends that at the time the
child contracted the virus, his father could have safely assumed
that the child would die.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's lawyer, Joseph Murphy, has called the case a
``tragedy'' but not a crime. In his opening statement Wednesday,
Murphy dismissed the prosecution's largely circumstantial case and
contended that the child had contracted the disease some other way.
</P>
<P>
   Two people who lived in the same household were intravenous drug
users, Murphy said, and two convicted sex offenders may also have
come into contact with the child.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that health officials have tested everyone who
may have come in contact with the child, including the drug users
and sex offenders, and none have tested positive for HIV. The
child, who was identified as ESJ, has also been examined for sexual
abuse, and no sign has ever been found.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 32, who lives in Columbia, Ill., was employed as a
phlebotomist, drawing blood at a hospital laboratory, at the time
he went to his son's room in another hospital, where the child was
being treated for asthma and pneumonia, on the morning of Feb. 6,
1992. Prosecutors say that while Stewart's girlfriend, the boy's
mother, was out of the room, he injected the baby with infected
blood stolen from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the boy's mother, who has been identified only as
Jennifer, told the jury that when Stewart appeared that morning in
1992, she followed his suggestion that she get a soft drink from
the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to see Stewart sitting in a rocking chair with the
infant in his lap. The infant was hysterical, she said. ``He kept
crying and screaming, and I couldn't seem to quiet him down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She called nurses for help, but could find nothing wrong, she
said. Shortly afterward, Stewart left. The baby kept crying until
he was exhausted, she said, but there was no visible cause.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's pediatrician, Dr. Linda Steel-Green, testified
Thursday that she became alarmed because the child was lethargic
and breathing fast, with a rapid heart rate. Suddenly, his
condition was much worse.
</P>
<P>
   His symptoms were consistent with a bad reaction to an infusion
of incompatible blood, the doctor testified today, but she
suspected nothing because the baby had never received a
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steel-Green had never treated an AIDS patient before, and it
was not until May 1996, when the boy had become desperately ill and
she remembered the boy's family telling her that the father said
the child would not live long, that she had him tested for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, his mother wept as she described her child's
suffering and slow progress with help from new medications which
have also left him nearly deaf. Stewart listened impassively,
taking notes now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer met Stewart in January 1990, and became pregnant five
months later.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that she gave birth to their son in February 1991,
and that her relationship with Stewart ended in August 1992. She
called Stewart that month from a local clinic where she was
undergoing treatment for stress.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that, when she told him he was financially
responsible for their son, he denied paternity and ``started in
with these threats of `I told you, when I leave, I'm going to leave
for good. I'm not going to leave any loose ends or ties behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   She testified that he told her, ``You won't need to look me up
for child support anyway, because your son's not going to live that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what he meant by that, and he said: `Don't worry
about it. I just know that he's not going to live to see the age of
five,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``He's told me that if I tried to find him, he
could have me taken care of, and no one would ever be able to trace
it back to him.''
</P>
<P>
   She sued Stewart twice for child support, and in 1997, after
paternity was established, was awarded $267 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing, Amy Braun, a subsequent girlfriend of
Stewart's, testified that he told her ``he didn't want the child
from the beginning, that he wanted the mother to get an abortion
and that the child would be dead soon anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Sgt. Kevin Wilson of the St. Charles County Sheriff's
Department testified that Stewart's co-workers told him they
usually knew which patients had HIV or AIDS because hospital staff
and patients let them know. It also would have been easy to draw
extra tubes of blood, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer testified that Stewart took needles, syringes and
tourniquets home from work when they were living together and that
she twice found vials of blood in her freezer.

ANALYSIS: THE MESSAGE FROM EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With EUROPE-RATES.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three months ago, Alan Greenspan, the federal
reserve chairman, warned that the United States could not ``remain
an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing
greatly increased stress.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a while, but Europe has come to the same
conclusion. After brushing aside hints from the Clinton
administration in September that the United States would like to
see coordinated trans-Atlantic interest rate cuts, Germany and the
other nations that are creating a single European currency trimmed
rates Thursday to help keep their economies from stalling.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, where the Federal Reserve cut rates
three times in seven weeks this fall, the impetus to ease monetary
policy in Europe came primarily from concerns about the effects of
the global downturn at home, not from a desire to fix the rest of
the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a broader message in the European action as well:
that central banks in all the major industrial nations have now
shifted their attention from fighting inflation to nurturing growth
at a time when the world is suffering one rude economic shock after
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing, and justly so, the abandonment of the
inflation-fighting religion, which was eminently successful,
perhaps too much so, and has given us a world of recessions and
considerable risks, including deflation,'' said Allen Sinai, an
economist at Primark Decision Economics. ``The European move is
part of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate reductions in Europe are unlikely to have a direct
influence on policy-makers at the Federal Reserve, who will meet on
Dec. 22 to decide whether to cut rates again.
</P>
<P>
   But the forces that led the Fed to ease policy over the last
several months, and that led Europe to act Thursday, have proved
difficult to contain, and both emerging economies and
industrialized nations remain vulnerable. Just Thursday, Brazil's
Congress failed to pass a key component of its economic recovery
package, jolting investors across Latin America and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, is scheduled to
meet here on Friday with Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin. American officials made no substantive comments on the
European rate cut Thursday, but are sure to welcome it in their
discussions with Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have been slashing their estimates for growth in
Europe next year, saying that a decline in exports caused by the
global troubles will hurt the Continent's gradual recovery. The
left-leaning governments that now dominate Europe _ especially
Lafontaine and the new German government _ have also been pressing
openly for lower rates from their central banks, especially since
inflation is dormant and unemployment remains high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European rate cut should be seen in the context that Alan
Greenspan formulated back in September _ that of a change where the
risk is of a growth slowdown and not from inflationary price
pressures,'' said Christopher Widness, an international economist
at Chase Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In moving Thursday in a way that stunned the financial markets,
which had not expected a rate cut for weeks _ or maybe even until
after the new European Central Bank took over _ the 11 European
nations also seemed intent on reminding the world that collectively
they are a major new economic force in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the move seemed to underscore their
willingness to accept that with their newfound clout comes the need
to view an economically united Europe as more bound to the ups and
downs of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of monetary and other economic policy is going to
be much more integrated and coordinated because all these countries
are part of the world system,'' Sinai said. ``The lesson of the
Asian events is how tightly tied to each other the countries of the
world are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts think the Europeans may have had a less
altruistic goal in mind, as well, one driven by the increasing
competition for export sales around the world as demand in many
countries declines.
</P>
<P>
   They said Europe did not want to risk entering monetary union,
which formally starts on Jan. 1, with the new currency, the euro,
valued at a level that would make it hard for European exporters to
compete around the world. Lower rates could help hold down the
value of the euro, which otherwise might rise relative to the
dollar if the American economy continued to slow and the Fed cut
rates further.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, by moving now, before monetary union formally
starts and the European Central Bank assumes the power to set rates
for 11 nations, the members of the single currency got the new
central bank out of a tricky spot. Although a rate cut would have
been justified by the darkening economic outlook, to cut rates at a
time of growing political pressure to do so might have left the new
central bank looking weak willed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rate cut was coming, it was better to get it out of the
way while the Bundesbank was still in charge,'' Widness said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the national central banks also seemed to be
telling the European governments that they would prefer to see the
economic problems dealt with through monetary policy than to see
big increases in government spending and growing budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the
rate cut was implemented on the assumption that governments would
stick to the fiscal criteria laid out in the single currency plan,
which include a limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross
domestic product.

ARRESTED CHINESE DISSIDENT'S DAUGHTER HAS SEEN IT ALL BEFORE

<P>
   BOSTON _ Once again, Xu Jin is watching as her father is taken
from her.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, she was eight years old, standing in her
nightgown as Chinese soldiers dragged him off in the middle of the
night. What's wrong, she asked him. He smiled, trying to comfort
her. Nothing's wrong, he said, go back to sleep. The next day, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 years, she lived without him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Xu, 26, watched on the news as her father, Xu Wenli,
one of China's leading dissidents, was dragged to prison in Beijing
this week. Xu is in Boston, where she is a graduate student at
Boston University, studying fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's crime: Creating a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised,'' Xu said in an interview Thursday, her
eyes brimming with tears. ``He kept a bag filled with things like
his toothbrush behind the door. He expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Carr, chairman of the advisory board for Harvard's Human
Rights Initiative, compares Xu Wenli to Nelson Mandela. Xu Jin said
Mandela is a friend of her father's, and said the two men agree
with the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she spent much of her childhood without her father's
direct presence, Xu said his letters to her, and his example,
taught her about standing up for your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his footsteps, she wrote a letter to the Chinese
government this week, condemning them for her father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has ideas about democracy and freedom but he has no
soldiers and no secret police,'' she wrote. ``He cannot hurt you.
Let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu can't go home to be with her mother, He Xintong, because she
fears she will not be allowed to leave China again. Xintong can't
come to Boston to be with her daughter because she fears she won't
be allowed to return to China. Xu is an only child, and her mother
is very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Xu attends school in Boston because she is forbidden from
attending universities in China. ``It's not a written law,'' she
said. ``But it's understood that because of who my father is, I'm
not to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Xu recalled a very happy early
childhood. She remembered marching with her father in protests, and
dancing and entertaining adults who had gathered at her family's
house to hand-write and hand-publish a pro-democracy magazine
called April 5th Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always lots of people in the house,'' Xu said,
smiling with the memory. ``It was quite wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's father was born and raised in Southern China, one of five
children. His father died when he was nine years old. Raised
alternately by his mother, an older sister, and his grandmother, Xu
Wenli became very interested in politics and history while he was
in high school, according to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Xu Wenli made the decision
not to attend college, which broke his mother's heart. But he
believed ``he would learn more by studying the government and
talking to people,'' his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He served five years in the Chinese army, and then took a job as
an electrician at a factory in Beijing, where he met He Xintong, an
accountant, fell in love, and married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Xu Wenli became involved with a fledgling democracy
movement, his daughter said. He began producing the magazine in his
house, and his daughter remembers how happy he seemed when he would
go with his wife and daughter to the central wall in Beijing to
sell the magazine on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Xu Wenli's friend Wei Ginsheng put
up a poster asking for democracy. He was arrested. Xu Wenli
organized a group of people to sneak a tape recorder into the
trial, and then published a transcript of the trial to show it was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's father was charged with stealing state secrets, and
taken away. It was a full year before Xu Jin or her mother even
knew if he was alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother took me to every prison, everywhere she could think
of where he might be, asking for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want
her to know how scared I was, so when I started to feel afraid, I'd
say I was going to go outside to look at the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first arrest, Xu Jin said, her elementary school
teacher harassed her, humiliated her in class and made sure ``I
didn't laugh so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's middle and high school teachers were more
understanding, she said. Nonetheless, she grew up very alone. Her
mother worked three jobs. After school, Xu came home to an empty
house. She had no close friends, because she could not let anyone
know about the truth of her father's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them he was on a business trip,'' she said. ``It
seemed safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu and her mother were allowed to visit her father in prison
every two months, for 40 minutes, with the exception of three years
in which he was allowed no visitors. It was the only human contact
he had for 12 years, as his captors were not allowed to speak to
him. For much of his sentence he was kept in a room ``not much
wider or longer than a coffin''.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Xu saw her father after his arrest, she said he
was huddled on the floor of a large room where 20 or so prison
officials sat at a large table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to talk about politics, or the trial,'' she
said. ``And my mother wasn't allowed to touch him. When I was
little I could sit on his lap, but after a while that stopped
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Xu Wenli was released to house arrest after the United
States government demanded his release in exchange for economic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   When her father emerged from the prison, he was a changed man,
physically. ``His hair was white, his teeth were rotted out,'' said
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit, however, remained intact. ``He just started talking
and wouldn't stop,'' his daughter said. ``I had cooked a whole
table of his favorite foods, but he wouldn't stop talking to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu had only a few months with her father after his release from
prison before she was to head to the United States, to attend Bard
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he's against college,'' she said. ``But he understood.
He wants me to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu hopes to finish school, take a job in graphic design
somewhere in the United States, and continue to support her mother.
But her father's activism has also worn off on her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Chinese government, Xu said that computers
confiscated from her father's house were bought with money she
earned ``by washing dishes and waiting tables. Why are you afraid
of me and my father?''

DOW FALLS 184.86 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell broadly on Thursday, buffeted by more
projections of reduced earnings and a budgetary setback in Brazil
that caused its Bovespa index to plunge nearly 9 percent. Seemingly
ignored was a coordinated interest-rate cut in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the old devils of international economies and earnings
outlooks are coming back again,'' said John Shaughnessy, the chief
strategist at the Advest Group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also pointed to a lack of a strong new sector during
the market's rebound from the October lows, a situation they said
helped put investors in a mood to cash in profits.
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular American gauges each dropped about 2
percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending down 184.86
points. Of the 30 blue-chip components, only Allied Signal managed
even a fractional advance.
</P>
<P>
   This was another session of exceptional volatility, the fourth
straight in which the Dow's gyrations created a gap between its
high for the day and its low that exceeded the 30-day average. The
last time the daily range was more than 100 percent of the average
for so long was from Aug. 27 through Sept. 1, when the market hit
its 1998 low.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, said Fane Lozman, chairman of the
Chicago-based Scanshift, which analyzes stock market data,
investors should be more careful in placing orders to buy and sell
since they may wind up in a fast-moving market with unacceptable
prices by the time their orders are executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to pay attention to slippage on a market order,''
one executed at whatever price prevails when it reaches the
market-maker or exchange specialist, Lozman said. Using a limit
order, one that will be executed only at a specified price, can be
used as protection though it may also keep the transaction from
getting done at all.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were caught up in Thursday's pounding as Ebay
skidded 16, Onsale 12| and Amazon.com 10.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may have turned to Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch, the latest hot first public offering. Shares of
the online company, 7 million of which were offered at 14, began
trading at 52 and then changed hands as high as 56] before closing
at 40\.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own no Internet stocks, you're not playing'' these
days, said Larry Rice, the chief investment officer at Josephthal.
He bemoaned a lack of market breadth of late and called the market
overvalued at more than 22{ times next year's expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market focus has continued on the same groups and the same
names,'' he said. ``There's no new leadership whatsoever'' that
would befit a proper bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services, computer and drug groups were especially
hard hit on Thursday, which saw the Dow industrials, which closed
at 8,879.68, slip below the 9000 mark for the first time since Nov.
17. It was also the Dow's second loss of more than 2 percent this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise rejection by Brazil's Congress of a tax increase
designed to shrink the country's budget deficit shriveled bank
shares, especially those with heavy Latin American exposure. Among
those down were BankBoston, off 3 11/16, to 38 15/16 and J.P.
Morgan dropping 4 1/16, to 107\.
</P>
<P>
   Most drug stocks also suffered multiple-point losses, with Eli
Lilly down 5[, to 83}, Merck and Bristol-Myers each down 3{ and
Schering-Plough down 3\.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bond of Bond Procope cited poor ``sentiment and the
underlying tone'' of the market in the last few days and said late
in the session that he had heard that computer-chip stocks had come
under pressure because of higher production in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, investors are awfully jittery,'' Bond
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers, who are vulnerable to distress in Brazil, were
mixed but Intel was driven down 4 1/16, to 109{.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, larded with high-technology shares,
fell 40.88 points, a 2.05 percent drop that almost exactly matched
that of the Dow industrials.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks fared slightly
better, down 21.11 points, or 1.8 percent.

MARKETS PLUNGE AFTER BRAZIL DEFEATS TAX INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Markets throughout Latin America plunged
Thursday after the Brazilian Congress voted down an increase in
pension contributions by public workers, delivering an unexpected
blow to the government's pledges of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Brazil's Lower House late Wednesday threw out a
measure to increase from 11 percent to 20 percent the pension
payments of civil servants earning more than $960 a month. As the
defeat represented the loss of an estimated $2.2 billion in
revenues, the vote's damage was both politically and
psychologically severe.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, has been under enormous
pressure to cut its deficit in order to avoid the same kind of
financial crises that ensnared Southeast Asian economies more than
a year ago, the start of an economic virus that has repeatedly
shaken financial markets and raised fears of a severe global
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   For investors and political analysts, the vote in Brazil
signaled trouble ahead for a raft of proposals to reduce government
spending and raise taxes, designed to make the country solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat is also raising concerns about Brazil's ability to
meet the terms of its agreement for a $41.5 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund. The loan has been crucial to
offsetting fears of an economic meltdown in Brazil that would
affect the rest of Latin America and even sounder economies in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 160 million people, Brazil concentrates more than
half the population of South America in a country bigger than the
continental United States. Thanks to a slew of privatizations in
recent years, it is home to $36 billion in direct foreign
investment. Its size and weight make it the undeniable leader in
Latin America, the market for about 20 percent of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a round of coordinated interest-rate cuts throughout
Europe, markets throughout Latin America on Thursday skidded in
reaction to the defeat in Brasilia. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the
market fell 8.8 percent, while Argentina's Merval plummeted 6.5
percent. In Mexico the market dropped 3 percent, while Chile's
market fell 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant selling in Latin America also rattled the stock
market in the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled 184.86 points or 2.04 percent to 8,879.68.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Congress had been expected to grant President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso broad support to carry out deep reforms.
In the past, Congress has supported the government in moments of
economic crisis, most recently after Thailand's financial collapse
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that wasn't supposed to happen,'' said
Desmond Lachman, head of emerging-markets economic research at
Solomon Smith Barney. ``It's raising questions about the ease with
which they can pass the rest of their package.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based political consultant, said
future reforms would likely take more political maneuvering to win
approval. The defections came from within the president's own party
_ with 25 deputies voting against the measure _ and from an allied
party led by former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning of a rough road ahead,'' Barros
said. A recent scandal, featuring secret recordings of
conversations in which government ministers appeared to be favoring
another former official in the auction of Brazil's phone system
last summer, has heightened skepticism toward the Cardoso
administration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this week the first lady was booed when she visited a
university in Rio de Janeiro, with students throwing money and
coins at her. ``The honeymoon's over,'' Barros said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which had announced just an
hour after the congressional vote that it would release an initial
$5.3 billion slice of the bailout loan, issued no formal statement
following the congressional defeat. A spokesman told Reuters that
the IMF was ``looking at the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of its agreement with the IMF, Brazil must
produce a surplus in its primary accounts _ government expenses
less debt service _ amounting to 2.6 percent of gross domestic
product next year. The government had presented a $23.5 billion
package of budget cuts and increases in taxes to demonstrate its
ability to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian budget deficit has blown up to 7 percent of GDP,
or more than $55 billion. Its reforms were designed to bring down
interest rates and shrink the budget deficit to 4.7 percent next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Amaral, a spokesman for the president, told reporters
that the failure to approve increased pension contributions would
mean ``more cuts in public-works projects, and reductions in
transfer payments to the states and municipalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Ferraz, president of Banco Bozzano Simonsen, said the
markets had overreacted to the bill's defeat, and that he did not
believe the vote spelled the end _ or even the delay _ of
government reform. ``Markets tend to be extremely pessimistic or
optimistic all the time,'' Ferraz said. ``Our view has been that
those things take time, but they're all going to be implemented in
time.''

FINESSING YOUR FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: In the last graf, replace (AT) with the typographical `at'
symbol.) 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm a part-time contractor at a high-technology company.
Recently, my supervisor asked if I would be interested in a
full-time job, at less pay per hour but with stock options and
other benefits. The truth is that I'm not interested _ I like the
freedom and my current pay _ but I worry that if I reject his
offer, he'll replace me with someone committed to the long haul.
Any negotiating suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Freedom or security: It's a stark choice _ and one that your
employer may not realize is a tough call for you. Because the
company wants you full time, it clearly likes your work.
Nevertheless, before deciding on a bargaining approach, talk with
your boss about exactly why he made the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the company is looking to cut expenses or
reduce its number of consultants,'' said Bob Deissig, president of
recruiting services for the Ayers Group, a human resources
consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you should seek ways to maximize your value _ like
increasing your work load but not your fee _ that would make the
company more willing to keep you on your terms.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, your boss may simply be dazzled by your technical
prowess and is afraid of losing you. Employers are often much more
worried about your taking off than you are about being replaced _
particularly in this tight job market, said Robin Ryan, a
Seattle-based career counselor and author of ``Winning Resumes''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the operative word is tact. By turning down a
full-time gig, you are saying, in essence: ``I really like you
guys, but not enough to commit.'' Think about how that line played
in your last personal relationship. Employers tend to take
rejection about as well as insecure girlfriends or boyfriends, so
when breaking the news to your supervisor, let him down easy.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the money, Ms. Ryan advised: ``Go to your employer
and say, `I just can't take a salary cut at this time.' '' This
puts your rejection in practical, hard-dollar terms that most
business types can grasp. After all, stock options are a nice perk,
but they can't pay the rent, and they often have no value until you
have been with a company for 3, 5 or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how practical your reasons, you need to make your
rejection as flattering as possible, Deissig said. ``Tell your
supervisor how honored you are by the offer,'' he said, ``and
stress how terrific you think the organization is.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasize that you have no intention of abandoning the firm.
``Assure them that the offer makes you even more committed to the
organization,'' he added, ``and ask what you can do to make
everyone more comfortable with your consultant status.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do plan to stay, Deissig said, consider negotiating a
long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if your employer is desperate to hire you, he may
counter with a second offer at your current pay _ or higher. At
that point, you'll have to re-evaluate just how much you want to
stay footloose and freelance. &QL;

EXXON AND MOBIL WIELD FORMIDABLE LOBBYING CLOUT IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (With EXXON-DEAL.) 
(bl) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After tornadoes, El Nino rains and an ice storm swept across
large swaths of the nation, Congress enacted an emergency spending
measure in May providing $2.6 billion in natural disaster relief.
Deep inside that bill, though, in a last-minute addition, the oil
industry won a big concession: relief of $66 million from the
amount owed for extracting oil from federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, with Congress wrangling over a huge spending
bill and eager to cut deals and leave town, the oil industry won
again as the House leadership reaffirmed that relief. Indeed, in
the end, Congress even sweetened the deal a bit, by extending the
break a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of Big Oil in Washington, and two of the
biggest players in this monolithic and highly effective industry
lobby are Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. Rich in cash, aggressive in
style, with issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes and the
environment, Exxon and Mobil have been effective in pushing their
agenda through behind-the-scenes contacts at the highest level of
government and through arm-twisting in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have a narrow range of interests to lobby on,''
said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group which tracks Washington lobbying.
``But, by its very nature, oil is so pervasive and it is so
affected by government policy that they care about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With the oil and gas industry generally marching, and lobbying,
in lockstep, it is often hard to separate Exxon and Mobil from
their rivals. While somewhat different in their approaches, both
companies are big supporters of the American Petroleum Institute,
an industry trade association that spent $3.7 million on lobbying
in 1997. They often join industry coalitions created to lobby about
a specific topic _ the lifting of sanctions to oil-producing
nations like Iraq, for example, or the ability of U.S. oil
companies to swap oil with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, Exxon and Mobil have a combined total of 15
full-time lobbyists on their payrolls in Washington, and employ
other Washington lawyers and lobbying firms as well. Last year,
Mobil spent $5.3 million on federal lobbying and Exxon spent $5.2
million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Combined,
this would make them the fifth largest entity in spending on
lobbying the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   As multinational corporations with businesses in far-flung
spots, Exxon and Mobil's interests in Washington touch on many
trade and finance issues. The two companies have won favorable tax
rulings before the IRS and the Treasury Department concerning the
use of foreign tax credits to reduce their U.S. tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   They are sensitive to the State Department's Middle East and
Asian policies, especially since oil is often found in pariah
nations such as Libya, Myanmar and Iran. They are generally
supportive of Arab nations. And new issues, like the proposed
Caspian Sea pipeline route _ a region where Mobil has operations _
have engaged them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably most effective behind the scenes,'' said
Martin Lobel, a Washington lawyer who represents consumer groups
and small oil companies. ``They'll get their economists and lawyers
to see the IRS and the companies will stay relatively hidden.
You've got maybe two Ph.D economists in the entire IRS and Exxon
can hire as many as they want. We were once in a big battle with
Exxon on the issue of oil overcharges and there must have been 30
economists on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rothschild, a senior associate with Podesta Associates, a
Washington lobbying firm, said that the two companies' lobbying on
complicated tax issues had paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of esoteric issues, especially in taxes, but
which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ``There
were efforts by the Clinton administration in the last two budget
bills to reduce the value of the foreign tax credits. But Exxon and
the industry descended and those provisions were quietly
eliminated. I don't know who they talked to, but they got the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Exxon and Mobil are usually allied on industry issues,
each has a different operating style: Exxon is more aloof and
somewhat diffident about how it is perceived; Mobil is quicker to
defend its public image and more willing to enter the political
fray.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's brashness was evident when the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil
spill, one of the worst environmental catastrophes in U.S. history,
became a giant tax break, as the company wrote off all
disaster-related expenses _ including legal bills and cleanup
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil makes practically no campaign contributions, while Exxon
is a leading donor to the Republican party and candidates. In the
1996 presidential election cycle Exxon contributed $593,928,
donating 95 percent to Republicans; in the last congressional
races, Exxon gave $475,855, 84 percent to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This GOP tilt could help the companies in the next Congress: the
three new top House leaders are all Republicans from the ``Oil
Patch'': House Speaker Bob Livingston of Louisiana, Majority Leader
Dick Armey of Texas and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's new
conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Exxon and Mobil opposed the Clinton
administration's efforts to gain Senate approval of the Kyoto
Protocol, an international treaty to curb global warming that had
won support by other oil companies like Royal Dutch/Shell Group and
British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the last Congress, they won significant victories to
halt the Interior and Treasury departments' efforts to get oil
companies to pay more in royalties for oil and gas extracted from
federal lands and pay back some $345.5 million in past royalties
that Interior says is owed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has even filed suit to get collect these
royalties; last August, Mobil spent $56.5 million to settle these
claims. Meanwhile, in Congress, Exxon leads an industry effort to
pay royalties owed to the government in oil rather than in cash _ a
proposal the government strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil companies lobby in a very coordinated way,'' said a
staff member for a House energy-related committee, who spoke on
condition neither neither he not his committee be identified.
``They rely heavily on the American Petroleum Institute, but
they've also got their people. Exxon's lobbyist is very friendly
and outgoing and the company is really involved in the royalty
issue. On a technical point, Exxon's lobbyist will bring in 11
people to talk to you about it. They are incredibly influential.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Russo, an Exxon spokeswoman, said it was too early to tell
how the company's lobbying would be affected by the merger, a view
shared by Donald Turk, a spokesman for Mobil. Mobil does plan to
continue paying for op-ed newspaper ads and for the ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' television series through 1999, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, the companies' lobbying expenses will
undoubtedly rise while the merger faces federal scrutiny: Bell
Atlantic Corp.'s lobbying costs shot up to $15.6 million at the
time of its merger with Nynex, and Boeing Co.'s costs rose to $10
million as it was acquiring McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the specter of a combined Exxon-Mobil juggernaut on the
Potomac scares some. ``They will be so huge and interested in an
incredible number of issues,'' said Charles Lewis, executive
director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit
group. ``They'll come up with new lobbying battlegrounds.''

GOP RANKS DIVIDE OVER CENSURE VS. IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the prospect of President Clinton's
impeachment in the House too close to call, a struggle broke out
Thursday in the Republican ranks as a renegade lawmaker split with
GOP leaders and began rallying support for an alternative plan to
hit Clinton with a sharply worded censure and hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   The move, by Representative Peter T. King of New York, came in
the tense prelude to the House Judiciary Committee's final
impeachment hearings next week, as many GOP lawmakers privately
anguished over how to decide Clinton's fate when the full House
confronts the issue as early as Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the speaker-designate, Robert L. Livingston, told
reporters that no group in Congress should exert pressure to sway
the outcome of the impeachment process, King began organizing
moderate Republicans to support his plan for a censure and fine as
an alternative to removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was seen as a counterstrike against the GOP
majority whip, Tom DeLay, an ardent advocate for Clinton's ouster,
who has been marshaling his potent whip organization in
anticipation of the Judiciary Committee sending at least one
article of impeachment to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want leadership to know there is a lot of support for
censure,'' King said. ``And this is the only alternative because
impeachment is not going to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the Judiciary Committee and supports censure, said the
White House is open to discussing King's proposal, which would
require Clinton to accept a fine of about $300,000. That was the
amount the lame-duck speaker, Newt Gingrich, paid last year to
settle House ethics charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   The King plan also would require Clinton to issue a written
statement acknowledging wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was little evidence to support King's contention
that as many as 20 Republicans would break with the GOP majority
and oppose articles of impeachment in favor of the censure plan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several GOP lawmakers said support for impeachment may
have strengthened since Clinton refused to admit any legal
wrongdoing in his response last week to 81 questions from the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the president came out with those absurd responses, I
found that some members who weren't going to vote for impeachment
were of a mind to say, `He just doesn't get it. I'm going to vote
for impeachment almost as a form of punishment,' '' said
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who
opposes both impeaching Clinton and censuring him.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as the House Judiciary Committee
formally abandoned its two-day foray into investigating Clinton's
1996 campaign fund-raising, effectively clearing the way for the
panel to vote next week on proposed articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde, said he
``informed the White House that the committee will not address
allegations involving abuse of campaign finance laws in its
deliberations currently scheduled for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, who had accused Republicans of leading ``a
wild goose chase'' in pursuing the fund-raising allegations, chided
them after the inquiry was dropped. ``Obviously, this spastic lurch
into campaign finance was not well thought out by the committee
majority,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also has dropped plans to seek impeachment charges
related to former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's
allegation that Clinton groped her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But, Hyde added, ``We feel there is more than adequate
information before the committee to pursue the debate leading to
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee sources said the impeachment articles are expected to
include at least two counts of perjury, one charging Clinton with
lying to a federal grand jury investigating his sexual relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky. The second count would charge him with
lying under oath in his deposition for the Paula Corbin Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit, which was recently settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee Republicans also are expected to propose
articles charging Clinton with obstruction of justice and abusing
the power of his office, although the perjury charges are seen as
the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, in his first public comments after several days of
prodding from Democrats for him to take charge of the impeachment
inquiry, said he expects the full House to vote the week of Dec. 14
if the Judiciary Committee passes articles of impeachment next
week, as the panel is expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also maintained neutrality on the censure issue,
although he has said previously that the House should fulfill its
duty to vote on the impeachment issue before lawmakers consider
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each member of Congress has the responsibility to search his
heart and his conscience and judge for himself the importance to
his constituents, what his vote should be,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeLay and lawmakers opposed to impeachment claimed they
have enough votes to prevail when the issue reaches the House
floor. But neither side has substantiated their claim, and the
situation remains in flux as King and several Democrats advocate
censure plans and GOP conservatives continue to press for Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democrats, all Southern conservatives, are considered
certain to back Clinton's impeachment: Representatives Virgil H.
Goode Jr. of Virginia, Ralph M. Hall of Texas, and Gene Taylor of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Republicans other than King and Shays have publicly
said they will oppose impeachment charges: Representatives John
Edward Porter of Illinois, Jack Quinn of New York, and Mark Souder
of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But two other GOP members _ Representative Jim Bunning of
Kentucky and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho _ have said they will not
participate in House impeachment votes because they were elected to
the Senate in November and might be required to vote on removing
Clinton from office if the House sends articles of impeachment to
the Senate for a trial. Bunning and Crapo were seen as likely to
vote for House impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Although King, Shays and other moderate Republicans say at least
15 other GOP members will oppose impeachment, none have come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty, anxiety reigns on both sides of the
impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats in the House, 228-206, with a
lone independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont,
considered highly likely to oppose impeachment.

ARRESTED CHINESE DISSIDENT'S DAUGHTER HAS SEEN IT ALL BEFORE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Once again, Xu Jin is watching as her father is taken
from her.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, she was eight years old, standing in her
nightgown as Chinese soldiers dragged him off in the middle of the
night. What's wrong, she asked him. He smiled, trying to comfort
her. Nothing's wrong, he said, go back to sleep. The next day, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 years, she lived without him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Xu, 26, watched on the news as her father, Xu Wenli,
one of China's leading dissidents, was dragged to prison in Beijing
this week. Xu is in Boston, where she is a graduate student at
Boston University, studying fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's crime: Creating a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised,'' Xu said in an interview Thursday, her
eyes brimming with tears. ``He kept a bag filled with things like
his toothbrush behind the door. He expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Carr, chairman of the advisory board for Harvard's Human
Rights Initiative, compares Xu Wenli to Nelson Mandela. Xu Jin said
Mandela is a friend of her father's, and said the two men agree
with the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she spent much of her childhood without her father's
direct presence, Xu said his letters to her, and his example,
taught her about standing up for your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his footsteps, she wrote a letter to the Chinese
government this week, condemning them for her father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has ideas about democracy and freedom but he has no
soldiers and no secret police,'' she wrote. ``He cannot hurt you.
Let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu can't go home to be with her mother, He Xintong, because she
fears she will not be allowed to leave China again. Xintong can't
come to Boston to be with her daughter because she fears she won't
be allowed to return to China. Xu is an only child, and her mother
is very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Xu attends school in Boston because she is forbidden from
attending universities in China. ``It's not a written law,'' she
said. ``But it's understood that because of who my father is, I'm
not to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Thursday, Xu recalled a very happy early
childhood. She remembered marching with her father in protests, and
dancing and entertaining adults who had gathered at her family's
house to hand-write and hand-publish a pro-democracy magazine
called April 5th Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always lots of people in the house,'' Xu said,
smiling with the memory. ``It was quite wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's father was born and raised in Southern China, one of five
children. His father died when he was nine years old. Raised
alternately by his mother, an older sister, and his grandmother, Xu
Wenli became very interested in politics and history while he was
in high school, according to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Xu Wenli made the decision
not to attend college, which broke his mother's heart. But he
believed ``he would learn more by studying the government and
talking to people,'' his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He served five years in the Chinese army, and then took a job as
an electrician at a factory in Beijing, where he met He Xintong, an
accountant, fell in love, and married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Xu Wenli became involved with a fledgling democracy
movement, his daughter said. He began producing the magazine in his
house, and his daughter remembers how happy he seemed when he would
go with his wife and daughter to the central wall in Beijing to
sell the magazine on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Xu Wenli's friend Wei Ginsheng put
up a poster asking for democracy. He was arrested. Xu Wenli
organized a group of people to sneak a tape recorder into the
trial, and then published a transcript of the trial to show it was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's father was charged with stealing state secrets, and
taken away. It was a full year before Xu Jin or her mother even
knew if he was alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother took me to every prison, everywhere she could think
of where he might be, asking for him,'' she said. ``I didn't want
her to know how scared I was, so when I started to feel afraid, I'd
say I was going to go outside to look at the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first arrest, Xu Jin said, her elementary school
teacher harassed her, humiliated her in class and made sure ``I
didn't laugh so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Jin's middle and high school teachers were more
understanding, she said. Nonetheless, she grew up very alone. Her
mother worked three jobs. After school, Xu came home to an empty
house. She had no close friends, because she could not let anyone
know about the truth of her father's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them he was on a business trip,'' she said. ``It
seemed safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu and her mother were allowed to visit her father in prison
every two months, for 40 minutes, with the exception of three years
in which he was allowed no visitors. It was the only human contact
he had for 12 years, as his captors were not allowed to speak to
him. For much of his sentence he was kept in a room ``not much
wider or longer than a coffin''.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Xu saw her father after his arrest, she said he
was huddled on the floor of a large room where 20 or so prison
officials sat at a large table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to talk about politics, or the trial,'' she
said. ``And my mother wasn't allowed to touch him. When I was
little I could sit on his lap, but after a while that stopped
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Xu Wenli was released to house arrest after the United
States government demanded his release in exchange for economic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   When her father emerged from the prison, he was a changed man,
physically. ``His hair was white, his teeth were rotted out,'' said
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit, however, remained intact. ``He just started talking
and wouldn't stop,'' his daughter said. ``I had cooked a whole
table of his favorite foods, but he wouldn't stop talking to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu had only a few months with her father after his release from
prison before she was to head to the United States, to attend Bard
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he's against college,'' she said. ``But he understood.
He wants me to have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu hopes to finish school, take a job in graphic design
somewhere in the United States, and continue to support her mother.
But her father's activism has also worn off on her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Chinese government, Xu said that computers
confiscated from her father's house were bought with money she
earned ``by washing dishes and waiting tables. Why are you afraid
of me and my father?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the most coordinated action yet toward
European monetary union, 11 nations simultaneously cut their
interest rates Thursday to a nearly uniform low level.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a month before the nations are to adopt the euro
as a single currency and marked a drastic shift in policy. As
recently as two months ago, European central bankers had adamantly
refused to lower rates because they were intent on establishing the
credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank in
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, citing signs that the global economic slowdown
has begun to chill Europe, the central banks of the 11 euro-zone
nations reduced their benchmark interest rates by at least
three-tenths of a percent. The cuts are intended to help bolster
the European economies by making it cheaper for businesses and
consumers to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, every country in the euro zone except
Italy had reduced its key interest rate to 3.0 percent. Germany's
powerful Bundesbank, which has long been the benchmark for all the
others, cut its basic rate from 3.3 percent. Italy, which has had
some of the highest rates in Europe, dropped to 3.5 percent from 4
percent. The key rates are comparable to the Federal Funds rate in
the United States, the target rate for overnight loans between
banks, which is now 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence is now complete,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, head of
Economic Research at the Frankfurt office of Warburg Dillon Read.
``We have arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most economists had expected the new European Central
Bank to lower interest rates early next year, almost everybody was
surprised when the national central banks settled the issue before
the new bank officially assumed responsibility for European
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after months of bitter and public battles
between Europe's conservative central bankers and the
left-of-center governments that are in power in most countries. The
angriest battles have been in Germany, where Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine has waged a relentless public campaign to persuade the
Bundesbank and the European Central Bank to lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the
Bundesbank, said Thursday that the central bankers had acted in
response to mounting evidence that European growth rates will be
significantly slower next year than they had predicted as recently
as last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic estimation is that there will be a measurable
slowdown, but there won't be a recession,'' he told reporters. But
he adamantly denied accusations that the decision was a response to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deaf to political pressure, but we are not blind to
facts and arguments,'' Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine, preparing to board a plane for the United States,
said quickly on Thursday that he was pleased. ``Over all, I'm
satisfied,'' he said. ``We saw how the crises in Asia were not
without impact. On that basis we welcome this step.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists argued Thursday that the central bankers had
strong reasons for opening the monetary spigots a bit. Even though
Germany reported Thursday that its economic growth accelerated in
the third quarter, government and industry economists have been
lowering their projections for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe's already low inflation rate has declined even
further in the last year. In Germany, where annual inflation has
dropped to seven-tenths of a percent from 1.8 percent so far this
year, many experts say the country is already on the brink of at
least a mild deflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a brave decision,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz,
global economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``There are
many who feared that the extensive criticism from political
policymakers would prevent the European Central Bank from taking
action because they would be worried about being seen as responding
to political pressure.

 FRANKFURT: political pressure. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What this showed is that they realized that they were brave
enough to realize that their credibility is not enhanced by making
bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists across Europe have lowered their predictions for
growth in the euro zone to less than 2.5 percent in 1999 from about
3 percent in 1998. With inflation having all but evaporated,
economists said the central bankers had room to inject extra money
without causing prices to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the last 12 months, inflation has dropped
substantially and interest rates have not,'' Fahrinkrug said. ``The
European Central Bank has demonstrated that it is sensitive to
global woes and that it is ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few experts suspected that politics played at
least an indirect role in the rate cuts. Skeptics noted that
political leaders and central bankers had in some ways been
shadow-boxing around a trade-off between lower interest rates and
adherence to tough-minded budget policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's top economic adviser stunned many economists last
month by publicly arguing that European countries might have to
relax the tough rules governing budget deficits for countries
adopting the euro. Other leaders have suggested that governments
might have no choice but to increase spending if the central bank
refused to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was kind of a poker game between the governments
and the central bankers,'' said Emmanuel Ferry, economist at Credit
Commercial de France in Paris. ``I think there was some very tough
bargaining going on between the governments and the central bankers
and that there was a trade-off between monetary policy and fiscal
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ferry said he was as surprised as everyone else that the
bankers moved as early as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is a big surprise because personally I was
anticipating a cut during the first quarter of next year,'' he
said. ``Our idea was that the first move would be carried out by
the European Central Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the decision announced on Thursday appears to have
been made on Tuesday, when the central bankers from each country
met in Frankfurt for a regular meeting of the governing council of
the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, dropped
strong hints that a rate cut might be imminent after the council
meeting broke up Tuesday evening. But the European Central Bank
does not officially make monetary policy until January because the
power remains with the national central banks until then.
</P>
<P>
   Tietmeyer, on the other hand, could not officially commit the
Bundesbank to a rate cut without bringing the issue to a vote by
his bank's board. As a result, the decision had to wait until
Thursday, when the Bundesbank met for its regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
   World financial markets reacted modestly to the unexpected rate
cuts. The dollar, which has increased significantly against
European currencies in the last several weeks, held steady Thursday
and traded for about 1.67 marks. Ordinarily, a surprise rate cut
across Europe would tend to strengthen the dollar, but traders said
the rate cut was offset by new worries about financial instability
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   European stock exchanges all climbed slightly Thursday, in
contrast to the declines suffered on Wall Street. Germany's DAX
index of leading stocks climbed 2.13 percent, while the French CAC
40 index climbed 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will probably reduce the political pressure on
Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker who has been fixated on
demonstrating his political independence ever since European
political leaders named him president of the new European bank in
May.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duisenberg who remarked just one month ago that it was
``normal'' for politicians to voice their thoughts about monetary
policy but that it would be ``abnormal if those suggestions were
listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the rate cuts were led by Tietmeyer, an undisputed
monetary hardliner who has stared down political leaders time and
again, they will almost certainly provoke less second-guessing than
if they had been pushed through by the still-untested Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a pretty smart move to do it earlier, because
it takes political pressure off the European Central Bank,''
Fahrinkrug said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most profound aspect of the rate cut was what it
said about European monetary union. Under a single currency, every
country becomes subject to the same monetary policy and interest
rates essentially converge at some common level.
</P>
<P>
   That process of convergence has already been under way for a
long time as central banks from Spain to Portugal to France modeled
their policy after that of the Bundesbank. But the convergence
reached its finale Thursday, when countries like Ireland and
Portugal cut their rates by more than a half-point and brought them
even with the low bar set by Germany. The 11 countries launching
the euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France,
Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is now the only country in the euro zone with a base
interest rate that is higher than 3.0 percent. But Italy cut its
rates, too, and is expected to match those of its neighbors before
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for investors and the financial markets is
that Europe is stepping in with this interest rate, which is valid
not just for one day,'' Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and bankers disagreed about whether Europe would have
to lower rates even more in the months ahead. European rates are
already about a full percentage point below the United States
Federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3 percent level could hold for a significantly long
time,'' said Matti Vanhala, governor of the Bank of Finland, at a
news conference in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   But private economists like Ferry at Credit Commercial predicted
that Duisenberg would have to reduce rates to about 2.5 percent by
the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial markets are still nervous,'' said Werner Becker, an
economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. ``The central
banks are beginning to recognize that inflation is no longer a
problem and that deflation might be the bigger problem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   After tornadoes, El Nino rains and an ice storm swept across
large swaths of the nation, Congress enacted an emergency spending
measure in May providing $2.6 billion in natural disaster relief.
Deep inside that bill, though, in a last-minute addition, the oil
industry won a big concession: relief of $66 million from the
amount owed for extracting oil from federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, with Congress wrangling over a huge spending
bill and eager to cut deals and leave town, the oil industry won
again as the House leadership reaffirmed that relief. Indeed, in
the end, Congress even sweetened the deal a bit, by extending the
break a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of Big Oil in Washington, and two of the
biggest players in this monolithic and highly effective industry
lobby are Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. Rich in cash, aggressive in
style, with issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes and the
environment, Exxon and Mobil have been effective in pushing their
agenda through behind-the-scenes contacts at the highest level of
government and through arm-twisting in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have a narrow range of interests to lobby on,''
said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group which tracks Washington lobbying.
``But, by its very nature, oil is so pervasive and it is so
affected by government policy that they care about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With the oil and gas industry generally marching, and lobbying,
in lockstep, it is often hard to separate Exxon and Mobil from
their rivals. While somewhat different in their approaches, both
companies are big supporters of the American Petroleum Institute,
an industry trade association that spent $3.7 million on lobbying
in 1997. They often join industry coalitions created to lobby about
a specific topic _ the lifting of sanctions to oil-producing
nations like Iraq, for example, or the ability of U.S. oil
companies to swap oil with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, Exxon and Mobil have a combined total of 15
full-time lobbyists on their payrolls in Washington, and employ
other Washington lawyers and lobbying firms as well. Last year,
Mobil spent $5.3 million on federal lobbying and Exxon spent $5.2
million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Combined,
this would make them the fifth largest entity in spending on
lobbying the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   As multinational corporations with businesses in far-flung
spots, Exxon and Mobil's interests in Washington touch on many
trade and finance issues. The two companies have won favorable tax
rulings before the IRS and the Treasury Department concerning the
use of foreign tax credits to reduce their U.S. tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   They are sensitive to the State Department's Middle East and
Asian policies, especially since oil is often found in pariah
nations such as Libya, Myanmar and Iran. They are generally
supportive of Arab nations. And new issues, like the proposed
Caspian Sea pipeline route _ a region where Mobil has operations _
have engaged them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably most effective behind the scenes,'' said
Martin Lobel, a Washington lawyer who represents consumer groups
and small oil companies. ``They'll get their economists and lawyers
to see the IRS and the companies will stay relatively hidden.
You've got maybe two Ph.D economists in the entire IRS and Exxon
can hire as many as they want. We were once in a big battle with
Exxon on the issue of oil overcharges and there must have been 30
economists on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rothschild, a senior associate with Podesta Associates, a
Washington lobbying firm, said that the two companies' lobbying on
complicated tax issues had paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of esoteric issues, especially in taxes, but
which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ``There
were efforts by the Clinton administration in the last two budget
bills to reduce the value of the foreign tax credits. But Exxon and
the industry descended and those provisions were quietly
eliminated. I don't know who they talked to, but they got the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Exxon and Mobil are usually allied on industry issues,
each has a different operating style: Exxon is more aloof and
somewhat diffident about how it is perceived; Mobil is quicker to
defend its public image and more willing to enter the political
fray.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's brashness was evident when the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil
spill, one of the worst environmental catastrophes in U.S. history,
became a giant tax break, as the company wrote off all
disaster-related expenses _ including legal bills and cleanup
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil makes practically no campaign contributions, while Exxon
is a leading donor to the Republican party and candidates. In the
1996 presidential election cycle Exxon contributed $593,928,
donating 95 percent to Republicans; in the last congressional
races, Exxon gave $475,855, 84 percent to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This GOP tilt could help the companies in the next Congress: the
three new top House leaders are all Republicans from the ``Oil
Patch'': House Speaker Bob Livingston of Louisiana, Majority Leader
Dick Armey of Texas and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's new
conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Exxon and Mobil opposed the Clinton
administration's efforts to gain Senate approval of the Kyoto
Protocol, an international treaty to curb global warming that had
won support by other oil companies like Royal Dutch/Shell Group and
British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the last Congress, they won significant victories to
halt the Interior and Treasury departments' efforts to get oil
companies to pay more in royalties for oil and gas extracted from
federal lands and pay back some $345.5 million in past royalties
that Interior says is owed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has even filed suit to get collect these
royalties; last August, Mobil spent $56.5 million to settle these
claims. Meanwhile, in Congress, Exxon leads an industry effort to
pay royalties owed to the government in oil rather than in cash _ a
proposal the government strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil companies lobby in a very coordinated way,'' said a
staff member for a House energy-related committee, who spoke on
condition neither neither he not his committee be identified.
``They rely heavily on the American Petroleum Institute, but
they've also got their people. Exxon's lobbyist is very friendly
and outgoing and the company is really involved in the royalty
issue. On a technical point, Exxon's lobbyist will bring in 11
people to talk to you about it. They are incredibly influential.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Russo, an Exxon spokeswoman, said it was too early to tell
how the company's lobbying would be affected by the merger, a view
shared by Donald Turk, a spokesman for Mobil. Mobil does plan to
continue paying for op-ed newspaper ads and for the ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' television series through 1999, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, the companies' lobbying expenses will
undoubtedly rise while the merger faces federal scrutiny: Bell
Atlantic Corp.'s lobbying costs shot up to $15.6 million at the
time of its merger with Nynex, and Boeing Co.'s costs rose to $10
million as it was acquiring McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the specter of a combined Exxon-Mobil juggernaut on the
Potomac scares some. ``They will be so huge and interested in an
incredible number of issues,'' said Charles Lewis, executive
director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit
group. ``They'll come up with new lobbying battlegrounds.''

MORE LIGHT TRUCKS THAN CARS SOLD IN NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Americans bought more sport utility vehicles, pickup
trucks and vans than cars last month, for the first time since a
brief period at the end of World War II, as very low gasoline
prices, low interest rates and a strong economy kept overall auto
sales brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of so-called light trucks reached 50.8 percent of the
market last month, mainly because of a steep climb in sales of
sport utility vehicles. The broad popularity of these vehicles
began in the early 1990s and has accelerated in the last three
years with the introduction of much bigger models like the Ford
Expedition and Dodge Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign automakers sold cars and light trucks last
month at a brisk annual rate of 15.4 million vehicles, up 2.2
percent from a year earlier. Ward's Auto Info Bank, an industry
data service, predicted that this year would be the second-best
ever for sales in the United States, trailing only the 16.0 million
sold in 1986. Plunging gasoline prices and changing tax laws
produced a surge of sales then.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign automakers sold 579,845 light trucks and
562,190 cars last month, according to Ward's. Light trucks
typically account for a slightly higher share of new vehicle sales
in November than in any other month, as Northeast buyers snap up
four-wheel-drive vehicles in preparation for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding commercial purchases, American families bought more
light trucks than cars in November and December of last year. But
November of this year marks the first time since a brief period at
the end of World War II that overall auto sales, including
purchases by rental-car agencies and other commercial fleets, have
included more light trucks than cars. Rental agencies have
historically bought mostly cars.
</P>
<P>
   Light trucks are typically bigger and more powerful than cars,
and millions of Americans are turning to them now that gasoline
prices have fallen so steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Light-truck sales have also increased this year because of
aggressive marketing. For years, demand for sport utility vehicles
and minivans outstripped supply.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, practically every automaker had decided to
design new light-truck models and build new factories for them or
convert car factories. Light-truck production is now surging as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., which has been rapidly expanding production of
full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, announced
Thursday that it sold 1.3 percent more vehicles last month than a
year earlier, as a 7.4 percent jump in its light-truck sales more
than offset an 8.4 percent drop in its dwindling sales of cars.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., which still sells more cars than light
trucks, suffered a 5.6 percent fall in overall sales, as its car
and light-truck sales eroded.
</P>
<P>
   The giant automaker has been short of inventory, partly because
it is switching factories to the production of new full-size
pickup-truck models and partly because of a crippling two-month
strike last summer that left its dealerships almost barren of
popular models even as other automakers' sales were climbing.

RUSSIA MOVES TO AID QUEST FOR ART TAKEN IN HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Great Britain, Israel)  (mk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the close of an international conference on
Holocaust-era assets, Russia surprised the chairman Thursday by
handing over three secret documents that might help Jewish families
recover art confiscated by the Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Valery Kulishov, director of the restitution department at the
Russian culture ministry, gave the papers to the chairman, Under
Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, as a symbol of Russia's new
commitment to contribute to an international database on looted
art.
</P>
<P>
   One document is a September 1942 letter written by a Nazi
cultural aide identified as Dr. Fucke-Michels, to Hans Posse, whom
Hitler chose to procure art for the Nazi leader's museum in Linz,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``Since there is an acute danger that the Jew Gutmann
might flee the country and might bring with him a precious medieval
German manuscript, this manuscript was confiscated in 1938.''
Kulishov said the medieval manuscript, which belonged to Rudolf
Ritter von Gutmann, is now in the Vienna National Library.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian move was one of several unexpected gestures at the
conference, which concluded not only with general agreements to
return Nazi-looted art, settle unpaid insurance claims and open
national archives, but also with the promise that the work to
redress the wrongs of World War II would go on in new meetings next
year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland said it would sponsor a meeting on the Internet next
year about the fight against racism and anti-Semitism. Sweden
invited governments, institutions and educational experts to attend
a conference in Stockholm on Holocaust education and research in
1999 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Poland said it wanted to organize a conference to find ways to
return synagogues, churches, schools and other property confiscated
from religious organizations in World War II. Lord Janner, chairman
of the Holocaust Educational Trust in Britain, suggested that
Austria, which won praise at the conference for a new law enabling
the restitution of art in its state museums, sponsor another
conference on looted art.
</P>
<P>
   And Noach Flug, a Holocaust survivor who is secretary-general of
the World Jewish Restitution Organization, suggested that delegates
meet ``next year, in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat began organizing the conference a year ago after a
meeting in London on the issue of Nazi gold. The major achievement
of the conference was agreement on 11 principles to bring about the
restitution of stolen art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art world will never be the same in the way it deals with
Nazi-confiscated art,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines call on governments, museums and art dealers to
search their art holdings for Nazi plunder, place all the
information in a central database on the Internet and resolve
claims quickly through negotiation, not litigation. The guidelines
are non-binding, but Eizenstat said they carried a ``moral
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian concessions at the conference were the greatest
surpise. Russians have always considered wartime booty to be
partial reparation for the deaths of 20 million Russians in the war
and the damage the country suffered. Moscow recently passed a law
precluding the return of ``trophy art'' that Soviet troops took
from German and Central European museums. The new offer applies
only to individual victims of the Holocaust or their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The two other documents Kulishov released included a list of art
stolen from Austrian Jews and taken to a collection point in Vienna
and an outline of the private collections confiscated from Leo
Furst, Louis Rothschild and Alexander Hauser, all Austrian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The documents alone may not prove ownership, experts here said,
but could bolster ownership claims when added to information from
other archives. The delegates to the conference from 44 countries
and 13 Jewish and gypsy groups agreed to place on the Internet,
with links to related sites, the work of 17 historical commissions
on the Holocaust as well as the proceedings of this year's
conference and one held in 1997. It has not been decided who will
maintain the site, a State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates to the conference expressed disappointments. In
their closing statements, Ukrainian and Russian delegates made
pleas to include their non-Jewish survivors of concentration camps
in the relief fund created a year ago for Jewish survivors.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Borer, the Swiss ambassador for Holocaust issues,
asked Americans to drop their class-action suits against insurance
companies and instead pursue their claims before an international
commission.

HOUSE MUTINEERS WANT 3-DAY WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Livingston has a rebellion on his hands. Not
over impeachment. He is still avoiding that one. No, the
speaker-designate of the House of Representatives has to resolve
something even more weighty than the president's future, a matter
that so deeply affects members of Congress that they have drummed
up a petition.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is this: How many days a week should the House work?
Five, as Livingston has proposed? Or the three to which members
have become accustomed?
</P>
<P>
   While House members have shown few signs of uniting over
anything, least of all the impeachment inquiry, they are finding a
consensus on the workweek issue: Keep it short.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five members, most of them Republicans, have signed a
petition and sent it to Livingston and other House leaders, putting
the matter succinctly: ``Please do not expand the Washington
legislative schedule to five days a week. The present
three-day-a-week calendar gives us ample time to complete our
legislative business and also allows us sufficient time to do
important district-related work.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a refined version of a petition circulated last month
that was considerably more angst-filled _ and drew few signatures).
That one said, ``Meeting in Washington five days a week will return
us to the nonproductive stress and anxiety of 1995,'' a reference
to the first frantic 100 days of the 104th Congress, when the new,
fresh-scrubbed Republican majority was eager to make its mark.
</P>
<P>
   Things slowed after that, and the House drifted down to a sort
of gentleman's club approach in which members gathered Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays. This year they met for the fewest days of
any House in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   This coincided with a chaotic end-of-session budget deal that
required multiple postponements of the start of the fiscal year.
While there was not necessarily a connection between the chaos and
the schedule, Livingston drew one. A more full and orderly
schedule, he said, would mean the work would get done on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have longer workweeks and fewer holidays,'' he
demanded of the current speaker, Newt Gingrich, in a letter written
even before he announced his own candidacy for speaker. Livingston
proposed that the House hold votes as early as noon Monday and as
late as noon Friday. This sent alarms through the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work my tail off 70 hours a week,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston,
R-Ga., explaining his signature on the petition. ``I don't need to
be in Washington with the lobbyists two more days a week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., signed the earlier petition but did
not sign the current one because she was just elected to be part of
the Republican leadership. She said she sympathized with
Livingston, but believed the House could be more efficient without
cutting into members' time at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work six and seven days a week,'' she said. ``People just
don't understand this. When we're home, we're working. I'm giving
three speeches and have a town meeting a day. After my first two
years, I said I wouldn't work on Sundays. I was killing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Corallo, a spokesman, said Livingston was aware of the
concerns and had not yet decided about ``the parameters of the
calendar.'' Ms. Fowler, for one, said Livingston was ``not rigid''
and predicted he would seek some sort of compromise to keep members
happy.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Boeing 747s have a fuel-pump part that can
wear out after a few flights and possibly lead to fuel-tank
explosions, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday. The
agency issued an emergency order to reduce the risk of potentially
explosive sparks from the pumps in a move that will cut the range
of the newest planes by 400 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The order, which requires changes in how fuel is stored in the
tanks of the 747s, came after airlines noticed pump failures and
returned 14 pumps to Boeing. The pumps had a bearing shaped like a
washer, about the size of a half-dollar coin, that was wearing
away, letting metal parts rub against each other. Each 747 uses 10
or 12 of the pumps, and Boeing said it had shipped airlines about
700 suspect bearings either in pumps or as replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency said that the flaw was not the cause of the
explosion on TWA Flight 800 two-and-a-half years ago. The agency
has attributed the explosion to a spark in the center fuel tank,
but the pump bearings found in the wreckage off New York showed no
wear. Still, the order is an example of the greatly increased worry
by inspectors about the safety of fuel systems on the planes, and
the latest in a series of orders covering potential ignition
sources in the planes' fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Erickson, the agency's director of aircraft
certification, said in a telephone interview, ``our concern has
been heightened in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McSweeney, the associate administrator for regulation and
certification, said that the action, which will have more impact on
airline operations than most FAA orders, was indicative of the
agency's effort to cut accidents by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hatch, Boeing's chief engineer for 747s, said that the
accident and the subsequent discovery of a variety of problems in
fuel systems had changed the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being extra conservative here,'' Hatch said. Tests
showed that the fuel pumps would overheat, he said, but the
temperatures were too low to cause a fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is still exploring the biggest proposal to come out
of the TWA crash, which is to switch jets to a fuel less prone to
form explosive vapors.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pumps covered by Thursday's emergency order are at the
bottom of the tanks, and when they are running they are usually
immersed in fuel, which lubricates them and eliminates oxygen, so
there can be no fire or explosion. But it has been standard
procedure to run the pumps to empty the tanks almost completely, at
which point the pumps are running dry, unlubricated and exposed to
fumes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ordering the replacement of suspect bearings, the
agency told airlines to stop using fuel tanks in the horizontal
stabilizers of 747-400s, the newest model. Those tanks in the
horizontal portion of the tail carry 3,300 gallons of fuel. They
are shallow, and, if the plane climbs steeply, the pumps may be
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Another standard procedure is to burn fuel in those tanks before
landing, to prevent the plane's center of gravity from shifting too
far back, but burning all of it means running the pumps dry.
</P>
<P>
   Without the tanks, the planes' range is cut to about 8,000
statute miles, from 8,400 miles. On a long trip, the plane consumes
more than 6 gallons a mile. Airlines could compensate by flying
with fewer passengers or less cargo, or by stopping to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``On long-haul operations in the Pacific,'' Ms. Erickson said,
``they won't be able to do one hop straight through.''
</P>
<P>
   For some airlines, that could mean having to fly with an extra
crew, experts said, because adding a stop could make the workday
longer than agency rules allow. It could also mean some planes
might have to carry more flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines owns 35 of the 747-400s, more than any other
domestic airline, and its routes from Chicago to Hong Kong and from
the West Coast of the United States to the South Pacific, Hong Kong
and Taipei could be affected, said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman.
Engineers at the airline were looking for an inspection system that
would satisfy the FAA and allow continued use of the tank, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Northwest Airlines, Jon Austin, said that the
Detroit-to-Beijing route might be affected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the order Thursday required older 747s without tail
tanks to fly with more fuel in the center tank, which is routinely
pumped dry in flight, and to switch off the pumps with the problem
while thousands of gallons of fuel remain inside. Some of that fuel
can be recovered and used by small ``scavenge pumps,'' but,
especially on shorter trips, the effect will be to require planes
to fly with thousands of extra pounds of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it did not know what the order would cost. There
are 1,087 747s in operation, of which 246 are registered in this
country. &QL;

TV SPORTS: ABC REPLAYS GRUESOME INJURY, WITH WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grisly broken leg suffered by 49ers defensive tackle Bryant
Young in Monday's San Francisco-Giants game is a reminder that 13
years before, Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann's leg was mangled
in a similarly gruesome fashion, also against the Giants, also on
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC handled Young's injury without a voyeuristic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn away, folks, turn away, if you don't want to see this,''
Dan Dierdorf cautioned, as the camera viewed the triage from a
respectful distance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC waited until after a commercial break to show its sole
replay, which showed Young's leg bow grotesquely in slow motion
from the impact of linebacker Ken Norton's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the risk of injury is always there,'' Boomer
Esiason said. ``It's the one thing that nobody wants to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night's'' agreed-upon policy is not to dwell on
sickening injuries, like one suffered on its air several years ago
by Napoleon McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who didn't see it, you have to replay it, but you
warn people about it, then you get out,'' Al Michaels said
Thursday. ``It serves no purpose to go back and redocument it. When
a leg is sticking out at a 40-degree angle, one replay is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The distant perception of Nov. 18, 1985, is that ABC endlessly
reran Lawrence Taylor's sacking Theismann on a failed flea flicker,
and Theismann's leg being caught awkwardly under Taylor's weight,
causing a compound fracture.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury was actually shown on replay only three times,
twice in the immediate aftermath, the final one in the third
quarter, which may have been unnecessary, but did not constitute
overkill. ``If your stomach is weak, you just don't watch,'' Frank
Gifford warned before the second and third replays.
</P>
<P>
   As Theismann was tended to, ABC never showed the gruesomeness of
the bone's protruding from the quarterback's skin. The camera
zoomed in only once, to a close-up of Theismann's face, framed by
teammates and medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But Gifford provided a verbal description of what the camera did
not show. ``There was blood on Joe's right shinbone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, ABC cut from Theismann to Taylor, much as the
network cut to a concerned Norton on Monday night. Gifford said in
1985, ``I have a feeling Lawrence Taylor heard the snap of the bone
in Joe Theismann's leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Young's injury, Theismann felt an awful rush of deja
vu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got chills,'' Theismann, the longtime ESPN analyst, said
yesterday from his Philadelphia hotel room, where he was preparing
for last night's Rams-Eagles game. ``I saw him on the ground and
saw enough. I saw the angle of his leg and I felt a knot in my
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ABC rolled the replay, Theismann walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Robin, said, `Don't look.''' In fact, he said he had
never seen the graphic replay of his broken leg, although it has
been rerun countless times over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen the master shot with me on the ground and all
the other people around me,'' he said. ``But if the replay comes on
TV, I turn my face.''
</P>
<P>
   He retains a vivid memory of virtually everything that happened
after the sack, from conversations on the field with his coach, Joe
Gibbs, and Giants coach Bill Parcells, to watching the end of that
night's game on a small black-and-white hospital television set as
he was being prepared for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can close my eyes and feel it come back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel the pressure coming from the left side and hear the
leg break, like two muzzled gun shots. I don't feel pain. I
remember looking up and telling Harry Carson: `Don't retire. I'm
coming back.' And Harry said, `Not tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Taylor called him in the hospital. ``Lawrence
said, `How're you doing?' and I said, `Well, my leg is broken in
two places.' And Lawrence said, `Well, I never do anything
halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   And 16 days ago, Taylor called Theismann ``to wish me a happy
anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pigskin Delay
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner's detailed announcement of its spring-summer pro
football league, which is scheduled to launch in 2000, will be
delayed from this month until early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planning is going well, but there are lots of things to
work out,'' said Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen one thing that's been an impediment to the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Airwaves
</P>
<P>
   The high decibel level exercised by ABC's Brent Musburger _ as
exhibited last Saturday during the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game _ is proof
that (a) you need only an open window, not a TV set, to hear him
and (b) the games he calls must be more exciting than any other
announcer's because he's louder than them all.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN Classic's look back at the 1971 Nebraska-Oklahoma game
was a gem, an adroit blend of old footage and reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keith Olbermann is to start anchoring the Fox Sports News on
Jan. 5 or 6.

 &HT;    Albright decries slow human rights gains but defends efforts
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright mildly
criticized the Chinese government Thursday, just days after two
prominent dissidents were arrested for trying to form a party to
oppose Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Emory University, Albright said the greatest test
for democracy and human rights in the coming century probably will
occur in China, home to more than 20 percent of the world's
population. And while conceding that the Chinese people have a few
more freedoms than they did a generation ago, Albright said the
United States has ``grave concerns'' about the Communist regime's
continued crackdown on individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' she said, ``the pace of progress toward full
respect for human rights is disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government said Thursday it will continue to block
efforts by dissidents Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin to form the China
Democratic Party. Both activists were arrested Monday on grounds of
endangering national security. A third dissident trying to set up
the political party, Wang Youcai, has been in custody for a month.
</P>
<P>
   On another human rights issue, Albright defended the continued
training of Latin American troops at the U.S. Army's School of the
Americas at Fort Benning, Ga. Critics of the school, which opened
in 1984, contend it teaches torture tactics and other repressive
measures. An estimated 7,000 demonstrators gathered in Columbus a
few weeks ago for a yearly protest that started in 1991 with about
a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a question-answer session with Emory students,
Albright was asked how the United States can operate the Army
school and still claim to adhere to the fundamentals of human
rights. Albright said that while she and many other policymakers
believe that serious mistakes were made in the past, democracy now
flourishes in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has now been in all cases subordinated to
civilian control,'' she said. ``It is important for us to continue
to have relationships with this new military in order to instill in
them _ contrary to what was done previously _ democratic principles
and the ability to work in democratic governments and to be
subordinated to civilian control.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the continuing problems with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein, Albright said U.S. policy aimed at toppling him could take
quite awhile. Saddam has been contained since the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, she said, through tough economic sanctions imposed by the
United Nations. Now, Albright said, the United States is stepping
up pressure with ``containment-plus,'' a policy of supporting those
seeking to overthrow the Iraqi dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that may take a considerable amount of time,'' she
said. ``And the way to make it happen is to work with a variety of
opposition groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright devoted her speech mostly to human rights issues,
touching particularly on the plight of oppressed women. Despite
progress in many countries, she said, appalling abuses continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who suggest that all this is cultural and
there's nothing we can do about it. I say it's criminal and we each
have a responsibility to stop it,'' she said, drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who served on President Jimmy Carter's National
Security Council staff, came to Emory to deliver the university's
Rosalynn Carter Distinguished Lecture in Public Policy and was
introduced by the former first lady.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton appointed Albright ambassador to the United
Nations in 1993, and she made history in January 1997 when she
became the first female U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Being a woman in such a high-powered post has its advantages,
she said. ``If I were a man, you would just see a tired old man.
But thanks to makeup ...

 &HT;    Impeachment focus turns from fund-raising to Lewinsky
relationship
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
abruptly cast aside their inquiry into campaign fund raising
Thursday and are now drafting three articles of impeachment against
President Clinton focused solely on how he concealed his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to forgo further investigation of allegations that
Clinton was involved in campaign fund-raising abuses during the
1996 election clears the way for the committee to vote next week on
whether the president committed perjury, obstructed justice and
abused his presidential powers in the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) told fellow
Republicans in a conference call Thursday morning that secret
Department of Justice memos outlining alleged fund-raising abuses,
reviewed by committee staff members Wednesday, did not warrant
inclusion in articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having received reliable information from Justice Department
sources that the memorandum may be of value to the committee's
impeachment investigators, the committee would have been derelict
in its duty had it failed to examine the document,'' said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde hinted that the campaign finance issue is not over for the
White House, despite not being included in the impeachment inquiry.
``We are far from satisfied that existing campaign finance laws
have not been violated,'' said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute move to examine the Justice Department memos and
the failure to find anything useful in them prompted Democrats to
accuse the committee of conducting a ``partisan goose chase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process looks a little chaotic and disjointed,''
said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a member of the Judiciary
Committee.''It is beginning to look like a partisan committee
looking to impeach the president, but they haven't figured out why
yet. They're looking to dress it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the committee prepares for a historic vote next week over
whether to recommend removing Clinton from office, both sides
intensified pressure on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been calling spontaneously,'' said Randy Tate,
executive director of the Christian Coalition based in Virginia.
Members of the conservative group are calling lawmakers because the
public is frustrated at the way the president responded last week
to 81 questions submitted by Hyde, said Tate.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has delivered ``hundreds of thousands of
petitions'' to Congress calling for the president to be removed
from office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lux, vice president of the liberal People for the
American Way, said conservative religious groups are blanketing
Congress with calls for the ouster of Clinton ``because most of the
public does not want impeachment and they see their dream of
impeaching Bill Clinton slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lux said his group would mount its own grass-roots campaign to
push for a quick end to the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Louisiana Republican Bob Livingston, the GOP
choice for House speaker, told reporters he hopes the matter will
be completed before the 106th Congress convenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Judiciary Committee could complete its work next week,
it would be my expectation that we could have a vote on the
following week,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure continued to mount for a quick solution and it is
escalating tension between moderates and conservatives in the
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) circulated a censure proposal calling
for punishment short of impeaching the president. The proposal
would condemn the way Clinton concealed his relationship with
Lewinsky, impose a financial penalty and require an admission of
guilt, according to King's spokesman, Kevin Fogarty.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats met with House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
(D-Mo.) to craft a way to reach out to wavering Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many Republicans would support a censure
plan. Last week, some moderates estimated that as many as 20
Republicans in the House would vote against impeachment. But that
forecast seemed to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was before the president's answers to the 81 questions,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who is considered a
moderate. ``He was very obstinate and he made it harder for members
to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The daily verbal battle between the White House and the
Judiciary Committee continued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mooney, the committee's general counsel, wrote to White
House lawyers that they could expect questioning from committee
members and staff following their defense of the president next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee does not have some documents the White House
requested in preparation for their defense, Mooney wrote. He noted
in particular that internal Justice Department memos related to
alleged campaign finance abuses are in the possession of the
Department of Justice, not the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other documents the White House sought, he wrote, will be made
available only in the confines of the committee's heavily guarded
document room.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked a terse response from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee's erratic behavior leaves the fundamental focus
of this investigation unclear,'' said Joe Lockhart, the president's
press secretary. ``Their actions have been chaotic, partisan and
irresponsible, fundamentally limiting the president's ability to
present a coherent defense. At this late date, we still don't know
what the committee is charging, or for that matter, who is in
charge.''

A MILESTONE IN SPACE FLIGHT IS POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt
Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission
to start assembling the international space station. Another
attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts is scheduled
for Friday at 3:36 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a
shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled
and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. The uncommon delay
prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although officials
stressed that it was entirely warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to err on the conservative side,'' Ralph Roe, launch
director at the Kennedy Space Center, said at a news conference
after the sudden halt of the countdown just 19 seconds before
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Everything had been going smoothly for a rare nighttime
launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday morning. The weather, forecast
to be iffy, turned out to be fine, and the sky was alight with a
nearly full moon.
</P>
<P>
   But the length of the so-called launching window was, as
planned, unusually short _ only 10 minutes. That brevity was a
result of Endeavour's having to rendezvous with a space-station
part that Russia put into orbit last month.
</P>
<P>
   The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when
the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm.
Controllers studied the data and discovered a momentary pressure
drop on one of the hydraulic systems that control the movements of
the shuttle's engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Officials eventually decided that the pressure drop was
insignificant, and they resolved to press ahead. But by then it was
too late: time had run out for one of the procedures needed to keep
the shuttle's fuel supercold. So the countdown was aborted just 19
seconds from blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   The six astronauts began to emerge from the shuttle an hour
later and ultimately headed for bed to rest up for another attempt
early Friday.

   Four decades after his famous father was elected president of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James P. Hoffa was in a
close race Thursday as a federal monitor began counting ballots in
the election for the presidency of the powerful union.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hoffa's campaign manager has sought to lower
expectations, making it clear that Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer,
would not win a landslide victory over his main challenger, Thomas
Leedham of Portland, Ore., director of the union's warehouse
division.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is hoping to win this year's race after losing narrowly in
his 1996 race against Ron Carey, whose victory was overturned when
a federal election monitor found that his aides had improperly
siphoned more than $700,000 in union money into the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   John Metz of St. Louis, director of the Teamsters' public
employees division, is the third candidate in the race, but he has
not mounted a serious campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said David Lyle, a Hoffa
spokesman. ``We do not anticipate a blowout one way or the other.
Leedham is an incumbent, and he and the other slate have squabbled
over who gets control of the incumbent arsenal, but all their guns
have been pointed at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the federal election monitor, had hired 450
workers to count the 420,000 ballots that have been mailed in,
representing less than 30 percent of the union's 1.4 million
members. The count is being conducted in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday evening, with about 4 percent of votes counted,
union officials said Leedham had 9,306 votes, Hoffa 8,226 and Metz
573.
</P>
<P>
   All those ballots were from the South, which was being counted
first, followed by the East, the central states, the West and
finally Canada. Cherkasky said he hoped the count would be complete
by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the count, Cherkasky said, ``We obviously have a
very, very strict protocol so that we can assure the government and
the Teamsters that every vote is going to be counted and there
isn't going to be any fraud in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carey won in 1996 by 52 percent to 48 percent, many Hoffa
supporters said the previous federal monitor had distorted the
count in Carey's favor. Those charges were never substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Trossman, a Leedham spokesman, said he was encouraged by
the closeness of the count, because Leedham expects to run strongly
in the East and the West. The Hoffa forces expect to do well in the
central states, the stronghold of Hoffa's father.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've started from nowhere, and we've turned this into a horse
race,'' Trossman said. ``Hoffa's been campaigning for four years.
He's spent millions of dollars. He has the most famous name in the
history of American labor. And still this is going to be a close
race. This shows the reform movement is rejuvenated.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham has sought to pick up the somewhat tarnished Carey
mantle, pledging to continue the cleanup that Carey began when he
was first elected in 1991. Hoffa has pledged to reunite a union
that became badly fractured in the Carey years. In his campaign he
has relied largely on the backing of Teamster leaders around the
United States.

 &HT;    Constitutional rewrite would lengthen lawmakers' terms
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A new state Constitution to be proposed today
would give the 31 state senators six-year terms instead of the
current four, a change that would give Texas the longest term of
any state legislature in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The reframers of the Constitution, Sen. Bill Ratliff and Rep.
Rob Junell, who are offering up an almost-total rewrite, say the
150 House members, who now serve two-year terms, should serve four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have two-year terms for House members. Only Alabama,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and North Dakota have four-year
terms. No state has six-year senate terms, though U.S. senators
serve six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ratliff-Junell proposal would would take away as well as
give. Though terms would be longer, lawmakers would, for the first
time in Texas, be subject to term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Senators could serve as long as it took to complete nine regular
legislative sessions, 18 years in most cases. House members could
participate in eight regular sessions, generally 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Ratliff said Thursday, is to let lawmakers spend more
time doing their jobs and less time running for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly for House members, when you run every other year
you spend all your time running for office, it is very hard for
them to do their job if they are constantly having to raise money
and run for office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current Constitution, adopted in 1876 and amended 377 times
since, has long outlived its usefulness, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig McDonald, director of the government watchdog group Texans
for Public Justice, said he's not sure what ill is cured by longer
legislative terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ought to be able to stand before the voters more often,
not less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Smith, Texas director of Public Citizen, another
watchdog group, endorsed the four-year House term concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would reduce dramatically the amount of money members would
have to raise, as well as the time spent campaigning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith opposes lengthening Senate terms and term limits.
</P>
<P>
   The term change is among a list of major overhauls proposed by
Junell and Ratliff, key lawmakers who chair the Legislature's
budget-writing committees.
</P>
<P>
   Untouched, however, would be the Bill of Rights portion that
tops the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rewrite calls for appointment of judges and more of
a cabinet form of government that would put more power in the
governor's office. The land commissioner, agriculture commissioner,
railroad commissioners and State Board of Education, now elected,
would become gubernatorial appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the constitution would require legislative and voter
approval. Junell and Ratliff say winning approval of a new
Constitution is a long shot but a concept that needs to get
rolling.

 When Charity Drives At Work Go Overboard  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  The senior executive in charge of my company's United
Way campaign is putting a lot of pressure on people to contribute _
too much pressure, in my opinion. For instance, he has promised to
give an extra week of paid vacation to any department in which
everyone makes a United Way contribution. This turns the personal
decision about giving into a departmental issue. And it creates an
uncomfortable situation for people like me who prefer to give to
charity directly. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Your senior executive probably has the best of
intentions _ maximizing the number of people who contribute to the
local community.
</P>
<P>
   And many companies offer incentives such as T-shirts to
encourage people to support the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   But I agree with you that this exec is going way overboard by
making an individual's charitable giving a factor in whether his or
her co-workers get an extra week off.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, this kind of heavy-handed pressure does more
harm than good _ creating resentment not only against this
particular manager, but against the company in general and the
whole United Way idea.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do? There are three possible responses, and the one
you should choose depends on your values and specific workplace:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignore the pressure and give to charity exactly the way you
normally would. Three months from now, no one may remember or care
that you were the one United Way holdout who kept them from getting
a week off. In fact, many of your co-workers may share your
resentment at the way the campaign is being run.
</P>
<P>
   _ Express your concerns to the human resources department. The
HR manager may be able to ask this executive to modify the
incentive program while keeping your identity confidential.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give a token amount just to be part of the team. Even a
onetime $5 contribution will push you into the ``contributor''
category _ helping your department reach that 100 percent
participation goal.
</P>
<P>
   You should note that today, people can earmark their United Way
donations for a specific nonprofit group _ even one that's out of
town or not listed in the United Way brochure.
</P>
<P>
   United Way takes an 11 percent cut to cover its processing and
fund-raising costs, so your chosen charities wouldn't net quite as
much as if you wrote them a check yourself. But earmarking your
donation might be a good compromise that would allow you to fund
the groups you want while helping your department win that free
week of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I'm an assistant manager at a 70-person company and
currently am on leave due to a work-related injury. I was surprised
to get a letter from my firm, after being off for just five weeks,
saying that I was expected to pay for my own health insurance. Can
I recover the payments that I've had to make?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: If you've worked for this company for a year and put in
more than 1,250 hours, you're covered by the federal Family and
Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   FMLA entitles workers to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year
if they or a family member have a serious health problem.
</P>
<P>
   More relevant to your case, the law requires employers to
continue providing health coverage to workers while they're on FMLA
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person should not have to pay for those benefits,'' said
Doris Ng, an attorney with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit
group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Give a call to ERA's free advice and counseling line at (800)
839-4372. One of their attorneys will go over the details of your
situation and call the company on your behalf.
</P>
<P>
   If that fails, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department
of Labor or a parallel state agency such as the California
Department of Fair Employment and Housing. But that shouldn't be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear in the law that they're required to keep
providing health benefits for 12 weeks,'' Ng said. ``If the
employer is reasonable, they will refund the money.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: How many days in a row can an employee work before
overtime is required? I work for a health care provider, and my
schedule often has me working Thursday through Sunday of one week,
followed by Monday through Friday the next. That makes a total of
nine days without a break. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Overtime in California isn't based on the number of days
you work _ it's based on the number of hours worked over the course
of a week.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most nonunion employers are required to pay overtime
after you put in 40 hours over a seven-day work week. (A few
employers, like hospitals, don't have to pay overtime unless
workers put in 80 hours over a 14-day period.)
</P>
<P>
   There &LR;  are  &LR; some laws limiting the number of days in a row that
people can be asked to work.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most California employers are required to give
their workers one day off out of seven. But those days off can be
postponed due to business necessity, as long as people receive the
equivalent of one day off out of seven by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, the company clearly is giving you one day off each
week. And unless your hours add up to more than 40 in one work week
(or 80 hours over two weeks in cases like hospitals), you're not
owed any overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? Your schedule may be inconvenient, but it's probably
legal.
</P>

JOHN GLENNS, WITH A BIT LESS ALTITUDE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time a youth-obsessed advertising agency convenes a
focus group to divine how to spend a client's money, maybe Jack
McQuillan should be included. Or Jimmie Troccoli. Or Richard
Handel. These three men have lived a combined 208 years and are
fulfilling shared, long-held fantasies that would tax the
imagination, drive and pocketbooks of many people half their ages.
</P>
<P>
   What unites Messrs. McQuillan, Troccoil and Handel is a love of
flying planes and, at last, the leisure time and the money to
realize their dreams. They are yet another indication that Madison
Avenue's adoration of the 18-to-49 age group, advertising's Holy
Grail, lags well behind the demographic curve in a nation whose
population is inexorably aging.
</P>
<P>
   Americans over 50 control much more wealth than their children
or grandchildren, noted Theodore Roszak in an article in the
October-November issue of Civilization, the magazine of the Library
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, people over 50 account for half the nation's disposable
income, 75 percent of its financial assets and 80 percent of its
savings and loan accounts, wrote Roszak, who is also the author of
``America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of
Nations.'' And Americans over 65 enjoy twice as much discretionary
income as those aged 25 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   McQuillan, 62, a retired New York City detective sergeant from
Staten Island, has dreamed of flying since he was 7 and is taking
lessons to earn a private pilot's license _ despite medical
problems that might have turned someone less determined to
shuffleboard.
</P>
<P>
   Troccoli, 78, a semiretired manufacturers' representative from
West Orange, N.J., became obsessed with flying in 1927, also at age
7, when Charles A. Lindbergh flew nonstop from New York to Paris.
Two years later, Troccoli took his first airplane ride, but it
wasn't until 1965 that he received his pilot's license; he has
since logged more than 3,000 hours in the air.
</P>
<P>
   He is now qualified to fly just about anything with wings and
thinks nothing of renting a Lear jet and ferrying friends to Las
Vegas for a night at the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Handel, 68, lives in Maplewood, N.J., and is retired from his
family's furniture-manufacturing business. Like his friend
Troccoli, he has wanted to fly since childhood. So now he, too, is
working toward a private pilot's license. He calls it his
``unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, McQuillan hung around an airport on Staten Island,
sometimes scraping together $2 for an airplane ride. The airfield
has long since been replaced by the Staten Island Mall, but that
early love of flying stayed with him through a four-year stint in
the Marine Corps and 34 years on the police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just always too busy working, and my money had to go for
raising a family,'' he said. ``But the dream was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream, however, almost ended. A diabetic, McQuillan
developed cataracts in both eyes two years ago. He had successful
eye surgery, but the Federal Aviation Administration prohibited
people with diabetes like his from getting a pilot's license. ``I
was pretty discouraged,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, the FAA changed its rules and allowed
insulin-dependent diabetics to fly, with certain restrictions. ``I
was back in the game,'' he beamed.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, 1997, McQuillan became a student pilot at the
Caldwell Flying Academy at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey
and is looking forward to taking the FAA tests for his pilot's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Troccoli, who quit school after the eighth grade to go to work,
also delayed his flying ambitions until he had enough money. He
owns a single-engine Cessna and flies almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   He holds an air transport commercial pilot's license and is
qualified to fly multi-engine planes and jets, as well as gliders
and seaplanes. He earned his jet rating when he was 72.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not finished. ``I want to get a helicopter rating and
an instructor's license,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Handel started pilot's training two years ago at the Morristown
Municipal Airport in New Jersey, where he met Troccoli. The two
became friends and flying buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started taking lessons, I felt a little strange,''
Handel said. ``Everybody seems to be 25, 28 or 30 years old. I sort
of wished there was someone a little older around. Then I met
Jimmie. I felt a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Handel will soon be able to take his FAA tests, but is in no
hurry. ``I'm trying to be the safest pilot around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why have these three clung to their youthful ambitions across
the decades?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McQuillan put it best: ``You know how everybody has
dreams in which they are flying? Well, flying low and slow in a
small plane is as close as you can come to that in this life.''

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS STEERED BACK TO NARROW FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
Thursday abandoned their effort to add campaign finance issues to
the impeachment inquiry and canceled plans to question the director
of the FBI and a former Justice Department prosecutor about their
investigations into fundraising practices in the 1996 election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the committee chairman _
just two days after the committee issued subpoenas to witnesses on
campaign finance _ cleared the way for the panel to vote on
articles of impeachment next week.
</P>
<P>
   In returning to accusations against President Clinton in the
Monica Lewinsky matter, Hyde told Republicans in a conference call
that no evidence of impeachable offenses was found in a review of
secret memorandums on campaign finance written by the FBI director,
Louis Freeh, or the former prosecutor, Charles La Bella.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials had examined the memos to see why the two
law enforcement officials had argued to Attorney General Janet Reno
that an independent counsel should look into Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde announced that the Judiciary Committee instead would pursue
fundraising questions next year as part of its traditional
oversight role over the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   With the House vote on impeachment moving into its critical
stages, more Republican turmoil surfaced Thursday as some moderates
assembled a proposal to censure Clinton instead of impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   It would condemn Clinton's behavior and require him to admit he
had deceived the American people. It would also require Clinton to
pay a financial penalty of an undisclosed sum, which would require
his consent in order to overcome constitutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Circumventing the House Republican leadership, the group sent
the proposal directly to the White House for scrutiny. The
moderates' stance put them at odds with Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
Majority Whip, who has come out vehemently against censure in
recent television appearances and is fighting to keep such a
proposal off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose is to make sure the president is not allowed
to walk away unpunished,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who was
working on the proposal along with Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del. ``A
vote on impeachment, which we believe will not pass, would be
giving the president a victory he would not deserve,'' King said.
``This is to show that Republicans as the governing party have a
strong resolution condemning the president's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official confirmed that discussions about
the censure proposal were under way with King, who has a good
relationship with the administration. The discussions were the
clearest indication to date that the White House is developing a
back channel to devise an alternative to impeachment that would be
attractive to moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
stressed that the White House was doing more listening than
talking. ``It's more King saying, `here's what we're doing,' more
than anyone here saying, `This is what we want,' '' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   King said about 20 Republicans were backing his proposal,
although he declined to name his supporters. But with Republicans
divided over how to end the White House scandal, those pushing to
impeach the president questioned how many Republicans were really
supporting his plan. ``There is no censure groundswell,'' said one
Republican official promoting impeachment. ``Out of 228
Republicans, 220 don't want censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Democrats and Republicans alike to grab hold
of the impeachment process and wrap it up, Rep. Robert Livingston,
the incoming speaker, raised his profile Thursday and said he would
prefer to see the House finish impeachment proceedings this year.
But he refused to indicate whether he would allow House
consideration of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to make a decision on that,'' Livingston
said, adding that he was waiting to see the recommendations of the
Judiciary Committee. The committee is expected to vote along party
lines late next week to recommend at least one article of
impeachment against the President for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting side by side with Trent Lott, the Senate Majority
Leader, at their joint news conference, Livingston tried in vain to
highlight a broader Republican agenda. ``Is there a question other
than on impeachment that we could maybe ...,'' Lott began to say,
trying to change the subject. He was met with a chorus of No's from
reporters.

PATRIOTS STADIUM DEAL MAY BE BIGGEST GIVEAWAY IN SPORTS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ They are not sure where it will go, what it
will cost or when it will be finished, but leaders of the
Connecticut legislature are moving swiftly to approve a deal that
sports economists think will be the biggest giveaway in the history
of professional sports _ a new stadium for the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since Gov. John G. Rowland stunned the public
and the sports establishment by luring Patriots owner Robert Kraft
to Hartford, the fine print of the deal has prompted a round of
second-guessing by legislators of both major parties who are
alarmed by a price tag that could rise to more than a billion
dollars, and by a host of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single parking space is included in the stadium's budget,
the land at the site where officials hope to put the stadium is
polluted with cancer-causing coal tar, and taxpayers would be
liable for millions of dllars in guarantees each year if luxury
seats go empty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the deal promises to raise instantly the value of
the Patriots by $100 million because of the deal's favorable terms,
while the state's projection of its own profit stands at $3 million
over the 30-year term of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're writing a blank check to the Patriots,'' said state Rep.
J. Wayne Fox, D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. John Thompson, D-Manchester, said he was imploring
his colleagues to reconsider their euphoria. ``The momentum is to
do it as fast as possible, but there are at least six or seven
serious questions, and I think there will be more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And state Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, said Connecticut would be
jeopardizing other programs by taking on such a huge debt for a
stadium. ``People understand you can't keep charging everything in
the hopes that things will remain rosy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the skeptics and opponents remain a small minority. So far,
only about 12 of the state's 186 legislators have indicated that
they would vote against the plan when it comes up Dec. 15. Rowland
said this week that he did not care how rich his state makes the
Patriots and that the deal would be passed by the legislature
easily and in just one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bet the ranch on it,'' he said after a Christmas tour at the
Executive Residence. ``Full speed ahead. Go, Pats!''
</P>
<P>
   How is it that Connecticut, which fancies itself ``the land of
steady habits,'' has gone giddy? The stadium deal would allow
Hartford to begin a long-dreamed-of redevelopment project along the
Connecticut River, giving the city the hope of halting the downtown
decay that began with the exodus of manufacturing jobs in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a major-league team would give Hartford, which has fought
a reputation for dullness ever since Mark Twain arrived in 1868 and
complained about the paucity of cigar stores, a chance to be known
for something besides insurance-company headquarters. No longer
could Bostonians dismiss Hartford as ``the filing cabinet of the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to spend $350 million on a new stadium, which
the Patriots would use rent-free in return for a 10 percent tax on
tickets and an agreement to stay in Hartford for 30 years. Already,
that is an unusually good deal, according to several sports
economists, but then there are the extras: The state would
guarantee up to $17.5 million a year for luxury boxes and club
seats that go unsold, would pay for the team's insurance, would
give the team catering rights for University of Connecticut games
that are played in the stadium and would throw in $15 million for a
practice center elsewhere in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state promised to make any road improvements
necessary so that the stadium could be cleared in one hour or less.
The tentative deal that Rowland and Kraft signed last month also
gives the team any money from advertising signs in the stadium and
``any and all other sources of revenue from or relating to the
stadium that may be developed in the future.'' On top of that the
governor agreed to pick up the tab for major repairs at the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor's aides insist that the deal is ``revenue
neutral,'' Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith
College and one of the nation's leading authorities on stadium
financing, estimates that it will cost Connecticut taxpayers $30
million to $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state's potential liability over the 30 years of the lease
includes $375 million for construction and infrastructure
improvements, $525 million in guarantees for unsold luxury seats
and boxes, and $115 million for a capital-improvement fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could set a record in terms of the richness of the
deal,'' Zimbalist said, pointing to the size of the guarantee for
luxury seats and the fact that it is being paid by the government
instead of by business groups, as is more common.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the St. Louis Rams pay a city commission rent of
$250,000 a year, plus the city received $80 million in fees from
preferential seating licenses. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which
moved into a new stadium this year, pay a city authority more than
$3.5 million each year in rent. The Baltimore Ravens paid the city
$10 million for the right to sell the name of the team's new
stadium (still on the market).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these stadium contracts are sweetheart deals,'' said
Dean Bonham, a consultant in Denver who specializes in valuing
teams, ``but this is a gimmee from beginning to end. If it gets put
together, it will be unquestionably the best deal for any owner in
the NFL and, in all probability, the best deal in professional
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state had promised to have the stadium ready for 2001. But
the company that owns a steam plant situated on the proposed site
is demanding $100 million to move, a figure that is not in the
project's budget. Negotiations seem to be at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Marquardt, president of the plant's owner, CTG Resources
Inc., said the state or the developer would have to pay for the
demolition and replacement of the plant since it would not result
in any growth of his business. But Rowland said, ``We're not paying
the whole freight.''
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, regulators say that a half-dozen environmental
permits and studies will be required because of the extensive
pollution caused . Those studies may make the three-year
construction schedule impossibly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland says he still believes the stadium can be built on time,
but he is now calling that a ``target date.'' And leaders say the
legislation will not specify a location for the stadium, in case
the problems with the proposed site become insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons that the deal has encountered such little
resistance is the widely held belief that it will help jump-start a
long-dreamed-of redevelopment project along the Connecticut River.
The project, Adriaen's Landing, which is to include a convention
center and hotel, is the Hartford's main hope for emerging from the
downtown decay that began with the exodus of manufacturing jobs in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rowland, a Republican, has managed to make the
Democratic leaders unofficial partners in the deal he signed with
Kraft on Nov. 19. Although Rowland negotiated with Kraft in secret
for months, he brought the leaders of the House and Senate, both of
which are controlled by Democrats, into the negotiations four days
before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot have hurt his cause that Senate President Pro Tempore
Kevin Sullivan is from West Hartford, and the House Speaker Thomas
Ritter is from Hartford. After months of conference calls between
the governor's aides and Kraft's lawyers, a new voice joined them
as the final terms were worked out - a lawyer for Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that instead of shooting holes in the governor's
plan, legislative leaders are looking for ways to make the deal
work, no matter how many wrinkles arise. ``I think I sold five
skyboxes this morning,'' Ritter said this week. Legislative leaders
said they are treating the proposed deal like ``a treaty signed by
the governor,'' and will permit their members to make no major
changes.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor's office released the plan's financial details
this week, the haste showed. A state-financed report by the
consulting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick seemed to prove the governor's
claim that the stadium would wind up costing taxpayers no money.
But then the governor's aides acknowledged that the report did not
consider the cost of paying the guarantee on some skyboxes, which
would be necessary under what they billed as their conservative
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   After an occasionally tense meeting with the governor the next
day, Rep. Moira Lyons, D-Stamford, who is the House majority
leader, said she needed more information than was in the report and
asked for ``a breakdown of what the real costs are.'' The
governor's aides said they would get back to her.

OFFICE CHRISTMASES, GRINCH BY GRINCH  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the mail is any guide, Charles Dickens was surely writing
from life when he created Ebenezer Scrooge, who threatened Bob
Cratchit with the loss of his livelihood on Christmas Eve. There
seems to be something about the season that brings out the beast in
many a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Scrooge was the first person to come to A.J. Lawrence's mind
when she recalled a holiday season at a Park Avenue law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresh out of law school, I was very excited about my first
office holiday party,'' she wrote from Manhattan. ``Visions of
sugar plums danced in my head, as well as thoughts of an open bar
and lavish buffet. Anything could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the party, the partners called members of the
staff together for a meeting. ``I assumed the partners wished to
praise each and every one of us for a year's worth of good work,''
Ms. Lawrence wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, the 20 lawyers, 2 paralegals, 10 secretaries
and various support staff were chastised by the managing partner
for failing to give thanks to each and every partner for their
raises. (Ms. Lawrence uses the word ``minuscule'' to describe
them.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, she said, the managing partner berated them for not
providing the partners with gifts. In closing, he informed his
audience that many of them would not be employed by the firm during
the coming year. He then wished one and all a ``Merry Christmas''
and a ``Happy Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   And the party had not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   The site was a little Italian restaurant a few blocks from the
office. When the managing partner saw it, he threw a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is a dump!'' Ms. Lawrence recalled him screaming.
At the end of the considerably muted festivities, he dismissed the
staff member who had chosen the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Ms. Lawrence quit her job just before the holiday
party. The managing partner said she could attend anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She declined.
</P>
<P>
   When Lorraine LaFemina was starting out as a writer, she landed
a job at a small publishing company where the hours were long, the
pay was scant and the employees had to punch in and out on time
cards. But one day, to their surprise, the employees were told that
a holiday party had been scheduled from 1 p.m. until quitting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the hour approached, we anxiously watched as catered food
was brought in from a tony delicatessen: champagne, fancy cutlery,
dim sum, the works,'' Ms. LaFemina wrote. At last, the staff began
to feel appreciated _ until a loudspeaker announcement ordered one
and all to punch out at 1 p.m. before attending the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. LaFemina complained to her supervisor about being
docked a half-day's pay to attend an office party, she received a
quick reply: ``Well, how do you think we're going to pay for all
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaFemina now owns a small publishing company in Eastport,
N.Y. ``I give my writers a nice cash bonus at holiday time,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Christine Bliss, now of Shelton, Conn.,
was working as a payroll manager for a trucking company in New
Jersey, the owners had a holiday tradition: a potluck buffet
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each person brought his or her special dish, the company
contributed a six-foot hero sandwich and we ate happily, laughing
and chatting about the upcoming holidays,'' Ms. Bliss wrote.
``Spirits were high.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she received a summons to the office of the chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bliss said he told her that the company was going to
downsize its office staff immediately and handed her a list of 20
names. Her instructions were to bring the victims, one by one, into
his office, where they would be handed their final paychecks (no
severance), dismissed and escorted to the front door with no chance
to say goodbye to co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bliss set about her work. ``At first no one noticed that
people were gradually disappearing,'' she said. ``For about 20
minutes, the party remained in full swing, but all of a sudden, it
seemed to dawn on everyone that people were vanishing. The word of
what was happening went around fast, and voices gradually died away
until the room was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They terminated more than one-third of the office staff that
day, and I finished the afternoon crying at my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   As the senior labor negotiator for a former employer, Ronald
Rakowski of Bethel, Conn., became known one year as ``the Scrooge
from corporate'' for pressing a contract provision that eliminated
all holidays, including Christmas, at one of its larger plants. The
production shutdown, management had decided, was just too costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my normally supportive and long-suffering family sided
with the workers,'' he wrote, with his wife and children muttering
``something about my next Christmas stocking and coal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day, during a company bargaining committee caucus, we
were distracted from our deliberations by loud chanting coming from
the parking lot. We peered out the windows and were greeted by a
parking lot full of children, ranging from toddlers to teen-agers,
holding placards which read: `Please let Mom and Dad spend
Christmas with us!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearful of a visit from Charles Dickens' Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come, we did.''

WHITE HOUSE FUND-RAISING PRACTICES DROPPED FROM CONSIDERATION IN
IMPEACHMENT PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee backed
away Thursday from plans to examine President Clinton's campaign
fund raising, leaving only sex and perjury allegations at the
center of a likely vote next week on impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans signaled their retreat as incoming Speaker
Bob Livingston repeated his desire for the full House to vote on
articles of impeachment before Christmas _ a timetable reportedly
endorsed overwhelmingly in a survey of GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Judiciary Committee could complete its work next week,
it would be my expectation that we could have a vote on the
following week,'' said Livingston, a Louisiana Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats worked separately on
alternatives to impeachment, resolutions that would rebuke the
president for his admitted affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and efforts to hide the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, conducting only
the third presidential impeachment investigation in the nation's
history, has scheduled hearings next week with the final three days
set aside to debate articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one article is expected to emerge from the 11 possible
offenses outlined by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, whose
report to the committee accused Clinton of perjury, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power in the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday, committee Chairman Henry Hyde
told his GOP colleagues on the panel that White House fund-raising
practices during the 1996 campaign would no longer be considered as
articles of impeachment are drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's decision came after consulting with the panel's
Republican investigator David Schippers who, along with a
Democratic counterpart, was allowed Wednesday to read secret
Justice Department memos alleging fund-raising irregularities by
top Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde told his colleagues the memos contained nothing
usable in their impeachment effort, he issued a statement late
Thursday saying the information gleaned by Schippers would prove
useful in the committee's oversight of the Justice Department. ``We
are far from satisfied that existing campaign finance laws have not
been violated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also notified the White House that the president's lawyers,
who are preparing his defense, do not need to worry about
addressing the fund-raising issue during hearings next week.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Judiciary
Committee's sudden expansion of the investigation on Tuesday and
abrupt contraction on Thursday ``have been chaotic, partisan and
irresponsible, fundamentally limiting the president's ability to
present a coherent defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat on the committee, said
he was not surprised by Hyde's decision to back off the
fund-raising issue. ``I expected it,'' Nadler said. ``It was
obviously just a bone that he was throwing to his extremists in the
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Hyde's decision was late reaching Charles LaBella, a
federal prosecutor who wrote one of the internal Justice Department
memos recommending an independent investigation of President
Clinton's campaign fund-raising role in 1996. LaBella was enroute
from California to Washington to discuss his memo with committee
investigators when he received news of Hyde's decision by pager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're running for the hills,'' LaBella later told
the Associated Press when asked about the Republicans' decision not
to press the fund-raising issue.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Republicans quietly decided against including
Kathleen Willey's complaints about the president in the impeachment
inquiry. Willey has accused Clinton of groping her during a private
meeting at the White House in November 1993. He acknowledged the
meeting but denied any inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Willey also claimed that Democratic financier Nathan Landow, a
Maryland developer, talked to her about not publicly discussing the
encounter. When he was subpoenaed by Starr and by the Judiciary
Committee, he declined to answer questions citing his 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination. Investigating further was ruled
out. ``There's no time to get into it,'' one staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Starr told the committee that he had found no
evidence of impeachable offenses in his investigation of misuse of
FBI files at the White House, the firings at the White House travel
office or, so far, in the failed Arkansas land deal known as
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Livingston has kept a low profile on
impeachment, and on Thursday only discussed it because he was
pressed during a fireside press conference with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott. And then Livingston focused on his desire not to
drag out the inquiry. ``If the Judiciary Committee doesn't conclude
its work next week, it will be pretty certain it would have to be
carried over'' to next year, Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   And like their leader, most House Republicans want to avoid
having the impeachment issue awaiting their return in January. A
telephone survey of 60 of the 228 House Republicans by the staff of
Texas Rep. Tom DeLay, the GOP Whip, found unanimous support for
closing out the inquiry and voting on articles of impeachment by
the end of the year. Likewise, those surveyed were near unanimity
in opposing having to vote on anything but impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want an up-or-down vote on impeachment. They don't want a
half-step, some sort of censure resolution,'' one DeLay aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republican Rep. Paul King of New York said he was one
of 15-20 GOP members willing to support a form of censure. The
House has 435 members _ 228 Republicans, 206 Democrats and one
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Censure ``is the only alternative, because impeachment's not
going to pass,'' said King, who is drafting a resolution that would
rebuke the president, require him to make a statement of contrition
and pay a fine.
</P>
<P>
   King explained that if the only vote by House members is for or
against impeachment and it fails, then the president gets off
without any penalty. ``Congress must go on record saying
(Clinton's) conduct is wrong,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several days, committee Democrats have worked
privately on their own censure resolution condemning the
president's behavior but with no other penalties. While Democrats
plan to offer their version as a substitute for articles of
impeachment during Judiciary Committee hearings next week, Hyde has
indicated he would rule any Democratic alternatives to impeachment
``out of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic censure-drafters _ including Houston Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, Massachusetts Rep. William Delahunt and Virginia Rep.
Rick Boucher _ met behind closed doors with House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt. In addition to discussing whether one or several
alternatives should be offered, Democratic staff sources said, the
group began outlining how to win support from Republicans not on
the Judiciary Committee once the issue emerges from the committee
for consideration by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston would not say Thursday if he would allow a vote
on the House floor to censure Clinton. ``I'm just not going to make
a decision on that,'' Livingston said. ``I'm not going to make any
decisions about procedure until we see the report, have a chance to
digest it, and understand exactly what Henry Hyde and the Judiciary
Committee are recommending.'' &QL;

MEXICAN RESTAURANT CHAIN TURNS ITS TORTILLAS OVER TO NEW OWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Looking to make an already rapid expansion
(ITAL)mas grande(END ITAL), the parent company of Baja Fresh has
sold a controlling interest in the restaurant chain to an investors
group.
</P>
<P>
   The new majority owner of suburban Westlake Village-based Fresh
Enterprises is headed by restaurant industry veterans Greg
Dollarhyde and Pete Siracusa, who both worked for the Rusty Pelican
chain. Carelton Partners of Connecticut also holds a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Siracusa, founder of the Rusty Pelican, will be Baja Fresh
chairman, and Dollarhyde becomes its president and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarhyde said Baja Fresh founder Jim Magglos will have a seat
on the company's board, hold a ``significant minority stake'' in
the company and help with the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Magglos, the former owner of a vehicle window tinting and detail
shop, opened his first Baja Fresh on Kimber Drive in nearby Newbury
Park in 1990 with a $30,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I always wanted to do, and I loved Mexican
food,'' he said. ``So I came up with a concept of serving freshly
prepared Mexican food in a clean and bright environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a hit. Soon customers from Westlake Village and
nearby Camarillo were jamming into the little restaurant, so
Magglos expanded his chain even as the region was sinking into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sit-down, quality food at fast-food prices,'' he said,
``so the recession didn't hurt us. It actually helped.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1991, he opened a second store in Westlake Village. The
chain has grown to 50 restaurants with about 1,000 employees in
Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. Twelve are company-owned,
and 38 are franchised.
</P>
<P>
   Magglos said he is happy with his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about the transition,'' he said. ``I'll be
there to do what I like to do best, which is new product
development. I have no remorse, not at all.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I used to think that opinion columnists, those natural-born
curmudgeons, were the loneliest souls at newspapers. I now believe
that editorial cartoonists are the ultimate outsiders. They are the
most misunderstood of all journalists because their craft _
alternately making us laugh, curse and think _ is finicky and
strange to us.
 &HT;    Unlike columnists, who have the luxury of using logically
arranged words, metaphor, simile, dialogue and other literary
devices to make their point, editorial cartoonists rely on simple
drawings and a handful of words _ or no words _ to make their
statements.
 &HT;    While the column is more or less discursive, the editorial
cartoon never is. The cartoonist's message, if it hits the mark, is
delivered wittily. It is a rapier cutting into the conscience, a
lethal harpoon piercing the psyche. Therein, of course, lies the
mystery of the craft, the very reason that so many readers
misinterpret the meaning of editorial cartoons.
 &HT;    And when their work is misinterpreted, many cartoonists wonder
if they and their readers are on the same planet.
 &HT;    Take my colleague and pal Don Addis here at my newspaper, who is
regularly misinterpreted, drawing the wrath of readers. One of his
recent cartoons, for example, brought a surprising number of
hateful complaints from blacks.
 &HT;    It is a one-panel sketch of a highway patrolman stealthily
parked alongside a road as he monitors traffic. Three signs mark
the opposite side of the road, alerting the reader to a gross
racial injustice that occurs each day on American highways.
 &HT;    The first sign reads, ``All Traffic Must Stop For School
Buses;'' the second, ``Right Lane Must Turn Right;'' the third,
``All Black Male Drivers Must Be Up to Something.''
 &HT;    Obviously, the message of the last sign is different from that
of the other two, and any right-thinking person should know that
the cartoonist is trying to make an important moral statement. Why
else is the message in question shockingly different?
 &HT;    Don, who is white and a member of the Times' editorial board,
drew the cartoon to protest law enforcement's practice of stopping
black male drivers far more frequently than they do drivers of
other racial or ethnic groups. A veteran black U.S. congressman
calls this infraction DWB: driving while black.
 &HT;    Don openly condemns all acts of racism. Two days before the
cartoon was published, the board had discussed law enforcement's
opposition to a proposed congressional bill that would have
required officers to collect racial and ethnic data on people
during traffic stops. Don told us that he was going to satirize
cops for their unjust treatment of black males.
 &HT;    Critics of the cartoon should have informed themselves and
should have been aware of the DWB issue and should have understood
that the cartoonist empathizes with black males.
 &HT;    Don's only sin was employing satire, the cartoonist's sharpest
knife. Unfortunately, satire _ the art of diminishing an object by
making it ridiculous and the butt of amusement, contempt, indignity
or scorn _ apparently escapes the intellectual reach of many of
today's readers.
 &HT;    ``It's disheartening to realize there are so many readers who
can miss the point so totally,'' Don said. ``They view the drawing
through their own agenda-colored glasses and read into it _ imagine
into it _ what they want or expect to find. There are those
sourpusses out there whose only joy in life is finding something to
be offended by, especially now, under the crush of political
correctness. Other cartoonists also will tell you it's harder to do
humor nowadays.
 &HT;    ``In the case of this particular cartoon, I had angry calls from
African-Americans accusing me of racism. Other African-Americans
praised the cartoon and thanked me for it. That shows it's not just
my fault for failing to present the idea clearly. Some people do
get it. There are those who never will grasp the subtleties of
satire or irony or the different levels of humor. No amount of
explanation will ever get through to them. These are people we
politely refer to as `unsophisticated.'''
 &HT;    Don, like his colleagues, such as Mike Peters, Pat Oliphant,
Mike Luckovich and Garry Trudeau, rarely unloads a cheap shot. His
best work offers painful but useful insights into the human
condition. The reader can feel his righteous anger. He never kicks
a man while he is down. He champions the rights of the underdog and
the less fortunate. And, like most good editorial cartoonists, he
routinely pokes us in the eye.
 &HT;    Why so much misinterpretation of his work and that of other
editorial cartoonists nationwide?
 &HT;    I agree with Don that PC prevents understanding, and I believe
also that many readers are too obsessed with ethnicity, gender and
religion to appreciate the ancient art of satire. They fail to see
that, unlike the comic, which evokes laughter for its own sake,
satire derides, using laughter to lampoon an object existing
outside the work itself.
 &HT;    In Don's DWB cartoon, institutionalized racism in law
enforcement is under attack. We do not see a cop actually stopping
a black male. But the sign _ ``All Black Male Drivers Must Be Up To
Something'' _ takes its ugly resonance from the real world outside
the drawing.
 &HT;    Do we laugh? Yes, but uneasily. We look at ourselves,
questioning our own attitudes toward black males. Don's wit has
disarmed us.
 &HT;    For African-Americans and other minorities, misinterpreting such
editorial cartoons can have serious consequences. ``It's
discouraging to find some folks can be so combative that they even
attack their own allies,'' Don said. ``They're so quick to take
offense, they don't even know I'm on teir side.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT 
 &HT;    (Chuck Colbert is a founder of the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of
Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors
of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gay voters made up 4 percent of the 1998 mid-term electorate,
according to exit polling conducted by Voter News Service (VNS).
That's a piece of post election analysis largely ignored by the
mainstream media, although only African Americans (10 percent) and
Latinos (5 percent) exceeded the numbers of gay voters this year,
VNS found.
 &HT;    But the 4 percent turn out was not lost on the leadership of the
Democratic Party, which for the most part benefited from the gay
vote. In California, for example, where the Democrats routed the
GOP, 73 percent of lesbian and gay voters supported gay-friendly
Gray Davis for governor, while 68 percent supported Sen. Barbara
Boxer's re-election.
 &HT;    Likewise, in New York, 77 percent of the gay voters supported
Democrat Rep. Charles Schumer in his upset victory over incumbent
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, who, contraversially, had been
endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's largest
gay and lesbian political organization.
 &HT;    The Democratic Party also made history in Wisconsin, with the
election of Tammy Baldwin as the first openly lesbian member of
Congress.
 &HT;    ``These results remind us of what we already knew,'' said
Democratic National Committee Chair Steve Grossman. ``Gay men and
lesbians are a very powerful voting block and grassroots organizing
force. When Democratic candidates are actively involved in the
struggles of their constituents and committed to the Democratic
platform of equality and non-discrimination for gays and lesbians,
community members lend their support and their votes,'' he said.
 &HT;    The Democrats picked up five additional House seats, bucking a
post World War II trend of the party in control of the White House
losing an average of 27 House seats and four Senate seats. The
composition of the Senate remains the same after the election.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the gay National Log Cabin Republicans were quick
to point out that one-third of the gay vote _ about one million
votes _ supported GOP House candidates, according to VNS.
 &HT;    ``These polling numbers solidify the growing body of evidence
each year that the gay vote is more in play between the parties
than widely believed and that gays should not be written off by the
GOP,'' said Richard Tafel executive director of Log Cabin
Republicans.
 &HT;    But gay voters had good reason to vote Democratic this year.
Last summer the Republican controlled House of Representatives
succeeded in passing four out of five anti-gay amendments, covering
everything from banning adoptions by gay couples in the District of
Columbia and restricting local and federal funds there for needle
exchange programs that prevent the spread of HIV; to denying
federal housing money to the city of San Francisco for its liberal,
one-of-a kind domestic partnership ordinance; to cutting federal
housing money for people living with AIDS.
 &HT;    Not only did the Republicans assault gay and lesbian Americans
in Congress, but also the Christian Right, closely allied with the
GOP leadership, launched a national ad campaign characterizing gays
as unrepentant sinners, suffering from a mental illness.
 &HT;    ``We've been through one of the most vitriolic and hostile years
in recent memory for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered
people,'' said Kerry Lobel of the National Lesbian and Gay Task
Force.
 &HT;    Still, ``American voters rejected the mean-spirited, anti-gay
positions that have been expressed throughout this election season,
and registered their dissatisfaction at the polls,'' said Elizabeth
Birch, HRC's executive director.
 &HT;    By way of comparison, 90 percent of HRC's endorsed candidates
and 75 percent of Log Cabin-endorsed candidates won their races
compared to only 46 percent of candidates backed by Gary Bauer's
far-right Campaign for Working Families, according to HRC and Log
Cabin.
 &HT;    Before the election John Rowland, the Republican governor of
Connecticut, told The New York Times that ``our party doesn't get
it at the national level. Beating up on gays _ all that stuff. That
turns my stomach. We're never gong to win the White House again
unless we have an ability to reach out to people.''
 &HT;    Tafel of Log Cabin was equally as blunt after the election:
``All these religious right candidates running for president in
2000 _ John Ashcroft, Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle, and Bob
Smith _ shouldn't bother packing their bags for New Hampshire. If
the religious right continues to dominate the party in 2000, we
will not only lose the White House yet again, we will probably lose
the Congress.''
 &HT;    With Newt Gingrich gone as Speaker of the House and new
Republican leadership on the horizon, it remains to be seen if the
GOP has learned its lesson _ gay bashing just doesn't work.

the religious right continues to dominate the party in 2000, we
will not only lose the White House yet again, we will probably lose
the Congress.''
 &HT;    With Newt Gingrich gone as Speaker of the House and new
Republican leadership on the horizon, it remains to be seen if the
GOP has learned its lesson _ gay bashing just doesn't work.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Movies, perhaps America's greatest cultural asset and
contribution to the world, have long served as a means of
propaganda, information and entertainment. But they also serve as
incisive statements of philosophy, fact and dangerous propositions
to be discussed, debated and portrayed.
 &HT;    Strong movie statements can move populations and their leaders
into and out of turbulent issues like no other medium. When
properly portrayed, for example, American political issues have
been decided one way or the other by how they were played in movies
or on television.
 &HT;    Such is the case of the latest movies, ``The Siege'' and ``Enemy
of the State.'' These two movies are important, to be viewed by
anyone concerned about the continuing encroachment on the rights
guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution.
 &HT;    Take, for example, the use of American troops to police
Americans as was seen in the movie, ``The Seige.'' This is
outlawed, and for good reason. The ability to search for suspects
or contraband in door-to-door searches is illegal because it is
unconstitutional.
 &HT;    Broad, warrantless searches violate the 4th Amendment of the
Constitution that states, ``The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to be searched and the
persons or things to be seized.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Americans have little knowledge of the 4th
Amendment. It takes movies like ``The Seige'' and ``Enemy of the
State'' to awaken American citizens.
 &HT;    There are people like Ross Perot, for example, who have called
for broad, warrantless searches of Dallas Black and Mexican
neighborhoods encircled by National Guard troops, all in an effort
to locate guns and drugs. Perot denied he took such a position, but
eyewitnesses confirmed he did.
 &HT;    Taking similar positions that parallel Army troops rounding up
Arab-origin men in ``The Siege'' are people calling for exactly
such searches in California to root out illegal aliens from Mexico.
No mention is made of the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions,
of illegal aliens from Canada.
 &HT;    No, only those with brown skin are targeted for broad,
warrantless searches and seizures. Of course, illegals wouldn't be
the only ones targeted for the unconstitutional searches and
seizures. Legal citizens, too, would be violated not because they
are illegal, but because their skin is the same color as mine,
brown.
 &HT;    The setting up of concentration camps for Japanese Americans
during World War II by hysterical army generals and President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt provide us with a glimpse at what might
happen if the hysterical extremists among us today were to have
their way with mass searches, road blocks, sweeps and arrests _ all
in an effort to save America's ``sovereignty'' from bedraggled farm
workers and busboys who total, by the way, less than 2 percent of
America.
 &HT;    But you don't have to go to these two movies to have the hair on
your neck raised. Travel north or west of San Diego and you'll
encounter roadblocks manned by the Border Patrol searching cars of
American citizens, willy nilly, without warrants, looking for
``drugs'' and ``illegal aliens.''
 &HT;    Life imitates art. The Constitution is trashed by men in green
uniforms, wearing federal badges and carrying big guns.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, there are no Denzel Washingtons, Will Smiths or
Gene Hackmans to protect us, just congressmen, some of whom bounce
checks, take dirty campaign money and lie through their teeth when
they run for reelection and have never read or understood the 4th
Amendment.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    With Christmas around the next chimney, I have enough to worry
about without inventing more.
 &HT;    Yet, at 55, I fret over ``grandchildren.''
 &HT;    When will I meet them?
 &HT;    Both my 30-year-old son and my 27-year-old daughter are
unmarried. Neither hears wedding bells in the near future.
 &HT;    So, for now, I'm able to share my wish.
 &HT;    If they had spouses, I couldn't even address the issue. I'd be
considered _ and rightly so _ a meddling mother-in-law.
 &HT;    I am blessed, of course, to have two children, but I yearn for
grandchildren _ and have for some time.
 &HT;    Five years ago or maybe 10, I recall, I was up in the attic with
my son and daughter. They were horsing around, pulling some of
their childhood toys from a box.
 &HT;    ``Be careful,'' l admonished them in a tone that surprised even
me. ``I'm saving those for my grandchildren.''
 &HT;    They were taken aback at my siding with someone other than them.
 &HT;    Until that moment, I wasn't aware that I'd been thinking about
grandchildren. Yet, on a deeper, subconscious level, I must have
been. Why else would I have intervened, protecting their interests
instinctively?
 &HT;    Poised at evening's threshold, I knew I'd grown old.
 &HT;    How many more Thanksgivings will pass without highchairs? We
can't choose to have grandchildren as we once did children.
 &HT;    Would-be grandparents simply have to wait and wait, all the
while realizing that we, too, have biological clocks that are
winding down.
 &HT;    I would have been a better grandmother at age 48 or 52 than I
would make today or in a few years. Not only do I tire more easily,
but each passing year puts that much more distance between me and a
grandchild.
 &HT;    What was most difficult about a recent move from the home where
our family had lived for 13 years was packing items from the attic
_ those leftovers I'd often pictured in the hands of a future
granddaughter and grandson: my children's books and toys, some of
their clothes and costumes. Up there, too, were a dollhouse, a
small table and chairs, a little fort, even an old saddle from my
husband's childhood. The sum of it all? A grandmother's hope chest.
 &HT;    More than once, I envisioned myself playing with my children's
offspring in the attic. Now the playthings are buried deep inside a
storage locker.
 &HT;    Even with no grandchildren on the horizon, I find myself losing
sleep over the thought of them. Will I be ready to drop everything
at a moment's notice and help? Or will I see my grandchildren only
during the holidays and on vacations?
 &HT;    We think we make those choices once and for all with our own
children. Little do we realize we'll confront them again a
generation later.
 &HT;    While waiting, at least, I get to observe those who've gone
before _ and learn from them.
 &HT;    I know that my children are hoping to find the right partners. I
also understand that people today are marrying later than they did
before.
 &HT;    Still, others keep telling me they are experiencing one of the
greatest joys in life.
 &HT;    ``We're so sorry you don't have grandchildren,'' they say. ``We
wish you did so you'd know the happiness we feel.''
 &HT;    I wish I did, too.
 &HT;    At this rate, I probably won't meet my great-grandchildren; but,
hopefully, I'll see a grandchild or two come into the world, before
I go the other way out.
 &HT;    Now that will be a time to give thanks for.

 &HT;    What was most difficult about a recent move from the home where
our family had lived for 13 years was packing items from the attic
_ those leftovers I'd often pictured in the hands of a future
granddaughter and grandson: my children's books and toys, some of
their clothes and costumes. Up there, too, were a dollhouse, a
small table and chairs, a little fort, even an old saddle from my
husband's childhood. The sum of it all? A grandmother's hope chest.
 &HT;    More than once, I envisioned myself playing with my children's
offspring in the attic. Now the playthings are buried deep inside a
storage locker.
 &HT;    Even with no grandchildren on the horizon, I find myself losing
sleep over the thought of them. Will I be ready to drop everything
at a moment's notice and help? Or will I see my grandchildren only
during the holidays and on vacations?
 &HT;    We think we make those choices once and for all with our own
children. Little do we realize we'll confront them again a
generation later.
 &HT;    While waiting, at least, I get to observe those who've gone
before _ and learn from them.
 &HT;    I know that my children are hoping to find the right partners. I
also understand that people today are marrying later than they did
before.
 &HT;    Still, others keep telling me they are experiencing one of the
greatest joys in life.
 &HT;    ``We're so sorry you don't have grandchildren,'' they say. ``We
wish you did so you'd know the happiness we feel.''
 &HT;    I wish I did, too.
 &HT;    At this rate, I probably won't meet my great-grandchildren; but,
hopefully, I'll see a grandchild or two come into the world, before
I go the other way out.
 &HT;    Now that will be a time to give thanks for.

BRANDY TUZON, KAREN LAM and HUGH SON 
 c. 1998 A. Magazine: Inside Asian America 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Whether it's a cutting-edge internet company or an organization
that provides urgently needed programs to an underserved community,
realizing a personal vision means taking risks, raising money,
managing allies, and keeping the faith in the face of sometimes
heartbreaking obstacles. Here are 10 individuals who redefine what
it means to be young, Asian American, and on their own.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DANNY SEO, 21, Executive Director, Earth 2000, Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    Danny Seo, award-winning activist and author, doesn't celebrate
April 22 just because it's his birthday. It's also Earth Day _ a
coincidence, but a fitting one for Seo who, at the age of 12,
founded the environmental organization Earth 2000 (now 20,000
members strong). The goal: to reverse the impact of environmental
destruction by the end of the millennium. Although his first
project, an attempt to save 66 acres of forest from developers in
his native Pennsylvania, ended in failure, he didn't let that
discourage him. His organization has since organized anti-whaling
protests, headed campaigns against companies selling fur, and
helped to construct homes for Habitat for Humanity.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of Seo's campaign for promoting Earth-friendly
lifestyles is his upcoming book ``Free, Green, &AMP; Beyond: A Guide to
Cruelty-Free, Ecologically Sound Living,'' which is being launched
Earth Day '99 and which he describes as ``Greenpeace meets Martha
Stewart.''
 &HT;    While Seo's good deeds have gotten much media mention, his Asian
background hasn't. ``I don't live up to their stereotypes,'' he
says. But he doesn't shy away from the question _ he's been known
to introduce himself at conferences by saying, ``In case you don't
know who I am, I'm the other Asian activist.''
 &HT;    Seo's recipe for success? First, he says, always innovate rather
than imitate. ``If you find someone who inspires you, great. But
don't try to be that person.'' Secondly, always keep the faith:
``There will be moments when everybody thinks you're wrong. But if
you stick with it and believe in yourself, the outcome is usually
in your favor.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CECILIA PAGKALINAWAN, 29, President, Boutique Y3K, New York.
 &HT;    ``Retailing is the third oldest profession in the world,''
Cecilia Pagkalinawan explains. ``Since merchants began selling on
the street, it hasn't changed too much.''
 &HT;    But this scion of Silicon Alley has joined the fray to reinvent
retail _ on the Net. Less than a year old, her company, Boutique
Y3K, is helping companies like Nine West hock their wares online.
The 7-employee operation also creates and operates online shopping
boutiques for high-traffic Web sites like hipper-than-thou teen
site Bolt and smut page for the literary set, Nerve. ``We've gone
from being considered geeks to being considered cool,'' she jokes.
 &HT;    Dabbling in America Online while at a prestigious ad agency six
years ago, ``I immediately saw the Internet as an alternate medium
(for advertising),'' she says. That led her to take a job creating
one of the first online malls, ``marketplaceMCI,'' for clients like
Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, and Champs. At her next stop, the
financiers presented her with a unique opportunity _ by pulling
out. So at the age of 28, she bought out the owners and set up
shop.
 &HT;    ``We just changed the sign on the door,'' she says.
 &HT;    Y3K is estimated to clock revenues of $1.5 million by the end of
its first year. But Pagkalinawan's passions go beyond profit. Last
year, she co-founded MOUSE (Making Opportunities for Upgrading
Schools and Education). The non-profit's 500 volunteers work to
wire up resource-strapped public high schools, thus helping to
bridge the tech gap between New York's young haves and have-nots.
``To expose the kids to technology, so that it wouldn't be a
mystery to them when they go to the workforce, is to make the
difference between the employable and the unemployable in the
future,'' says Pagkalinawan.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I look at these kids and see all this potential and
hope. To reach out and affect those kids, to allow those kids to
think that it is all doable, that is very impactful.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SABEER BHATIA, 29, CEO, Hotmail, Sunnyvale, Calif.
 &HT;    What took online giant America Online six years to do only took
14 months for Hotmail co-founders Sabeer Bhatia and Rex Smith. With
a startup investment of $300,000, they've lured over 22 million
subscribers (and an additionall 100,000 daily) to Hotmail, one of
the Net's first free E-mail service providers and now the largest.
Unlike other providers who require special software, all Hotmail
users need is a browser and an Internet connection, while
advertisers pay for coveted space targeting specific demographics.
Sweet, simple-and lucrative.
 &HT;    It was only a matter of time before acquiring minds came
knocking. On the verge of Hotmail's IPO last December, Microsoft
head Billl Gates arrived with check in hand, snapping up the
company for a cool, estimated $400 million. Bhatia has remained on
board as CEO of Hotmail, now a wholly owned subsidiary of
Microsoft.
 &HT;    Not bad for a guy who once had doubts about striking out on his
own. The Bengalore-born Indian American dropped out of the Birla
Institute of Technology after landing a scholarship at Caltech in
1988. After getting his master's degree in electrical engineering
and PhD at Stanford, he went on to take a job as a system
integrator at Apple Computers. ``I was scared,'' Bhatia told India
Today. ``All around me young people were taking big risks and
joining start-up firms. I just couldn't sit there and not get
involved.''
 &HT;    It's fitting that Bhatia and Smith launched Hotmail on
Independence Day 1996. Freed from the confines of a dreary job at
yet another techie corporate giant, they haven't looked back since.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANDY DALAL, 22, Designer, Sandy Dalal, New York.
 &HT;    In the realm of menswear, Nautica's David Chu was for years the
lone Asian American designer of note _ until Sandy Dalal came
along. Last year, Dalal held the menswear establishment in thrall
with a debut collection that was youthful, immaculately tailored,
forward-thinking and yet inspired by the rich aesthetics of his
Indian heritage. This year, he became the youngest designer ever to
win the CFDA award _ fashion's equivalent of the Oscar. Now, his
clothes are a hot item with style-conscious shoppers at Barneys,
Saks, and specialty stores around the country.
 &HT;    Ironically, Dalal saw the volatile fashion industry as a
professional safety net. ``I wasn't really that good a student,''
he confesses. He raised investment from family and close friends
(he estimates that so far, his company has spent around 1.4 million
dollars in launch capital.) But Dad, a CPA, and Mom, a garment
production consultant, also contributed a work ethic. ``People who
work for you, give them infinite respect,'' Dalal says,
``especially when working from the ground up.''
 &HT;    This year, Dalal expects to generate a million dollars in sales
_ but getting to that level has required enormous sacrifice. While
still a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, he commuted
weekly between classes in Philadelphia and his fledgling operations
in New York, ultimately suspending his studies. ``If I had it to do
again, I would have done all four years together,'' he admits.
Today time management continues to be an issue (``Do I get enough
sleep? No way!''), but Dalal has his eyes on the long haul.
``Things work themselves out over time,'' he says, adding that all
labor should be for love _ if not, then ``it's not worth your
time.''
 &HT;    NOEL LAXAMANA, 28
 &HT;    ELVIN REYES, 27
 &HT;    KORMAN ROQUE, 29
 &HT;    Founders, Classified Records, San Francisco.
 &HT;    As artists, producers, and consumers, Asian Americans are the
``Area 51'' of the music industry: It is known they exist, but
rarely are they spotted on the front lines. The founders of
Classified Records are changing all that. When the three (plus
co-founder Rino Que who now has limited involvement) got the idea
to start a record label to promote the Bay Area's rich Filipino
American music talent, they used their existing music studio and
put together more than $20,000 in start up money. All they needed
was a radio-ready artist.
 &HT;    Six months later, they fell on urban vocalist Jocelyn Enriquez.
Her hit single ``I've Been Thinking About You,'' caught the
attention of record companies and radio stations across the
country. By 1997 Classified entered a joint venture with Tommy Boy
to produce her second album, a single from which, ``A Little Bit of
Ecstasy,'' topped Billboard's Hot Dance charts for six weeks.
 &HT;    But Classified says it's not beholden only to dance music or,
for that matter, Asian American musicians. ``We are doing dance
music, R&AMP;B, and alternative,'' says Roque. And along with Filipino
American artists like Julie Plug, Drop N' Harmony, Pinay,
Classified has added names like Latino artist M:G.
 &HT;    Roque likens the future road of Classified to the one traveled
by the legendary Motown Records, which consolidated a community's
talent and resources to turn musical unknowns into household names.
He envisions Classified doing the same: propelling Asian American
artists out of the backwaters of pop music and into the mainstream.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DINEH MOJAHER, 25, CEO and President, Hard Candy, Inc. Beverly
Hills, Calif.
 &HT;    Ever hear of nail polish with attitude? Meet Dineh Mojaher, who
founded Hard Candy, the hottest new name in cosmetics, out of her
parents' Beverly Hills home. Now a fave among the young and the
style-conscious, Hard Candy started three years ago when Mojaher, a
second semester senior at the University of Southern California,
found herself in a fashion emergency _ baby-blue heels and no
matching nail polish. In a pinch, she mixed different nail polishes
until she got the color she wanted.
 &HT;    Today, Hard Candy offers more than 35 colors of nail polish _
with funky names like ``trailer trash'' and ``pimp'' _ as well as a
full spectrum of cosmetics. Mojaher admits that the road to posting
$10 million dollars in annual sales is not without its pitfalls.
``My mistakes happened to be being naive, hiring out of
desperation, and out of need, which you can't avoid in business,''
says Mojaher. ``My best advice for entrepreneurs is to learn from
your mistakes, surround yourself with the right team, and try to be
straight-forward with yourself and go with your gut.''
 &HT;    Mojaher runs the business with the help of her sister and
boyfriend. The cosmetics magnate also got a $50,000 investment
boost from mom and dad, although that meant putting school on hold.
``My dad, who is actually a doctor, is disenchanted with what the
medical field is like,'' says the potential M.D. ``So he was glad
and excited for me.'' Eventually, Mojaher plans to return to finish
her undergraduate degree, but for now she enjoys minding the candy
store.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JULIUS PARAS, 28, Founder, Project PULL, Mountain View, Calif.
 &HT;    When Julius Paras was an undergrad at Stanford, he didn't see
many other Filipino Americans on campus. So in 1994, a year after
graduating, he started Project PULL, a non-profit which preps young
Filipinos and other high school students of color _ who might
otherwise have thought that they weren't ``college material'' _ to
get into college. Project PULL coaches students into reassessing
themselves and their educational potential, and provides them with
much-needed role models of academic achievement.
 &HT;    Paras began by presenting leadership workshops at Filipino
American student conferences, followed by the creation of an online
networking resource for Filipino American youth, the BARANGAY
website, at www.projectpull.org. A year-and-a-half later, with a
$15,000 seed grant from the echoing green foundation and support
from Filipinos for Affirmative Action in Oakland and the Asian
American Activities Center at Stanford, he launched a one-week
summer leadership academy for high school teens.
 &HT;    Admittedly, says Paras, raising funds and recruiting help hasn't
been easy, but the rewards speak for themselves. This fall, all of
the students who were high school juniors during the inaugural 1997
program enrolled in community colleges or four-year universities.
Two-thirds of the original participants were so energized they
returned this year to help out as volunteers.
 &HT;    The key to achieving a 100 percent success rate? Paras says,
``Be positive, stay focused, and keep promises to yourself and to
others.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MARY CHUNG, 31, Founder and Executive Director, National Asian
Women's Health Organization, San Francisco.
 &HT;    OK, so she's over 30. But Mary Chung founded NAWHO, the nation's
leading health organization for Asian women, at the tender age of
26.
 &HT;    As a youngster, Chung had her mind set on the law school trek.
But her career plans changed when she took a stint at San
Francisco's Asian Law Caucus during a two-and-a-half year hiatus
from the University of San Francisco. Upon completing her economics
degree, she withheld the law school applications and joined a
women's reproductive rights organization instead. It was there that
it occurred to her to fuse both sides of her identity as an Asian
woman in her community work. Suddenly, the idea for NAWHO clicked.
``I realized I wanted to do national work, to get involved in the
politics, the public policy debates,'' she says. ``I wanted to
change the debate on Asian American women. Period.''
 &HT;    In 1993, Chung began NAWHO with a $25,000 start-up grant from
the Jesse Smith Noyes foundation, a voice-mailbox hooked up to her
home, and three volunteers. Now, NAWHO has a $1 million budget and
offers the country's first toll-free hotline for information and
referral on breast and cervical cancer available in four Asian
languages. With its numerous educational programs and research
studies, health leaders and policymakers alike recognize NAWHO as
the first stop when it comes to the health concerns of Asian
American women. There are ``stereotypes reflected in (mainstream)
health-related policies and programs which have limited their
effectiveness in assessing and responding to the health care needs
of Asian women and girls,'' says Chung. She created NAWHO to combat
just that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ENG HERR, 29, Executive Director, The Hmong Minnesota Pacific
Association, St. Paul, Minnesota.
 &HT;    After gaining professional experience in public relations and
doing outreach with the local Boys and Girls Club, Eng Tonva Herr
saw the need for a special organization in St. Paul _ one which
would serve the city's 65,000-strong Hmong community and promote
self-sufficiency among its high percentages on public assistance.
 &HT;    It was far from easy, Herr admits. His first challenge was to
get people, despite his youth, to take him seriously. ``They think
young people can't do this and can't do that,'' he recalls. But in
1992, Herr pooled his own money with donations from other
individuals and founded the Hmong Minnesota Pacific Association.
The Hmong Association now offers tutoring, job counseling, health
education, child care, and housing placement among its many
programs. Herr's perseverance is already paying off: Where local
Hmong American youth were once at high risk for dropping out of
school, the Association is largely responsible for boosting the
area's graduation rates to 90 percent in high school and 85 percent
in college.
 &HT;    The Association's ultimate goal, Herr says, is to integrate
Hmong Americans into the American mainstream and to give political
voice to a people alienated and displaced by the devastation of
war. ``We're the only human beings in the world that possess a
nation without a state,'' says the young visionary, who is low-key
about the kudos he's received, like the St. Paul Companies
Leadership in Neighborhood Award and the City of St. Paul Parks and
Recreation Award. ``If I do something good,'' he says, ``I usually
don't tell people about it, because it's part of my job to give
back to the people I grew up with.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WELLY YANG, 25, Artistic Director, Second Generation
Productions, New York.
 &HT;    ``There's so much incredible performing talent in the community
that's not being harnessed,'' says actor Welly Yang. ``So I wanted
to be like Ben Franklin and create some electricity.''
 &HT;    After finishing a two-year stint on Broadway as Thuy in ``Miss
Saigon,'' Yang pulled together colleagues from the entertainment
industry and financial support from the Asian American community to
found Second Generation, a theater company devoted to celebrating
the history and achievements of Asian Americans. So far, the
company has mounted successful music theater showcases at small
venues in New York and colleges around the country. But ultimately,
Second Generation plans to launch a full-book musical called
``Making Tracks,'' a rock opera with dramatic vignettes depicting
different eras of Asian American history.
 &HT;    Needless to say, this will take some money. To run the company,
Yang has been able to rely on the good will of friends ``like a CPA
doing accounting stuff, graphic designers, friends helping me make
phone calls to colleges.'' Ultimately, he says, a healthy, small
theater company putting out two or three productions a year will
require a budget of a half-million dollars. ``Until then, you're
working out of your apartment.''
 &HT;    Still, the payoff from their first production, for which they
raised $20,000, was about far more than money. Yang says audience
members watched the staged commemoration of a massacre that
happened in Taiwan 50 years ago and were ``moved that young people
really cared about what happened in the past.'' For Yang, putting
Asian American faces and experiences on stage is about shattering
the isolation that Asian Americans, especially artists, have felt
from history and from each other. ``Our history gives us purpose,''
he says. ``And the community gives us strength.''

   CARTOONIST'S SATIRE LOST ON SOME READERS. Columnist Bill Maxwell
used to think that opinion columnists, those natural-born
curmudgeons, were the loneliest souls at newspapers. ``I now
believe that editorial cartoonists are the ultimate outsiders,'' he
writes. ``They are the most misunderstood of all journalists
because their craft _ alternately making us laugh, curse and think
_ is finicky and strange to us.''

   VOTER BACKLASH AGAINST THE GOP. Gay voters made up 4 percent of
the 1998 mid-term electorate, according to exit polling conducted
by Voter News Service (VNS). ``That's a piece of post election
analysis largely ignored by the mainstream media,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, noting that only African Americans (10
percent) and Latinos (5 percent) exceeded the numbers of gay voters
this year. But the 4 percent turn out was not lost on the
leadership of the Democratic Party, which for the most part
benefited from the gay vote, he adds.

   ROUND-UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS! Strong movie statements can move
populations and their leaders into and out of turbulent issues like
no other medium, notes columnist Raul Lowery Contreras. ``When
properly portrayed, for example, American political issues have
been decided one way or the other by how they were played in movies
or on television,'' he writes. Such is the case of the movies,
``The Siege'' and ``Enemy of the State.'' ``These two movies are
important,'' he says, ``to be viewed by anyone concerned about the
continuing encroachment on the rights guaranteed to Americans by
the Constitution.''

   A GRANDMOTHER'S HOPE CHEST. What was most difficult about a
recent move from the home her family lived in for 13 years was
packing items from the attic, notes columnist Kirsten Chapman _
those leftovers she'd often pictured in the hands of a future
granddaughter and grandson: her children's books and toys, some of
their clothes and costumes. ``The sum of it all? A grandmother's
hope chest,'' she writes. Her two children are unmarried and
neither hears wedding bells in the near future. ``At 55, I fret
over `grandchildren.' When will I meet them?'' she wonders. Her
biological clock, she says, is winding down.

   VOTER BACKLASH AGAINST THE GOP. Gay voters made up 4 percent of
the 1998 mid-term electorate, according to exit polling conducted
by Voter News Service (VNS). ``That's a piece of post election
analysis largely ignored by the mainstream media,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, noting that only African Americans (10
percent) and Latinos (5 percent) exceeded the numbers of gay voters
this year. But the 4 percent turn out was not lost on the
leadership of the Democratic Party, which for the most part
benefited from the gay vote, he adds.

granddaughter and grandson: her children's books and toys, some of
their clothes and costumes. ``The sum of it all? A grandmother's

FOR ESPN'S RAVECH, THERE ARE MATTERS OF THE HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday, ESPN's Karl Ravech leaves on an 18-hour flight for
Melbourne, Australia, to cover the Presidents Cup golf tournament
for the all-sports cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't a big deal. Except when you consider about a month
ago, the 33-year-old had an honest-to-goodness heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ravech was shooting baskets with ESPN pals Bill Pito, Dave
Feldman and David Lloyd at a rec center just outside Bristol,
Conn., when he started having chest pains and a feeling of numbness
down his arms. This had never happened to him before, but he knew
it felt serious.
</P>
<P>
   Pito decided to drive him to the hospital, although Ravech said
``I could have walked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of arriving, an EKG showed that he was having a
heart attack. Within the hour, Ravech was having an angioplasty to
remove blockage from his arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never feared the worst while all this was happening,''
Ravech said. ``Doctors are there to make you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, what Ravech's doctors eventually found out
was the buildup in his system of an amino acid called homocystine.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are able to convert it into protein. But for those
who can't, it accumulates in the bloodstream and can be as damaging
to heart as cholesterol. Modern medicine has only recently done
extensive studies on the condition.
</P>
<P>
   While Ravech admits he's had to dramatically alter his lifestyle
(``I eat clementines like grapes,'' he said about his no-fat
intake), he has been able to control it with vitamins and daily
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   So a high-stress, late-night, fast-food shoveling job like a
sports anchor can't be very helpful for this, can it? We've seen
enough of ABC's ``Sports Night'' to know better.
</P>
<P>
   Ravech, who's been the ``Baseball Tonight' anchor the last few
years, fills time in between with the golf assignments and
``SportsCenter'' shifts. He says he brown bags it to work these
days and relies on colleagues to keep him in check about what he's
popping in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably better professions to be in than this, but
I don't generally get stressed out,'' said Ravech, who's been at
ESPN for six years. ``It doesn't occur to me we're doing a thing on
TV that millions are watching or we get through a stressful live
show. We all deal with stress differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing a stress test at his doctor's office Wednesday cleared
him for his working trip to Australia. Ravech said he was told that
whatever damage was done to the interior wall of his heart has
gone.
</P>
<P>
   When he traveled last week with his wife and 3-year-old son to a
Thanksgiving dinner at his parents' home in Boston, Ravech admitted
he did some personal reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing is imagining my wife rasing our son by
herself; that was the toughest part of the first week,'' said
Ravech.
</P>
<P>
   It also caused colleagues to think twice. It wasn't that long
ago that another member of ESPN's family, Tom Mees, drowned in his
backyard swimming pool, leaving a widow and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened, we all felt terrible,'' said Bill Seward,
the former L.A.-based sportscaster who works at ESPNEWS and golfs
frequently with Ravech. ``I looked at it as I'm a few years older
and a few pounds heavier . . . what are my chances? It's a wake-up
call for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a time for those at ESPN to watch out for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real satisfying parts to all this is the support of
the people here,'' said Ravech. ``It shouldn't take something like
to this make people tell you how they feel about you. In this
environment, we all work with high stress and wonder if anyone else
notices what we're doing. It's really nice to hear from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to work so fast may seem unusual, but it's the nature
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning that the heart is a weird thing,'' said Ravech.
``It's not like a twisted ankle. Once they fix it, it's fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never was at a point where I felt I was close to
dying. But my doctor said I was on my way to a really big heart
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's on his way to Australia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
Three games for the price of one. UCLA fans who show up early to
the Wooden Classic college basketball doubleheader Saturday can
watch ESPN's coverage of the Bruins-Miami football game (11 a.m.)
on the Pond's scoreboard video monitor. Both Pepperdine-Kansas and
UCLA-Oklahoma State hoop games are on KCAL-Channel 9, which struck
a three-year syndication package deal with the Wooden Classic after
it had been shuffled between all the networks in recent years.
TNT's Bob Neal and Bill Walton do the broadcast on both games. With
UCLA's Chris Roberts doing football in Miami for KXTA-AM (1150),
John Ireland, who'll be a sideline reporter for KCAL's coverage of
the first game, goes over to basketball play-by-play on radio for
the UCLA game. Follow that? &QL; 
DirecTV has added CNN/SI to its lineup (Channel 205). &QL; 
The day-in-the-life-of-the-Kings piece in the current issue of
Sports Illustrated. Seems they do a lot of sleeping and eating. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
Malone again, naturally. In a segue from ridiculous radio to TV
torture, Karl Malone plays the part of an INS agent tracking down a
Central American baseball player (played by Jose Canseco) in
tonight's episode of ``Nash Bridges'' (Channel 2, 10 p.m.). &QL; 
Fox Sports Pittsburgh was called for unsportsmanlike conduct by the
NHL for airing commercials during a recent Penguins broadcast that
hawked two hockey fight videotapes. According to ``The Hockey
News,'' the Pittsburgh regional arm of Fox Sports Net originally
rejected the spots, but the company went through a clearing house
in L.A., bought the time and snuck the commercial in. Of course,
folks in L.A. are always willing to help circumvent red tape for
the promotion of good, old-time hockey. &QL; 
Fox's first network Saturday baseball game of the week for L.A.
will be the Angels-Dodgers game _ on June 5. Baseball's apparently
so hot a network sport that it can afford to skip April and May.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Expensive, over-the-top, glorious department-store
windows at Christmas time are a ritual as integral to the season in
New York City as overpriced chestnuts sold by street vendors and
traffic snarls near Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   News shows troop over to Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord &AMP; Taylor for
their 20-second spots of Santas, chimneys and the small voices of
children's choirs, while tourists line up three deep between
Thanksgiving and New Year's to take in the festive window scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But what amounts to a moment's thrill for those who pass by the
windows is the result of months of tedious, highly guarded planning
among retailers, who are looking for much more than appreciative
gawking: They see the windows as a competitive tool for increasing
news-media attention and store traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The windows are certainly competitive,'' said Sheri
Wilson-Gray, executive vice president of marketing at Saks.
``Christmas is a key selling season with lots of tourists and
infrequent customers, and great windows give you an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Window dressing has attracted even more attention in recent
years as competition among department stores has grown increasingly
intense at the same time that their merchandise has become
increasingly similar.
</P>
<P>
   The windows, then, set the tone and image for each retailer,
especially for those shoppers who come only at Christmas and may
not know the character or style of each store. The competition is
especially heightened this year, as New York City experiences a
record flow of tourists, or in the stores' views, potential
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   With Gimbels, Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and other department
stores now resting in the retail graveyard, the attention has come
down to a few prominent players, who spends thousands of dollars on
their windows to stand out and draw customers in.
</P>
<P>
   The windows rarely feature merchandise for sale in the store,
but rather a theme the retailer hopes is alluring. Details count.
Creative directors may spend weeks choosing the perfect ribbon, or
ferreting out pumpkin-scented room spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows are getting much more intricate and detailed since the
economy has improved,'' said Sam Joseph, visual director for
windows at Macy's. In the early part of the decade, when the
economy was less rosy, many windows were more austere and featured
headless mannequins and far fewer trimmings, he said. Now opulence
is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the retailers who still do it, it has become more
important,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys
New York and author of a new book, ``Confessions of a Window
Dresser'' (Penguin Studio, $40). ``They are more of a marketing
springboard, because windows create a buzz about the store.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge part of all the buzzing is because of Doonan, who has
raised the bar for Christmas window displays in the 13 years that
he has been doing them for Barneys. His mandate for drawing
attention grew out of the store's former geographically challenged
spot at 17th Street and Seventh Avenue, where nary a tourist would
go to see holiday displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to be a destination; people needed a reason to go
down there,'' said Doonan, adding that the tradition remained even
after Barneys opened a branch at the heavily trafficked Madison
Avenue and 60th Street and later closed its original store.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan's windows are a big departure from mistletoe and gentle
Santas. He tends to pepper his displays with inside fashion jokes
and playful sendups of celebrities, from Madonna to Anne Heche to
Margaret Thatcher as a dominatrix clad in a British flag.
</P>
<P>
   He also draws heavily from other pop culture. In this year's
installation, for instance, he made a kitchen stool out of Comet
cans and walls from Jiffy Pop popcorn containers. Another year's
display featured a Christmas tree created with condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan's work has sometimes landed him in hot water, as in 1994,
when he hired the artist Tom Sachs to make a ``Hello Kitty Nativity
Scene,'' which featured the Three Kings in the form of Bart
Simpson, the Madonna (the religious icon) depicted as Madonna (the
singer) in leather and the Kitty (the popular figure decorating
children's school supplies, hair accessories and the like) as the
baby Jesus. After protests from Roman Catholic groups, he took the
display down.
</P>
<P>
   His displays have inspired others to do offbeat holiday windows
with pop-culture references. The windows at Sony Plaza on Madison
Avenue this year were done by Martha Stewart, and feature giant
versions of her frosted animal-shaped cookies, elaborate food
displays and a parody of her personal calendar, which is featured
in the front of her magazine each month and lists her plans for
things like antique shows in the Hamptons and a great deal of
mulching.
</P>
<P>
   On this calendar: ``Tie bows with tweezers'' and ``Iron 311
yards of ribbons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to stop and look,'' said Christine Belich,
Sony's creative director. ``And we know people are not going to
come into the store because there is a TV in the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stores stick to the traditional imagery of Christmas and
still attract attention. This year at Saks, each window depicts
children from the 1920s looking at parts of the world through their
attic telescope. Lord &AMP; Taylor, the master of childhood themes, is
using Peter Pan this year, with the tag line ``Think Happy
Thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord &AMP; Taylor's trademark is technology; it has the world's only
hydraulic window display, which is created in the store's basement
and actually rises into the windows each November.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the windows feature condoms or finely crafted
puppets, the displays take months of planning. Ms. Belich at Sony
started doing her work in April by poring through Martha Stewart
Living magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea about the details,'' she said. ``The color of
the thread used to embroider the tag line on the window frame?
Everyone had an opinion on that. We decided to use silver on a
`Martha' green. We looked at 10 samples of pine cones before we
selected one. We went through 20 samples of frosting styles before
we found the one thing that was perfect. It couldn't be almost
perfect. It had to be perfect.''

</P>
<P>
   At Bloomingdale's, Michael Fisher, the creative director of
visual merchandise, found a way to scent the store's sidewalks with
essence of pumpkin for the window unveiling this year. He will not
say how he accomplished this task. He does not want other stores
copying the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Joint ventures are also common now. Barneys received some
financial help from In Style magazine for its windows this year,
and in a pleasantly tacky way that only that store's tribute to
popular culture could get away with, the magazine is plastered all
over the display.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's worked with the magazine in the past, too. The
relationship is partly financial and partly a means of marketing:
For a small fee, In Style can glean some hipness from being in the
right store window (and maybe attract a few new customers of its
own).
</P>
<P>
   Although he is certainly the leader of his generation, wacky
window displays did not start with Doonan. In the 1930s, during the
height of the dada art movement, artists were called upon to create
nontraditional, if not downright macabre scenes for store displays.
In 1938, Salvador Dali put a bathtub with a bloody-faced mannequin
in a Bonwit Teller Christmas window, and later some windows
displayed a Santa falling off a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's first moving figures were featured in their windows in
1898, but the real art of display did not get going until the late
1920s, said Jane Stubbs, the curator of the new show ``Just Window
Dressing?'' at the Municipal Art Society, which looks at the
history of the retail art.
</P>
<P>
   ``In department stores here in 1905,'' Ms. Stubbs said, ``they
would put paper flowers in the windows and mannequins with missing
body parts and sleeves hanging down because they didn't have
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Window design experienced a certain frenzy during the 1970s,
reflecting, perhaps, a sense of decadence in fashion and lifestyle
similar in many ways to today's. ``In the 1970s, there was this
great explosion of controversial talent,'' Ms. Stubbs explained.
``There was Candy Pratts Price, whose windows at Bloomingdale's had
a slightly violent edge, but the city at that point was undergoing
a very tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of window dressing's greatest stars, Gene Moore, died just
last month. Moore was best known for his work at Tiffany's, where
he did windows for several decades. But he worked for many
retailers, including the Clarence House fabric store, where he once
did a display featuring three wise women in Norma Kamali dresses
looking at a street sign that pointed to Bethlehem, as well as to
Paris and New York.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether those windows sold more fabric, but
sometimes, even today, the larger goal of windows is to feed not
simply the cash register but also the ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely competitive,'' said LaVelle Olexa, senior
vice president of fashion merchandise at Lord &AMP; Taylor. ``As a
retailer, you are always interested in what other retailers are
doing. Windows in New York are always compared store to store, and
you want to put your best face forward.''

   11 EUROPEAN NATIONS MOVE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES
</P>
<P>
   Eleven European nations simultaneously cut their interest rates
to a nearly uniform low level in the most coordinated action yet
toward European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a month before the nations adopt the euro as a
single currency and marked a drastic shift in policy. As recently
as two months ago, European central bankers had adamantly refused
to lower rates because they were intent on establishing the
credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank in
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   AGREEMENT REACHED ON ENCRYPTION
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government announced that an agreement had been reached
in Vienna that was expected to produce new international controls
on the export of data scrambling software and hardware, a
long-contentious issue pitting individual privacy against national
security in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement is a compromise that places new restrictions
on the exporting of mass-market software with keys above 64 bits in
length.
</P>
<P>
   TOSHIBA AND FUJITSU FORM VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba and Fujitsu announced a joint venture that they said
should allow both companies to reduce costs and development time
for the next generation of their computer memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. PRODUCTIVITY RISES 3 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Productivity in the United States rose at a revised 3 percent
annual rate in the three months ended in September, a sign that the
almost eight-year-old expansion of the economy will stay on track
into the new year. But the Labor Department said first-time jobless
claims rose 12,000, to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 for the week
ended last Saturday, after falling 39,000 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government said Thursday that the economy had
shrunk at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter,
signaling deeper troubles ahead for Japan as it struggles through
its worst recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIALTY STORES HAVE GOOD MONTH
</P>
<P>
   Specialty stores and discounters outdistanced major department
store chains in holiday sales during November, according to monthly
results from big retailers. Analysts attributed the gains at
discounters and specialty chains to efforts to focus on a core
customer group or product category.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT-TRUCK SALES EXCEED CAR SALES
</P>
<P>
   Americans bought more sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and
vans than cars last month, for the first time since a brief period
at the end of World War II, as very low gasoline prices, low
interest rates and a strong economy kept overall auto sales brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of so-called light trucks reached 50.8 percent of the
market last month. The broad popularity of these vehicles has
accelerated in the last three years with the introduction of much
bigger models like the Ford Expedition and Dodge Durango.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T TESTS CABLE TV SERVICES

service in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and wife Melinda Gates
are expecting their second child next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Family spokeswoman Rose Berg confirmed Thursday that the baby is
due in mid to late June.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda and Bill are ``very excited'' about the prospect of a
sibling for Jennifer Katharine, now 2 1/2, but plan to say little
else, preferring to keep family matters private, Berg said. They
don't know the baby's sex and don't plan to find out before he or
she is born.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates holds about one-fifth of the shares of Microsoft,
which he co-founded in 1975. At Thursday's closing price, those
shares were worth just under $63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Gates is closely involved in the family's philanthropic
efforts, Berg said. Washington Gov. Gary Locke recently named her
co-chair of a new state commission on early childhood learning,
along with his wife, Mona Lee Locke.

BUYERS LIFT TICKETMASTER SHARES TO 4 TIMES OFFERING PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors snapped up the initial public offering of Ticketmaster
Online-City Search Inc., an online seller of tickets and city
guides, sending its shares as high as four times their offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster shares closed at $40.25 in Nasdaq trading, after
trading as high as $56.38. Because the shares opened at $52, many
investors who bought in the first hour of trading lost money on the
stock. The company sold seven million shares at $14 each on
Wednesday, up from the $11 to $13 range set by the lead
underwriter, Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a ticker-symbol mix-up, the initial public offering of
Ticketmaster also prompted an unusual flurry of trading in the
shares of Temco Service Industries, a provider of building
maintenance and security services. Temco shares, which trade under
the symbol tcmo, and traded under the symbol tcms prior to Oct. 7,
soared as high as $65 before investors realized they were not
buying Ticketmaster, which now uses tcms. Temco shares closed at
$25.50, down $3.25, in over-the-counter trading. At $40.25,
Ticketmaster's 69.5 million shares outstanding give it a market
valuation of $2.80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester Research, said
Ticketmaster needed to distinguish itself from other online city
guides, but added that ``event ticketing is going to be one of the
key drivers for electronic commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates online ticket purchases growing from $115
million this year to $2.75 billion by 2003, Ms. Allen said.
Ticketmaster, however, needs to find better ways to link its city
guides with the ticket business, Ms. Allen added.

 &HT;    BCS `the best system we could have now'
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's see. To win the national championship, Tennessee
must conquer Mississippi State in Saturday's SEC championship game,
then somebody else during the Fiesta Bowl, then everything from a
slew of computer rankings to the quality of their quartile.
</P>
<P>
   Computers? Quartiles? Not only that, the Vols' strength of
schedule and their standing in the two major polls will determine
where they finish after this first year of the Bowl Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Good.
</P>
<P>
   Now the BCS isn't the loveliest thing for separating the best
from the rest in college football. It isn't the lousiest, either.
It is simply lovelier than anything shy of what would rank among
the greatest horrors known to mankind, and that is a playoff system
at the Division I-A level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never supported having a playoff system at this level,
and I never will,'' said Georgia associate athletics director Dick
Bestwick, sounding like the wise man that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best system we could have now,'' Bestwick said.
``Still, the better way is to do what (Georgia athletics director)
Vince Dooley has espoused in recent years, and that is to structure
everything around the bowl games. In the end, you could take the
top two teams and have them play for the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but there always is this: If the NCAA's objective
is to get as close as it can to selecting the top college football
team in the country at its highest level, then it must have a
January Jubilee to match its March Madness in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, that shouldn't be the NCAA's objective. Soon after
a January Jubilee, we'd see efforts to get more of the Division
I-A's 112 teams involved to create a February Festival. After that,
we'd eventually see tackling right up to the first dribble of March
Madness.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this a problem? Although it is flawed, there still is
this concept known as the student-athlete that separates college
sports from the professional ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that, except on game days and the
camaraderie you have with others, football is about as fun as
digging a ditch,'' said Bestwick, a 40-year veteran in athletics,
ranging from coaching at Virginia to serving as a scout for the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, going to a bowl is fun for the kids. They spend
about a week to 10 days at the site. That definitely would change
with a playoff system that would have kids going into a city the
day before a game and probably leaving right afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine how terrible the media would be. You'd have these
kids going into a Super Bowl mode. But I don't think any of this
will happen. If it does, the college presidents would be the
biggest hypocrites of all. There would be no academic justification
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   None. As for those who mention that Division I-A is the only
level of college football without a playoff system, Bestwick said,
``It isn't anywhere near the same game. The players at this level
are bigger and faster. There's more pounding on their bodies, and
that only would increase by adding more games to their season.''
</P>
<P>
   So the solution here is obvious: If you have problems with the
BCS, well, simply get over it.

 &HT;    Dogs win with tenacity
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mention the seeming hopelessness of their cause
against Tennessee, and watch Mississippi State players grin. Not to
conceal anger, but as a familiar reaction to what is being called a
mismatch for the SEC championship.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Volunteers appear to have it all: speed and depth
at virtually every position, playmakers, an excellent kicking game
and survival skills _ not to mention luck _ that have bailed them
out of their closest calls.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 23 Bulldogs are well aware that they're unknown and
practically unloved outside of their cloistered environs. They
foiled a Tennessee-Arkansas rematch by knocking off the Razorbacks
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet State isn't without some strong suits that have helped it
turn in a respectable 8-3 mark, the program's best in five years.
They have 13 senior starters, including four on a solid offensive
line; some good quickness and flexibility on defense; a strong
kicking game and special-teams play; and a gritty mind-set that has
contributed to clutch wins late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Tennessee coach) Phillip (Fulmer) says they have no
stars, that's not really true,'' coach Jackie Sherrill said,
rattling off the names of Tee Martin, Al Wilson, Peerless Price and
the injured Jamal Lewis. ``We don't have any players with a lot of
name recognition, or anybody who is going to be a high draft
choice. But we have guys with no quit in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they're 14-point underdogs, which might be a generous
line for the Dogs, who have absorbed some brutal losses to bad
teams (LSU, Oklahoma State) on a schedule brimming with exactly one
team currently ranked (No. 11 Arkansas).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem for us,'' starting free safety Eric Daniel
said. ``I think we play better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Edward Smith, who might be playing as well at his
position as anyone in the league, is happy to chime in: ``We've
been overlooked, and we're being overlooked now. We showed we were
the better team against Arkansas, and Tennessee just barely beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are five keys for the Bulldogs against the Volunteers:
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line, Johnson Senior tailback James Johnson, the SEC's
leading rusher, has seen limited action the last two games with a
groin pull and a strained shoulder. If he does play, he is far from
100 percent. Without him, State has been unable to establish a
running game, and redshirt freshman quarterback Wayne Madkin
doesn't have enough experience or options to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   A hefty, talented offensive line, which averages 310 pounds,
needs to contend with a quick Tennessee defensive front seven to
keep State close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know their line is active,'' guard Randy Thomas said. ``But
we can really move, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Contain Tee Martin
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn's bag of tricks features an
array of formations, in part to make up for a lack of size. The
ends, Smith and Cornell Menafee and nose guard Kenwoynne Smith, all
weigh around 230. But they're good blitzers, and State seems
willing to let its SEC-best pass defense handle long throws
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an athletic quarterback,'' Sherrill said,
``you're better off keeping him in the pocket and letting him throw
rather than flushing him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Create turnovers
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have scored five touchdowns on defense and four on
special teams. Brian Hazlewood kicked five field goals against
Arkansas and has good range, with a 52-yard best.
</P>
<P>
   Big plays on offense
</P>
<P>
   Senior flanker Kevin Prentiss, only 5 feet 8, has played well
the past two games, leaping to make big receptions and running well
after the catch. Given the Vols' weak link in the secondary, his
acrobatics might be the most reliable weapon State can employ.
</P>
<P>
   Maintain level of confidence
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs think that they don't have much to lose against a
team needing a win to keep its national championship hopes alive.
And they've got the experience factor, if not the stockpile of
talent, on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our maturity level helped us finish the season strong,''
defensive back Tim Nelson said. ``It's been up to us. We just
didn't give up.

 &HT;    'Stability' for Tech, O'Leary
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech football coach George O'Leary signed a
new contract Thursday, giving Tech some insurance that he will be
around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's new deal is a six-year rollover contract worth
$600,000 annually, an increase of $184,000 a year from his previous
five-year rollover contract. Under the new contract, if O'Leary
leaves Tech for another college coaching job, he would have to pay
a $1.5 million penalty, the same amount Tech has to pay O'Leary if
the school terminates his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which goes into effect Jan. 1, the day Tech plays
Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl, includes incentives worth as much as
$100,000. Under the previous contract, O'Leary could have left for
another job without paying a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to get it done and move on,'' said O'Leary, who is
27-21 in his fourth full season at Tech and headed to a second
consecutive bowl. ``The biggest thing you get out of this contract
is stability in the program and in the coaching staff, and
consistency in a football program is essentially what it takes to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, whose name was mentioned in the coaching searches at
Auburn and South Carolina, hopes the signing of this contract
reaffirms his commitment to Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never changed my stance,'' O'Leary said. ``I'm very happy at
Georgia Tech. I needed to get some things ironed out; it just took
some dialogue to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech athletics director Dave Braine said his goal has been to do
a new deal with O'Leary since Braine joined the program in the
spring of 1997 and heard concerns that Tech lost every good coach
it got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody thinks this had something to do with
(Auburn),'' Braine said. ``It did not. He's done a great job with
this program, and he's a good fit.''

 &HT;    Springboard to No.1
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the powers that be in the SEC raised the concept
of a conference championship game in 1991, the traditionalists
scoffed. Then they predicted all manner of dire results.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, said the naysayers, a tough extra game would ruin the
conference's shot at another national title. In fact, they said,
the conference wouldn't even get a chance to play for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the eve of the seventh SEC championship game, it can
be said: They were wrong. If No. 1 Tennessee (11-0) beats No. 23
Mississippi State (8-3) Saturday in the Georgia Dome, the Vols have
a good chance to be the fifth SEC championship game winner in seven
years to advance to a bowl game that could determine the national
championship. Two of those previous four winners, Alabama in 1992
and Florida in 1996, used a victory in the SEC championship game as
a springboard to the national title. Not bad for a game that was
supposed to rip the competitive guts out of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly can't say it surprises me,'' said Tennessee coach
Phillip Fulmer, who is looking for his second SEC title in a row.
``If you go through this league undefeated, as tough as it is, you
certainly should be in the mix of teams for the national
championship. Week in and week out, there is no tougher experience
than going through an SEC schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   With a win, Tennessee should finish no worse than second in the
Bowl Championship Series standings, which will be released Sunday
afternoon. If the two other undefeated teams at the top of the BCS,
Kansas State and UCLA, both win Saturday, Tennessee would play one
of them in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. If the
Volunteers win the SEC title again, Fulmer said, he has no doubt
that his team belongs in the Fiesta Bowl. ``We've beaten four of
the Top 25 (Florida, Georgia, Arkansas and Syracuse) and three of
those teams were in the Top 10 when we played them,'' Fulmer said.
``But more than that, I just think that if you're the SEC champion
and you're 12-0, you have got to be in the big game.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at the event backs up Fulmer's point:
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   Alabama was 11-0 and ranked second when it faced Florida in the
inaugural SEC championship game at Legion Field in Birmingham. A
win would guarantee the Crimson Tide a date with No. 1 Miami in the
Sugar Bowl. The Gators put a scare into the mostly Alabama crowd
when they scored to tie the game at 21 with 8:21 left. But Antonio
Langham returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown and
Alabama went on to a 28-21 win. The Crimson Tide beat Miami 34-13
in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   1995
</P>
<P>
   Florida was 11-0 and ranked No. 2 when it beat Arkansas 34-3 at
the Georgia Dome for the conference title. That victory set up a
national championship game with No. 1 Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl.
The Gators hung tough early but were no match for the Cornhuskers,
losing 62-24.
</P>
<P>
   1996
</P>
<P>
   Florida was 10-1, ranked No. 4, and seemingly out of the
national picture when it arrived at the SEC championship game
against Alabama. But earlier in the day, No. 3 Nebraska was upset
by Texas in the Big 12 championship game. Florida beat Alabama
45-30 at the Georgia Dome and the next day was No. 3 behind No. 1
Florida State and No. 2 Arizona State. With Arizona State committed
to the Rose Bowl, Florida was invited to the Sugar Bowl for a
rematch with Florida State, which had beaten the Gators 24-21 in
the last game of the regular season. On Jan. 1, Arizona State was
upset by Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. On Jan. 2, Florida trounced
Florida State 52-20 in New Orleans and won its first national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   1997
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was 10-1 and ranked No. 3 when it rallied to beat
Auburn 30-29 for the SEC title. The Vols then traveled to the
Orange Bowl to meet Nebraska, ranked No. 2. Had No. 1 Michigan lost
to Washington State in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, the Orange Bowl on
Jan. 2 would have been for the national championship. Michigan won,
however, and claimed the AP national title. Nebraska thumped
Tennessee 42-17 and was rewarded by the coaches who vote in the USA
Today/ESPN poll, who gave their national title to Tom Osborne and
the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that history, if an SEC team is undefeated and wins in
December in the SEC championship game, it should be playing for the
national title in January. Even with a loss, the SEC champ still
has an outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   One coach who believes in the SEC championship game as a
toughening ground is Florida's Steve Spurrier, who had a team in
five of the six previous games. The SEC championship ``is all we
talk about around here, and it's all we will talk about,'' said
Spurrier, who won five SEC titles 1991-1996. ``That's because it's
a real championship that you can win on the field. That other thing
is nice, but people have to vote you in and there's a lot of luck
involved. That was certainly the case when we won it. That year,
God was certainly smiling down on the Gators.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC commissioner Roy Kramer was aware of the potential negative
impact of the game when he and his staff brought the concept to
reality. Kramer, a longtime football coach before getting into the
administrative end of the sport, said he thinks that the game
actually improves an SEC team's chances of winning the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to win the game, of course,'' Kramer said, ``but if
you do win, your team is going to be battle-tested. Chances are
they won't face anything in a bowl game they haven't seen before.
If you ask the coaches who have been involved, they'll tell you
that the SEC championship game is really more intense than most
bowl games. It's more of a Super Bowl-type atmosphere. Once your
kids have played in this thing, they are not going to have their
heads turned by anything they see in a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer can attest to that, after his team played in the SEC
championship game for the first time last December. Tennessee was a
solid favorite over Auburn, but the Vols came out tight and
preoccupied with their surroundings. They fell behind 20-7 before
rallying behind Peyton Manning to win 30-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that it's really not something you can prepare for,
because the SEC championship game is so unlike any other game we
had played in,'' Fulmer said. ``The festive atmosphere is great.
The noise is incredible in the Dome. We play in a lot of loud
places. Our place (Neyland Stadium) is pretty loud with 107,000
people. But our guys had to make some adjustments. Fortunately, we
were able to do it and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Tennessee, if it can defeat Mississippi State, will become
the next team to use the SEC championship game as a springboard to
a chance at the national championship. The trend, Fulmer said,
should not end anytime soon.

 &HT;    Vols must stop sweep
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until last December, Phillip Fulmer had never been to
an SEC championship game. ``No,'' the Tennessee coach said and
chuckled, ``I really don't want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as a spectator, anyway. Fulmer wanted to go in style, in
character, as coach of the SEC Eastern Division champions. He
finally got the opportunity last year and guided UT to its 12th SEC
title. Now the Vols are back in the Georgia Dome again, their
Saturday opponent Mississippi State, but their eyes ultimately on a
much bigger prize: A national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Tempe, though, UT must go 12-0. How? Here are
five keys:
</P>
<P>
   Stop the MSU sweep
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to pound the football at you,'' UT defensive
coordinator John Chavis said. ``Pound you, pound you, pound you,
then throw play-action passes. But they want to run the football,
first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   And first and foremost, the Bulldogs run the sweep. Whether it's
the banged-up James Johnson, the SEC's leading rusher (1,345 yards)
or backups Dicenzo Miller and Chris Rainey running behind a huge
offensive line, MSU sees every quarter of every game as a sweeps
period. ``We haven't seen a lot of sweep, and they're committed to
it,'' said Chavis, whose defense is eighth nationally against the
run, allowing 96.5 yards a game. ``They run the sweep better than
anybody in the country. They run well between the tackles, but they
run the sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Limit turnovers
</P>
<P>
   In last year's SEC title game, Tennessee made six turnovers
against Auburn. The Vols fumbled six times, losing four, and threw
two interceptions. They trailed 20-10 at halftime before rallying
for a 30-29 win. This year, ball security has been a UT strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols lead the SEC in turnover margin at plus 15, their 1.36
average tying for fifth nationally. They have committed just 15
turnovers _ nine fumbles, six interceptions _ while forcing 30, 16
fumble recoveries, 14 interceptions. Tennessee has fumbled just 21
times, compared with 33 total fumbles last season, and cut its '97
interception total of 12 in half. In last Saturday's 41-0 rout of
Vanderbilt, UT turned six Vandy turnovers into 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Running game must work
</P>
<P>
   When Peyton Manning left, it was clear that Tennessee needed
offensive diversification. But when the Vols lost tailback Jamal
Lewis with a knee injury in the fourth game, the ground game didn't
grind to a halt. Rather, it has thrived behind tailbacks Travis
Henry (850 yards rushing) and Travis Stephens (427), who play
behind a great offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Tee Martin (307 yards rushing, seven touchdowns) has
helped UT become the SEC's top running team (216.8 yards a game,
13th nationally). A sound ground game will help nullify Mississippi
State's offensive strength; the Bulldogs' were outgained in rushing
in two of their three losses.
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin needs big game
</P>
<P>
   Since adjusting to the starter role in the season's first month,
Martin has been outstanding, starting with the second half at
Georgia, when he threw for two touchdowns, turning a 9-3 halftime
lead into a 22-3 game. After completing less than 50 percent of his
passes in the first five games, throwing four interceptions, he's
sizzled in the past six UT wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade him for any other quarterback in the
country,'' Fulmer said. Martin is second in the SEC in passing
efficiency (148.26) and 14th in the nation. In the past six games,
Martin is 87-of-130 (66.9 per cent) for 1,291 yards, eight
touchdowns and one interception. He hasn't thrown an interception
in his past 59 pass attempts. Martin has thrown and rushed for a
score in each of the past four games. If he continues against the
stunting schemes of Mississippi State defensive coordinator Joe Lee
Dunn, Martin gives UT a big edge over Bulldogs redshirt freshman
quarterback Wayne Madkin.
</P>
<P>
   Jump to an early end
</P>
<P>
   In each of its three losses, Mississippi State fell behind
quickly. In the clamor of the Georgia Dome, that could prove
damaging. Tennessee was admittedly tight in its first championship
game a year ago. This year, the Vols know what to expect, while
Mississippi State will find a far more frenzied atmosphere than in
its two Peach Bowls here, in 1993 and '94.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee must focus on Dec. 5, not Jan. 4, when the
national championship will be decided in the Fiesta Bowl, between
the top two teams in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. Despite
being a 14-point favorite, UT can't overlook MSU.

</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hall kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired as the
Volunteers escaped with the victory. Quarterback Tee Martin
completed only nine of 26 passes in his first start of the season,
but led the team on a 72-yard drive in the final minutes to set up
Hall's field goal. Jamal Lewis rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown

   Hall provided the game-winner for the second contest in a row, a
41-yarder in overtime as the Volunteers ended their five-game
losing streak against Florida. Big plays were the difference for
the Vols as they scored on a 57-yard run by Shawn Bryson and a
29-yard pass from Martin to Peerless Price. Linebacker Al Wilson

penalties and two turnovers, the Vols cruised as Martin passed for
four touchdowns and Lewis rushed for 135 yards and two touchdowns.
Record: 3-0.

<P>
   Oct. 10 at Athens
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers won their eighth in a row over Georgia,
dominating both lines of scrimmage in a game that was more
one-sided than the score would indicate. Martin passed for two
touchdowns and Hall kicked three field goals as the Vols moved into
sole possession of first place in the SEC East. Record: 5-0.
</P>

   TENNESSEE 35, ALABAMA 18
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 24 at Knoxville

two touchdowns. Record: 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 49, SOUTH CAROLINA 14
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 31 at Columbia, S.C.

</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 37, ALA.-BIRMINGHAM 13
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7 at Knoxville
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers held Alabama-Birmingham to 71 passing yards, and
Travis Henry rushed for 104 yards to lead an offense that gained
447. The win, coupled with Ohio State's loss to Michigan State,
vaulted the Vols to the nation's No. 1 ranking for the first time
since 1956. Record: 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 28, ARKANSAS 24
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14 at Knoxville
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' stay at the top of the rankings nearly ended
after one week, but they capitalized on a late Arkansas fumble and
drove 43 yards for the winning touchdown with 28 seconds remaining.
Henry rushed for a career-high 197 yards, including the winning
touchdown. The Vols rallied from a 21-3 deficit for the win.
Record: 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 59, KENTUCKY 21
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21 at Knoxville

   The Wildcats were supposed to provide a stiff challenge, but the
Vols opened a 38-7 halftime lead and clinched their second

INJURED QB FORCES CHANGE FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown will miss tomorrow's Big 12
championship game because of a broken left collarbone, coach R.C.
Slocum said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, who will be replaced in the lineup by Stephenville's
Branndon Stewart, was injured during a fourth-quarter touchdown run
in last week's 26-24 loss to Texas. Because the initial pain was
not severe, no X-rays were taken at the time, and McCown was
cleared to practice in preparation for tomorrow's meeting between
No. 10 A&AMP;M (10-2) and No. 2 Kansas State (11-0) at 3:30 p.m. in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   McCown reported increased pain during Wednesday's workout,
prompting trainers to X-ray the shoulder yesterday. That is when
the break was discovered, A&AMP;M officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He aggravated the injury Wednesday while throwing the
football,'' Slocum said. ``We'll miss him, but we've won a lot of
games with Branndon, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a fifth-year senior who became a backup to McCown on
Oct. 3, has a career mark of 19-10 as A&AMP;M's starting quarterback.
He is 4-1 as a starter this season, including a 234-yard passing
performance Nov. 7 in place of an injured McCown in a 29-0 victory
over Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lacks McCown's scrambling abilities, Stewart has a
higher completion percentage (54.6) and a higher passing efficiency
rating (111.3) this season. He has completed 53 of 97 passes for
668 yards and four touchdowns, with only one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branndon is excited, and the team has a lot of confidence in
him,'' A&AMP;M offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said. ``I've been
chastised for saying this, but I've always said we've got a
quarterback luxury. We've won with both guys.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown, 6-1 as A&AMP;M's starter, missed the Oklahoma game because
of a separated right shoulder. That injury was unrelated to the
collarbone injury he suffered against Texas. Kragthorpe said McCown
is expected to miss three weeks, which would make him questionable
for a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coaches said they would make no changes to the game plan to
account for Stewart's presence. But they have elevated punter Shane
Lechler, a quarterback in high school, to the role of Stewart's
backup and had him take snaps in practice yesterday. Ry Marek, a
freshman walk-on, would be the third-teamer, Kragthorpe said.

 &HT;    Mora keeps calm as Colts keep losing
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ More than two years after Jim Mora's personal
Chernobyl, the self-inflicted wounds have healed and the physical
and mental rehabilitation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many thoughts about the emotional meltdown of Oct.
20, 1996, which signaled the end of a stormy tenure in New Orleans
and the beginning of his much-needed hiatus from the NFL. His
ballistic reaction to the Saints' demoralizing 19-7 loss at
Carolina that day, if not a life-altering incident, has been
catalogued carefully as a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   After having spent the subsequent years debunking the notion
that he is a raving lunatic and fielding probing questions about an
embarrassing tantrum that became his defining ESPN moment, Mora
learned the lesson well.
</P>
<P>
   Scared by the snide suggestion he might require a straitjacket
to overcome occupational burnout, Mora suddenly is a man at peace
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   So a trim and healthy-looking 63-year-old Mora is justifiably
excited about his young Indianapolis Colts team and is handling a
2-10 record with far more aplomb and patience than skeptics thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know how to handle things better now, I think,'' said
Mora, whose team plays the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome on
Sunday. ``We've lost some tough ones, and after those games, darn
right, you're in the tank a little bit. But you know what? I
recover a lot quicker than I used to. You learn to bounce back.
That probably comes from being more at ease with myself as a coach
now, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The mental image of a laid-back Mora _ calm after the bitter
34-31 loss to the San Francisco 49ers earlier this season in which
the NFL publicly admitted two officiating gaffes that robbed the
Colts of an upset _ runs contrary to experience.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no vein-bulging sideline eruptions in his
first campaign with the Colts, players here admit he has delivered
a few halftime admonitions that could have stripped the paint from
the locker room walls. And he has not attempted to camouflage his
unhappiness with the officiating this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is, after all, a man who rarely holds his emotions totally
in check.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, he ranks among the most human of NFL coaches, a
rare straight-shooter who does not mince words, is devoid of
pretense and regards the game more seriously than he does himself.
He is a man's man, a guy who looks you in the eye and isn't above
mixing an off-color allusion to accentuate a point, a coach who
seeks solutions more than excuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom-line world of the NFL, it's appropriate there are
no gray areas with Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk away from a conversation with him you understand
exactly where he stands on things,'' former University of Georgia
star and Colts offensive right tackle Adam Meadows said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony there is that Mora might be one of the most
misunderstood coaches of this era, a man afforded only grudging
credit for his success. A startling statistic: In his 10 full
seasons in New Orleans, the Saints won 91 regular-season games. In
his 10 years in San Francisco, the sainted Bill Walsh won 92
regular-season contests.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there was justification for focusing on New Orleans'
postseason collapses in Mora's stint there and for bashing a stodgy
offense designed by coordinator Carl Smith. And the conscious
decision to retool an aging roster by cutting one-time stars like
Rickey Jackson may have been ill-advised. What often went
overlooked, however, is that Mora inherited a club that had never
been to the playoffs before his arrival and led it to the only four
postseason berths in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last three or four years (in New Orleans) were hard
years, man, very hard years,'' Mora said after a Colts practice
session. ``They took it to me pretty good. We had teams that I
thought would be better than they were. Things got pretty personal
and I took them that way. Geez, it was a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no such problems in Indianapolis, where the lack
of expectation surrounding the '98 Colts has afforded Mora and team
president Bill Polian a grace year. But where the fans of New
Orleans were ungrateful, the public here, even 14 years after the
Colts' arrival, remains unsophisticated. Sports fans still care
more about Bob Knight's recruiting classes than budding superstar
quarterback Peyton Manning, so the incremental steps Mora and the
team have taken this year have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the perception he is an extreme football
conservative, Mora has had offensive coordinator Tom Moore open the
offense up for Manning, and the result is it's No. 11 in the
league. There remains a daunting rebuilding task on defense, and a
disadvantageous salary cap situation for '99 could slow progress.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mora, who has rebuilt his image after the Carolina
incident and reassessed his priorities, there have been more
difficult challenges. His season away from the game _ a '97
campaign in which he was interviewed for vacancies in St. Louis and
San Diego but ended up working as a studio analyst for NBC _
certainly has re-energized him. More important, it has improved his
flagging self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last couple of years in New Orleans, I definitely lost
some (confidence),'' Mora said. ``You want to talk about
frustration, that was it. So now, looking back, I'm glad I had the
year off. I'm refreshed. I'm upbeat. I look down the road and
there's hope here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I know I'm a good coach and I don't give a damn what
anyone else thinks.

 &HT;    Next Bledsoe test is facing Steelers
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two weeks ago, New England's Drew Bledsoe culminated a
frenetic last-minute rally against Miami, when free safety Brock
Marion fell down backpedaling. The Patriots quarterback, despite
having fractured the index finger of his throwing hand a few snaps
earlier, took advantage of the Dolphins' pratfall to find a
wide-open Shawn Jefferson with the winning touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, officials enabled Bledsoe to pull out a game with
their controversial pass interference call in the end zone which
set up a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Coates with no time
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of excitement is on tap for Sunday's game at Three
Rivers Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've played there,'' Bledsoe said, ``it might take
another miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Pittsburgh Steelers own six consecutive home
victories against the Patriots, the most recent a 7-6 squeaker in
the 1997 playoffs. The loser between these talented, but
torturously inconsistent, teams likely will miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   After the '97 playoff game, in which Bledsoe lost a fumble and
threw an interception on New England's final two possessions,
teammates came down hard on him. It didn't help, of course, that
Bledsoe demonstrated no public remorse at his blunders. Instead, he
spent his postgame time schmoozing with agent Leigh Steinberg and
fellow client Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's heroics in recent days has all but expunged those
memories from some teammates. But Bledsoe hasn't forgotten, and he
enters Three Rivers in search of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a win and I need to play well against those guys for a
change,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the NFL ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: Tampa Bay has lost six in a row to Green
Bay and averaged only 9.0 points. A loss on Monday night all but
eliminates the Buccaneers from a wild-card spot. The Bucs will find
a way to win against a Packers team with plenty of injuries and the
distractions accompanying the pending exit of coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: The in-line collisions between Tennessee
tailback Eddie George and Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis
will be bone-rattling. But we prefer a duel between Colts tailback
Marshall Faulk and Falcons linebackers Cornelius Bennett and Keith
Brooking. The Indy star has become the NFL's biggest threat out of
the backfield. The Falcons linebackers have superior coverage
skills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Niners quarterback Steve Young needs one
touchdown pass to reach the 30 mark for the second time in his
career. Against a crippled Carolina secondary, he'll get it in the
first five minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: Neither Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas
nor Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe is likely to forget the
late-game debacle of three weeks ago. The refs will be watching
these two from the time they step off the bus. Thomas won't draw
three personal fouls again, but there's going to be some bad, bad
blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: The games usually aren't good, but there always
seems to be a subplot or two when the Cardinals and Giants meet.
This time is no different. New York quarterback Kent Graham was
once the starter in Arizona but was dumped in favor of Jake
Plummer. Giants coach Jim Fassell is a one-time Cardinals offensive
coordinator.

ESPY DECLARES HIMSELF `CERTIFIABLY CLEAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mike Espy recalls in detail the grim mood of the
White House four years ago when, with a corruption inquiry looming,
he was forced to walk the political plank as secretary of
agriculture with, he says, a farewell handshake and a firm promise
from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton poll numbers were tanking and Whitewater had just
begun and they did not need any more trouble,'' Espy said Thursday,
recalling his forced resignation even as he awaited word from the
president to see whether Clinton might bring up that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he wants to talk about,'' said Espy, who, a day after
his acquittal in an independent counsel prosecution, carefully
declined to discuss the president's words. ``I'm sure we'll
converse shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
dampened speculation that the president, now caught in the
impeachment ordeal, might soon deliver on any four-year-old hope
Espy harbors for reappointment to government. Clinton hailed the
acquittal as heartening and expressed hope Espy could in some
fashion continue his service to the country.
</P>
<P>
   In defeating a 30-count indictment brought after a four-year,
$17 million inquiry, Espy was celebrating a major setback for the
independent counsel law and for Donald Smaltz, the prosecutor who
failed to convict him of breaking the law in accepting sports
tickets and favors from companies his agency regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a bit of a megalomaniac,'' Espy said of Smaltz,
whom the Espy defense team criticized in particular for having
contended after the acquittal that ``the actual indictment of a
public official may in fact be as great a deterrent as a
conviction'' of that official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Kafkaesque,'' said Ted Wells, an Espy defense lawyer.
``Why not just randomly execute a few innocent people?'' he asked,
complaining that Smaltz, Kenneth Starr and other independent
counsels have unlimited time, resources and zeal once an official
has become the focus of an inquiry and the prosecutors' reputations
are on the line. ``It is inevitable that it will become a witch
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz was not available for comment but William Noakes Jr., his
associate counsel and spokesman, said it was inaccurate to
interpret Smaltz's comment to mean that he brought the indictment
to make an example without concern for whether Espy would be
convicted. ``I don't think he was saying in the abstract that the
indictment was going to send a message,'' he said. ``But when you
have an indictment and there are facts that come out in a trial
over eights weeks, that does send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers criticized the remark as graceless and morally
wrong, but Espy's other defense lawyer, Reid Weingarten, conceded
there probably was no ethical violation in a losing prosecutor's
claiming to find virtue in his failed indictment. Weingarten said
the Espy prosecution was so sweeping and single-minded that he had
been unable to approach the independent counsel in the informal but
crucial way defense lawyers often point to weaknesses in a
prosecutor's case before going to trial. In a typical Justice
Department prosecution, he said, professionals would have ordered
the Espy inquiry closed after six months for lack of strong
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably more certifiably clean than anybody in the
city,'' Espy declared in an interview at his lawyers' office.
``I've been looked at from head to toe,'' he said, from tax
statements to home mortgage applications, personal diaries
included.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had greater strength after the four-year ordeal in
which he relied on the Bible and martial arts for spiritual
comfort. But he listed a variety of damaging effects, too. Espy
said that Michelle Matlock, his twin sister, is now burdened with
extensive legal bills because she had been summoned to testify
about him. Untrue rumors of a hidden business deal were enough to
block a bank loan for an old friend and respected farmer back home
in Yazoo City, Miss., he added.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the trial led him to discover who his real friends
were, Espy said. ``Very few in this town,'' he declared. Yet he is
considering opening a law office in Washington, among other options
for repairing his career. ``Never say never,'' he added to the
question about whether he might consider a possible run for
Mississippi governor or other office. ``Adversity can be a boon to
you even perhaps politically,'' he said, as ``somebody who beat
City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy said he fervidly wanted to testify at his trial but his
defense team had him sit mute because of the government's weak
case. Smaltz's tally of more than $30,000 in reported gift-taking
was a ``sham figure,' Espy said, insisting the amount of
questionable gifts actually totaled no more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Of skybox sports tickets he accepted from one agricultural
corporation, Espy said that government business was not discussed
and the jury found it not to be a crime. In retrospect, he
admitted, ``I probably shouldn't have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, ``I am guilty of being inattentive and in some
cases stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy would not discuss his legal costs from the four-year
struggle, which are not reimbursable under the independent counsel
law. Officials under investigation who are cleared short of
indictment do get reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter,'' he said. ``I want to teach ethics classes in
Mississippi _ I think I'm an expert now,'' he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten countered, ``No, in D.C., in Washington.''

 &HT;    Bush visits Mideast leaders on vacation
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, still weary from an
overseas journey with presidential overtones, said Thursday he
learned that Israel is a nation with unlimited potential and Italy
is a country with many mopeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is short on natural resources in terms of resources you
find in the ground, but it is very long on the most natural
resource of all, which is brain power,'' said Bush. ``Israel has
got a tremendous amount of talent, smart folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned Wednesday from a three-day trip organized by the
National Jewish Coalition, a Republican organization. Govs. Mike
Leavitt of Utah, Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Marc Racicot of
Montana also made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The governors met with Israeli leaders. A proposed meeting with
Yasser Arafat did not happen because the Palestinian leader was in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip began with a family vacation in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable experience to go to a place where there
are millions of mopeds and artifacts from centuries ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While in Italy, Bush took a sidetrip to meet Egyptian president
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to listen and learn, and I learned a lot,'' Bush
said of his Middle East trip. ``I learned a lot about the history
of Israel and the history of my own particular religion and the
history of religions that are now the dominant religions of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been involved in a dialogue with Abraham Foxman,
president of the Anti-Defamation League, a vigilant voice against
anti-Semitism, concerning Bush's 1993 comment that he believed
heaven was open only to followers of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman, who believes Bush harbors no religious intolerance, said
earlier this week he is expecting a letter from Bush expanding on
his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he addressed the issue in an October letter to
Foxman. The governor declined on Thursday to release the letter,
which he deemed a ``personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it communicated the same thoughts he laid out at
Thursday's news conference, which he said have been consistent for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior
is my salvation,'' he said. ``And I believe that. I also, though,
made it very clear that it's not the governor's role to decide who
goes to heaven. I That's God's role.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has shown his appreciation for all faiths while in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have shown people that I'm a tolerant person. And my job as
governor is to use my office to promote dialogue and discussion and
mutual understanding and mutual respect. I've got great respect for
the other religions of the world. But I happen to firmly believe
what I just told you about the tenets of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believes heaven is open only to Christians, Bush
said, ``No, I don't believe that. I believe God decides who goes to
heaven, not George W. Bush.''

NFL APOLOGIZES TO BILLS, ADMITS OFFICIATING ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson said Thursday the National
Football League has apologized to his team and acknowledged that
its officiating crew erred on the two controversial decisions that
gave the New England Patriots a last-second, 25-21 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they blew both of those calls,'' said Wilson
after being fined $50,000 for complaining about the officials to
the press. ``They said they were sorry but admitted they were
wrong. I was upset because they cost us the ballgame. I know these
(officials) are trying their hardest and trying to make the right
call, but I have every right to get upset, talk about it when
something like that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson later issued a statement upbraiding NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue for the fine. ``I don't like the fine,'' he said before
issuing the press release. It's excessive and it's punitive. And I
didn't like the tone of his letter when he is lecturing me like
some kid who is being punished. I've been around pro football a lot
longer than he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson believes the officiating cost his team a critical AFC
East game. A win would have kept the Bills in a first-place tie; a
loss virtually would have knocked the Patriots out of playoff
contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were leading, 21-16, in the final 30 seconds at
Foxboro Stadium and the Patriots had fourth down and 9 yards to go
at the Buffalo 34. If the Patriots failed to get a first down on
the play, the game would have been over because they had no
timeouts left.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe threw a pass to the right sideline,
where wide receiver Shawn Jefferson made a diving catch but
appeared not only to be out of bounds but also short of the
first-down marker.
</P>
<P>
   After a sideline conference, the officials ruled it a catch and
gave New England new life with a first down. Six seconds remained
when Bledsoe lofted a pass into the left corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Terry Glenn jumped high over a cluster of Bills and
Patriots but dropped the ball after it hit him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the official nearest the play called pass interference
on Buffalo, giving the Patriots the ball on the 1 with no time left
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe then hit tight end Ben Coates for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   By league rule, the game must be played to its conclusion except
when a score takes place in the overtime. That meant a conversion
attempt was still necessary. But the Bills ran off the field. The
Patriots were called back and executed a 2-point conversion with no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Wilson, general manager John Butler, coach Wade
Phillips, and many of the Buffalo players said the Bills had been
robbed and the officials blew both calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buffalo dressing room, Wilson said, ``This was the worst.
It's embarrassing to the league. Not that the Patriots don't have a
good team; they have a heck of a team. But we got robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner added that he had predicted the interference call
before the play ``because I've seen it all across the league this
year. I don't know what can be done about it. That's the kind of
officiating we've got _ it is the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The league started a review Tuesday. Wilson said he was notified
by fax from Tagliabue of the $50,000 fine and felt the tone of the
commissioner's letter was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he wrote his stinging reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``On December 2d I received a fax from Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue informing me the Bills are being fined $50,000 for
criticism on my part of officiating in the last moments of our game
with New England. I described two calls, back-to-back, as probably
the worst I have witnessed in the 60 years I have watched pro
football. Those two calls cost the Bills a very important game, one
in which our team fought back very courageously from a substantial
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society today is more enlightened. Fair comment and criticism
are rampant. The entire media as a unit is frank and the millions
watching a game are frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Commissioner, lecturing to me as if I were a novice
instead of one who has been involved in football infinitely longer
than he has, contends that criticizing a call has `destructive and
corrosive effects on the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more destructive and corrosive _ errant calls in front
of millions of viewers or my statements of opinion? People all over
the country registered shock at the way the officials, however
honorable their purpose, took the game away from us. Even the
league has admitted to us that the calls near the conclusion of the
game were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday morning the Commissioner can sermonize on
destruction and corrosion, but he has never experienced the pain of
blowing a crucial game due to officiating. I have yet to decide
whether I will pay or challenge the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, at 80, I do know I don't need pompous lectures from the
Commissioner and I feel that the $50,000 is not only unwarranted,
but punitive in nature. The next time he may ask me to sit in the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Wilson, the league also talked about fining
Phillips for not keeping his team on the field for the conversion.
``They were trying to go after Wade,'' said Wilson, ``but no one
came to him and asked him to bring his team on the field. If they
had, he would have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bills wanted an explanation from the league office
as to why the Patriots had not been penalized when their players
and coaches ran onto the field in celebration after the TD.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says his fine will not change his attitude about the
calls the NFL now admits were wrong and took the game away from his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done to make this different in the
future,'' Wilson said. ``I don't know just what that is yet, but
I'm not finished trying to make this work better.''

 &HT;    NASA to try Endeavor launch again
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ NASA launch managers prepared space
shuttle Endeavour for another launch attempt at 3:36 a.m. today
after deciding an alarm that thwarted Thursday's launch wasn't a
real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to crank this thing up and try it again,'' NASA
spokesman Dwayne Brown said Friday evening as the launch team began
refueling the shuttle's huge external tank. The tank's loads of
supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen were drained after
Thursday's scrub.
</P>
<P>
   NASA weather experts gave a promising forecast of 60 percent
odds for weather favorable to a launch, but it was less than a
guarantee: A good forecast early Thursday turned into a nailbiter
waiting for scattered showers to drift out before launch time.
</P>
<P>
   They did, but the launch was scrubbed 19 seconds before liftoff
after a cockpit alarm stopped the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything for this mission because Endeavour must
enter a precisely planned orbit to rendezvous with Zarya, a
Russian-built craft in space.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour carries another piece of hardware, the Unity
connecting node, that is to be docked with Zarya in the first step
of assembling the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's six-person crew includes former Troy resident
Nancy Currie, the astronaut who will use Endeavour's robot arm to
position the two modules for docking.
</P>
<P>
   The master caution alarm sounded on Endeavour's flight deck four
minutes before liftoff. The alarm puzzled the crew and launch
engineers because no other messages or lights went on to signal a
specific problem.
</P>
<P>
   Launch controllers stopped the clock at minus 31 seconds, while
engineers checked data on the shuttle's myriad systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative approach is not to progress with something we
don't understand,'' launch integration manager Donald McMonagle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers pinned the alarm to a brief pressure spike in the
shuttle's hydraulic system and decided it wasn't a real problem.
Launch controllers resumed the countdown, but they called it off
seconds later because too much liquid oxygen propellant had drained
away during the countdown hold.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen draining is part of the shuttle's engine starting
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Another scrub today could put a serious kink in Endeavour's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A single 10-minute launch window exists each morning, but Roe
expressed concern for the launch team, which went through its
second sleepless night Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If today's launch were scrubbed, ``one of the things we will
want to look at is team fatigue,'' Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   Further delays would shortly put Endeavour's launch in conflict
with plans to launch the Mars Climate Orbiter, scheduled for a
liftoff on an unmanned Delta 2 rocket. Shuttle managers say
Endeavour has to fly by Tuesday or be rescheduled, possibly after
the first of the year.

IS IT TIME FOR STEVENS' TOTAL ECLIPSE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Is this the year Gary Stevens finally wins the
Eclipse Award as the nation's outstanding jockey?
</P>
<P>
   It could depend on which version of the ``official'' statistics
is mailed to Eclipse voters at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is based here in Southern California, ranks first
in earnings with more than $18.8 million in purses this year,
according to the list put out by the Equibase Company under the
auspices of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   But he's only third, with $16.2 million, behind Kentucky's Pat
Day ($17.2 million) and New York's Jerry Bailey ($17 million), in
the list published more widely by the Daily Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the Racing Form doesn't count races run
outside North America, costing Stevens credit for Silver Charm's
$2.4 million victory in the Dubai World Cup last March and other
foreign earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings isn't the definitive statistic when it comes to
comparing jockeys _ there is no definitive statistic _ but it's the
first one the voting reporters and racing executives are likely to
read. Thus, the Racing Form and the NTRA have a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to unify all the data,'' said Irwin
Cohen, a Racing Form senior vice president, whose goal is ``a level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eclipse is for North American jockeys, voters won't
be out of line if they consider the results of the Dubai World Cup,
which has emerged the past few years as one of the sport's biggest
events and always draws top U.S. horses and riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you really can overlook a race like the Dubai
World Cup when one of the leading horses (Silver Charm) in the
United States is going over there,'' said Chris Scherf, executive
VP of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, which runs the Eclipse
voting.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to give riders credit for purses earned when
they ride North America-based horses overseas but not when they
ride foreign-based horses overseas. That way, Stevens' Dubai World
Cup money would count, because 1997 Kentucky Derby winner Silver
Charm is all American, but the $250,000 Stevens earned in the Dubai
Duty Free the same week would not, because he won that race aboard
an Arab-based horse.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy would require judgment calls and produce more
controversy than it prevents.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Cohen said, the keepers of the racing statistics
will agree to include the Dubai World Cup and the Dubai among about
a dozen foreign races ``in which Americans routinely ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it will be up to Eclipse voters to decide which of each
jockey's accomplishments to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it works when voters compare the horses who are up
for divisional Eclipse Awards. Horses' foreign races are included
in the Racing Form past-performance charts that are mailed with the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 35, was voted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1997 but
has never won an Eclipse, although he's been close, coming in
second to Jose Santos in 1990 and to Bailey more recently.
</P>
<P>
   He has three factors going for him in '98:
</P>
<P>
   All of his important numbers compare well with the other
contenders. His horses' earnings per race ($22,481, if you include
Dubai) dwarf Bailey's $16,575 and Day's $14,051. His million-dollar
victories (five) dwarf Bailey's two and Day's one. And although
Bailey leads with 14 Grade I wins, five of those came aboard Skip
Away, two involved Banshee Breeze and two involved Escena; Stevens'
six Grade I wins involved six different horses.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens did well in the brightest spotlights, riding two winners
on Breeders' Cup Day and riding Victory Gallop to a dramatic win
over Real Quiet and Kent Desormeaux in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters might be tired of Bailey, who has won the award the past
three years, an Eclipse record for jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Stevens is out of the country again this week,
riding in Japan before returning to Hollywood Park on Sunday to
ride Manistique in the Bayakoa Handicap. Will the Japan earnings
count? We'll have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The weekend: &LR;  The race that produced Hollywood Park's
first-ever walkover in 1997 might be close to a one-horse race in
'98.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharp Cat circled the track alone to win the Bayakoa
Handicap. Sunday, Manistique might have only two opponents in the 1
1/16-mile race for fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Stripes and India Divina, South America-breds who have
yet to win a stakes in this country, are the only other confirmed
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique was the nation's hottest 3-year-old after she won her
first three races, including the Hollywood Oaks, by a combined 31
lengths. But she has been sidelined because of a throat infection
since finishing third to Banshee Breeze in the Alabama Stakes at
Saratoga in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have big plans for her,'' said John Shirreffs,
who trains the huge daughter of 1990 Kentucky Derby winner
Unbridled for owner Marshall Naify. ``But, for now, we just want to
get her through (the Bayakoa).''
</P>
<P>
   Not much will stand in her way. &QL;

JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON TO CLOSE PLANTS AND CUT JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to bolster lagging earnings, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the
world's fifth-largest drug maker, announced Thursday that it would
take an $800 million charge in the fourth quarter in part to close
36 plants and cut 4,100 jobs, about 4 percent of its global work
force. Eleven of the plants are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come as Johnson &AMP; Johnson, one of the most diversified
companies in the pharmaceutical industry, struggles to keep pace
with its competitors. In the third quarter, the company posted an
11 percent increase in earnings, one of the worst performances in
the industry, while most of its competitors had gains of some 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were surprised Thursday not so much that Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was reorganizing but that the cuts were so severe. In the
next 12 to 18 months, the company will eliminate 5,800 jobs
worldwide, primarily in manufacturing, with 2,500 of those coming
in the United States. At the same time, the company will add 1,700
jobs, bringing the net reduction to 4,100 people. Some of the
displaced people may fill the new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Johnson &AMP; Johnson has three large divisions _
medical equipment, consumer products and pharmaceuticals _ the job
cuts will not be evenly divided. Company executives confirmed
Thursday that the pharmaceutical operations would largely be
spared, with the majority of the job cuts coming from the medical
devices and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy virtually guarantees that few pink slips will be
passed out at Johnson &AMP; Johnson's headquarters in New Brunswick,
N.J. Company officials said late Thursday that of the 11,000 people
who work in New Jersey, about 160 are expected to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Darretta, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's chief financial officer,
said late Thursday that the majority of job cuts were coming from
the company's consumer and professional divisions because both
units were being converted from primarily local to regional
operations. The pharmaceutical division already largely functioned
under a regional system, Darretta said.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, though, made up only half of the company's $800
million charge. Johnson &AMP; Johnson will write off $300 million of
research and development with the company's $3.5 billion
acquisition of DePuy Inc., an orthopedics company. Darretta said
the remaining $100 million consisted of miscellaneous charges,
including $50 million to write off good will from several of the
company's previous acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization should generate annual savings of $250
million to $300 million, the company said. Analysts said Thursday
that the savings should bolster Johnson &AMP; Johnson's earnings gains
to 14 percent a year, well ahead of its current pace.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's reorganization comes at an odd time for the
company. Even though its third-quarter earnings gain was only half
that of some of its competitors, investors recently sent the
company's shares to record highs. Analysts said anxious investors
had traditionally bought shares in Johnson &AMP; Johnson because the
company was a consistent performer during periods of market
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with the investor frenzy, there had always been a hint
of trouble within the company. Last month, Johnson &AMP; Johnson
announced that it would not meet its $3 a share earnings forecast
for 1999. That only raised more criticism on Wall Street that the
company's diverse products, which include the world's largest line
of medical equipment and Band-Aid adhesive bandages, was taking
valuable resources away from its high-margin pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that more evident than the company's stock. Even
though Johnson &AMP; Johnson's stock hit record highs this year, it
could not match its competitors' gains. The company's shares have
increased 20.8 percent so far this year, compared with 82.4 percent
for Warner-Lambert and 47.9 percent for Pfizer. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's drug index is up 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's shares closed Thursday at $79.5625, down
93.75 cents. The market had closed before the company's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson &AMP; Johnson is just starting to feel some of the
setbacks from some of their businesses,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical investment
research company in New York. ``The over-the-counter drug business
is only growing at 1 percent annually. Johnson &AMP; Johnson can close
some of these plants and not lose any efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts generally applauded Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
reorganization, Darretta denied that the company's realignment had
anything to do with its competitors' sizzling earnings
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not related to our competition at all,'' he said. ``I
have no idea what this realignment will do to our stock price
tomorrow. But what I do know is that because of it our company will
have a stronger future.''

BILL WOULD CAP TUITION AT STATE SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Taking the unusual step of having the entire state
Senate co-sponsor legislation, lawmakers proposed a bill Thursday
that would cap tuition and fees at state colleges and universities
at one-third or less what it costs to educate each student.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Legislature has aimed to limit student costs in
budgets for the state's colleges and the University of
Massachusetts over the past two years, Thursday's move would put it
into statute, effectively making it illegal to raise tuition beyond
a certain point in a state that for years has had some of the most
expensive state colleges and universities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Ways and Means Chairman Stan Rosenberg, who has filed the
bill in past years, said he hopes the fact that the entire Senate
has signed onto this year's proposal will increase its chances of
getting support from the House and Gov. Paul Cellucci. But as an
additional inducement, the bill also adds a provision that would
require schools to meet certain performance standards or risk
losing state money. This would prevent costs from rising too much _
and the state being stuck with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters call it ``Ed reform for higher ed,'' likening it to
the 1993 Education Reform Act that required the state to pay at
least 50 percent of what it costs to run public elementary and
secondary schools, and at the same time demanded more of those
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about it is that it's a strong commitment to
public higher education, which is just ancillary to our commitment
to K-12, and it does insist on acccountability,'' said Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham. ``That's the explicit bargain we
struck with the Commonwealth when we passed the Education Reform
Act, and that is the type of symmetry the taxpayers can reasonably
demand. People are decent and inclined to be generous to education,
but they are not patsies, and they don't want their money to be
thrown down a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   For students and for schools, the so-called ``fair-share'' bill
would mean stability and predictability.
</P>
<P>
   Many students were squeezed out of public higher education in
the 1980s and early 1990s, as state funding was slashed 22 percent
and tuition and fees more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by 1994, Massachusetts' community colleges were the
most expensive in the nation, state colleges the seventh most
expensive, and UMass the fourth most expensive state university.
</P>
<P>
   Under fair share, which first came out of a 1994 report by a
commission of legislators and academics, students at state colleges
and UMass would pay no more than one third their tuition and fees,
and community college students would get even more of a break, with
their tuition and fees capped at 25 percent of the cost of their
education.
</P>
<P>
   With tuition cuts set by the state Board of Higher Education,
students now pay 33.2 percent of the cost of their education at
UMass. At state colleges, students pay anywhere from 40 percent of
the cost of education (at Bridgewater State) to 19.5 percent the
cost (at Massachusetts Maritime Academy). Community college
students pay anywhere from 27 to 40 percent the cost of their
education.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at schools with higher costs would shrink to the
one-third or one-quarter share within three years. If the state
were to slash funds to schools, tuition would drop.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires schools to achieve a certain level of
support from federal grants, endowment, and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the proposal would be $269.2 million over the
four years.
</P>
<P>
   James F.Carlin, head of the state's board of higher education,
and the force behind both tuition cuts and increased
accountability, said he supported the Senate proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to work hard to fine tune it so it will get broad
support,'' he said. ``There is one aspect of fair share that has to
be resolved before it will get house or administration support and
that is, how do you manage the aggregate cost of higher education
in a realistic, workable manner.If there can be controls on cost,
the proposal will have much smoother sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Carlin said, he supports performance standards,
which have now been adopted in some form in over half the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of higher education in the US and in Massachusetts
over the last 20 years has gone up double the inflation rate,'' he
said. ``We also know the cost of higher education has gone up
nationally faster than the cost of health care. Unless the fair
share proposal has some workable mechanisms for cost control, it's
going to be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Cellucci said the governor would not
comment on the proposal until he has seen it. But, said Nicole St.
Peter, ``The governor is committed to making the state's colleges
and universities affordable for all families.''

ESCAPED PRISONER'S BODY BELIEVED TO BE FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two off-duty corrections officers fishing at a bridge
on the Trinity River late Thursday afternoon came across the body
of a man in inmates' clothing caught in the current, and officials
said it appeared to be Martin Gurule, the convicted murderer who
vanished early Friday after becoming the first inmate to escape
from death row in Texas since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The bloated body was found at 5:30 p.m. under a bridge about
four miles from the Texas prison system's Ellis Unit, where all of
the state's death-row inmates are held and from which Gurule
escaped last Friday shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said Thursday night that they could not yet say
for certain that the body was that of the 29-year-old Corpus
Christi man, who was convicted after the 1992 murder of a
restaurant owner and a cook during a robbery. But, they said, since
the body was in prison-style clothing and shoes and no one else was
missing from the prison, it appeared likely.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was one of seven inmates who plotted to escape from the
largest death row in the United States by cutting through a fence
surrounding a prison recreation yard and moving onto a nearby roof.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:20 a.m. Friday, the men dropped to the ground and began to
move toward the two perimeter fences surrounding the Ellis Unit,
when officers in two guard towers 200 feet away opened fire. All
but Gurule surrendered immediately. Gurule made it over the two
10-foot fences, topped with razor wire, and into the nearby piney
woods that flank the facility on three sides.
</P>
<P>
   Police dogs later lost his scent down a nearby road and the
authorities began a six-day manhunt that included guards posted
along all roads near the prison, boat patrols on the Trinity River,
and teams of officers on horseback and officers with dogs picking
through the dense woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend one dog team found the 2-inch piece of hacksaw
blade that Gurule and the others apparently used to cut their way
through the fence. But before the discovery of the body on
Thursday, there was no indication of what had become of the escaped
inmate, which led to growing speculation that he had slipped past
the officers and out of the rough woods surrounding the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The long manhunt transformed Gurule _ before his escape a
little-known inmate on Texas' death row _ into a nationally known
fugitive, and there were many reported sightings of him throughout
the state. What might have happened to him became a hot topic of
conversation. There was speculation that he was still hiding in the
woods or that he had made it past the police lines and forced his
way into a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   All the time, though, prison spokesmen said they remained
convinced that Gurule was still somewhere in the woods, largely
because they had no hard evidence that he was not and because the
vast majority of escapees are caught before getting more than a few
miles from the prison.
</P>
<P>
   As tension mounted and pressure built on officials to explain
what had happened and where Gurule had gone, Allan Polunsky, the
chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, said prison
officials intended to bring Gurule back ``dead or alive, and it
really doesn't make any difference in my opinion which it will
be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials changed their tactics, easing up on the
dog and horse patrols into the woods, hoping to make Gurule believe
that the pressure was easing and it was safe for him to move. Still
there was no sign of him.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier Thursday, as the manhunt moved into its sixth
morning, prison officials announced a reward for information
leading to Gurule's capture.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said on Tuesday that they were closing down the
work program that allowed about 150 of the death-row inmates access
to the recreation yard for several hours each day _ rather than the
one hour per day other condemned prisoners receive _ and a
commission was appointed by prison officials to investigate the
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Stringfellow, a member of the state board that oversees the
Texas prison system, said the investigation would be aimed at
finding out what had gone wrong and what could be done to prevent
future escapes.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday, before the
discovery of the body, that he wanted another, more independent
investigation by the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset about it,'' he said. ``I've asked the Texas Rangers
to step in and answer the questions for me and for Texas.''

EDITORIAL: EUROPE FINALLY ACTS ON INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The world's economic situation remains delicate, but until now
European central banks have refused to join in international
efforts to lower interest rates. Thus it is salutary that the
German Bundesbank and other major central banks announced rate cuts
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Hans Tietmayer, the head of the Bundesbank,
finally yielded to the pressure to cut rates is also an indication
that the economic outlook in Europe is weakening. Europe and the
United States have been the bastions of strength in a world economy
plagued by recessions in Asia and signs of downturns in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the major Western economies is how they can
continue to prosper while the rest of the world suffers. In the
United States, consumers remain confident and this Christmas looks
like a strong one for many retailers, notwithstanding poor sales at
Sears. But the industrial sector continues to suffer _ as Boeing
workers facing layoffs can attest _ and some measures of industrial
activity indicate a risk of recession.
</P>
<P>
   In this unsettled time, the World Bank's annual report on global
economic prospects, released this week, contained reasonably
encouraging forecasts. While it said global growth this year was
expected to be only half the level of 1997, it forecast a mild
recovery in 1999 as East Asian economies stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Bank warned that a global recession next year was
a possibility if things go wrong. Insuring against that possibility
_ through reforms in many countries and through pro-growth policies
_ should be the goal for policy-makers. It is likely that the new
European Central Bank, which formally takes over monetary policy in
the 11 European countries that will adopt a common currency at the
end of the month, will need to lower interest rates again next
year.

 UNDATED: her fetus. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, said Dr. John Moore, a researcher at the Aaron
Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, scientists had an
advantage in their studies.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the epidemic, thousands of patients have
volunteered to be followed closely, providing cells for genetic
analysis and medical records that would allow researchers to
correlate their disease progression with their genetic inheritance.
Those large groups of patients were the key to discovering the
relationships of genes to the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is all but useless, Moore said, to look at an individual and
ask why that particular person did, or did not, have a rapidly
progressing infection. Scientists need to look at close to 1,000
individuals to see if a particular genetic pattern persists in
people with particular disease patterns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current discovery builds on recent research showing that
CCR5, a protein on the surface of cells, can act as a doorway for
HIV. Then, about a year ago, Ahuja discovered genes that control
the CCR5 gene, the so-called CCR5 promoter genes.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further investigation, O'Brien and his colleagues,
including Dr. Maureen P. Martin and Dr. Mary Carrington, discovered
that there were 10 genetic sites within the CCR5 promoter that
varied from person to person, and each site had two possible
genetic forms. That meant there were a total of 1,024 possible
normal genetic variations of the gene.
</P>
<P>
   But, O'Brien said, when they looked for the variations in a
group of 2,400 people, ``mercifully, only four were common.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and his colleagues next examined genetic and medical
data from 700 people who had been infected with HIV. Close to 15
percent had progressed rapidly to severe illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Of them, 10 percent to 17 percent had a particular variant of
the CCR5 promoter gene, the investigators found. The investigators
expect that other, as yet undiscovered genes, will explain why the
others deteriorated so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he saw the growing understanding of how genes
determine the course of an HIV infection in terms of an epic
struggle between the virus and the human body.
</P>
<P>
   As a swarm of billions of viruses try to invade cells, they
require collaboration from the body _ its cells, enzymes and
molecular pathways that facilitate the course of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, the body can throw up a roadblock and slow or
prevent the viral attack. And at any stage, genes that control
cellular functions that may seem only tenuously connected to
infection with the AIDS virus can take on key roles.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth K. Kidd, a professor of genetics and psychiatry at
Yale University, said the AIDS scenario was typical of diseases in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease is not generally a single thing that goes wrong,'' he
said. ``It is a process, a multi-stage process, and many of the
symptoms are results of secondary effects that develop later and
affect another system.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, he said, there are myriad ways for different genes to
alter the course of a disease.
</P>
<P>
   With AIDS, said Dr. Gregory Stock, the director of the program
on medicine, technology and science at the UCLA School of Medicine,
``we are just beginning to see the kinds of things that will occur
in many, many diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be incredibly interesting,'' Stock said.
``We're entering a renaissance.''

U.S. REPORT SAYS SALINAS' BANKERS IGNORED SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eager to do business with Raul Salinas de Gortari, a brother of
the former President of Mexico, Citibank executives ignored some of
the bank's own safeguards against the laundering of illicit funds,
a congressional report says.
</P>
<P>
   As the bankers took in millions of dollars from Salinas, they
never asked for standard information on his financial background
and made virtually no effort to verify the source of the money, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After Salinas was arrested for murder in 1995 and lawyers for
the bank had begun monitoring his accounts, his personal banker in
New York quietly advised Salinas' wife to move the money elsewhere,
apparently without the consent of the legal department.
</P>
<P>
   And even when Citibank finally warned federal officials about
Salinas' suspicious transactions, and after Mrs. Salinas had been
arrested as well, the bank failed to tell the government about the
network of foreign shell companies and offshore accounts that the
bank had set up to shield the Salinas fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures, in a report by the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, represent the most detailed
accounting yet of how Salinas used a special Citibank unit reserved
for the wealthiest customers to move up to $100 million out of
Mexico secretly.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and the bank have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Whether
any U.S. laws were broken remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are continuing to investigate
the possibility that Citibank, a unit of Citigroup Inc., illegally
laundered the money. Officials at the Justice Department and the
Federal Reserve Bank refused to discuss the case with congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation underscores why federal regulators are
stepping up scrutiny of the high-end services called private
banking and why they have begun to propose steps for banks to track
customers' financial movements and backgrounds more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined in the Salinas scenario that Citibank's
voluntary controls did not work,'' the investigators wrote.
``Citibank, while violating only one aspect of its then policies,
facilitated a money-managing system that disguised the origin,
destination and beneficial owner of the funds involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was issued weeks after Swiss authorities had moved to
confiscate $114 million from Salinas, asserting that the funds were
protection money paid by drug traffickers. Mexican officials also
recently announced that they had frozen an additional $119 million
in a maze of other accounts that Salinas controlled.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, the bank said the report ``contains
errors of fact and interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bank, Richard Howe, would neither detail the
errors nor address any specific issues in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that officials in the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, which has not investigated the case,
believed that the civil bank-secrecy statute had probably not been
violated. The law says prosecutors can only prove that Salinas or
the bank violated money-laundering statutes if they first show that
the money was from an unlawful source. The prosecutors would then
have to demonstrate that the bank knew or should have known that
the money was illicit.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials familiar with the case said their
principal challenge had been to amass enough evidence to prove in a
criminal trial that Salinas had earned his money by one of the
handful of crimes, like drug trafficking, that are covered abroad
under the federal money-laundering statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss investigators, who faced a much lower evidentiary
threshold to confiscate Salinas' deposits there, based their case
in part on statements by convicted drug traffickers imprisoned in
the United States. Although U.S. officials have dismissed some of
those potential witnesses as unreliable, they said the prosecutors
in New York had interviewed others whom they considered credible.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether any figures in the new group have gone
before the grand jury in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying as a government witness in an earlier
money-laundering trial, the Citibank executive who worked on
Salinas' account, Amy Elliott, suggested that the bank's ``know
your customer'' policies were fundamental to its efforts to avoid
easing the way for illegal transactions.
</P>
<P>
   That case, in 1994, involved a former gasoline-station attendant
from northern Mexico who masqueraded as an upstanding executive to
launder huge sums of money for one of the biggest drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Elliott stated that she and her colleagues had
evaluated their potential customers carefully, checking their
business dealings and credit backgrounds and visiting them up to 12
times a year, the congressional investigators found that she worked
quite differently with Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citibank made no attempt to investigate Salinas' background
before accepting him'' as a customer in 1992, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   It notes that Ms. Elliott, still an employee in good standing,
filed neither a standard financial profile nor a financial
background check. Nor, as bank policy required, did she ask to have
the requirement for a profile waived.
</P>
<P>
   Although Salinas had never been formally accused of wrongdoing,
rumors of possible corruption were widespread in Mexican financial
circles. Nonetheless, Ms. Elliott later told prosecutors in a
deposition, she thought of her new customer as something akin to
``a Rockefeller.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott said in her statement that she believed that much of
Salinas' money came from the sale of a construction company. But as
the deposits flowed in, generating $1.1 million in fees, bank
officials never learned the company's name.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system Ms. Elliott devised, Salinas' third wife,
Paulina Castanon, would pick up cashier's checks in pesos at
Mexican banks, carry them to the Citibank subsidiary in Mexico
City, convert them to dollars and wire them to New York, using the
name Patricia Rios, a first name that she did not use combined with
her mother's maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators, like Swiss detectives before them,
were unable to establish the source of the pesos that Salinas kept
in Mexican banks. But if he had received drug bribes, they would
have almost certainly been paid in American dollars, the currency
in which drugs are generally sold.
</P>
<P>
   From Mexico, Salinas' money went to a Citibank account in New
York that disguised its origins by mixing it with deposits from
other banks and customers. The funds were then sent to Swiss and
British accounts in the name of a Cayman Islands shell corporation,
Trocca Ltd., that was run by three other offshore shell companies
but secretly controlled by Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report states that after Salinas' arrest in
February 1995, Ms. Elliott filed a brief financial profile and went
to Mexico City without the knowledge or consent of the bank's legal
representative to try to persuade Mrs. Salinas to close her
husband's Citibank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Salinas finally did try to consolidate his holdings, but
was arrested in Switzerland that November. Only then did Citibank
file a criminal referral form, the congressional report states, but
it neglected to mention Trocca or the Swiss or British accounts.

 &HT;    Group promises to fight use of chaplain in Ohio school system
 &HT;    By David Kepple
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Washington-based group that works to protect
the principle of church-state separation has informed Brookville
school officials it will fight any attempt to establish an
``educational chaplaincy'' program in the school system.
</P>
<P>
   If Brookville proceeds with the tentative proposal, it could
become the first public school district in the nation to use the
regular, full-time services of a chaplain _ who would function
roughly along the lines of a military chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the ``educational chaplain'' would be available
to help students, faculty and staff of all backgrounds, and would
not seek to impose a religious agenda on anyone, nor espouse the
beliefs of one religious group over another.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a group
claiming more than 50,000 members, describes itself as ``working to
protect the constitutional principle of church-state separation, a
vital cornerstone of religious liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the school board to reject the proposal for a
volunteer school chaplain,'' wrote Ayesha Khan, a lawyer for the
group, in a warning letter to Brookville Superintendent Larry
Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our review of the job description and the relevant case law
leads us to believe that the proposal is unconstitutional,'' Khan
wrote. ``In the event you elect to proceed . . . we would have
little choice but to bring a legal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan said Thursday that she is unaware of any public school
district in the nation that employs a chaplain, and that Brookville
evidently would be the first if the district were to pursue the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a very peculiar and rare proposal,'' Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial plan has yet to officially reach the school
board, but is being approached with a mix of interest and caution
by district officials. A nine-member steering committee made up of
school officials and community representatives is reviewing the
proposal. That advisory panel hosted about 100 citizens at an Oct.
22 ``town meeting'' to receive public comment on the idea _ with
most of those present supporting the concept.
</P>
<P>
   School board vice president Mark Poesch, who moderated the town
meeting and who serves on the steering committee, said the school
board does not intend to fund the position with tax dollars, nor
would the board spend money to mount a legal defense if the plan
was approved and then challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who also serves on the steering committee, said the
informal panel is set to meet Wednesday and will soon make a
recommendation to the school board about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the chaplaincy idea are the Rev. Howard M. Lee, founder
and director of a group called Public School Chaplaincy for
America, and Lee Behnken, a 40-year-old Brookville native and
evangelical Christian known for his music ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, formerly of Dayton and now living in St. Louis, has
established the PSCA's headquarters in Dayton. Behnken and Lee
approached Henry earlier this year with the chaplaincy concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our public schools are in a national state of emergency,'' Lee
wrote in a document outlining the chaplaincy proposal. ``The need
for motivation, moral support and spiritual support of our students
must be met to alleviate the stresses they suffer from in this
violent society. . . . These stresses can be addressed by a public
school chaplain.''
</P>
<P>
   Behnken, who has written a song called The Christian Anthem in
support of public school chaplaincy, said he'd love to see his
hometown be the first public school system in the U.S. to adopt the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Miller, deputy director of legal services for the Ohio
School Board Association, said Thursday he couldn't comment on the
Brookville matter.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking generally, Miller said, ``I think a district must
be careful, because (case law) is clear that there not only cannot
be an endorsement of one religion over another, but of any
religion. Any sort of religious reflection has to be student driven
_ with a capital 'S.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the New York Daily News , a member of
the New York state assembly is supporting a bill that calls for a
voluntary chaplaincy program at the school district level. That
effort is unrelated to the Public School Chaplaincy of America's
program.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. drafted a bill _ which he plans to
introduce in January _ calling for school chaplains in New York
City schools after Bronx teacher Mildred Rosario was fired earlier
this year for leading her class in prayer. The bill requires
parental consent before a student could be sent to a chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Americans United also have criticized the
Diaz proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In Brookville, Henry said school board members ``were kind of
neutral'' after the original discussion with Behnken and Lee last
spring. ``They said we need to find out more, get the feeling of
the community - and that's what we've been doing ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Poeschl and Henry declined comment on the letter from Americans
United, but Poeschl did say: ``We've received some very good input,
both pro and con, and we are weighing that. We will use all of that
as we reach a decision on what we're going to do.

12-03 -- Israeli Pvt. Gil Shalom strums his guitar at the Tsurit
army post just north of the Israeli border in southern Lebanon. In
the last two weeks, seven Israeli soldiers were killed in the

EXXON-MOBIL MERGER REFLECTS VISION OF TWO MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Tiger and the Flying Horse would have been too
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive of the Exxon
Corp., and Lucio Noto, his counterpart at the Mobil Corp. decided
to refer to the companies they run by the code names Lion and
Moose.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began Lee and Lucio's intensely personal quest to pull off
the world's largest corporate merger, a deal between two companies
that were once part of a monolithic whole but which, during 87
years apart, had grown as proud and self-sufficient as sovereign
empires.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Raymond had insisted that others might seek alliances
and mergers, but that Exxon could only be weakened by taking on a
partner. Meanwhile, Noto had been looking for a huge acquisition or
at least a merger of equals to lift his oil company, already the
nation's second-largest, into Exxon's league.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their board members were skeptical. Others were
incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Raymond and Noto negotiated in secret, the lawyers for
both companies continued battling in court over Exxon's accusation
that Mobil had infringed on a patent worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. And even after they had summoned their respective
directors to gather in New York on Tuesday morning to ratify the
deal, last-minute hitches kept them up late into the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 billion agreement they reached demonstrates that even in
an era of corporate megamergers that require the efforts of
battalions of investment bankers and lawyers, the most important
deals still can come down to the leaders' outlook and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``To an unusual extent, the CEO's established this deal,'' said
one participant. ``Those two men deserve the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Both chief executives, passionately analytical, ordered up
mountains of studies and scenarios to make sure the merger would
work whatever the price of oil. But both also agreed to keep their
lawyers and investment bankers far away until they had an agreement
virtually ready to be drafted. Most of the discussions were
directly between two executives who regarded each other as among
their few equals.
</P>
<P>
   Those two leaders have had little to say themselves. And _ with
their companies' habitual secrecy reinforced by fears that any
leaks might sink the merger as regulators begin to examine it _
they have demanded that their board members, aides and outside
advisers remain silent as well. Thus, the accounts of those
individuals with some knowledge of the deal-making process and
willing to speak are fragmentary and sometimes contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the deal rest on a series of obscure musings,
dropped hints and preliminary approaches calling to mind the old
joke about how porcupines make love _ very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon was once known as Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil as
Standard Oil of New York, the two largest pieces of John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up in 1911.
Initially, the two companies continued to share confidences as well
as a headquarters at 26 Broadway in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding generations of ambitious executives took the two
companies in very different directions, but they came to face
similar challenges. Most recenlty, the falling oil prices of the
1990s _ now lower after inflation than before the Arab oil embargo
of 1973 _ has caused severe cutbacks that led to tens of thousands
of layoffs at both companies.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of oil taking another disorienting step down this
year, the companies' chief executives finally concluded they had
done all they could on their own. ``The easy things are behind
us,'' Noto put it earlier this week. ``The easy oil, the easy cost
savings _ they're done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobil _ outflanked by Exxon, which is twice its size, and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, which is even larger _ began hunting for
partners. In Europe, Mobil combined its refinery and marketing
operations with those of British Petroleum, even agreeing to let
the British brand predominate. It knew that DuPont wanted to sell
its Conoco oil company to the public or a sufficiently large buyer.
Both B.P. and Amoco, the old Standard Oil of Indiana, were willing
to discuss mergers of approximate equals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to one Wall Street executive, Mobil was
also suggesting that it might consider an outright sale. Investment
bankers were encouraged just enough to present the idea to Exxon
executives early this year, this deal-maker said, but it appeared
to fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Raymond was still saying Exxon had no need to resort
to the mergers and partnerships that weaker companies were trying.
If Mobil was rattled by an agreement between Shell and Texaco to
team up in refining and sales in the United States, Exxon remained
combative. Raymond even boasted last year that his lawyers were
reviewing the Shell-Texaco agreement on antitrust grounds, adding
that suing one's rivals was ``the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Raymond doesn't have to try hard to be intimidating. A
Ph.D. in chemical engineering, with a heavy frame, rumbling voice
and jowly visage, he seldom hesitates to let reporters, analysts or
aides know when he thinks what they are asking or doing is just
plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such attributes, combined with acknowledged technical
brilliance, helped him drive his company to the limits of
efficiency, while he remained cautious about costly new ventures
abroad. But, according to associates, even Raymond was starting to
bump against the limits of efficiency gains Exxon could achieve on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   If Exxon was to take any action, he felt, it had to have the
scale and substance to truly improve his company. He first broached
the subject of Mobil with his board this spring, receiving enough
encouragement to take the next step.
</P>
<P>
   By June, during an American Petroleum Institute meeting, Raymond
and Noto were chatting about a Japanese refinery where they each
have a stake, they told reporters after the deal was announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we ought to have a conversation about the U.S.,''
Raymond suggested, perhaps with a view towards countering the
Shell-Texaco partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Noto responded in kind, saying, ``Well, yeah, that and some
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks later they met in the Washington area, where
Mobil has its Fairfax, Va., headquarters. Discussions moved slowly
at first. But as the men pondered whether to begin more serious
talks, they saw that the two companies were more complementary than
it had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Their foreign ventures had surprisingly little overlap, with
Mobil more devoted to developing natural gas. And Mobil's marketing
ability _ it popularized the self-service gas station _ fit well
with Exxon's huge and efficient crude oil volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Noto also agreed early on that Raymond would be the boss. Though
both are now 60, there would be no awkward attempt at having
co-chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   That Noto would accept a vice chairmanship at the combined
company, to be called Exxon Mobil, surprised some who know him.
``Lou Noto is a very _ I don't want to say egomaniacal _ he has a
very big ego,'' said William Randol, an independent analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Noto _ compact and balding, with a brushy moustache _ is much
more the salesman and adventurer, a lover of sports cars and opera,
comfortable chatting up reporters or literary luminaries. At the
joint news conference on Tuesday, he repeatedly stepped in to
rescue Raymond from awkward moments. Asked about their rapport, he
said, ``We do a bear act if you give us a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But to associates, Noto had been making it clear that even a
company as huge as Mobil might not be able to go it alone. That
conviction was reinforced in August, when British Petroleum
announced its $48 billion takeover of Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   That news reverberated at Exxon as well, though some executives
there almost made a point of not dwelling on it. ``That would not
have been the Exxon style,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks turned earnest, the companies began exhaustive
analyses. In a project code-named Highway, using far fewer people
than normal to preserve secrecy, they tested the merger's benefits
for years to come at a wide range of oil prices. Even if prices
unexpectedly rebounded, they concluded, the deal would still pay.
</P>
<P>
   Though they had agreed on the measures they would use to value
their companies, agreement on a precise price came late.
Discussions about antitrust issues also persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers and lawyers, however, were only brought in
once Raymond, Noto and their boards were almost ready to have their
agreement rendered on paper. By about mid-November, others at the
companies began their first preparations to make the deal public.
</P>
<P>
   Board members of both companies, who had been kept closely
informed, were asked last week to convene in Manhattan Tuesday
morning, the Mobil board at the company's midtown offices, the
Exxon board at those of its bankers, J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute details, however, kept senior executives up until
late Monday night, leaving some wondering whether the documents
would be ready for the boards' votes by the time the markets
opened.
</P>
<P>
   With hardly an hour _ if that _ to spare, the Exxon board
approved the deal unanimously. The Mobil, only six of whose 14
members would join the combined board, had one abstention or no.
Minutes before the markets opened, the news was officially out.

 &HT;    Minor alarm keeps Endeavor grounded, but NASA to attempt launch
again today
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA was to again attempt to launch the
space shuttle Endeavour this morning after its scheduled take-off
Thursday was aborted moments before liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   A master warning alarm had forced NASA programmers to put
Endeavour's scheduled 3:59 a.m. Thursday launch on hold with less
than a minute to go in the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm came after shuttle pilot, Maj. Rick Sturckow, started
the Endeavour's auxiliary power unit. It powers the shuttle's
landing gear, engine valves, control structures such as aelerons
and other hydraulic systems.
</P>
<P>
   Under NASA criteria, if a master alarm sounds, programmers must
either eliminate it as a threat to the flight or scuttle. They
ultimately decided the problem was caused by a loose switch and was
minor.
</P>
<P>
   After resuming the countdown, NASA officials scrubbed the launch
with only 19 seconds left because it had missed a 10-minute window
to send Endeavour into space.
</P>
<P>
   The slim time frame was set so Endeavour could rendezvous with
the Russian Zarya control module for the International Space
Station on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's flight had been questionable for hours before the
alarm because showers and cloud cover were expected to impede the
launch. But with less than 30 minutes remaining in the countdown,
NASA officials cleared Endeavour for takeoff because the showers
for the most part had come ashore to the north of the launch site.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's launch was also iffy, with NASA weather
forecasters predicting a 60 percent chance of showers for the
scheduled 3:36 a.m. launch.
</P>
<P>
   The flight is a major event for NASA and its 15 international

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the most coordinated action yet toward
European monetary union, 11 nations simultaneously cut their
interest rates Thursday to a nearly uniform low level.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a month before the nations are to adopt the euro
as a single currency and marked a drastic shift in policy. As
recently as two months ago, European central bankers had adamantly
refused to lower rates because they were intent on establishing the
credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank in
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, citing signs that the global economic slowdown
has begun to chill Europe, the central banks of the 11 euro-zone
nations reduced their benchmark interest rates by at least
three-tenths of a percent. The cuts are intended to help bolster
the European economies by making it cheaper for businesses and
consumers to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, every country in the euro zone except
Italy had reduced its key interest rate to 3.0 percent. Germany's
powerful Bundesbank, which has long been the benchmark for all the
others, cut its basic rate from 3.3 percent. Italy, which has had
some of the highest rates in Europe, dropped to 3.5 percent from 4
percent. The key rates are comparable to the Federal Funds rate in
the United States, the target rate for overnight loans between
banks, which is now 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence is now complete,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, head of
Economic Research at the Frankfurt office of Warburg Dillon Read.
``We have arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate reductions are unlikely to have a direct influence on
U.S. rate policy, but they could aid the American economy by
strengthening the market for goods in Europe and by helping bolster
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Though most economists had expected the new European Central
Bank to lower interest rates early next year, almost everybody was
surprised when the national central banks settled the issue before
the new bank officially assumed responsibility for European
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after months of bitter and public battles
between Europe's conservative central bankers and the
left-of-center governments that are in power in most countries. The
angriest battles have been in Germany, where Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine has waged a relentless public campaign to persuade the
Bundesbank and the European Central Bank to lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the
Bundesbank, said Thursday that the central bankers had acted in
response to mounting evidence that European growth rates will be
significantly slower next year than they had predicted as recently
as last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic estimation is that there will be a measurable
slowdown, but there won't be a recession,'' he told reporters. But
he adamantly denied accusations that the decision was a response to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deaf to political pressure, but we are not blind to
facts and arguments,'' Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine, preparing to board a plane for the United States,
said quickly on Thursday that he was pleased. ``Over all, I'm
satisfied,'' he said. ``We saw how the crises in Asia were not
without impact. On that basis we welcome this step.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists argued Thursday that the central bankers had
strong reasons for opening the monetary spigots a bit. Even though
Germany reported Thursday that its economic growth accelerated in
the third quarter, government and industry economists have been
lowering their projections for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe's already low inflation rate has declined even
further in the last year. In Germany, where annual inflation has
dropped to seven-tenths of a percent from 1.8 percent so far this
year, many experts say the country is already on the brink of at
least a mild deflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a brave decision,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz,
global economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``There are
many who feared that the extensive criticism from political
policymakers would prevent the European Central Bank from taking
action because they would be worried about being seen as responding
to political pressure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What this showed is that they realized that they were brave
enough to realize that their credibility is not enhanced by making
bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists across Europe have lowered their predictions for
growth in the euro zone to less than 2.5 percent in 1999 from about
3 percent in 1998. With inflation having all but evaporated,
economists said the central bankers had room to inject extra money
without causing prices to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the last 12 months, inflation has dropped
substantially and interest rates have not,'' Fahrinkrug said. ``The
European Central Bank has demonstrated that it is sensitive to
global woes and that it is ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few experts suspected that politics played at
least an indirect role in the rate cuts. Skeptics noted that
political leaders and central bankers had in some ways been
shadow-boxing around a trade-off between lower interest rates and
adherence to tough-minded budget policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's top economic adviser stunned many economists last
month by publicly arguing that European countries might have to
relax the tough rules governing budget deficits for countries
adopting the euro. Other leaders have suggested that governments
might have no choice but to increase spending if the central bank
refused to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was kind of a poker game between the governments
and the central bankers,'' said Emmanuel Ferry, economist at Credit
Commercial de France in Paris. ``I think there was some very tough
bargaining going on between the governments and the central bankers
and that there was a trade-off between monetary policy and fiscal
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ferry said he was as surprised as everyone else that the
bankers moved as early as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is a big surprise because personally I was
anticipating a cut during the first quarter of next year,'' he
said. ``Our idea was that the first move would be carried out by
the European Central Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the decision announced on Thursday appears to have
been made on Tuesday, when the central bankers from each country
met in Frankfurt for a regular meeting of the governing council of
the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, dropped
strong hints that a rate cut might be imminent after the council
meeting broke up Tuesday evening. But the European Central Bank
does not officially make monetary policy until January because the
power remains with the national central banks until then.
</P>
<P>
   Tietmeyer, on the other hand, could not officially commit the
Bundesbank to a rate cut without bringing the issue to a vote by
his bank's board. As a result, the decision had to wait until
Thursday, when the Bundesbank met for its regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
   World financial markets reacted modestly to the unexpected rate
cuts. The dollar, which has increased significantly against
European currencies in the last several weeks, held steady Thursday
and traded for about 1.67 marks. Ordinarily, a surprise rate cut
across Europe would tend to strengthen the dollar, but traders said
the rate cut was offset by new worries about financial instability
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   European stock exchanges all climbed slightly Thursday, in
contrast to the declines suffered on Wall Street. Germany's DAX
index of leading stocks climbed 2.13 percent, while the French CAC
40 index climbed 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will probably reduce the political pressure on
Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker who has been fixated on
demonstrating his political independence ever since European
political leaders named him president of the new European bank in
May.
</P>
<P>
   It was Duisenberg who remarked just one month ago that it was
``normal'' for politicians to voice their thoughts about monetary
policy but that it would be ``abnormal if those suggestions were
listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the rate cuts were led by Tietmeyer, an undisputed
monetary hardliner who has stared down political leaders time and
again, they will almost certainly provoke less second-guessing than
if they had been pushed through by the still-untested Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a pretty smart move to do it earlier, because
it takes political pressure off the European Central Bank,''
Fahrinkrug said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most profound aspect of the rate cut was what it
said about European monetary union. Under a single currency, every
country becomes subject to the same monetary policy and interest
rates essentially converge at some common level.
</P>
<P>
   That process of convergence has already been under way for a
long time as central banks from Spain to Portugal to France modeled
their policy after that of the Bundesbank. But the convergence
reached its finale Thursday, when countries like Ireland and
Portugal cut their rates by more than a half-point and brought them
even with the low bar set by Germany. The 11 countries launching
the euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France,
Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is now the only country in the euro zone with a base
interest rate that is higher than 3.0 percent. But Italy cut its
rates, too, and is expected to match those of its neighbors before
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for investors and the financial markets is
that Europe is stepping in with this interest rate, which is valid
not just for one day,'' Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and bankers disagreed about whether Europe would have
to lower rates even more in the months ahead. European rates are
already about a full percentage point below the United States
Federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3 percent level could hold for a significantly long
time,'' said Matti Vanhala, governor of the Bank of Finland, at a
news conference in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   But private economists like Ferry at Credit Commercial predicted
that Duisenberg would have to reduce rates to about 2.5 percent by
the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial markets are still nervous,'' said Werner Becker, an
economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. ``The central
banks are beginning to recognize that inflation is no longer a
problem and that deflation might be the bigger problem.''

INJUSTICES IN THE SHEPPARD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 4:
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years after Dr. Sam Sheppard was convicted of
murdering his wife, the Ohio Supreme Court has allowed his son, Sam
Reese Sheppard, the chance to clear the doctor's name. Yet even now
the local county prosecutor is stubbornly fighting efforts to
exonerate Sheppard, whose plight inspired the movie and television
series ``The Fugitive.'' The case still captures the public
imagination because it shows the evil of a legal system when it is
blind to innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision allows Sheppard's son to move forward with
a wrongful-imprisonment lawsuit against the state of Ohio. Sheppard
served 10 years in prison before the United States Supreme Court
overturned the conviction on grounds that the trial had been
tainted by excessive press coverage. He was acquitted at a second
trial in 1966, but died a few years later a broken alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   New DNA evidence shows that blood spattered at the Sheppard
house does not match that of either Sheppard or his wife,
indicating that a third person was present at the scene. DNA
evidence also suggests that the killer may have been a window
washer who was eventually convicted of another murder.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do prosecutors admit that devastating mistakes were made
even in cases decades old. The Sheppard case still polarizes
lawyers and politicians who feel compelled to defend their actions
in the earlier investigation. One Ohio Supreme Court justice who
had been an assistant prosecutor in the second trial refused to
recuse himself despite his obvious conflict of interest. He voted,
unsuccessfully, to block the wrongful-imprisonment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheppard arguably got a better shake than many innocent
people who have been wrongly convicted. His wealth and professional
standing brought attention to the case, and the noted criminal
lawyer F. Lee Bailey helped win his acquittal. Sheppard was
railroaded into prison for 10 years. Less privileged individuals
without resources or able champions have languished even longer in
prison, sometimes on death row, for crimes they did not commit.

THE SPY BUDGET SLIPS FROM SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 4:
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, advanced
openness in government earlier this year by voluntarily disclosing
how much money Washington spends on spying. It would be a pity if
Tenet now pulled the blanket of secrecy back over the intelligence
budget. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case, just as spending
is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has done much to overcome the reflexive drive to classify
in the espionage business. He has committed more manpower and money
to unsealing intelligence archives than his predecessors did. In
March he revealed that the 1998 budget for intelligence activities
was $26.7 billion. That figure covers 13 agencies, including the
two most expensive _ the National Security Agency, which monitors
international communications, and the National Reconnaissance
Office, which manages spy satellites. The CIA itself accounts for
roughly $3 billion. Knowing the scale of intelligence spending,
which this year is about one-tenth of the defense budget, can help
Americans judge the value of their spy services.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tenet had disclosed the 1997 total under pressure from a
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, his willingness to volunteer
the 1998 figure was an important symbolic step. While he declined
to break down the budget by agency or category, he effectively
demolished the hoary argument that official disclosure of the
aggregate budget would endanger security by giving enemies some
sense of how much money Washington was devoting to spying. Any
basis for that contention expired when the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet should not retreat now merely because the budget is
increasing in 1999. News accounts have placed the increase at about
$1.8 billion, bringing the total close to $29 billion, comparable
to Cold War-era budgets. Since well over two-thirds of the Cold War
budget went into collecting intelligence about the Soviet Union, it
is hard to understand why so much money is needed today, even to
combat terrorism, develop new satellites and hire new staff.
</P>
<P>
   The threats facing America, whether Saddam Hussein, Osama bin
Laden or rogue nations like North Korea, will not be any greater if
the intelligence budget is officially disclosed. There are
legitimate espionage secrets that require protection. The size of
the intelligence budget is not one of them.

CALIFORNIA'S HIGH-END HOMES RED-HOT PROPERTIES IN THIRD QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California's high-end real estate sparkled during
the year's third quarter as the number of million-dollar homes sold
hit an all-time peak, an industry tracker reported.
</P>
<P>
   Between July and September, 1,555 homes sold for more than $1
million, including more than 100 in the suburban San Fernando
Valley area, said Acxiom Corp.'s DataQuick Products Division. The
number jumped 41 percent from the year-ago period, 5.1 percent from
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the ZIP code with the highest sales count was
90210 -- Beverly Hills -- with 63.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of these pricey homes are well ahead of the surge of the
late 1980s, when million-dollar sales activity peaked at 1,246
mansions during the third quarter of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reflect strong consumer confidence, an increase in
the number of new millionaires in the state and price appreciation.
A lot of houses that carried six-figure price tags a year ago have
now crossed the million-dollar threshold.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the buyers paid for their palatial digs in
cash. The median down payment was $390,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in the economy has been kind of top-down,'' said
DataQuick market analyst John Karevoll. ``High-income households
are making a lot more money now than five years ago, and because of
the growth in the stock market and the economy, more people can
afford these homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive home sale during the quarter was a
seven-bathroom, five-bedroom, 10,060-square-foot estate on 2.3
acres in Bel-Air that went for $10 million. Eighteen California
homes sold for $5 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   There were 91 condominium sales in the million-dollar category,
mostly in West Los Angeles and San Francisco. The median price per
square foot for all million-dollar homes was $402 last quarter, up
from $365 a year ago.

EDITORIAL: A WEEK TO FORGET IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Legislature's attempt to tiptoe into Albany
to pass a quick and quiet pay raise has turned into a loud, messy
disaster. The Assembly Democratic majority, whose members were
hungriest for salary hikes, came up with a bill that substantially
increased legislators' pay while maintaining their status as
part-time workers who enjoy innumerable favors from friendly
lobbyists. The Senate Republicans, between bursts of rhetoric about
the importance of curbing the power of unions in schools, revived
an outrageous piece of special-interest legislation for their
friends in the police union.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who constantly complains about the
dysfunctional Legislature, could have taken this opportunity to
press for serious reforms in the way the Assembly and Senate
operate. This would also have been the perfect time to bring up
what he contended during the campaign was his secret plan to reform
campaign finance laws. But instead the governor attempted to use
the pay raises as a bribe to get the Assembly to approve a sweeping
charter school bill.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of charter schools, which would be free from
supervision by the normal education bureaucracy but paid for by
public-school funds, is intriguing. But if poorly done, a charter
schools program could drain local school systems of resources,
borrow money that would have to be repaid by taxpayers if the
school failed, and leave children at the mercy of educators who are
even less qualified and well supervised than the worst
public-school employees. Obviously, this is not the sort of change
that should be passed by a lame-duck Legislature during a three-day
session, with pay raises dangled as the reward for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans attempted to sweeten the school bill by
adding on at least one goodie for every sector of the education
establishment, making the legislation even more unwieldy. They also
passed a long-moribund Assembly bill taking away New York City's
control of contract negotiations with the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association.
</P>
<P>
   That measure has long been sought by city police officers, who
rightly suspect the state board would give them more generous
contracts. The idea that the Republicans would tie the hands of a
Republican mayor in such a critical budget issue is incredible. But
it demonstrates a mindset less interested in theories like local
autonomy than in special-interest politics.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing the Assembly Democrats did during the special
session was to leave town without passing the charter schools bill.
The presumption now is that Pataki will sign the pay raise and
police union bills, but only if he gets his own charter school
legislation in return.
</P>
<P>
   This page has supported the idea of raising legislators' pay if
it is combined with reforms. But the scene in Albany this week has
made it obvious that nobody deserves any financial rewards this
year. The Assembly should drop charter schools until next year and
stay home for the holidays. Pataki should veto the pay raise bill,
the police bill and all the other dribs and drabs of legislation
that were swiftly passed at the behest of lobbyists with friends in
the right places. Forget this session ever happened and allow
everyone to start fresh in 1999.

INTERNATIONAL GROUP REACHES AGREEMENT ON DATA-SCRAMBLING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. government said Thursday that an agreement had been
reached in Vienna, Austria, that was expected to produce new
international controls on the export of data-scrambling software
and hardware, a long-contentious issue pitting individual privacy
against national security in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement by the 33 members of the Wassenaar
Arrangement, a multilateral export-control group, is a compromise
measure that places new restrictions on the exporting of
mass-market software with numerical keys above 64 bits in length.
</P>
<P>
   The more bits used in a key, the stronger the encryption. But
the increase is exponential, so that a 64-bit key is only
marginally longer than a 56-bit key, but would take 256 times
longer to break.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long refused to allow American companies
to export ``strong encryption'' _ that is, software that scrambles
data so thoroughly that it is virtually impossible to decode
without the key _ on the ground that it could be used by
international terrorists to hide the plotting and execution of
nefarious activities from the nation's intelligence and police
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been eager to close what it considered a
loophole in foreign export controls that permits companies outside
the United States to freely export mass-market programs like
Internet browsers, which in the United States routinely use 128-bit
encryption to protect financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States argues that the 64-bit key is strong enough to
protect data from almost all computer users today. But industry
executives and technical experts say it is not beyond the
code-breaking power of the supercomputers used by the National
Security Agency and other intelligence organizations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government officials said Thursday that they thought the
agreement would reduce some opposition from America's
high-technology industries, which say export controls increasingly
put them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This levels the playing field between the U.S. and other
countries,'' said Ambassador David Aaron, the president's special
envoy for cryptography. ``Companies in other countries were
actually advertising: `Buy our software. We don't have export
controls.' Now they will have export controls for strong
encryption.''
</P>
<P>
   But technology experts in the United States questioned that
assertion. Though the new agreement was likely to lead to some new
restrictions, it probably would do little to change the policy of
nations like Germany and Finland, which have opposed any
restrictions on the export of encryption software, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a mixed result for the U.S.,'' said Stewart
Baker, a Washington lawyer who represents several high-technology
companies. ``They've eliminated record-keeping for low-level
encryption, and what the U.S. got in exchange for that is that
other countries now have clear authority to control the export of
stronger forms of encryption.''
</P>
<P>
   Other industry representatives predicted that the agreement
would do little to halt the spread of encryption technology to
terrorists or belligerent states.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever limits the nations enact, many experts have noted
that the most advanced encryption software is neither esoteric nor
costly and is easily within the grasp of most bright college
students.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the United States placed controls on all
exports with numerical key lengths greater than 40 bits. The key
length for unrestricted exports was raised to 56 bits in July. But
John Gilmore, a San Francisco privacy activist and entrepreneur,
quickly demonstrated that it was possible to decode a message
encrypted with a 56-bit key in just 56 hours with a custom-built
computer assembled for less than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   And given the exponential increase in the per-dollar power of
computer technology, many privacy advocates and security experts
argue that the 56-bit and even 64-bit numerical keys permitted
under the new agreement are not adequate protection.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, code cracking has employed brute-force attacks in
which an ultrafast computer or group of processors systematically
tests each of a huge number of possible keys. But there are also
many more subtle and clever ways to crack encryption schemes, such
as guessing at a computer user's password.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States places no domestic legal restrictions
on encryption, the export controls alarm civil liberties groups,
which see them as limits on private communications.
</P>
<P>
   Several representatives at U.S. companies said the new accord
would help meet the federal government's goal of restricting the
export of strong cryptography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that the governments will now have to
exercise tighter controls, particularly on products where
encryption exceeds 56 bits,'' said Lynn McNulty, government affairs
director at RSA Data Security, a computer security company.

ADVERTISING: DEUTSCH LANDS A TROPHY NATIONAL ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will success, to paraphrase the title of a 1950s film
about advertising, spoil Donny Deutsch?
</P>
<P>
   After years of striving, Deutsch Inc. in New York, the hot
midsized agency that Deutsch heads as chief executive, has finally
landed a national advertising assignment from a large automotive
marketer. Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America expanded its
relationship with Deutsch in mid-November by consolidating its
estimated $250 million account there.
</P>
<P>
   Because a national automotive account is a trophy assignment for
an agency in the way that a supermodel is a trophy spouse for an
aging tycoon, competition for those duties is fierce. So Deutsch's
patient, yearlong pursuit of Mitsubishi was noteworthy: The agency
initially landed ad duties for 41 regional dealer associations, won
the task to introduce the redesigned Galant sedan, and then gained
the rest of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The nod from Mitsubishi capped a skein of account gains that
helped Deutsch _ known best for energetic campaigns for brands like
Baskin-Robbins, Foot Locker, Ikea, Snapple and Tanqueray _ grow
into one of the three largest independent agencies in New York.
Billings, estimated at $275 million as recently as 1994, are now
estimated at as much as $875 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsch, who in 1983 took over a small agency founded by his
father, David, still finds acceptance from his peers more difficult
to achieve than from advertisers. Few, for instance, would think to
classify Deutsch among highly regarded creative powerhouses like
Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis; Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in
San Francisco, owned by Omnicom Group, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Deutsch _ and by extension, his agency _ has had
difficulty overcoming an image as a brash parvenu who uses schmooze
and mirrors to woo clients, and gimmicks and guile to woo
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals of Deutsch still deride a campaign the agency produced
when Japanese companies were snapping up Manhattan real estate; the
ads, for the metropolitan New York Pontiac dealers, equated buying
Japanese cars with wanting to watch the Christmas tree being
lighted at ``Mitsubishi Center.''
</P>
<P>
   And they dismiss a commercial in which two actors played a gay
male couple shopping at Ikea as more about changing perceptions of
Ikea as a purveyor of unfashionable furniture than changing
perceptions about homosexuals among mainstream consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The two attitudes to Deutsch were on display last month, when he
was one of a small group of agency leaders selected for full-page
portrait photographs in the 20th-anniversary issue of the trade
publication Adweek. The honor was undercut with a caption that read
in part: ``Outspoken? Sure. Successful? Undoubtedly. Popular? Not
in all circles. Donny Deutsch has yet to live down his reputation
as a braggart who favors publicity stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, in an interview in the sprawling, block-long space
in Chelsea where Deutsch plans to relocate the agency in March, the
slight remained fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be 80 years old in a nursing home and I would still
get `brash,''' said Deutsch, 41, who was joined by a dozen senior
managers for the interview on the vacant 14th floor of 111 Eighth
Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's just a little envy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   If so, there has been more than a little to envy lately. Deutsch
is one of the few agencies based in New York that have been able to
open a thriving outpost in the Los Angeles market; the strength of
the California operation was important to Mitsubishi, which is
based in Cypress, Calif. The outpost, now in Marina del Rey,
Calif., has 140 employees, compared with the 324 in the main
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some concerns when I came to the agency,'' said Mike
Sheldon, the executive vice president and general manager for
Deutsch Los Angeles, who previously worked at shops including
Chiat/Day. ``But I spent time with Donny and he said the office
would be very much a part of Deutsch, like another floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch has also opened a small Chicago office, with 10
employees, and plans additional offices in cities like Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful agencies have a defined culture,'' Deutsch
said. ``Ours is being smart and aggressive, doing take-no-prisoners
creative work.'' John Mittnacht, a partner and group account
director, described the shared attitude the agency hopes to instill
in employees as ``speaking Deutsch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deutsch is also expanding units to handle tasks like media
services, interactive marketing and account planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pitching Mitsubishi,'' Sheldon said, ``we talked about
relationship marketing, taking them through a time line of how
people think about a car from `prebuying,' about a year before the
purchase, to the repurchase three years out.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Deutsch has downs as well as ups. The agency now
lacks clients in high-profile markets like beer, fast food and
technology, which Deutsch described as ``holes we have'' and
categories ``we still haven't conquered.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency lost one big client, BankAmerica, when it was
acquired by Nationsbank, and another, L.A. Cellular, is changing
owners as AT&AMP;T takes a majority stake. The future of that account
is cloudy because Deutsch is not on the AT&AMP;T agency roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the paper one morning and your client is no longer
your client,'' Deutsch said in a follow-up interview this week.
``But when it's not performance-related, you can't beat yourself
up; those tend to even out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have speed bumps,'' he added. ``That
comes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the people who ``have waited for us to stumble,'' Deutsch
said _ the ones who ``used to ask `Who's this kid going into
Daddy's business?''' _ ``that's the price you pay'' for
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day people stop being jealous,'' he added, ``is the day we
have something to worry about.''

 On-the-Job Experience  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hundreds of round white cardboard containers slid down the assembly
line. An overhead pipe spurted each one full of silken-soft vanilla
ice cream. Then, barely a second later, the conveyor belt whisked
them off to a giant freezer with a temperature of 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could get vicious,'' muttered Arthur Boerner, a
grandfather from Colorado who was watching the ice cream containers
zip past.``We didn't have breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Boerner and 11 members of his extended family had skipped
breakfast and forked over $2 each to join a 9:15 a.m. tour of the
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream plant in Union City.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 people a year take the Dreyer's tour _ one of
about two dozen public tours offered by Bay Area manufacturing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of firms that allow the general public to
visit their factory floors is dwindling because of management
worries about issues like liability and trade-secret theft.
</P>
<P>
   But those firms that do offer tours are becoming increasingly
sophisticated about it, sometimes building multimillion-dollar
visitor centers to supplement the actual factory-floor visit.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Herman Goelitz _ which guided 377,000 people last
year through its Jelly Belly candy plant in Fairfield _ will open
an adjacent $6.5 million visitor center in March.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that offer tours say the hassle is far outweighed by
the payoff: a kind of customer loyalty that can't easily be
quantified but that goes far deeper than the return from even the
snazziest TV ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A commercial during the Super Bowl costs millions of dollars
for 30 seconds,'' said Patty Laustrup, who oversees tours for about
39,000 people a year at the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Fairfield.
``We get people's attention for one hour for just $7.40, the cost
of a tour guide. And it's total immersion into our product. You
can't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no hard data on the number of U.S. companies that offer
tours to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   But people who have researched factory tours say the number is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey's no longer lets visitors inside its world-famous
chocolate factory in Hershey, Pa. Instead, it offers a ride through
a make-believe factory in a giant cocoa-bean tram.
</P>
<P>
   And Kellogg's halted its factory tour in the 1980s for fear of
cereal spies, instead opening up a company museum in Battle Creek,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a trend toward museums, which meet some of
the same needs as going on a factory tour,'' said Karen Axelrod,
co-author of a book about factory tours, ``Watch It Made in the
USA: A Visitor's Guide to the Companies That Make Your Favorite
Products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's not the same excitement for visitors as when
you're right there in the middle of all the noise and movement and
sparks flying,'' Axelrod added.
</P>
<P>
   Both nationally and in the Bay Area, companies offering tours
tend to sell brand-name products _ especially food or drink _ to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Dreyer's, Herman Goelitz and Anheuser-Busch, firms with
local tour programs include Anchor Brewing Co., Levi Strauss, Mrs.
Grossman's Paper Co., Norcal Waste Systems and New United Motor
Manufacturing, the joint car-making venture between Toyota and
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   These firms say there's a lot more to running a successful tour
program than simply adding a couple of extra ``visitor'' spaces in
their parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   They've sometimes had to purchase extra liability insurance.
Some have had to train staff in first aid and set up procedures to
deal with potential medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of seniors visiting, and the tour involves five
blocks of walking with great fluctuations of heat and cold, after
they've had some alcohol,'' said Laustrup of Anheuser-Busch.
``We've had situations where seniors occasionally become weak. We
use our radios and have a truck come to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies also have had to negotiate special deals with state
workplace-safety regulators. For instance, Anheuser-Busch had to
get state officials to waive their normal rule requiring people on
the brewery floor to wear closed-toe shoes and long pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite an ordeal to get those releases, but we hated
telling people they couldn't go on the tour because they were
wearing shorts or sandals,'' Laustrup said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the challenge of training tour guides _ people who
must be both product experts and amateur diplomats capable of
handling antsy children and occasionally rude adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send out letters saying no children under 6, and no
strollers or babies in backpacks,'' said Michele Massari, a tour
guide at Dreyer's. ``But people show up at the door with a baby in
a frontpack and say, `Well, you didn't mention frontpacks.' I just
bring them in here (to the gift shop) and give them ice cream while
the rest of their group goes on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies find that gift-shop sales pay for the cost of
their tour programs. The tiny Marin French Cheese Factory in
Petaluma, which gets 500 to 1,000 visitors per week, does about
half its total sales from its on-site shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 10 people come through, nine are going to buy something,''
said general manager Kandace Millhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Goelitz sells more than $3 million worth of candy and
souvenirs to tour participants each year, out of total sales of
more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never intended it to be, but the tour became a profit
center,'' said Peter Cain, marketing director for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms subsidize their tours but still find them

   ``I don't know if we break even or not, but when people leave

notes from people saying things like, `My mom went out and bought
the flavor we tasted.' ''

<P>
   Arthur Boerner certainly was one happy visitor _ especially when
his group each got two scoops of ice cream at the end of their
Dreyer's tour. Boerner actually ended up with more than his share
because he finished off his grandchildren's uneaten portions.

<P>
   ``Pillsbury has their doughboy _ I'd like to be the Dreyer's
boy,'' Boerner said as he polished off his fifth scoop.

 At Conference, Amazon.com Chief Speaks to His Former Brethren  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey Bezos speaks, money
managers listen.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was one of them. He helped build a black box
computer-trading hedge fund for D.E. Shaw. (Yes, the same
investment firm whose colossal losses prompted BankAmerica's Hugh
McColl to send David Coulter packing. But don't hold that against
Bezos. He left the now-infamous firm earlier this decade.)
</P>
<P>
   For another, some of the best and brightest institutional money
managers _ who aren't exactly dim bulbs themselves _ think he's a
pretty smart guy. In fact, many of them will even admit that they
think Bezos is smarter than they are.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Bezos has been anointed lord of electronic commerce
by the digerati. Thus, when a ``Fireside Chat With Jeff Bezos'' was
scheduled for yesterday at the Credit Suisse First Boston
technology conference here in Scottsdale, Ariz., you knew it was
going to be a full house. Of course, getting the chief executive to
come and wax virtual with his former peers commanded a price: No
press allowed. The Internet executive presumedly was concerned that
something he might say would move markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, my curiosity was piqued, and I figured readers of
this column would like to hear what was on the guru's mind. So,
thanks to a couple of libertarian-minded conference goers who
volunteered as Street Smarts correspondents, the following are some
poignant comments made by the chief executive of the world's
leading e-tailer.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the chat (and a long ways from the days of
Franklin D. Roosevelt), an image of virtual flames was projected on
a huge screen behind Bezos while an interviewer read questions from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase, Bezos was asked how he felt about Amazon's
exceedingly rich stock evaluation. Shares closed yesterday at
$189.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell everyone in our company to wake up terrified,'' he told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that the lofty stock price should serve as an
incentive for his employees to work diligently toward serving
Amazon's customers because their endorsement of the Internet
retailer is more important than any advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right thing to be afraid of is our customers. They are the
ones that pay us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is the single-most important lesson on running an
Internet business?
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power shifts from the retailer to the consumer on
the Internet. One customer can tell 5 million people that
Amazon.com stinks.
</P>
<P>
   And when that happens, Amazon needs to satisfy five new
customers to make up for the one unhappy customer, Bezos figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to be able to have a lousy Internet product and
overcome that with great marketing, but you can't do that
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos was queried about other Internet businesses that he
admired, particularly ones which had yet to go public.
</P>
<P>
   One that caught his eye is PriceLine, a seller of excess
capacity on airlines. He thinks that it could revolutionize the
commercial airline business.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet pioneer also indicated that he was impressed with
eBay, the online auctioneer whose recent initial offering caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Bezos was asked what was behind Amazon's decision
to hire some top-level employees from discount titan Wal-Mart, one
of the nation's most efficient retailers. Wal-Mart is suing Amazon
over the matter, accusing it of pilfering some of Wal-Mart's
proprietary distribution know-how.
</P>
<P>
   To which he responded: ``We aren't interested in anyone's trade
secrets. But we are very interested in hiring talented people.''

 Groups Protest Pac Bell Plan to Raise 411 Rates  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pacific Bell's proposal to raise rates for directory assistance met
with stiff opposition yesterday from senior citizens, consumer
advocates and others who say the increase is undeserved and will
hurt customers.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before the California Public Utilities Commission,
members of the public spoke about Pac Bell's application to raise
411 rates from 25 cents to 50 cents per call. Pac Bell is seeking a
cap of $1.10 per call, which means it could charge that amount just
by giving the PUC 30 days notice.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company also wants to cut the number of free 411 calls
from five per month to three. Business customers, who currently get
three free 411 calls a month, would get no free directory
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is expected to vote on Pac Bell's application in May.
Consumer advocates and others said the rate increases will hurt the
communities that can least afford it _ low-income, senior citizen
and minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Berzok, a member of California's American Association of
Retired Persons state legislative committee, said directory
assistance is vital to elderly people, many of whom are on fixed
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Directory assistance is very important to our members, who may
need it because the print in the telephone book is too small or
it's too heavy to lift,'' Berzok said. ``This proposal amounts to
nothing more than gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Burns, who lives in San Francisco, said that while the
rate increase may not seem like a lot, it can destroy the budget of
someone who's struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 50 cents sometimes is a little more than we can add to
our telephone bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who spoke at yesterday's hearing, the sixth
hearing to be held statewide, said Pac Bell should not be allowed
to raise rates because it has a lock on the market. Customers can
get local phone numbers from a few other companies but must dial
special access codes to reach those providers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's proposal did get support from some retired Pac
Bell employees, union officials and some disabled customers.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Senhaux, who is legally blind, said Pac Bell's
application should be approved because the company has been a good
corporate citizen. Senhaux said Pac Bell provides free directory
assistance to anyone with a disability, something it may not be
able to afford if the rate increase isn't granted.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said they need to raise rates in order to
cover costs for directory assistance. The company said it has not
raised 411 rates since 1984 and is losing money on each call.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cain, Pac Bell director of product and market management,
said the company does not plan to charge $1.10, even though it's
asked for that as a rate cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only asking for an increase to 50 cents. Period,'' said
Cain. He said the money is needed to pay for salaries of operators,
who answer 411 calls 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates say they expect Pac Bell to raise rates
to $1.10 if the application is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carriers request the rates they want to charge,'' said Kelly
Boyd, senior telecommunications analyst with the Office of
Ratepayer Advocates. ``The clear purpose of requesting a rate above
the ceiling is to forgo regulatory oversight when the next increase
is implemented.''

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS STEERED BACK TO NARROW FOCUS 
 (SUBS TO ADD 8 GRAFS AT END)
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on
Thursday abandoned their effort to add campaign finance issues to
the impeachment inquiry and canceled plans to question the director
of the FBI and a former Justice Department prosecutor about their
investigations into fundraising practices in the 1996 election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the committee chairman _
just two days after the committee issued subpoenas to witnesses on
campaign finance _ cleared the way for the panel to vote on
articles of impeachment next week.
</P>
<P>
   In returning to accusations against President Clinton in the
Monica Lewinsky matter, Hyde told Republicans in a conference call
that no evidence of impeachable offenses was found in a review of
secret memorandums on campaign finance written by the FBI director,
Louis Freeh, or the former prosecutor, Charles La Bella.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials had examined the memos to see why the two
law enforcement officials had argued to Attorney General Janet Reno
that an independent counsel should look into Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde announced that the Judiciary Committee instead would pursue
fundraising questions next year as part of its traditional
oversight role over the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   With the House vote on impeachment moving into its critical
stages, more Republican turmoil surfaced Thursday as some moderates
assembled a proposal to censure Clinton instead of impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   It would condemn Clinton's behavior and require him to admit he
had deceived the American people. It would also require Clinton to
pay a financial penalty of an undisclosed sum, which would require
his consent in order to overcome constitutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Circumventing the House Republican leadership, the group sent
the proposal directly to the White House for scrutiny. The
moderates' stance put them at odds with Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
Majority Whip, who has come out vehemently against censure in
recent television appearances and is fighting to keep such a
proposal off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose is to make sure the president is not allowed
to walk away unpunished,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who was
working on the proposal along with Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del. ``A
vote on impeachment, which we believe will not pass, would be
giving the president a victory he would not deserve,'' King said.
``This is to show that Republicans as the governing party have a
strong resolution condemning the president's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official confirmed that discussions about
the censure proposal were under way with King, who has a good
relationship with the administration. The discussions were the
clearest indication to date that the White House is developing a
back channel to devise an alternative to impeachment that would be
attractive to moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
stressed that the White House was doing more listening than
talking. ``It's more King saying, `here's what we're doing,' more
than anyone here saying, `This is what we want,' '' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   King said about 20 Republicans were backing his proposal,
although he declined to name his supporters. But with Republicans
divided over how to end the White House scandal, those pushing to
impeach the president questioned how many Republicans were really
supporting his plan. ``There is no censure groundswell,'' said one
Republican official promoting impeachment. ``Out of 228
Republicans, 220 don't want censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Democrats and Republicans alike to grab hold
of the impeachment process and wrap it up, Rep. Robert Livingston,
the incoming speaker, raised his profile Thursday and said he would
prefer to see the House finish impeachment proceedings this year.
But he refused to indicate whether he would allow House
consideration of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to make a decision on that,'' Livingston
said, adding that he was waiting to see the recommendations of the
Judiciary Committee. The committee is expected to vote along party
lines late next week to recommend at least one article of
impeachment against the President for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting side by side with Trent Lott, the Senate Majority
Leader, at their joint news conference, Livingston tried in vain to
highlight a broader Republican agenda. ``Is there a question other
than on impeachment that we could maybe ...,'' Lott began to say,
trying to change the subject. He was met with a chorus of No's from
reporters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In other developments Thursday, the Republican-controlled
Judiciary Committee and the White House battled again over how
Clinton's defense would be presented next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mooney, the committee's chief of staff, told the White
House that the lawyer appearing on Clinton's behalf would be
``subject to at least one full round of questioning'' by the
37-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the lawyer would be allowed to review some of the
committee's evidence, but that the counsel would not be allowed to
take notes or make copies of materials. Mooney gave the White House
until Friday to name the witnesses it planned to call.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp attack on the panel's position, the White House press
secretary, Joe Lockhart, said, ``The committee's erratic behavior
leaves the fundamental focus on its inquiry unclear. Their actions
have been chaotic, partisan and irresponsible, fundamentally
limiting the president's ability to present a coherent defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee has been struggling with management of
the inquiry ever since the November elections when House
Republicans suffered unexpected losses partly attributed to the
public's weariness over the Lewinsky scandal. It has heard from the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and from convicted perjurers,
but it has not questioned major witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recently skidded into trouble as it tried to
broaden the inquiry beyond the Lewinsky matter. It briefly looked
into the incident involving Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who said the president had groped her. She was said to
have been pressured to change her account. Then this week it veered
quickly in and out of campaign finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee considered certain to recommend at least one
article of impeachment for perjury, the question is whether the
House will succeed in impeaching Clinton by a narrow margin. A
crucial question is how many Republican moderates will break with
their party.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats _ including Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, who
has been one of Clinton's harshest Democratic critics _ also
planned strategy Thursday with Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, to try to reach moderate Republicans to promote
bipartisan censure options.

2 NORTH CAROLINA WOMEN ENDING A SPECTACULAR CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Cindy Parlow and Siri Mullinix left their
respective high schools a year early to join the North Carolina
women's soccer team. Parlow, a forward, is the team's leading
scorer and has twice been the national player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix is the best goalie on the top team in the country. This
weekend, the two seniors will end their collegiate careers at the
National Collegiate Athletic Association final four.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, the two-time defending champion, will play
Portland at 4:30 p.m. Friday after Santa Clara plays Florida at 2
p.m. The final will be Sunday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bring a player in early, she should be
national caliber, both as an athlete and student,'' North Carolina
Coach Anson Dorrance said. ``The N.C.A.A. has all kinds of
regulations about early departure from high school, and it just
happened that we had two players who wanted to come early and who
could the same year. It did happen once before for us. You might
recognize the name, Mia Hamm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is considered the best player in the world in women's
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Parlow and Mullinix earned General Educational Development
degrees through correspondence courses and community colleges in
the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there wasn't anything more I could accomplish at the
club and high school level,'' said Mullinix, a native of
Greensboro, who was the most valuable defensive player of last
year's tournament. ``I knew I could come in and play one year
behind an all-American and then have a chance to play three years
at the best level college soccer has.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix developed into an all-American by her junior season and
has allowed only 6 goals in 24 games this season. Tony DiCicco, the
United States National Team coach, has invited Mullinix to join the
residency training camp in preparation for the 1999 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're always so strong offensively, goalkeepers here
haven't always gotten the credit they deserve,'' said her teammate
Tiffany Roberts. She added, referring to shots: ``Think about this,
she has the best players in the world pounding her in practice
every day. Believe me, she holds her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlow left her Memphis high school because she wanted a chance
at making the 1996 Olympic team, which she did as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy has fulfilled every possible dream and expectation I had
for her career and surpassed them,'' said Dorrance, whose teams
have won 14 of the 16 NCAA championships. ``I felt she could come
in and play at a national level immediately, and she did. I felt
she could win college player of the year, and she did. I felt she
could make the national team, and she did.''

SO LONG, CHRYSLER. IT'S BEEN FUN.  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 6)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The courtship was a whirlwind. The German-American nuptials were
lavish. And, for now, DaimlerChrysler AG appears to be in wedded
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   With the honeymoon on, what better time to look at the dowry
that Chrysler Corp., which last month ceased to exist as an
independent company, brought to that union?
</P>
<P>
   Like most auto companies, Chrysler produced its share of the
ingenious and ignominious. From its beginnings, it was known for
engineering innovations: the very first Chrysler, in 1924, had
four-wheel hydraulic brakes, not the cable-activated mechanical
brakes of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Chrysler bought out Dodge Brothers and brought out both
the midpriced De Soto and the low-priced Plymouth. By 1936, it was
the country's No. 2 automaker, behind General Motors and just ahead
of Ford, which was playing catch-up in midpriced cars.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years Chrysler boasted a string of innovations,
including the first power steering, the great ``hemi'' V8 and the
first modern minivan. There were also the less-than-successes: the
Airflow, an innovative but homely design that did not catch on; the
sleekly finned cars of the late 50s that were boldly styled but
badly built, and the premature downsizing for 1962 of the company's
bread-and-butter Plymouths and Dodges, which sank when they shrank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the debacle of the 1970s, when Chrysler was
selling little that the public wanted, resulting in a brush with
bankruptcy. Lee A. Iacocca, the company's chairman, sold Congress
on $1.5 billion in loan guarantees, saving the company. And the
rest is history. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave it to a playwright who has been dead for 2,400
years to jolt Broadway out of its dramatic doldrums. Sophocles'
``Electra'' opened at the Barrymore Theater Thursday night, in a
magnificent new production that represents soul-satisfying drama at
its most passionately, intensely alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the director David Leveaux's startling staging, the play is
both a timeless family tragedy and a lurid tabloid crime story. The
foul deeds of ``Electra'' may have been recorded nearly two and a
half millenniums ago, but in this masterly modern-dress version,
they are as raw as the lead item off the police blotter. The
portrait of a family convulsed by violence and betrayal is so
potent and harrowing, it leaves you dazed and weirdly giddy. A
daughter plots murder, a mother is butchered, a son is up to his
elbows in blood. And you couldn't be more delighted.
</P>
<P>
   With the astounding Anglo-American actress Zoe Wanamaker in the
title role, giving the proverbial performance of her career, this
``Electra'' is the most significant restaging of a classic on
Broadway since a revisionist ``A Doll's House'' with Janet McTeer
20 months ago. It's a provocative evening that not only reacquaints
you with the direct, unprocessed power of Greek drama but also
provides a depth of pleasure you associate more frequently these
days with great movies; you're swept along by the narrative,
majestic in its directness and simplicity. If there is any justice
in the theater world, every playgoer with a hankering for drama
with some flesh on it _ no doubt about it, this is theater for
meat-eaters _ will place an order for this full-course meal, served
in 90 gripping minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a sleek and hypnotic text by Frank McGuinness, who
also wrote the ``Doll's House'' adaptation, and the urgent,
authoritative performances by a flawless ensemble that also
includes Claire Bloom, Pat Carroll, Michael Cumpsty, Stephen
Spinella, Daniel Oreskes and Marin Hinkle, Leveaux's ``Electra'' is
a family fight for any and every time and place. Designed by Johan
Engels to exist in some fantastic limbo between the classical and
contemporary worlds _ the set encompasses both fragments of Greek
columns and broken pieces of modern furniture _ the production
erases the 2,400-year gap in the blink of a blackout. Everything
Sophocles' antique characters feel, from Electra's inflammatory
grief to Clytemnestra's frozen ire, can stir as well, it seems, in
latter-day hearts, even if today we shrink from expressing our
darker impulses so boldly.
</P>
<P>
   Something quite wonderful happens when ancient words are
conveyed with such brio. A Broadway audience is galvanized. How
strange, and cathartic, it can be to listen as characters vent
their lusts and fears and rages without any hint of
self-consciousness. Greek drama doesn't go in much for small talk;
while the characters in modern drama live in a universe of subtext,
shading the meaning of everything they say, Sophocles' figures have
a refreshing lack of regard for obfuscation. ``I want you to taste
the bitterness of death'' is how Orestes, superbly played by
Cumpsty, greets Aegisthus (the equally fine Daniel Oreskes),
moments before slaughtering him.
</P>
<P>
   Leveaux's production was unveiled last year at the Donmar
Warehouse in London and won Ms. Wanamaker an Olivier Award (over
such formidable competition as Dame Judi Dench in ``Amy's View,''
due on Broadway in the spring). After a brief run this fall at the
McCarter Theater with its new American supporting cast, it arrived
at the Barrymore for an eight-week run. Along the way, Leveaux,
best known for his direction a few years back of an acclaimed
``Anna Christie'' at the Roundabout with Liam Neeson and Natasha
Richardson, has refined the production, making the climaxes
sharper, improving the lighting effects and, it seems, helping the
actors take bigger risks in coloring in the more schematic aspects
of their characters' relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Electra's feelings for Orestes, for instance, are now more
ambiguous. Upon his return from exile, she gives her brother a
lingering kiss on the mouth. Seeing him again is a passionate
relief for her; she gains strength in the revival of her homicidal
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   From its earliest incarnation, the power center of this
production has been Ms. Wanamaker and her shattering Electra,
roaming Leveaux's physically as well as psychically wrecked world
in her murdered father's oversize coat. Her eyes puffy, her scalp
dotted with red patches, as if she had been tearing her hair out in
clumps, she is a figure of pitiless resolve, unable to purge her
obliterating sorrow over the murder of her father, Agamemnon, at
the hands of her mother Clytemnestra (Ms. Bloom) and stepfather,
Aegisthus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain, pain, pain, pain,'' Ms. Wanamaker declaims, the word
shriveling in her throat like a dry cough, until it practically
chokes her. The actress is endlessly inventive but never strident
or showy. In spite of her tragic countenance, it's a lyrical
performance; the music in her raspy, octave-climbing speaking voice
never stops. Neither does her agitation. Electra has lost
everything in the loss of her father: power, position, control over
her destiny _ she is under a kind of house arrest _ and her
powerlessness is expressed in a restless pacing of the stage. This
space offers no comfort, no consolation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such a forceful actress needs aggressive sparring partners, and
in the terrifyingly grand Ms. Bloom, she meets her match. Looking
ravishing in a scarlet gown and voluminous red shawl, Ms. Bloom's
Clytemnestra is vainly, haughtily feminine. This woman dresses to
kill. In her fiery exchanges with Ms. Wanamaker, you get a vivid
picture of a noblewoman enmeshed in her own desperate struggle to
maintain her power. The portrayal unmasks Clytemnestra's maternal
side as well; Ms. Bloom has a splendidly manipulative moment in
reminding Electra that it was Agamemnon's sacrifice of their
daughter Iphigenia that prompted her own murderous revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The counterbalance to Ms. Wanamaker's tumultuous encounters with
Ms. Bloom occur in the more tender scenes with Ms. Hinkle, playing
her flexible sister, Chrysothemis. The impressive Ms. Hinkle
continues to grow in the role. Her stature is dictated by her
softness. The actress has a delicate touch but stands her ground
with Ms. Wanamaker; her pleas for conciliation have the ring of
sisterly concern as much as self-preservation. No less substantial
is Cumpsty's Greek statue of an Orestes. He embodies the heroic
without ever seeming a stick figure. His reunion with Electra,
masterminded by Stephen Spinella's touching portrayal of Orestes'
servant, is now the production's emotional centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The performances work all the way down the line. Ms. Carroll, in
peasant garb, has found her footing as the play's navigator, Chorus
of Mycenae, intelligently asserting herself as the conscience of
the piece, choosing moments to egg Electra on or to advise a more
cautious tack. Oreskes, arriving late in the play and dressed in
white linen, like a California businessman, lets us feel Aegisthus'
sense of kingly prerogative at the precise moment that he realizes
his life is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the best of Greek tragedy, there's nothing frivolous
in this production, and nothing overwrought. The brutal economy of
the work comes to a stunning resolution in the play's perfect
closing line, enunciated by Ms. Carroll. ``The deed,'' she
declares, ``is done.'' A final moment, with the triumphant Ms.
Wanamaker poised on a damaged table. Over her face, she places a
Greek mask. Lights out.

HOUSE IMPEACHMENT VOTE MAY HINGE ON AS FEW AS 10 LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House impeachment vote may hinge on the verdicts
of as few as 10 undecided lawmakers, including Arizona Republican
Rep. Jim Kolbe, according to a private head count by leading
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The count, shared Thursday with ``The Arizona Republic,''
forecasts a dramatically close vote. The outcome would rest largely
on whether Kolbe and other undecided Republicans buck their party
by declining to support any articles of impeachment against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tt is increasingly clear that this thing is down to less than
10 and arguably less than five votes, of which he (Kolbe) is one,''
said a top Democratic vote-counter. ``It could be the biggest vote
of his entire political career.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a vote, incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston,
R-La., says he wants it to occur before Christmas. Republicans have
said privately that they probably have enough votes to support a
perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither Democrats nor Republicans have released any
public vote counts, and pundits have disagreed on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House voted 258-176 on Oct. 8 for an
open-ended impeachment inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee.
But a vote on actual impeachment would certainly be much closer,
because many of the 31 Democrats who joined the GOP in endorsing
the inquiry aren't expected to support articles of impeachment.
Also, some Republicans have been defecting.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe is just the sort of lawmaker whose support Clinton's
backers are seeking as they try to prevent House approval of a
perjury charge or other impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been targeting moderate Republicans from
congressional districts not considered overwhelmingly Republican.
Kolbe's district is split almost evenly between Democratic and
Republican voters. He won re-election last month, but with only 51
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe is in Europe this week attending meetings on security and
trade. Awaiting him in his congressional office is a thick briefing
book with background on the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man intends to do his homework,'' said Frances McNaught,
Kolbe's chief of staff. ``No one should read anything into this
(his indecision). He looks upon himself as a grand juror and feels
he should not be making decisions until he has an opportunity to
review the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has committed itself to voting on
articles of impeachment by the end of next week. After that, the
full House would need to be summoned back to Washington to approve
or reject any articles the committee passed. Any article of
impeachment endorsed by the House would send the entire matter to
the Senate; it would require 67 Senate votes to remove the
president from office, and that scenario is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   No Arizonan besides Kolbe showed up on the Democratic list of
swing votes. The list prominently includes Rep. Michael Castle,
R-Del., another undecided lawmaker who heads a moderate Republican
faction known as the Tuesday Group.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, buoyed by polls showing public disapproval of
the impeachment inquiry, is counting on at least a dozen Republican
defections.
</P>
<P>
   So far, GOP vote-counters have identified only five Republicans
dead-set against impeachment, according to ``Roll Call,'' a Capitol
Hill publication. They are Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut,
Mark Souder of Indiana, John Porter of Illinois, Jack Quinn of New
York and Peter King of New York. Majority Whip Tom DeLay has polled
dozens of GOP members and says there may be enough Republican votes
to impeach Clinton on a perjury charge, according to ``Roll Call.''
But Congress may also weigh an alternative, such as a censure,
which would stop short of impeachment. &QL;

DURAND TO TAKE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State Senator Robert A. Durand has accepted Governor
Paul Cellucci's offer to become state secretary of environmental
affairs, a move likely to delight environmental groups but create
some prickly political problems for Cellucci's efforts to fill top
administration positions.
</P>
<P>
   Durand, a hunter and outdoorsman, is a close Cellucci family
friend, four-term Marlborough Democrat and longtime chairman of the
Natural Resources Committee who is now the fourth-ranking Senate
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   According to individuals on Beacon Hill familiar with talks,
Durand told Cellucci Wednesday he will take the job, after weeks of
considering whether he had a more promising future staying in the
Senate. He apparently concluded he did not have clear support to
succeed President Thomas F. Birmingham down the road, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Durand has been enthusiastically supported for the environmental
job by representatives of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the
Environmental League of Massachusetts and several other groups that
liked his Senate record on bills to protect land, improve state
parks and restrict development along Massachusetts rivers.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to take the post, however, may work against one of
his Democratic colleagues, state Senator James P. Jajuga of
Methuen, a former State Police detective who has been aggressively
lobbying to be named secretary of public safety. Jajuga's major
competitor is outgoing Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey
Locke, a Republican defeated by state Senator William R. Keating, a
Sharon Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Hill staffers said Cellucci may find it politically
difficult to appoint two Democrats to his Cabinet, particularly
explaining the move to Republican loyalists. ``This gives Locke
some breathing room,'' said one administration insider, referring
to Durand's pending appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci refused to comment on his personnel decisions, but did
say that ``there's no limits, no quotas'' for the number of
Democrats he might name to the six-person cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for people who can help us get the job done,''
Cellucci said in a brief interview, adding that ``I think we'll
have something to announce next week'' on the environmental affairs
post.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is also trying to negotiate a peace within the
29-member House Republican caucus where House Minority Leader David
Peters of Charlton is facing an ouster by Representative Francis
Marini.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that was met with some astonishment among his
Republican colleagues, Peters Thursday sent House GOP members an
unprecedented, full-color ``year end legislative message'' that
attempts to justify his two-year tenure while acknowledging
``frustration'' among the Republican cohort.
</P>
<P>
   Peters is telling colleagues he has the votes to remain the
leader, but Republican insiders say Marini has a clear majority to
take the job from him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are said to be fed up with Peters's cozy
relationship with House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who was elected
speaker two years ago with backing from Peters and the rest of the
House's Republicans over the more liberal Richard Voke of
Charlestown, and for failing to bolster Republicans' precarious
hold on House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking to exit gracefully, but some of the members are
feeling he's fooling around too much with Marini,'' said one top
Republican source. ``But clearly, he's miscalculated. Marini is
ready for an all-out war if he doesn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters is said to be ready to accept Cellucci's offer to make
him state commissioner of fisheries and wildlife, but does not want
to look like he was pushed from power, Beacon Hill sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anderson of Citizens for Limited Taxation and Government
said it would be ``good news if Dave Peters is gone. Dave Peters
has just been too close to Finneran, and it's essential on Beacon
Hill that you have an active minority party. What we need now more
than anything on Beacon Hill is an opposition voice.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine, after walking in on the middle of a poker game, that
you are asked to choose which player will be the ultimate winner.
Would you automatically pick the player with the biggest pile of
chips?
</P>
<P>
   If your answer is no, then you believe in risk adjustment. You
realize that it matters how a player won his chips. If he did so
with one lucky bet, he is unlikely to be the overall winner. A
shrewder choice would be the player who has fewer chips but has won
them with relative consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of considerations apply to selecting an investment
adviser. But while many people have no difficulty understanding
risk adjustment in poker, they resist applying it to their
portfolios. They only want to know which adviser has made the most
money, period.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly puzzling in the current market. If nothing
else, the market's 20 percent selloff earlier this year should have
convinced investors that ignoring risk was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to focus on risk adjustment: You can sleep
better at night by doing so. Or, alternatively, you can make more
money. All it takes are some pretty simple tactics.
</P>
<P>
   If you weren't weighing risk, you might be drawn to the
portfolio of Prudent Speculator, an investment newsletter edited by
Al Frank. It has made more money than any other newsletter since
mid-1980, when I started monitoring the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Over those 18-plus years, it has produced a gain of 17.7 percent
annualized, compared with 16.1 percent for the broad market, as
represented by the Wilshire 5000 index.
</P>
<P>
   But consider how much risk Frank incurred in achieving those
returns. When measured by volatility, his portfolio was two and a
half times riskier than the market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Now ask yourself how much money you could have made on your own,
without subscribing to Frank's newsletter, if you were willing to
incur a similar amount of risk? A whole lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a portfolio that, by borrowing money, bought $250 of an
index fund for every $100 of its net worth. Such a portfolio would
have been no riskier than Frank's, yet over this same period would
have made 21.2 percent annualized, or 3.5 percentage points more
per year _ after paying the broker loan rate on the borrowed funds.
And the investor would not be paying a cent in newsletter
subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to look at these results: Adjusted for risk, Frank's
returns lagged the index by 3.5-point percentage points the price
paid for focusing on raw, unadjusted performance alone.
</P>
<P>
   Just as risk adjustment tempers Frank's achievement, it
sometimes increases the attractiveness of other advisers who may
have made less money. Such advisers haven't produced as high a raw
return, but have been more consistent.
</P>
<P>
   A good illustration is Growth Stock Outlook, edited by Charles
Allmon, which gained 11.9 percent, annualized, since mid-1980. But
Allmon's portfolio was only half as risky as the market, and only
about a fifth as risky as Frank's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in return for five times the risk, Frank gained
5.7 percentage points more per year. That's a poor trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are not inclined to risk adjustment might point
only to the ultimate difference in returns and ask: Why forfeit
those 5.7 percentage points? After all, you can't take a Growth
Stock Outlook's lower volatility to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But you can. Let's assume that you subscribed to Growth Stock
Outlook but were willing to incur as much risk as the Prudent
Speculator. By cutting the cash position that Allmon otherwise was
recommending, and then by using margin, you could have built a
leveraged Growth Stock Outlook portfolio whose risk matched the
Prudent Speculator's.
</P>
<P>
   Over the period of 18-plus years, this leveraged portfolio would
have returned 23 percent, annualized _ or more than 5 percentage
points a year more than Frank's.
</P>
<P>
   That would be something to bank on.

JUDGE APPROVES $25 MILLION LOAN FOR LIVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday night approved
a $25 million loan for Livent Inc., the Broadway theater company
that has been crippled by a financial scandal, after the lender
agreed to lower the interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Arthur Gonzalez relieved, at least
temporarily, an acute financial squeeze on Livent, which had warned
that without more cash by Friday it would close its doors on
Monday. Livent is the producer of ``Ragtime'' on Broadway as well
as other shows now in New York, Chicago and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's decision came after a lengthy hearing in his
Manhattan courtroom over whether the proposed lender _ Angelo,
Gordon &AMP; Co., a New York investment firm _ might have a conflict of
interest and be charging too much for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Livent creditors and bondholders had rejected the
loan from Angelo, Gordon, saying they were concerned that the firm
might have ties to companies interested in buying Livent or its
theaters. They also said they had found another lender willing to
lend Livent the money at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the creditors and bondholders did not mention any
names of companies with which Angelo, Gordon might have a tie. But
Angelo, Gordon was founded by John Angelo, a friend of Michael
Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co. Disney is among several
companies that have been mentioned as possible buyers of Livent,
its theaters or other assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Webster, an executive vice-president at Livent, told
the court he did not believe that Angelo, Gordon had an outside
``agenda'' in offering the company the loan. ``I believe they are
approaching this from purely a lending perspective,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam Harris, a lawyer for Angelo, Gordon, said that the firm
had no agreement with any third party that might be interested in
Livent.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-hour hearing attended by at least two dozen lawyers,
Webster said that the company would close its doors on Monday and
begin selling all its property if it did not get $13 million by
Friday. ``We don't have enough money to run the shows or run the
business,'' he said. ``We will begin to liquidate the company on
Monday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The creditors said that they had found another lender, Farallon
Capital Management, a California investment firm, willing to lend
Livent the money immediately at an interest rate of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But after negotiations behind closed doors, Angelo, Gordon
agreed to lower the interest rate on its loan to 13.5 percent from
14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors and bondholders then withdrew their objections. It
was unclear why they did not press for an even lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said the loan would carry the company to June or July.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now trying to reorganize its finances. This week,
Livent laid off hundreds of full-time and part-time employees, and
said that it planned to cut its administrative costs by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 18, Livent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection from its creditors. That move came just six months after
Michael Ovitz, the former president of Walt Disney, took over the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and the company's other new managers have blamed the
company's financial problems on its founders, Garth Drabinsky and
Myron Gottlieb. The new managers say the two men engaged in a
widespread financial fraud and manipulated the accounting ledgers
to hide millions of dollars in losses from the company's musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied all wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo, Gordon, a private firm, focuses on investing in
financially troubled companies. The firm was created in 1988 by
Angelo and Michael Gordon, who had headed the arbitrage department
at L.F. Rothschild &AMP; Co.

4 INDICTED IN NORTHWESTERN FOOTBALL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas, Pa., Ga., Wis., Mich., Iowa, Ohio, Ind.)  (bl) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Eight months after a point-shaving scandal embarrassed
its basketball program, Northwestern University suffered another
blow involving gambling Thursday when four former football players
were indicted on perjury charges related to betting on their own
games.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments, announced here by federal prosecutors, charge
the players with lying to a federal grand jury when they denied
betting on Northwestern games in 1994, as the Wildcats finished a
dismal season with a record of 3-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the players is accused of taking action to throw a
game. The indictment charges that Dennis Lundy, a star tailback on
the team, testified falsely when he denied fumbling the ball on
purpose in a November 1994 game against Iowa. Lundy, 26, of Tampa,
Fla., was then Northwestern's career-leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, which was excerpted in the indictment, Lundy
blamed the fumble on a sprained wrist on the previous play. ``I got
hit on the arm real good, and the ball just came out,'' he told the
jury. Prosecutors, however, have alleged that the game film did not
support Lundy's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy and Michael Senters, of Dallas, were charged with one
count of perjury, and Gregory Gill of Pittsburgh and Christopher
Gamble of Marietta, Ga., were charged with two counts. They were
accused of betting for and against Northwestern on various games,
including the 1994 contests with Iowa, Ohio State and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been gambling scandals involving college
football players, most involved players betting on sports but not
attempting to affect the outcome of games. The National Collegiate
Athletic Association said Thursday that it knew of no previous case
of point-shaving in football. And it is highly unusual that two
gambling scandals in two sports would surface at the same
university within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former Northwestern basketball players and two
gamblers were sentenced to prison terms of one to two months for
trying to fix three basketball games against Wisconsin, Penn State
and Michigan in February and March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's indictment alleges that the four players ran up
gambling debts by betting from $25 to $1,000 per game on college
and professional sports, paying a 10 percent surcharge on losing
bets.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment means only that the four have been charged, not
convicted. They will appear next week in U.S. District Court, their
first opportunity to enter a plea. If found guilty, they could be
sentenced to prison terms of up to five years on each count of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four student athletes betrayed their school, their
teammates, their fans and their coaches,'' said Scott Lassar, the
U.S. attorney for Chicago, who announced the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was the second gambling scandal in less than a
year at a school known more for the fierceness of its College Bowl
team than its appearances in the Rose Bowl, there was little stir
on the Evanston campus Thursday. ``It didn't really upset me that
much,'' said Jeff Esser, a student who was preparing for next
week's exams. ``People who come to school here are more focused on
academics than what the football or basketball teams are up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments, though, were announced on the afternoon of the
annual banquet for Northwestern's football team. After winning the
Big Ten title in 1995, earning a rare trip to the Rose Bowl, the
team has declined into its usual mediocrity. It finished 5-7 last
year and slid to 3-9 this season, without a victory in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Barnett, who came to Northwestern as the football coach in
1992 with the goal of ``taking the Purple to Pasadena,'' said he
had never questioned the integrity of the players charged. ``To
hear that there were other guys involved in some of it, it hurts,''
Barnett said. ``It doesn't indict a program. It doesn't indict the
school. It indicts the individuals. The stain is on the
individuals, not on the school.''
</P>
<P>
   The football scandal was unusual in at least three respects.
</P>
<P>
   Point-shaving in basketball is believed to be more common than
in football, where it is harder for a single player to affect the
outcome of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Point-shaving also usually involves a favored team playing
poorly to win by less than the point spread. The Northwestern
football and basketball players were underdogs accused of betting
on their teams to lose by more than the spread.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Northwestern basketball players, the football
players were not charged with receiving bribes to fix the outcome
of games. Prosecutors said the basketball players received money
from gamblers, while the football players put up their own money.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball and football scandals at Northwestern are
connected by a former football player, Brian Ballarini. He has
admitted that after injuring his knee he became a bookmaker, taking
wagers from student athletes. He pleaded guilty last summer to
gambling charges. He told investigators that he knew of
Northwestern football players who placed bets with him against
their team. At his sentencing, Ballarini said he was a gambling
addict and lashed out at Northwestern officials for not helping
him. Northwestern officials said they would have helped him but
that Ballarini had denied gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said a key piece of evidence would be videotape of
the Northwestern game against Iowa in November 1994. In the third
quarter, Northwestern was inside the 1-yard line with a chance to
cut into Iowa's 35-13 lead. Lundy fumbled a handoff on the goal
line and Iowa recovered. Iowa, favored by only 6 points, won the
game, 49-13.
</P>
<P>
   A teammate, Rodney Ray, believed that Lundy had a gambling habit
and complained openly that Lundy fumbled intentionally. Against
Ohio State just a month earlier, Lundy failed to score on a
two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the score. Ohio
State, which was favored by 15 points, won by only two points,
17-15. Barnett told reporters that Lundy had run the wrong play.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant coach overheard Ray's accusation and reported it to
Barnett. Northwestern hired an investigator, who discovered that
Lundy and a basketball player, Dion Lee, had been betting on
college sporting events. Lee held the Big Ten record for most
three-point field goals in a game.

   The school suspended Lundy and Lee, and turned over the
information to the U.S. attorney's office. Lee was one of the
people sentenced to prison last week for trying to fix basketball
games. Northwestern has expunged the names of Lee and the other
players from its record books.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney and the FBI commended Northwestern for
cooperating with the federal investigation. The NCAA said
Northwestern would not face any sanction in the case, because it
did not know of the gambling.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwestern spokesman, Allen Cubbage, said the school wasis
trying harder to persuade student athletes that gambling is
dangerous. ``They get the speech, and they get the literature,''
said Allen Cubbage.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said it believed many athletes yield to the temptation
to gamble. It said one study showed that 25 percent of players on
Division I basketball and football teams have bet on college
sports, and about 4 percent have bet on their own teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any college athletic program is at risk for sports wagering,''
said William Saum, NCAA director of agent and gambling activities.
``People need to realize that gambling is not a victimless crime.
The other players on the team, the cheerleaders, the fans, the
alumni, the other team _ these are the victims. We need to convince
colleges to remove the student bookies from our college campuses.
We need the media to realize that printing point spreads in the
newspaper is not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Saum said: ``We're not concerned about the
integrity of our game as it exists today. We're confident that the
games are square and on the up and up.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger is considering
filing a lawsuit against the New England Patriots and the National
Football League to prevent the team from leaving Massachusetts, his
office confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The action would likely be modeled after one or more suits filed
or threatened by other states _ including Washington, Missouri,
Florida, and Ohio _ that were faced with losing a professional
sports team, and could challenge the team's antitrust exemption as
well as the legality of breaking the lease at the team's current
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate on the likelihood of a lawsuit,''
said Harshbarger's spokesman, Ed Cafasso. ``I'm simply saying that
it's an issue that's on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso confirmed that lawyers in Harshbarger's office have
begun researching actions taken by attorneys general in other
states against professional teams. While in most instances those
suits were dropped or thrown out of court, they succeeded in
applying pressure that yielded desirable results.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially fertile area is filing an antitrust suit, which
other states have done to attack a number of issues regarding a
team's threats to move if it does not receive a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being explored is a legal challenge to the NFL's
apparent promise to Patriots' owner Robert Kraft that it would not
allow another football team into New England to compete with the
Patriots after the team moves to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Such a suit could be filed preemptively to delay or prevent the
Patriots' departure, or could be filed after the team relocates to
pressure the league to allow another team to play in the Boston
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were another NFL team that wanted to move to the
Massachusetts market and they were blocked by NFL rules from doing
that, that's the kind of situation that would increase the
likelihood of a lawsuit,'' Cafasso said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general in Ohio filed an antitrust suit in 1996 in
an attempt to keep the Cleveland Browns football team from moving
to Baltimore, where state lottery proceeds paid for a new $200
million open-air facility for the newly named Ravens. Cleveland
lost the team, but Ohio cut a deal with the league to get an
expansion team with the Browns' name and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri used antitrust claims against the NFL, which refused to
allow the Los Angeles Rams from moving to the smaller TV market of
St. Louis, thereby reducing revenues that are shared with all teams
in the league. The state had already built the $280 million
publicly financed Trans World Dome in St. Louis with the hopes of
luring a team.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of the suit, and the treble damages accompanying it,
pressured NFL owners to change their vote and approve the move.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Florida officials sued professional baseball's National
League in an action that, through the legal-discovery process,
allowed the state's attorney general to investigate the blocked
sale of the San Francisco Giants to Tampa Bay investors. As a
result, the team remained in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has occurred in other states has been researched here and
it has been discussed over the years, whenever the issue of the
Patriots leaving Massachusetts has become a possibility,'' Cafasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington case, the attorney general used a binding
stadium lease that the Seattle Seahawks signed with the county as
leverage to delay the football team from bolting to Los Angeles in
1996. As pretrial jurisdiction issues hit the appellate level,
Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen stepped in to buy the team with a
promise to keep it in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to exploit the Patriots' lease in Foxborough is one
approach Harshbarger could take, although it still needs to be
explored, Cafasso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done the kind of intensive analysis that would be
required to speculate about the likelihood of success in
Massachusetts,'' Cafasso added. ``Each case is driven by certain
facts and certain situations and agreements in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who also owns Foxboro Stadium and many acres of land
around the facility, does not own the footprint beneath the
concrete bowl. Foxboro Stadium Associates, which Kraft owns, has a
longterm lease for that property with the town of Foxborough. That
unique situation could allow the franchise to vacate without any
legal consequences, particularly because Kraft intends to keep The
New England Revolution, a Major League Soccer team, at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a lease to remain at the stadium only through
2001, which coincides with the target date for the team's proposed
move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other cases differ significantly from the one in
Massachusetts because in nearly every instance, the legal challenge
involved taxpayer money or other public support for a pro team.
With Massachusetts officials unwilling to dedicate public money to
the Patriots, Kraft had agreed to spend more than $200 million of
his own money on a new facility and had sought approval of a Senate
bill offering $72 million in public support only for improvements
on surrounding land and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been among the least generous stadium deals in the
country, but House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran opposed the land
component and no compromise was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Given the increasingly sweet taxpayer deals that NFL teams are
getting, coupled with the hostile political climate locally,
Massachusetts may not be any team's first choice to relocate, even
if the state could force the league to drop its ban against a
second New England team.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unlikely that Kraft would allow another franchise to
play at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a suit we would bring lightly,'' Cafasso
said. ``But it's always an option. A suit of that magnitude would
be incredibly resource-intensive. It would require numbers of
experts and a great deal of spadework to do it right. And this is
the kind of lawsuit that would require some support from the
governor and the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither branch has inquired about the possibility of a suit, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harshbarger could file a suit independently, without
the support or approval of Governor Paul Cellucci, the House, or
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should,'' said Stephen Ross, an expert on such litigation
and a law professor at the University of Illinois. ``People in
Boston are losing a team, and taxpayers in Connecticut are getting
hosed for hundreds of millions of dollars because of the NFL's
anticompetitive way that they set up issues concerning stadium
funding and financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the most radical suit would be to demand the breakup
of the NFL into two leagues, thereby opening professional football
to competitive forces, just like in the 1960s when the American
Football League existed. Such a case would have to build upon a
1986 verdict, in a suit brought by the now-defunct USFL, that found
the NFL was a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Competition would create more teams, allowing more cities to
host them without such lavish stadium deals. The teams would come
hat in hand, rather than having communities seeking the prestige of
having a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored antitrust suits have become popular, Ross said,
because money-generating facilities are one of the only ways
franchises can distinguish themselves within the NFL, where most
other revenue is shared among all the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a lot of bad effects, especially the incentive for
owners to move to see where they can rip off the taxpayers the
most,'' Ross said, adding that lease lawsuits are more
state-specific and technical.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Massachusetts is that Harshbarger, who gave up
his position to run for governor, leaves office Jan. 20 and will be
replaced by Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, whose
administration would have to fight the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of transition and whether the Reilly administration
would be supportive of this type of litigation would have to be
resolved,'' Cafasso said.

JUDGE FINDS STARR'S AIDES DID NOT ABUSE LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's prosecutors did not forbid Monica
Lewinsky to call her lawyer when they first confronted her at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Jan. 16, and in fact they gave her several
opportunities to call anyone she chose, a federal district judge
concluded in a finding unsealed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to that finding, issued last April but kept sealed
until now, President Clinton's lawyers and House Democrats have
argued that prosecutors mistreated Ms. Lewinsky by repeatedly
refusing her the opportunity to call her lawyer, Francis Carter.
They maintain that the incident illustrates Starr's
overzealousness, perhaps even misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, part of a ream of
documents ordered released this week by a federal appeals court,
sheds further light on the controversial episode at the
Ritz-Carlton, which occurred five days before the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal became public.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's prosecutors approached Ms. Lewinsky
there to try to win her cooperation in an investigation of whether
President Clinton or others had lied under oath to cover up his
affair with her. But Ms. Lewinsky's subsequent accusation that the
prosecutors' efforts amounted to bullying led the White House and
congressional Democrats to mine the incident for material they
believed embarrassing to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, White House lawyers demanded of Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee heads the
Clinton impeachment inquiry, that they be permitted to look at all
decisions by Judge Johnson ``addressing the question of whether Ms.
Lewinsky was denied access to her counsel, Frank Carter, on Jan.
16.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said they needed the information in
order to mount a defense of him before the committee next week.
</P>
<P>
   But in her decision, issued on April 28, Judge Johnson said
lawyers and agents from Starr's office had not barred Ms. Lewinsky
from calling her lawyer and had ``acted within the ethical rules in
questioning Ms. Lewinsky without her attorney present.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision, which sprang from complaints to her by Ms.
Lewinsky and Carter, was subsequently upheld by an appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said lawyers had not
reviewed the newly unsealed documents and would have no comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, Ms. Lewinsky's spokeswoman, also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly III, said: ``This is an
example where our prosecutors did not discuss rulings that would
have helped us to respond to attacks against the office. We were
prohibited from discussing it, because it was under seal, and we
adhered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Starr's office is not entirely absent from the
ruling, however. Judge Johnson said she was troubled by the fact
that prosecutors had begun immunity discussions with Ms. Lewinsky
at the Ritz-Carlton meeting without obtaining her lawyer's
permission, in violation of Justice Department regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court expresses its concern,'' the judge wrote, ``that the
Office of Independent Counsel may have acted improperly in
conducting immunity negotiations without the presence of her
counsel, but declines to take further action on this particular
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   When Starr testified before the Judiciary Committee two weeks
ago, Abbe Lowell, counsel for the committee's Democrats, suggested
that prosecutors and agents had held Ms. Lewinsky against her will
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Lewinsky's own account, one prosecutor at the hotel told
her that she could go to prison for 27 years if she was convicted
of perjury, and, when she said she wanted to call her mother to
seek advice, Jackie Bennett, Starr's deputy, told her: ``You're 24.
You're smart. You're old enough. You don't need to call your
mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned before the Judiciary Committee, Starr testified
that Ms. Lewinsky had been free to leave the hotel at any time and
had never been threatened or otherwise mistreated. He also said she
had been given several opportunities to call anyone she chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her perception was incorrect,'' Starr said. ``We made
it clear to the witness that she was, in fact, free to leave. And
the Ritz-Carlton, shall I say, is a fairly comfortable and
commodious place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At no point in his testimony did Starr mention the rulings that
had exonerated his office.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation of mistreatment was first raised by Ms. Lewinsky
and Carter last winter. Ms. Lewinsky had hired Carter to help her
draft an affidavit in the Paula Jones case in which she denied
having had a sexual relationship with the president. The affidavit
was filed on Jan. 16, several hours after Ms. Lewinsky had been
approached by Starr's prosecutors and agents at the Ritz-Carlton,
in suburban Virginia near the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Johnson that resulted from the
Lewinsky-Carter accusations was sealed until now because some of it
related to grand jury testimony. It was unsealed by court order
this week because that testimony has since become public knowledge,
largely through Starr's impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the judge's ruling, statements by two lawyers and
three agents from Starr's office were released Thursday, and they
portray in detail the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky at the hotel.
Their accounts contrast sharply with Ms. Lewinsky's recollection
that prosecutors refused her repeated attempts to call her lawyer
and tried to bully her into agreeing to cooperate with their
inquiry.

SUN GUILTY OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR, MICROSOFT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft's lawyers tried to show in federal court
Thursday that Sun Microsystems Inc., a tough competitor in the
software industry, was guilty of the same sort of anti-competitive
behavior that had prompted the federal government and 20 states to
file an antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With a Sun executive, James Gosling, on the stand, a Microsoft
lawyer, Tom Burt, introduced internal e-mail in which Sun
executives two years ago described meetings with Netscape
Communications Corp. at which it appeared that the two companies
were working toward an agreement not to compete in Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   One memo summarizing Sun's goals said, ``Unify browser efforts;
stop competing.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Netscape had a commanding market share in the
browser software used to navigate the Web, while Sun was creating
another browser, called Hot Java, written in Sun's Java programming
language.
</P>
<P>
   A key charge in the government's case against Microsoft is that
the company threatened to crush Netscape if it did not cede to
Microsoft the market for browsers written for Microsoft's Windows
operating system. Microsoft denies that charge and says its
discussions with Netscape were unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Burt asked Gosling about the Sun-Netscape
meetings. ``It's not at all unusual for companies to get together
and talk about how technologies ought to evolve, is it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling said, ``That's correct.'' But a few moments later, he
added, ``I do not recall any kind of decision to back away from
browsers because of any agreement with Netscape.'' Sun decided not
to begin selling Hot Java, he said, simply because the company
could not figure out how to make money with it when Microsoft was
giving away its browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said
Thursday's testimony ``further demonstrated that throughout the
software industry, companies meet together, talk together, plan
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, said that
was irrelevant. ``First,'' he said, ``the Sun browser had a trivial
market share, if any. Second, there was no agreement not to
compete. And there's no correlation with the Microsoft-Netscape
meeting because, in that one, you saw a monopolist, Microsoft,
using its monopoly power to crush another company unless the
company agreed not to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``even if there were a problem here, it
wouldn't get Microsoft off the hook. `Everyone does it' doesn't
really work as a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Microsoft's tack Thursday appeared to counter its
earlier strategy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Burt presented a case that Sun, a power in the
software industry, planned to use Java to mount a challenge to
Microsoft's dominance of the PC operating system market. This line
of attack was designed to convince Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
that Microsoft was facing such strong competition that it could not
be considered a monopoly under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Burt introduced numerous documents and
testimony to suggest that Sun's version of Java was actually a
slow, bug-ridden, poor-performing programming language that was the
object of ridicule in the industry. Given those facts, he
suggested, it was perfectly reasonable for Microsoft to create its
own, superior version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic was intended to counter government evidence that
Microsoft created a partly incompatible version of Java to cut off
any competitive threat posed by Sun's version. Burt never addressed
the seeming contradiction.

 Silicon Valley Tour _ Hype But No Depth   By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The saga of Silicon Valley has spawned enough intrigues, grand
failures and dazzling successes to stock a few dozen operas.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has inspired a superdeluxe limousine tour from Los Gatos
startup Tech-Tours that purports to give a sense of the historical
significance of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, a group of journalists, tech executives and a British
vice consul embarked on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the tour guide's bland recitation of dates and
names made the experience as flat as the roofs of the shoebox-style
buildings that cluster off Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   Like an earnest high school teacher, Tech-Tours President and
co-founder Deborah Lynn was determined to give her audience a
thorough grounding in every fact and figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, let's step back a few centuries and review some of the
background of the technology,'' she offered early on.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and business partner Nathan Cocozza, who said they have
years of experience in high-tech marketing and sales, launched
Tech-Tours a few weeks ago, after noticing Silicon Valley's notable
failure to show off its high-tech wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably every visiting group I talk to asks about a high-tech
tour,'' said Ann Marshall, marketing manager at the San Jose
Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau. ``We've had nothing to offer them.
You can't get into companies for security reasons, clean-room
issues. The closest thing has been the Intel Museum and now the
Tech Museum of Innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   The limo drove past a lot of tan, prefab buildings with signs
identifying them as Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, Intuit and
Cisco. There weren't any trips inside the buildings, perhaps
because the people inside were too busy inventing the future.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fleeting mention of Hewlett-Packard being started in
a garage, but no one got to see any garage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the shoeboxes, called the Repo Depot, bore a big sign
advertising deals on used office furniture. But long before its
present incarnation, it was known as Fairchild Semiconductor and
was a birthplace of the computer revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:40 a.m., the tour paused outside the Repo Depot to view
the bronze plaque commemorating Fairchild's invention of the
``first commercially practicable integrated circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 12:20 p.m. that the guide mentioned that some
Fairchild guys went on to start another company called Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The group also learned that a guy named Jim Clark started a
company called Netscape along with another guy named ``Marc
Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anderson was a young programmer,'' guide Deborah Lynn
explained, mangling Marc Andreessen's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape is one of the many Silicon Valley success stories,''
she continued.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  After a steady diet of factoids, some of the passengers began
to rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me something scandalous about Silicon Valley, so I can
tell it at my next cocktail party,'' pleaded one. ``I want some
juicy tidbits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's stick to the facts,'' said the valiantly smiling Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the passengers seemed to know more about
Silicon Valley than the guide. One explained that the reason
high-tech companies build a series of small offices _ rather than a
grand edifice _ is because they never know if they'll make it or
not and want to be able to give up some space in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Driving past Alza Corp., another guest noted that the firm is
working on a male-contraceptive patch.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting yesterday's ``special media launch day,'' which was
a bargain at $175 per head, Tech-Tours has conducted two outings
for paying customers: one for a quartet of Hollywood screenwriters
scoping out the valley for material, and one for a group of
businessmen from the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple _ partners in life as well as business _ have
high hopes that their ``moving museum'' will take off.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's sightseers appeared bemused by the constant stream
of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like driving around in a goldfish bowl,'' said Jo
Enefer, the British vice consul who was contemplating sending
visiting dignitaries on the tour. Being so confined to a car _ even
a 30-foot Lincoln Town Car limo _ might be a problem, she said.
Some of them ``would be champing at the bit to meet a real
person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a thick leather binder, Lynn rattled off the names
of companies that pioneered breakthroughs like point-contact
transistor amplifiers and symmetric multiprocessing. There was a
discussion of teraflops and gigaflops and the distinctions between
them _ ``The difference ... is like a whole lot,'' Lynn explained.
</P>
<P>
   Tech-Tours is not for your average out-of-towner who wants to
kill a couple of hours and see what the Silicon Valley hubbub is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   It aims straight at upper-echelon digerati: visiting corporate
VIPs, government dignitaries, foreign investors _ people who like
to go first-class and think nothing of dropping $250 or more for a
five-hour limo jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   The most deluxe part of the tour was the limo. Unfortunately,
only three people get to sit facing forward. One was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The other passengers &UR;  &LR; _ sitting sideways and backward _ started
to suffer from mal de mer after a while.
</P>
<P>
   The other elegant touch was the lunch, at Sunnyvale's Lion &AMP;
Compass, a palace of stained glass and oak. While there was a vague
reference to important tech talks being conducted there, there was
no mention that Nolan Bushnell started the restaurant in the early
1980s with his loot from Pong and Atari.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's grand finale was a visit to the Computer Museum
History Center at Moffett Field.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a tribute to technology's ease of use, it took four
uniformed guards using NASA computers 20 minutes to check in seven
guests in the ``Visitor Badging Area.``
</P>
<P>
   The center's aptly named curator Dag Spicer invested his tour
with all the spice and wit that the deluxe tour lacked.
</P>
<P>
   He showed off a truck-sized maze of vacuum tubes; the first
punch-card machine used in the 1890 census; and a piece of the
ENIAC, the world's first ``electronic stored program digital
computer'' which is a lot like saying it was the world's first
computer. The entire ENIAC was 18,000 square feet and had less
computing power than his wristwatch, Spicer said.
</P>
<P>
   Now housed &UR;  &LR; in a warehouse, the museum &LR;  (www.tcm.org)  &LR; needs $30
million and five to seven years before it flings open its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Spicer conducts public tours on Wednesdays from 1-3
p.m. and by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   You have to chauffeur yourself and bring your own lunch, but for
a taste of Silicon Valley history, the Moffett Field outpost
delivers the goods.

WILSON'S COMMENTS ABOUT OFFICIATING INFURIATE TAGLIABUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson and National Football League
commissioner Paul Tagliabue are angry _ though for different
reasons _ over a subject that has had telephone lines burning this
week across the league. Never before has the officiating gotten so
many people so mad.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Tagliabue, who is highly respected by the NFL
owners, faxed a letter to Wilson, stating that he intended to fine
him $50,000 for his critical comments after two controversial calls
in Buffalo's loss to the New England Patriots last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Lions owner William Clay Ford, who was highly critical
of several calls during his team's overtime victory over the
Pittsburgh Steelers on Thanksgiving Day, was faxed an identical
letter.
</P>
<P>
   During that game, the Lions benefited when an official
misinterpreted the Steelers' call of the coin toss in overtime, but
Ford called the game one of the worst officiated he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Wilson publicly blasted Tagliabue for ``pompous
lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, in turn, was said to be furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner lecturing to me as if I were a novice,
instead of one who has been involved in football indefinitely
longer than he has, contends that criticizing a call has
`destructive and corrosive effects on the game,''' said the
80-year-old Wilson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more destructive and corrosive _ errant calls in front
of millions of viewers, or my statements of opinion?'' Wilson
continued. ``People all over the country registered shock at the
way the officials, however honorable their purpose, took the game
away from us. Even the league has admitted to us that the calls
near the conclusion of the game were incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson added, ``I do know I don't need pompous lectures from the
commissioner and I feel that the $50,000 is not only unwarranted,
but punitive in nature. The next time he may ask me to sit in the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is considered by his peers to be one of the most admired
owners in the league, someone who has always acted with class. So
his comments were considered shocking _ no one would ever expect
Wilson to make his outrage public. It is an indication of just how
angry Wilson is.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson could face yet another fine from Tagliabue because of his
latest statement, said one league official who spoke on condition
on anonymity. That official said Tagliabue was ``furious'' over
Wilson's words, though a league spokesman said Tagliabue was simply
``very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, the official said, will probably issue the fine by
the end of the week. Then Tagliabue will evaluate if another fine
is warranted. It is also possible that Tagliabue could issue both
fines simultaneously, if indeed Tagliabue decides another fine is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills lost, 25-21, to the Patriots, thanks mainly to two
controversial officiating calls.
</P>
<P>
   The first call came during a fourth-and-9 play, during which New
England wide receiver Shawn Jefferson was awarded a 10-yard catch
after replays clearly showed he was out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The second call was pass interference which occurred in the end
zone as several offensive and defensive players jumped for a
desperation pass that set up the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, however, has opposed having the NFL return to the use of
instant replay to review officials' calls.
</P>
<P>
   Those calls, combined with the coin-toss foulup in the
Thanksgiving Day game between the Steelers and Lions, led to a week
of NFL officials being criticized perhaps more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The league even changed the coin-toss procedure; now a player
must tell the officials the team's choice before the coin is tossed
into the air, not while the coin is being tossed.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers' Jerome Bettis called tails at the outset of
overtime in the Lions' game, but the official claimed that Bettis
had said heads, and as a result Pittsburgh had to kick off to
Detroit, instead of receive. Detroit then scored on its first
possession to win that game.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that he has not decided if he will pay the fine or
appeal it, though a league official said that in the end he thinks
Wilson will calm down, pay the fine and work out the situation with
Tagliabue.

HMO PATIENTS RATE L.A.-AREA AREA PHYSICIAN GROUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In what it called a move to empower patients, one
of the state's largest health maintenance organizations released a
report card on the physician groups that treat its members.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, said suburban Woodland Hills-based Health Net, is
that overall scores have risen significantly since the first time
the HMO compiled such a study last year. The bad news is that the
gap between the best and worst plans remains wide.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, HMO members treated by UCLA Medical Group physicians
were most satisfied overall in areas such as the thoroughness of
the physical exams they received, the skill of their doctors and
their access to specialty care. Those at the Henry Mayo Newhall
Family Medical Group in suburban Valencia, meanwhile, appeared
dissatisfied with much, and just slightly more than 59 percent said
they would recommend the group to a friend or a relative.
</P>
<P>
   To compile the report, Health Net interviewed 550,000 members
and asked them to rate their physician groups in 28 categories. The
bulk of the plans emerged with a middle-of-the-road, four-star
rating, which reflects how well a physician group stacks up with
groups in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   Because most physician groups contract with several HMOs, the
report's authors say their findings could benefit more than Health
Net members, as when a physician group tries to be more responsive
to patients as a result of the report card. ``They're not going to
improve their processes only for Health Net but for the whole
membership in that medical group,'' said Antonio Legorreta, vice
president for quality initiatives at the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Legorreta said that in addition to encouraging members to use
the report card when picking a doctor, Health Net uses the data
when negotiating annual contracts with the physician groups. A
top-rated group can receive up to 5 percent more in per-patient
payments than one that scores below average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aligning the financial incentives of medical groups with
the results of the report card,'' Legorreta said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, physician groups said the report is generally on
the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health Net did a fairly good job,'' said Thomas Gordon, chief
executive of Cedars-Sinai Medical Delivery Network, which manages
groups that received three-, four- and five-star ratings.
</P>
<P>
   When their employers hand them a list from which to choose a
physician, ``employees are usually lost,'' Gordon said. Report
cards can provide a starting point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO's report card on doctors comes in the wake of several
years of ranking of HMOs by doctors, consumer groups and even news
magazines. And earlier this week, Baltimore-based HCIA Inc., a
health data company, released a ranking of area hospitals.

MASS. AG MAY SUE TO BLOCK PATRIOTS MOVE TO CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger is considering
filing a lawsuit against the New England Patriots and the National
Football League to prevent the team from leaving Massachusetts, his
office confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The action would likely be modeled after one or more suits filed
or threatened by other states _ including Washington, Missouri,
Florida, and Ohio _ that were faced with losing a professional
sports team, and could challenge the team's antitrust exemption as
well as the legality of breaking the lease at the team's current
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate on the likelihood of a lawsuit,''
said Harshbarger's spokesman, Ed Cafasso. ``I'm simply saying that
it's an issue that's on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso confirmed that lawyers in Harshbarger's office have
begun researching actions taken by attorneys general in other
states against professional teams. While in most instances those
suits were dropped or thrown out of court, they succeeded in
applying pressure that yielded desirable results.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially fertile area is filing an antitrust suit, which
other states have done to attack a number of issues regarding a
team's threats to move if it does not receive a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being explored is a legal challenge to the NFL's
apparent promise to Patriots' owner Robert Kraft that it would not
allow another football team into New England to compete with the
Patriots after the team moves to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Such a suit could be filed preemptively to delay or prevent the
Patriots' departure, or could be filed after the team relocates to
pressure the league to allow another team to play in the Boston
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were another NFL team that wanted to move to the
Massachusetts market and they were blocked by NFL rules from doing
that, that's the kind of situation that would increase the
likelihood of a lawsuit,'' Cafasso said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general in Ohio filed an antitrust suit in 1996 in
an attempt to keep the Cleveland Browns football team from moving
to Baltimore, where state lottery proceeds paid for a new $200
million open-air facility for the newly named Ravens. Cleveland
lost the team, but Ohio cut a deal with the league to get an
expansion team with the Browns' name and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri used antitrust claims against the NFL, which refused to
allow the Los Angeles Rams from moving to the smaller TV market of
St. Louis, thereby reducing revenues that are shared with all teams
in the league. The state had already built the $280 million
publicly financed Trans World Dome in St. Louis with the hopes of
luring a team.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of the suit, and the treble damages accompanying it,
pressured NFL owners to change their vote and approve the move.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Florida officials sued professional baseball's National
League in an action that, through the legal-discovery process,
allowed the state's attorney general to investigate the blocked
sale of the San Francisco Giants to Tampa Bay investors. As a
result, the team remained in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has occurred in other states has been researched here and
it has been discussed over the years, whenever the issue of the
Patriots leaving Massachusetts has become a possibility,'' Cafasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington case, the attorney general used a binding
stadium lease that the Seattle Seahawks signed with the county as
leverage to delay the football team from bolting to Los Angeles in
1996. As pretrial jurisdiction issues hit the appellate level,
Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen stepped in to buy the team with a
promise to keep it in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to exploit the Patriots' lease in Foxborough is one
approach Harshbarger could take, although it still needs to be
explored, Cafasso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done the kind of intensive analysis that would be
required to speculate about the likelihood of success in
Massachusetts,'' Cafasso added. ``Each case is driven by certain
facts and certain situations and agreements in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who also owns Foxboro Stadium and many acres of land
around the facility, does not own the footprint beneath the
concrete bowl. Foxboro Stadium Associates, which Kraft owns, has a
longterm lease for that property with the town of Foxborough. That
unique situation could allow the franchise to vacate without any
legal consequences, particularly because Kraft intends to keep The
New England Revolution, a Major League Soccer team, at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a lease to remain at the stadium only through
2001, which coincides with the target date for the team's proposed
move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other cases differ significantly from the one in
Massachusetts because in nearly every instance, the legal challenge
involved taxpayer money or other public support for a pro team.
With Massachusetts officials unwilling to dedicate public money to
the Patriots, Kraft had agreed to spend more than $200 million of
his own money on a new facility and had sought approval of a Senate
bill offering $72 million in public support only for improvements
on surrounding land and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been among the least generous stadium deals in the
country, but House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran opposed the land
component and no compromise was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Given the increasingly sweet taxpayer deals that NFL teams are
getting, coupled with the hostile political climate locally,
Massachusetts may not be any team's first choice to relocate, even
if the state could force the league to drop its ban against a
second New England team.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unlikely that Kraft would allow another franchise to
play at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a suit we would bring lightly,'' Cafasso
said. ``But it's always an option. A suit of that magnitude would
be incredibly resource-intensive. It would require numbers of
experts and a great deal of spadework to do it right. And this is
the kind of lawsuit that would require some support from the
governor and the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither branch has inquired about the possibility of a suit, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harshbarger could file a suit independently, without
the support or approval of Governor Paul Cellucci, the House, or
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should,'' said Stephen Ross, an expert on such litigation
and a law professor at the University of Illinois. ``People in
Boston are losing a team, and taxpayers in Connecticut are getting
hosed for hundreds of millions of dollars because of the NFL's
anticompetitive way that they set up issues concerning stadium
funding and financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the most radical suit would be to demand the breakup
of the NFL into two leagues, thereby opening professional football
to competitive forces, just like in the 1960s when the American
Football League existed. Such a case would have to build upon a
1986 verdict, in a suit brought by the now-defunct USFL, that found
the NFL was a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Competition would create more teams, allowing more cities to
host them without such lavish stadium deals. The teams would come
hat in hand, rather than having communities seeking the prestige of
having a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored antitrust suits have become popular, Ross said,
because money-generating facilities are one of the only ways
franchises can distinguish themselves within the NFL, where most
other revenue is shared among all the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a lot of bad effects, especially the incentive for
owners to move to see where they can rip off the taxpayers the
most,'' Ross said, adding that lease lawsuits are more
state-specific and technical.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Massachusetts is that Harshbarger, who gave up
his position to run for governor, leaves office Jan. 20 and will be
replaced by Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, whose
administration would have to fight the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of transition and whether the Reilly administration
would be supportive of this type of litigation would have to be
resolved,'' Cafasso said.

LABOR TALKS SPIKED BY PESSIMISM AND EMOTION 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the presence of Michael Jordan at the
bargaining table for the first time in more than a month, there
were few encouraging signs Thursday that the five-month-old
National Basketball Association lockout would end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and players, negotiating for the first time in 13 days,
exchanged angry words during bargaining sessions that began at 11
a.m. in Manhattan and lasted late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Two participants in the meeting said there was no compromise
between the players union and the owners, who rehashed old
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been less than amicable and several times talks almost
broke off completely,'' said one participant, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``But enough key people on both sides
decided that an open dialogue was better than none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides broke for lunch after meeting for almost two
hours. They met again for nearly five hours before caucusing
between about 6:30 and 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the owners nor the players took a dinner break, going
straight back into the bargaining room.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of urgency conveyed by Commissioner David
Stern. He was said to have made an impassioned plea to the players
that losing the season would have a devastating effect on the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts, also grew
emotional, a league official said. As he was giving a comprehensive
presentation of the NBA's plan for a collective bargaining
agreement, Checketts argued with the union's chief outside counsel,
Jeffrey Kessler, and other union lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jordan's presence that created the biggest stir. He
got out of a limousine at about 1:45 p.m. and took an elevator one
flight up to the bargaining session. In town for a board of
directors meeting for Oakley Sunglasses, it was Jordan's first
appearance at the negotiations since Oct. 28 _a marathon session
that ended at 1 a.m. in a Manhattan law firm.
</P>
<P>
   At one point that night, Jordan was part of a five-person group
that included the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and
Stern. Though Jordan spoke up Thursday and questioned owners about
their proposals, he stayed for only four hours. About 5:45 p.m. he
left to meet his wife for a family engagement and returned three
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides still argued over how to divide roughly $2 billion
in annual income over the next five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The recent stalemate was prompted by a failed negotiation on
Nov. 20, a session in which both sides claimed more progress than
any since the lockout began on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But within 48 hours, all progress was shelved. The union was
upset about an owners proposal that would severely limit the
signing of Larry Bird free agents, players who can sign for any
amount over a team's salary cap. The owners then accused the union
of reneging on its acceptance of a complex tax formula that was to
be used as part of an escrow system in the final years of a
proposed seven-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear late Thursday night whether they had made
progress on those economic issues or myriad others that separate
them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But with each announced productive session disintegrating into
charges and countercharges within days over the past two months, an
aura of pessimism permeated Thursday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt our last offer gave them what they wanted, which is
cost certainty,'' Alonzo Mourning said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to take everything from us. This lockout will
not end until the owners get as much as can from the players. It
comes down to greed on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said: ``There's a sense of
urgency, but the owners have said they won't operate our business
in a way that makes no financial. Obviously, you get more worried
as each day goes by.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that it will take about a month for training camp and
free-agent signings to take place after an agreement in principle
is reached, the earliest the season could start _ provided marathon
negotiations produced a settlement in the next week _ would be the
second week of January.
</P>
<P>
   That timetable would mean about a 48- to 50-game schedule,
figures that straddle the line of being considered a legitimate
season.
</P>
<P>
   The next major casualty of the lockout will most likely be the
All-Star Game in Philadelphia on Feb. 14. Granik and Stern have
been quiet about the possibility, preferring instead to try to
salvage the game.
</P>
<P>
   But one league official, on condition of anonymity, said an
announcement could be forthcoming in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the cancellation, the league will probably award
Philadelphia the 2002 game. Golden State and Washington have
already been selected to be host to the 2000 and 2001 games,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Russ have done all they could to try and make it
work, but it's just probably too late in the game at this point,''
the official said. ``We would probably need a miracle.'' &QL;

BOB HAGGART, 84, JAZZ BASSIST AND ARRANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Haggart, a bassist and arranger who performed with an
extraordinary variety of jazz groups during his nearly 70-year
career, died Thursday in a hospital in Venice, Fla., after
collapsing on his way to the post office. He was 84 and lived in
Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Haggart's long and varied career demonstrated his own vitality
as well as that of the music. Not only did he record with some of
the greatest black jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong, Ella
Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan and
Charlie Parker, but he was a mainstay in some of the great white
bands as well.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of his life he had not only participated in the
bands and recordings of figures like Bob Crosby, Eddie Condon,
Muggsy Spanier, Wingy Manone, Jess Stacy and Jack Teagarden, but
had become an important part of the neo-traditionalist movement
that he helped start by forming the World's Greatest Jazz Band in
1968 with the trumpeter Yank Lawson. Through the mid-1990s, Haggart
was still playing and recording with musicians like Kenny Davern,
Bob Wilber, Jane Jarvis and others.
</P>
<P>
   Haggart's success came in part from his ability to perform in
all sorts of different contexts, from small jazz groups to larger
pop ensembles designed for singers. He worked with the string
orchestra of Charlie Parker, and in the large ensembles that backed
Sarah Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   In the small groups his buoyant, swinging playing came to the
forefront; at his several appearances at New York's 92nd Street Y
in the 1990s, Haggart's playing always enlivened the band, making
the music swing harder than it otherwise might have.
</P>
<P>
   His first significant work in jazz was as a bassist with the Bob
Crosby band, to which he added not just his bass work but
arrangements that often proved to be classics, including ``What's
New,'' ``South Rampart Street Parade'' and ``The Big Noise from
Winnetka,'' a duet for bass and drums.
</P>
<P>
   That number, which he composed and recorded with the drummer Ray
Bauduc in 1938, opens with drums, has stop-time sections, slapped
bass and a rare musical virtuosity. Haggart whistles, Bauduc taps
on the bass strings with his sticks, and the effect is casual
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he left the Crosby band to freelance in New York,
working in recording studios and in radio and television. During
the 1940s Haggart was one of New York's most sought-after
musicians, recording and playing with such artists as Duke
Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   His playing with Armstrong is recorded on the ``The Complete
Town Hall Concert'' of 1947. For the next few decades Haggart
drifted in and out of the studios. He worked occasionally with Bob
Crosby reunion groups, and recorded with the saxophonist Bud
Freeman in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Haggart, whose full name was Robert Sherwood
Haggart, grew up in Douglaston, N.Y. He started playing guitar as a
teen-ager and then switched to the double bass when he was 17. He
is survived by a son, Bob Haggart Jr. of Sarasota, Fla., and a
sister.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he formed the World's Greatest Jazz Band with Lawson, a
group that in many ways provided inspiration for an entire movement
of neo-traditionalists that came to fruition in the 1980s and '90s.
In the '90s Haggart recorded regularly with the clarinetist Kenny
Davern and the saxophonist Bob Wilber, along with the pianist Jane
Jarvis and the saxophonist Rick Fay. In July 1996, he performed in
Japan with the World's Greatest Jazz Band. He was also an
accomplished painter in oils and watercolors and found a ready
market for his work.

MARGARET WALKER ALEXANDER, 83, CELEBRATED WRITER ON BLACK LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill., Ala.)  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Walker Alexander, who wove her experience as a black
woman in the Deep South into stories and poems that captured the
struggles and desires of her race, died Nov. 30 at the home of her
daughter Marion Colmon in Chicago. She was 83 and lived in Jackson,
Miss., on a street named for her.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born Margaret Abigail Walker in 1915 in Birmingham, Ala., to a
minister who was educated at Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill., she followed in her father's footsteps. A precocious child,
Margaret learned to read while still a toddler and began writing
poetry at 15 when she entered the university. She received a Ph.D.
from the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the WPA writing program, Dr. Alexander considered
herself part of the Chicago Renaissance, though she claimed to have
been cultivated by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance a decade
earlier, most notably her mentor, the poet Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, she became the first black writer to win the Yale
Series of Younger Poets competition, edited by Stephen Vincent
Benet, for her poem ``For My People'' from a compilation by the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   In it, she wrote: ``Let a new earth rise. Let another world be
born. Let a bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second
generation full of courage issue forth; let a people loving freedom
come to growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem, often quoted to describe the struggles of
African-Americans, became a sort of anthem for the Civil Rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander later became a professor at Jackson State
University, where she founded the Institute for the Study of the
History, Life and Culture of Black People in 1968. She served as
its director for 11 years, and the center was later renamed in her
honor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 she published ``Jubilee,'' which told the life story of
the daughter of a slave and a white plantation owner. The
best-selling novel, The New York Times Book Review wrote,
``chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of
bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel was at the center of a heated dispute in 1977, when
Dr. Alexander sued author Alex Haley, alleging that his book
``Roots'' infringed on her copyright for ``Jubilee.'' The case was
eventually thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who has captured the heart and soul of
black people any more than she did,'' Alferdteen Harrison, who
became the director of the institute when Dr. Alexander stepped
down, said. ``She was our model, our mentor. She had shown the way.
That was the mark of greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter Marion, Dr. Alexander, who was a
widow, is survived by another daughter, Margaret Williams, and two
sons, Firnist Alexander and Sigismund Alexander, all of Jackson,
and nine grandchildren.

ROY BENAVIDEZ, 63, MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT WHO ALMOST LOST
BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy P. Benavidez, a former Green Beret sergeant who received the
Medal of Honor from President Ronald Reagan for heroism while
wounded in the Vietnam War, then fought to keep the government from
cutting off his disability payments, died Nov. 29 at Brooke Army
Medical Center in San Antonio. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez, who lived in El Campo, Texas, suffered respiratory
failure, the hospital said. His right leg was amputated in October
because of complications of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 2, 1968, Benavidez, a staff sergeant with
the Army's Special Forces _ the Green Berets _ heard the cry ``get
us out of here'' over his unit's radio while at his base in Loc
Ninh, South Vietnam. He also heard ``so much shooting, it sounded
like a popcorn machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for aid came from a 12-man Special Forces team _ 3
Green Berets and 9 Montagnard tribesmen _ that had been ambushed by
North Vietnamese troops at a jungle site a few miles inside
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez jumped aboard an evacuation helicopter that flew to
the scene. ``When I got on that copter, little did I know we were
going to spend six hours in hell,'' he later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After leaping off the helicopter, Benavidez was shot in the
face, head and right leg, but he ran toward his fellow troops,
finding four dead and the others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   He dragged survivors aboard the helicopter, but its pilot was
killed by enemy fire as he tried to take off, and the helicopter
crashed and burned. Benavidez got the troops off the helicopter,
and over the next six hours, he organized return fire, called in
air strikes, administered morphine and recovered classified
documents, although he got shot in the stomach and thigh and hit in
the back by grenade fragments. He was bayoneted by a North
Vietnamese soldier, whom he killed with a knife. Finally, he shot
two enemy soldiers as he dragged the survivors aboard another
evacuation helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Loc Ninh, Benavidez was unable to move or
speak. Just as he was about to be placed into a body bag, he spit
into a doctor's face to signal that he was still alive and was
evacuated for surgery in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1968,
but a subsequent recommendation from his commanding officer that he
receive the Medal of Honor _ the military's highest award for valor
_ could not be approved until a witness confirmed his deeds.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in 1980, when Brian O'Connor, the Green Beret who
had radioed the frantic message seeking evacuation, was found in
the Fiji Islands. O'Connor told how Benavidez had rescued eight
members of his patrol despite being wounded repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan presented the Medal of Honor to Benavidez at the Pentagon
on Feb. 24, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Memorial Day 1983, Benavidez came forward to say
that the Social Security Administration planned to cut off
disability payments he had been receiving since he retired from the
Army as a master sergeant in 1976. He still had two pieces of
shrapnel in his heart and a punctured lung and was in constant pain
from his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The government, as part of a cost-cutting review that had led to
the termination of disability assistance to 350,000 people over the
preceding two years, had decided that Benavidez could find
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they want to open up your wounds and pour a
little salt in,'' Benavidez said. ``I don't like to use my Medal of
Honor for political purposes or personal gain, but if they can do
this to me, what will they do to all the others?''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said that Reagan was ``personally
concerned'' about Benavidez's situation, and 10 days later Health
and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler said the disability
reviews would become more ``humane and compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, wearing his Medal of Honor, Benavidez told the
House Select Committee on Aging that ``the administration that put
this medal around my neck is curtailing my benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez appealed the termination of assistance to an
administrative law judge, who ruled in July 1983 that he should
continue receiving payments.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan presented Benavidez with the Medal of Honor, he
asked the former sergeant to speak to young people. Benavidez did,
visiting schools to stress the need for the education he never had.
</P>
<P>
   Born in south Texas, the son of a sharecopper, Benavidez was
orphaned as a youngster. He went to live with an uncle, but dropped
out of middle school because he was needed to pick sugar beets and
cotton. He joined the Army at 19, went to airborne school, then was
injured by a land mine in South Vietnam in 1964. Doctors feared he
would never walk again, but he recovered and became a Green Beret.
He was on his second Vietnam tour when he carried out his rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez is survived by his wife, Hilaria; a son, Noel; two
daughters, Yvette Garcia and Denise Prochazka; a brother, Roger;
five stepbrothers, Mike, Eugene, Frank, Nick and Juquin Benavidez;
four sisters, Mary Martinez, Lupe Chavez, Helene Vallejo and Eva
Campos, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fellow Texans paid tribute to Benavidez. Several
schools, a National Guard armory and an Army Reserve center were
named for him.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not regard himself as someone special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real heroes are the ones who gave their lives for their
country,'' Benavidez once said. ``I don't like to be called a hero.
I just did what I was trained to do.''

JOSEPH F. UNANUE, 41, EXECUTIVE AT GOYA FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph F. Unanue, a senior executive in the Goya food business,
died Nov. 28 at the Swedish Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle.
He was 41 and lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a bone-marrow transplant,
according to a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Unanue (pronounced u-NA-nu-way) had been executive vice
president at Goya Foods Inc. in Secaucus, N.J., the nation's
largest family-owned Hispanic foods business.
</P>
<P>
   As the second-in-command at the company's headquarters, he was
among a handful of family and non-family executives who were
regarded as candidates for the two top positions in which his
father, Joseph Unanue, the president of Goya Foods, and his uncle,
Francisco Unanue, president of Goya de Puerto Rico Inc., the
company's main manufacturing center, share authority.
</P>
<P>
   Goya, which packages and sells about 800 food items _ from rice
and beans to sauces and spices _ throughout the United States,
Europe and Latin America, had revenue last year of $700 million, a
more than threefold rise over the last decade. The company employs
2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Unanue is credited with leading the company's expansion into the
Midwest and throughout the Southeast and Southwest and with
broadening Goya's reach beyond ethnic markets to shoppers of all
backgrounds. Until three years ago, Goya's only English-language
advertising had been in New York. He pushed for English-language
promotions in Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Unanue had grown up in the business founded in New York in 1936
by his grandfather, Prudencio Unanue, a Spanish immigrant who
parlayed an initial shipment of 500 cases of Moroccan sardines into
an olive-oil packing plant that just kept growing.
</P>
<P>
   As a child of 10 or 12, Unanue helped unload trucks and pack
olives. In the summers of his undergraduate years at Duke
University, where he received a bachelor's degree in philosophy in
1979, he continued his apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an M.B.A. at the University of North Carolina in
1981, he went to work at Goya's headquarters in Secaucus as
director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Unanue and a cousin took charge of a Goya cannery in
the mountains of Puerto Rico. He also worked with his uncle at Goya
de Puerto Rico in Bayamon. In 1989, he became general manager and
vice president of Goya de Puerto Rico. Then in late 1996 he took
the job as his father's No. 2 at the headquarters in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his father and his mother, Carmen, who have homes
in New Jersey and Puerto Rico, Unanue is survived by three
daughters from his former marriage to Isabel Banuchi, Isabel, Sofia
and Juliana, all of San Juan; four sisters, Mari Norris of
Cresskill, N.J., Mary Ann Quinones and Mimi Guggenheim of Miami and
Maribel McVicar of Norwood, N.J., and a brother, Andrew, of San
Juan.

LONG ISLAND GOP LEADER ARRESTED IN BRIBERY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER with JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The leader of the Republican Party in Suffolk
County was arrested Thursday and charged with taking bribes from a
private carter for access to a public landfill in Brookhaven and
with conspiring to traffic in stolen trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, John Powell, a former heavy-equipment operator for
the Brookhaven Highway Department, had a rapid rise to political
power in Suffolk County that culminated in 1995, when he took
charge of the county Republican organization. He had been
frequently mentioned as a candidate to head the Republican State
Committee, in part because of his early support for Gov. George
Pataki and his success in delivering votes for him on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 38, was among 19 people charged here in what federal
prosecutors said was a group of interlocking criminal schemes that
included operating ``chop shops'' _ in which stolen trucks were
taken apart to be sold for their parts or to be rebuilt and resold
_ and extortion at the landfill, as well as arson, obstruction of
justice and the sale of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen-truck operations were conducted from various
businesses in the county, including a horse farm in Manorville and
a truck repair company in East Patchogue, according to the criminal
complaint. The repair company was located across the street from a
trucking company, GP Tech, which prosecutors said was nominally
owned by Powell's brother, George, but which Powell is said to have
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint quotes government witnesses as saying that Powell
was aware that the East Patchogue company, owned by Joseph
Provenzano, was a chop shop. They say Powell was the ``driving
force'' behind GP Tech's purchase of trucks from Provenzano. In a
conversation secretly recorded in January, prosecutors said, Powell
discussed his desire to have the town of Brookhaven buy one of GP
Tech's trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who began his political career stuffing envelopes and
answering phones at the Brookhaven Republican Committee, and has
run that committee since 1991, has shown signs of imperiousness in
recent years, once boasting, ``I am Brookhaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But court documents contend that he tried to cash in on his
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prosecution's case involves allegations of bribes
made at the town landfill, where government witnesses described
widespread corruption, and centers on Joseph Lapienski, the
official in charge of the dump. Lapienski, who is accused of
extorting thousands from one unidentified Suffolk hauling company
in return for access to the landfill, referred to Powell as ``his
boss,'' prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who referred to the town dump as ``my landfill'' in one
intercepted conversation, prosecutors say, is accused of accepting
$20,000 over a 10-month period from the same hauling company.
Prosecutors said Powell suggested to an executive of the company,
who became a government witness, that the two ``become equal
partners'' on a new truck that would haul material to the landfill.
But prosecutors said Powell contributed nothing and expected $2,000
in cash each month.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that in May, when a search warrant was being
executed at Provenzano's East Patchogue truck yard, Powell lingered
at the scene, berating agents from the FBI and describing the
seizure of two GP Tech trucks there as ``a personal attack'' on him
and his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the following month, a year after the authorities had begun
their investigation, Provenzano was recorded telling a cooperating
witness how to continue making the cash payoffs to Powell without
being spotted by law enforcement agents, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the federal courthouse here Thursday, Powell referred to
the government's case as ``a joke'' but declined to comment
further. His lawyer, Raymond Perini, vowed that Powell would be
``completely vindicated'' and said he would push for a speedy
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a weak, thin complaint,'' Perini said.
``They're accusing the county leader of stripping trucks? It's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was released on $100,000 bail, secured by his house in
Medford. Powell will continue as party chairman ``into the
foreseeable future,'' officials of the Suffolk Republican Committee
said in a statement.

DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ACCEPT PLAN FOR SAVING HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Representatives of doctors and hospitals agreed
on Thursday to a state plan to provide patient treatment at reduced
costs for the next 90 days for members of the financially troubled
HIP Health Plan of New Jersey while the state tries to get it back
on a sound footing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the New Jersey banking and insurance
commissioner, Jaynee LaVecchia, who is the court-appointed
supervisor of the rehabilitation of the 194,000-member health plan,
proposed sweeping changes in state regulations of
health-maintenance organizations. She said the changes would
tighten regulation of HMOs and curb some of the business practices
that got HIP in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Ms. LaVecchia detailed the newly won support from
health providers for her plan to pull HIP from the brink of
financial ruin, she announced the failure of yet another HMO,
American Preferred Provider Plan. The 3-year-old company, based in
Paterson, is a Medicaid HMO with 44,000 members whose cash assets,
state officials assert, were looted by its owners and used to help
start Medicaid HMOs in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaVecchia insisted that each of the troubled HMOs
represented a discrete problem, not a systemic weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan for HIP, doctors and hospitals would immediately
get 30 percent of what they are already owed by the state's
fourth-largest HMO from unpaid claims. They also agreed to accept
payment of just 75 percent of what they bill the insurer for
treatment of its members over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also promised the providers to push for passage
of a guaranty fund, financed by the state's 23 HMOs, that could
retroactively pay them some of the money they would agree to forgo
for now.
</P>
<P>
   If at the end of 90 days HIP remained in trouble and insolvent,
Ms. LaVecchia said, it would be liquidated, its members sent to
other health plans and its assets sold to allow further repayment
of its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The state's plan comes more than a month after officials first
moved to take over the ailing, nonprofit HMO and forced it to sever
its 18-month relationship with Pinnacle Health Enterprises, a
for-profit company that had purchased the insurer's network of 23
health centers and, under contract with the plan, provided HIP
members with all health services and took care of all billing and
claims operations.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover prompted a race to the courts by the state to get
control of the centers and the 91.5 percent in monthly premium
payments that HIP had sent to Pinnacle and that will now be used to
finance the plan's rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   It also set off Pinnacle's mad scramble to the shelter of
bankruptcy protection to maintain control of the $70 million in
assets it had acquired from HIP as well as to protect other assets
of its parent company, PHP Healthcare Corp. of Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaVecchia said that one of the eight legislative and
regulatory changes she was recommending would prevent a
state-licensed insurer like HIP from transferring assets to an
unlicensed contractor like Pinnacle. Had such a provision been in
place 18 months ago, she said, the HIP and Pinnacle arrangement
could not have occurred and the providers would not be having their
current problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. LaVecchia noted that the health-care providers were owed
more than $100 million in past claims by HIP. ``But,'' she said,
``we are hopeful that they will join us in this plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conroy, a lawyer representing the Medical Society of New
Jersey, said the society endorsed the plan and would recommend that
its members sign formal agreements. Just last week the society and
its members were cool to a similar discounting of their past and
future claims to HIP, he said, but the leaders of the society
changed their minds after the commissioner's new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing couldn't be open-ended, because our doctors needed
a window in which they could plan financially,'' Conroy said. ``And
the retroactivity was crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Carter, the president of the New Jersey Hospitals
Association, said he, too, would recommend that the group's 112
member hospitals agree to the plan. The one dissenting voice on
Thursday came from the perennial antagonist of the providers, the
New Jersey Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langevin, president of the HMO trade group, angrily termed
the idea of surcharging his members to pay retroactive bills of
hospitals and doctors ``counterintuitive'' and added that it would
only drive up premiums for HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulatory changes that would clamp down on some
operations, he said, amounted to crippling strictures that would
put many companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Len Fishman, the state's commissioner of health and
senior services, whose agency shares regulation of HMOs with Ms.
LaVecchia's agency, said his office had received a few complaints
from HIP members who said that doctors or hospitals were refusing
to treat or admit them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the problems were quickly resolved, he said, adding that
under the court order obtained by the state to take over the
operations of HIP, health providers were forbidden to deny
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would agree that there is an ethical obligation for
doctors and hospitals, but there is also a court order that
requires them to provide care,'' said Fishman, refusing to discuss
what the state would do to those who did not comply.

COMMENTARY: IGNORANT CRY OF RACISM MAKES ALL KNEES JERK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's see if we have this right.
</P>
<P>
   A well-intentioned third-grade teacher, who happens to be white,
gave her mostly black and Hispanic students a critically praised
book about a black girl with kinky hair. Then parents came to
Public School 75, in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that they should have troubled themselves to read
the book, ``Nappy Hair.'' They might have found that it is about a
young heroine who celebrates that which makes her special.
</P>
<P>
   With ignorance in full bloom, they had no problem denouncing the
teacher as a racist, often in words of four letters. A couple of
them, whose children are not in the third grade, went so far as to
menace her _ ``We're going to get you,'' one said _ and to scream
anti-white slurs.
</P>
<P>
   So who did the school authorities choose to investigate first?
The well-meaning teacher, or the foul-mouthed, harm-threatening
parents?
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, of course.
</P>
<P>
   She stood accused, however falsely, of being ``racially
insensitive.'' And in the touchy-feely twilight of this century,
few sins will land you in purgatory faster than presumed
insensitivity, especially on a matter of race, sex, religion,
national origin or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that it took school officials little time to
realize that the teacher, Ruth Sherman, was guilty of no
transgression more serious than failing to clear the book with her
principal. The parents of her students praised her lavishly, as did
administrators at PS 75 and the local district, No. 32.
</P>
<P>
   Having immediately yanked her from her classroom (it was for her
own safety, they would later say, not in response to the racism
charge), the authorities asked Ms. Sherman to return. She declined
out of fear for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a good place to note that despite the occasional
well-publicized incident, physical attacks on teachers by parents
are relatively uncommon in New York's public schools. Most assaults
on staff members are by students, and their numbers have been
falling sharply, according to records kept by the United Federation
of Teachers. There were 913 in the 1997-98 school year, or fewer
than half the record 1,902 of four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were 913 assaults too many, and as Ms. Sherman
observed Thursday, ``How do I know that someone won't spit at me,
or push me?'' She expects to be reassigned, perhaps on Friday, to a
school in another borough.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is where this unpleasant episode should rest. Ms.
Sherman, 27, is prepared to let it go. ``There's so much tension in
that community that I don't want to stir another pot,'' she said
Thursday. ``I don't want to cause more tension. I'm not a
rabble-rouser.''
</P>
<P>
   But this incident won't disappear right away, because there is a
larger issue. The message that her instant removal from the
classroom sent to many New Yorkers was that a charge of racism, no
matter how knee-jerk and baseless, will get you into hot water more
readily than threatening someone with possible bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman's nascent teaching career was turned upside down for
no reason. What action has been taken against the menacing parents?
Thus far, 11 days later, nothing. And from the often-voluble
schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, there has been not a public word. So
much for the lesson that parents are supposed to instill in their
children: Behave responsibly, for actions have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   District 32 considered asking the police to get involved, but
then dropped the idea. Just as well, a Police Department spokesman
said. The threats against Ms. Sherman were too vague for criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   OK, what then might qualify as the ``appropriate action''
promised early this week by the district superintendent, Felix
Vasquez? Vasquez would not discuss the issue Thursday. But a Board
of Education spokesman, J.D. LaRock, said the PS 75 principal
``would talk to the parents and tell them that they behaved
inappropriately and that they have to behave appropriately when
they're in a school.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that with all the attention focused on this
episode, the lesson has been learned,'' LaRock said. At the board's
office, apparently, optimism reigns.
</P>
<P>
   As a coda, it might be noted that two years ago Ms. Sherman
tutored the daughter of a woman who threatened her last week. The
girl's reading scores went up, the teacher said. Ironic, some would
say. Others might find it all very sad.

ESCAPED TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE FOUND DEAD, FLOATING IN RIVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
and PAUL McKAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Death row inmate Martin Gurule, who broke
out of the Ellis Unit late Thanksgiving night, was found dead in
Harmon Creek Thursday, just one mile from the prison, officials
said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Two off-duty correctional officers who were fishing near the
community of Riverside about 5:30 p.m. spotted Gurule's bloated
corpse in the creek, which feeds into the Trinity River, prison
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said it appeared that the 29-year-old killer had
drowned and they estimated that Gurule's body had been in the water
at least a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Scott, the prison's executive director, also said
there was a wound on the body. It was unclear, he said, whether
Gurule injured himself on the prison's razor-wire fences or was
shot by prison guards as he fled a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long grueling seven days,'' spokesman Fitzgerald said
of the manhunt that involved hundreds of law officers and dozens of
tracking dogs. ``We believe it was the intense pressure put on by
prison employees and other law enforcement agencies that indeed
forced Gurule from his hiding place.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmate's body was taken to the Huntsville Funeral Home and
was to be transferred to the University of Texas Medical Branch in
Galveston for an autopsy. Fitzgerald said it could be several days
before a cause of death is determined.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, who was facing the death penalty for killing two men
during a 1992 Corpus Christi robbery, was the only one of seven
condemned killers to succeed in escaping. After using a hacksaw
blade to cut through the fence of a recreation yard just before
midnight on Thanksgiving, the group spent several hours on the roof
of a prison building before sliding to the ground and running for
the fences before dawn last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said Gurule, the first Texas inmate to flee death row
since 1934, had strapped cardboard around his body, under his
prison clothing, to protect him from the razor wire that tops the
two 10-foot chainlink fences he scaled before disappearing into the
foggy woods.
</P>
<P>
   The other six would-be escapees surrendered when guards began
shooting. None was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had launched a massive, round-the-clock search for
Gurule, but tracking dogs lost his scent in a marshy area near the
prison. Seven days of searching, including flyovers by helicopters
with heat-sensing devices, had turned up no leads until the body
was found.
</P>
<P>
   All seven inmates involved in the escape were part of the
nation's first prison work program to employ death row inmates.
Prisoners in the program were allowed much more freedom to move
about the prison than other death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the killers who tried to escape with Gurule had
attempted escape before. Despite that 1993 attempt, he was returned
to the work program, which produces prison clothing and other goods
for the corrections system.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial program was suspended by Criminal Justice
Board Chairman Allan Polunsky earlier this week, pending an
investigation. The captured inmates have been placed in
administrative segregation, a high-security setting in which they
are allowed to leave their cells for only an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush demanded answers and
asked the Texas Rangers to step in and conduct their own
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset about it,'' Bush said during an Austin news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, the investigative arm of the Texas Department of
Public Safety, had participated in the hunt for Gurule since
Monday, three days after the break, officials said. But Bush said
he wanted a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was sentenced to death for shooting Minas ``Mike''
Piperis on Oct. 12, 1992, during a robbery at a Corpus Christi
restaurant which Piperis co-owned with his brother, George. Gurule
also was charged with killing restaurant worker Anthony Staton, but
that case never went to trial. &QL;

SUCCESS OF `A BUG'S LIFE' SPELLS BIGGER PROFITS FOR PIXAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Silicon Valley legend &UR;  &LR; Steven &UR;  &LR; Jobs has become
the newest Hollywood mogul as the buzz over ``A Bug's Life'' turns
out to be much more than just hype.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated tale of ants vs. grasshoppers, co-produced
by entertainment giant The Walt Disney Co. and Jobs' Pixar
Animation Studios, has performed at the high end of expectations
during its 2-week-old life. Most analysts believe ``A Bug's Life,''
with around $70 million domestically after two weekends, will take
in $175 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is still there for going past $200 million,''
said Prudential Securities analyst Kathy Styponias. ``It's a solid,
solid movie and the buzz on it is building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life,'' which set a record for Thanksgiving holiday
performance despite serious competition from ``The Rugrats Movie,''
won't see a serious head-on challenge until Dec. 18 &UR; , &LR;  when
DreamWorks SKG opens ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance means Pixar, originally created by George Lucas
as part of his special-effects operations, will receive increased
recognition for its ability to mix powerful computer technology
with commercially viable stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pixar is not there yet, but they're on their way to people
going to see their movies sight unseen, just because they're Pixar
films,'' Styponias said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens,
has projected a $175 million domestic gross for ``A Bug's Life''
and about the same figure for its overseas box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers could be over $200 million, but we won't change
until we get more data over the next few weeks,'' he said. ``The
foreign (total) could also be $200 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have emphasized that early response to ``A Bug's Life''
shows that Pixar can deliver on its promises and that its success
with ``Toy Story'' was not a fluke. ``This gives us more confidence
that the next Pixar film is going to be solid,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, co-creator of Apple Computer with Steve Wozniak, bought
Pixar from Lucas in 1986 for $10 million and still owns more than
two-thirds of the company. Pixar, based in Richmond in the San
Francisco Bay Area, began receiving notice in 1988 when John
Lasseter's ``Tin Toy'' won the Academy Award for Best Short
Animated Film, then stunned Hollywood three years ago with the
surprise success of ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy over ``Toy Story'' -- the first feature-length,
computer-animated film -- and Jobs' reputation helped launch
Pixar's $140 million initial public offering, in which shares
jumped from $17 to $39 in the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Toy Story'' took in $192 million domestically and
$350 million worldwide, Wall Street's fever over Pixar subsequently
cooled as investors came to three realizations:
</P>
<P>
   --Pixar's deal with Disney gave Pixar only one-tenth of the
profits from a movie.
</P>
<P>
   --Pixar would not deliver another movie until this year.
</P>
<P>
   --Success in Hollywood is often elusive, with yesterday's
sure-thing blockbuster turning into today's flop in the face of
fickle moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   During 1996, Pixar traded as low as $12 a share and it finished
last year at $21 even though Jobs had negotiated a new
five-picture, co-production deal with Disney that gave Pixar half
the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The issue rose steadily during early 1998 and began swinging
wildly this summer as Disney launched a typically massive marketing
push for ``A Bug's Life.'' Bullish investors drove the stock up to
$64 in early July and pressure from short-sellers knocked it below
$29 by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are widely split on how to value Pixar, which has a
market value of better than $2 billion. In recent weeks, Pixar has
traded between $44 and $52, but was hit after Morgan Stanley
analyst Dean Witter downgraded the stock to ``neutral'' from
``outperform.'' Last week, Styponias downgraded her rating to
``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benjamin said last week that he retains a $75 price target
and Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman Selz reiterated his
``buy'' rating on Pixar with a 1999 target price of $60 as the
Thanksgiving grosses came in well above his estimates. Halpern
already has predicted that ``Toy Story 2,'' due out in November
1999, can generate $150 million at the domestic box office.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar also is developing a film tentatively called ``Hidden
City'' for release in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And when those pictures come out, Pixar will get a much better
share of the profit than it did with ``Toy Story.'' That's because
of the new deal Jobs struck with Disney, which was willing to offer
a sweeter deal because it is facing the biggest assault ever on its
animation franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the companies to split production costs, then
gives Pixar an equal share of the profits after Disney has recouped
its distribution costs. Merrill Lynch has estimated ``A Bug's
Life,'' which cost an estimated $90 million to make and distribute,
could generate more than $250 million in profits to Pixar from its
cut of theatrical, video, merchandise and TV revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge feather in Jobs' cap that he could get
that deal from Disney,'' Styponias said. ``Disney is extremely
tough in extracting favorable terms in negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney currently owns 2 percent of Pixar, and rumors have
emerged that it might buy the entire company from the 43-year-old
Jobs, who also is running the resurgent Apple Computer as interim
CEO. Styponias said that's unlikely, given Jobs' long-held interest
in Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback I get is that he really enjoys it, that Pixar is
fun and Apple is work,'' she said. ``He's kind of the center of the
universe at Apple, while he's not involved in day-to-day aspects of
Pixar. My sense is he doesn't want to give it up.''

OFF-DUTY PRISON EMPLOYEES FISHING, SPOT BODY OF DEATH ROW INMATE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Texas _ Mark Humphrey and Doug Smith were about to
call it quits with fishing about 5:30 p.m. Thursday, when they
motored out into Harmon Creek to check the trot lines they had run
near the community of Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a dispatcher for the prison system's Wynne Unit in
Huntsville, noticed something resembling a mannequin floating in
the middle of the creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun was going down,'' said Smith, 41. ``We were heading
toward one of our lines. I looked up and said, `Mark, look at
that.' We were pretty sure it was the inmate. The face was swollen.
We couldn't identify him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad thought came into my mind,'' said Humphrey, a
39-year-old prison truck driver who also works at the Wynne Unit.
``I said, `Oh, man, if it's got fingernails, it's not a mannequin.
I saw those fingernails, and I said, `That's a convict.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grabbed the clothes with a fishing gaff to keep the body
of escaped death row inmate Martin Gurule from floating off.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Humphrey said the body had several pieces of
cardboard wrapped around it with some kind of tape. While Smith saw
blood on the inmate and holes in his clothes _ but no bullet wound
_ Humphrey did not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities later confirmed that the body was that of Gurule,
who escaped late Thanksgiving night from the Ellis I Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Criminal Justice had launched a massive
search for Gurule, using about 500 law enforcement officers from a
variety of agencies, along with high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Humphrey said it would have been nearly impossible to spot
Gurule's body from the banks of the creek. The creek is about a
quarter of a mile wide at that spot, he said, and the body was
floating so low in the water it would have looked like a log. And
helicopters would have had difficulty finding it, too, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them spotting it with a helicopter would have been like
finding a needle in a haystack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey estimated Gurule, who was found floating face up, had
been in the water since shortly after he escaped because the body
was so badly swollen.
</P>
<P>
   The face was unrecognizable, but he had dark curly hair similar
to Gurule's, Humphrey said. ``He had convict attire on. Not prison
whites, but thermal underwear. To me it look like it had been dyed
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey and Smith said that Gurule had cardboard around his
belly, most likely to protect him when he scrambled over the razor
wire atop the prison's perimeter fences.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey dialed 911 on the cellular phone he was carrying and
was advised to stay with the body until authorities arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was minding my own business fishing,'' Humphrey added
with a wry laugh. ``And then I have to (go through) all that. It's
not something I want to do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is Humphrey's second episode with finding escaped
convicts.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, as he was hauling a load of prison pig
hides to Milwaukee, he was pulled over at a weigh station in Hope,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Three convicts working at a prison packing plant had cut holes
in three pig hides and crawled inside, and rode out with the
trailer load of hides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fate, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gurule's maternal grandmother, Amalia Marez of Corpus
Christi, Texas, wept uncontrollably at the news of her grandson's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have said a final goodbye to my baby,'' said
Marez, who helped raise Gurule after his mother died just before he
turned a year old. ``He was my first grandson. It's so sad because
I love him so much. He was so special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she got news of his death when reporters called her;
Gurule's father was notified by the Nueces County sheriff's
department, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been ``praying and praying'' for God to watch
over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Send your invisible angels and watch after my
baby.' I was praying for him constantly. Now that he's gone, that's
probably the way he wanted it to be.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Death row escapee caught
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino and Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ One of the largest manhunts in Texas history
ended Thursday when two off-duty Texas prison officers on a fishing
trip found the body of death row escapee Martin Gurule floating in
a creek just a mile from the prison he boldly broke out of a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bloated body, still garbed in prison-issue shoes and
clothing, was found about 5:30 p.m. He apparently died days ago,
prison officials said, after trying to swim swift-running Harmon
Creek near a road outside the Ellis Unit, which houses Death Row.
Officials said it was uncertain if there were additional wounds
because of the condition of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The condemned killer was found wrapped in cardboard inside two
layers of thermal underwear, a homemade get-up apparently designed
to protect him from razor-wire atop the 10-foot prison fences he
scrambled over late Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted off me,''
said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this supports our theory all along that he never
moved from the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, was one of seven death row inmates who outfoxed the
state by cutting through a recreation yard fence, hiding on a roof
for hours, and then dropping to the fog-shrouded ground to try to
scale two other razor-topped fences to the outside world. Gurule,
who was convicted of gunning down a Corpus Christi restaurant owner
in 1992, was the only one to make it out of the prison compound.
The other six gave up when prison officers began shooting from
towers 200 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's body, identified through fingerprints, was found by two
prison transportation officers from the Wynne Unit, Doug Smith and
Martin Humphrey. They were in a fishing boat running a trot line
when they saw Gurule's floating body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at peace now,'' said George Piperis of Corpus Christi, the
cousin of one of Gurule's victim, restaurant owner Minas ``Mike''
Piperis. ``It was tense, him being out on the loose and not knowing
what he might do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not bring my cousin back, but at least now justice has
been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The audacious breakout of death row stunned a state that has
gained a reputation for showing no mercy toward condemned killers,
carrying out far more executions than any other state in the
nation. The escape put a spotlight on the state's little-known
practice of allowing death row inmates to perform prison chores
that allowed them movement outside their cells.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 death row prisoners worked in a prison factory
that made uniforms for correctional officers. Gurule, who had been
a well-behaved prisoner since his incarceration, held a janitorial
job, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the break-out, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
came under severe criticism for running the work program, a system
no other state operates. The unusual work program was suspended
this week, and all 454 death row inmates have been locked in their
cells since the unexpected escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was the first death row inmate to escape a Texas prison
since the 1934 breakout of a member of the Bonnie and Clyde gang.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
conducted a round-the-clock search in the area around the Ellis
Unit, located about 15 miles northeast of Huntsville. As many as
500 officers, including many on horseback, aided by bloodhounds and
helicopters with infrared equipment patrolled 17,000-acres around
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hounds picked up Gurule's scent outside the 10-foot chain-link
fence where spots of blood were found later. But the dogs quickly
lost his scent on a nearby road.
</P>
<P>
   Roadblocks were set up in the around the Ellis Unit, and a house
to house search was conducted in the cluster of neighborhood of
correctional officer homes just outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The search was called off a few hours after Gurule's body was
pulled from the creek. Until about 8 p.m., corrections officers
were still posted as sentries along the roads around the prison,
huddled over small fires to ward off mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search is over,'' said Gary Johnson, head of the prison
division. ``We're relieved. This was an issue of public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said all along they believed Gurule would not
make it out of the prison vicinity. But on Thursday, the state
began circulating wanted posters with three photos of the wanted
killer and posted a $5,000 reward for him. Texas Crime Stoppers, a
state government program, offered the reward for information
leading to Gurule's capture.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Gov. George W. Bush had called on the Texas
Rangers to help figure out how Gurule escaped. ``I'm upset about
it,'' said Bush. ``I've asked the Texas Rangers to step in and
answer the question for me and for Texas . . . to find out why a
death row inmate escaped and is still at large.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had been involved in the search for Gurule since
early in the week. At Bush's direction, they had begun
investigating how the prisoner's escape plan had been hatched and
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they found him,'' said one guard posted along a road
nearby and who said he was not allowed to give his name. ``Now
maybe we can get up off this road.''
</P>
<P>
   American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief Ken Herman contributed
to this report.

BOEING OFFERS FREE PROGRAMS FOR EMPLOYEES FACING JOB LOSS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ May Lau, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Engineer, loads and dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Objective: a job in aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   May Lau is hopeful. ``I'm pretty marketable,'' she said.
``There's lots of jobs in other fields. But it's tight in
aerospace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau is in the third wave of layoffs; she got her 60-day warn
notice Nov. 25. She has a job at The Boeing Co. until the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave got their warn notices Oct. 2. They're on the
street today.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave got its 60-day notices Oct. 30. The next wave
gets its notices Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, as Washington state's largest company slims
down. As Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said Wednesday, ``When your
revenues go down, you've got to shrink the whole business.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing made the news Tuesday by forecasting a sharply lower
production rate in 2000 and cuts of 42,600 jobs in addition to cuts
already made since June. But airplane production goes up next year,
to 620 airplanes from 550. And while Boeing aims to build those
planes with fewer people, the ramp-up still means that many of the
early cuts will be non-assembly people such as planners, analysts
and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   People like May Lau. A recent graduate of the University of
Washington with a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics,
Lau has been at Boeing only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, she was at Boeing's Career Transition Center
in Renton, Wash., working on her resume. Clad in a sweater and
jeans, she was the only one there _ an indication, perhaps, of
less-than-burning urgency on the part of many co-workers, or an
urge to shove the distasteful task to the other side of Christmas.
Lau wasn't waiting; she said if she was going to be laid off, it
might as well be now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an advantage to be early,'' she said. ``As next year goes
on, it's going to get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   The service she was using is the latest thing in corporate
downsizing, and is available at Renton and Everett, Wash. The
center offers workshops (``Identifying Your Marketable Skills''),
video interview training, personal counseling and use of the
Internet, word processing, mailing supplies, postage and
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   These services, minus the Internet, were offered in the early
1990s. And though the market cost of the service is $1,500 to
$2,000 per user, Boeing spokesman Bob Jorgensen said the company
believes it is worthwhile to offer it as a free benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First _ the reason the company likes to talk about _ it's the
right thing to do. ``Phil Condit says it's the right thing to do,
and we need to do it,'' Jorgensen says. ``These are not employees
leaving because of poor performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``There's going to be an upturn down the road; there
always is.'' Boeing wants to be able to call people back. The
company doesn't want sour faces on those who are leaving _ or those
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the company doesn't want any incidents. ``In the last
downturn there was not a single case of workplace violence,''
Jorgensen said. Part of the job of the counselors is to defuse
anger, including temperamental outbursts at the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers like this program a lot,'' he said. All affected
managers received tapes showing how to deal with five different
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth _ the reason the company doesn't like to talk about _ is
lawsuits. People who are treated decently are less likely to file
them.
</P>
<P>
   The centers are open to salaried and hourly employees alike. The
two groups tend to use them differently. ``The salaried employees
tend to feel more confident they know what to do,'' Jorgensen said.
Like May Lau, they're there to use the computers and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hourly employees tend to need more support. They'll take
classes and sign up for counseling,'' Jorgensen said. ``But they
tend to find a job faster, because their skills are more
transferable.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate program is offered through the Aerospace Machinists
union, which includes up to $2,500 per year for three years in
retraining grants. The engineers' union, the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, has an informational package
that goes to all members facing layoffs. SPEEA also plans a job
fair in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody needs all this help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of people who can go out on their own,'' said
Lau, as she finished up work in the Boeing center. ``But it's nice
that they provide it for the people who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau is hoping to find work in Boeing; she grew up in Oregon, and
hopes to stay in the Pacific Northwest. But she said that depends
on what's available.
</P>
<P>
   Confident?
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, yes,'' she said. ``We'll see as my layoff dates
comes closer.''

TAPE OF TRIPP SLIPS OUT  
 POLITICAL PROPS PUT TO GOOD USE  
 HELP FOR HUDSON RIVER

<P>
   There has been talk that LINDA TRIPP, who tape-recorded her
talks with MONICA LEWINSKY, is talking about talking to LARRY KING
on CNN. For now, anyway, it is just talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda has made no commitment to appear on any show,'' said a
person close to her who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``She
has met with representatives of several media outlets and will meet
with others. As of now, however, she has not agreed to any
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   So why was Ms. Tripp seen last week on the tabloid-television
show ``Hard Copy''?
</P>
<P>
   She wanted ``to get some new pictures circulated,'' the person
close to Ms. Tripp said, so she agreed to be videotaped by the
television personality DAPHNE BARAK. No questions were asked _ or
answered _ and Ms. Tripp was not paid for the session, the person
close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The footage turned up on `Hard Copy,''' the person said,
``because Paramount, which owns the show, is one of the outlets
Barak is affiliated with.''
</P>
<P>
   Political Props Put to Good Use
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every day, elected officials cram their calendars
with ``same old, same old'' ceremonies. They give speeches. They
have their pictures taken. They do a lot of handshakes. Rarely does
inspiration strike.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Home Depot, the huge home-improvement retailer,
called a news conference in the Bronx to announce a tool-collection
drive for victims of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Honduras and
Nicaragua last month. The company said it had chosen the Bronx
because it has one of the highest concentrations of Hondurans in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, FERNANDO FERRER, attended. He shook
hands. He gave a speech. Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the light bulb go off as he was going through
his prepared remarks,'' said FRANK MARINO, a spokesman for Home
Depot. ``He said something like `Who needs to keep those mementos
on the walls?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer was talking about hard hats and shovels, the trophies
every elected official is given at groundbreaking ceremonies. The
bookshelves in Ferrer's office are crowned with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hats stacked upon hats,'' said his spokesman, CLINT
ROSWELL. ``It's sort of like walking into a construction area.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. Ferrer ordered his office cleaned out and the hats
and shovels delivered to Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Help for Hudson River
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Considering the blue-collar origins of Hudson
Riverkeeper, an environmental group formed in 1983 by fishermen and
former Marines, one might not expect it to be honored at a
celebrity-heavy event.
</P>
<P>
   But Hudson Riverkeeper is now run by ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., so
the rich and famous arrived in full force. BILLY BALDWIN, AIDAN
QUINN and EDWARD JAMES OLMOS were among those who turned out at the
brand-new Paul &AMP; Shark sportswear shop on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREA DINI, the president of Paul &AMP; Shark, said the company
expected to give Kennedy's group $30,000 to $50,000 from its sales
of limited-edition jackets, caps and sweaters with the Riverkeeper
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing one of the $497 yachting jackets, Kennedy christened the
store. He also treated the crowd to a brief history of his group's
efforts to fight suspected polluters like Exxon and General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's colleague, JOHN CRONIN, then led the crowd in
something of a chant, asking them to claim the Hudson as the
property of citizens, not polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under whose authority do we protect the Hudson River?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine!'' shouted the actress LORRAINE BRACCO, before the rest
of the crowd could chime in, ``Ours!''

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 GIULIANI VOWS TO PUSH CONTROVERSIAL GARBAGE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vowed Thursday to forge ahead
with his plan to ship most of New York City's residential trash to
transfer stations in New Jersey, saying that politicians furious
about the proposal would calm down once they realized the economic
benefits that their constituents stood to reap.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling of the plan on Wednesday piqued the interest of a
number of New Jersey towns eager to do business with the city,
Giuliani said, adding that he had received calls from ``at least
three public officials'' who were ``very, very anxious to make
deals with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Giuliani unflinchingly predicted that the plan would be
in place by the end of 2001, when the Fresh Kills landfill on
Staten Island is scheduled to close, opponents in both states were
threatening to do everything in their power to thwart it. In New
Jersey, elected officials said they would block construction of
huge transfer stations in Newark and Carteret, where garbage from
Manhattan and Queens would be shipped under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   And in Brooklyn, where a third transfer station would be built,
community groups were considering a lawsuit on grounds that the
plan violated environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a Republican whose second term will end just as Fresh
Kills is supposed to close, has a lot resting on the proposal.
Overwhelming support from Staten Island helped him win the mayoral
elections of 1993 and 1997, and that backing would also be
important if he decides to run for the U.S. Senate in 2000. If the
garbage proposal failed, it could also hurt any plans Giuliani
might have to seek a national office by raising questions about his
ability to carry out plans he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the mayor insisted that the plan would be
relatively easy to carry out _ even as he admitted that his
administration made what he called ``a good faith mistake'' by
waiting until the last minute to tell the New Jersey governor,
Christie Whitman, about the plan. Giuliani said his administration
kept the plan from public officials in New Jersey until it was
complete because of New York City's strict rules for reviewing
bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reflection, it certainly should have meant that Gov.
Whitman was briefed,'' Giuliani said in a rare show of contrition.
``That was a mistake, but it wasn't a bad-faith mistake. It was a
good-faith mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said he had
discussed the plan with Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff in several
phone conversations Thursday, and that officials from both
administrations would continue the talks in person. But while Mrs.
Whitman's aides said they were not necessarily against having some
of the city's garbage brought to the state, they promised to fight
Giuliani's plan to ship it to Newark and Carteret on barges and to
build new transfer stations to store it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about New York City's trash,'' said Pete McDonough,
chief spokesman for Mrs. Whitman. ``It is about the method for
receiving it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., also denounced the plan,
using even sharper language than the governor's aides. ``This is
not going to happen,'' said Torricelli. ``Garbage cannot be
transferred on barges off of beaches without impacting the quality
of life in New Jersey. We must present a united front in opposition
to this plan.''

RANKINGS DON'T IMPRESS BIBBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is picking up steam nationally, garnering
votes in both top 25 polls and rising to 25th in computer guru Jeff
Sagarin's power ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell Trojans coach Henry Bibby, who claims to care
less about any rankings, even though USC (4-0) is off to its best
start in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about a poll. It doesn't mean anything,'' Bibby
said. ``It's as bad as the Internet. It's a lot of gossip. I enjoy
being 4-0. I enjoy winning one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Bibby to change his message. He adopted the same
one-game-at-time cliche two years ago as USC made its run to the
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do what you're supposed to do, everything will fall
into place,'' Bibby said. ``I don't know about anything (power
ratings). That's something that gets you sidetracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership vacuum? Bibby said one of his concerns is that the
Trojans do not have a veteran player who has emerged in a
leadership role. He continues to hope junior forward Jarvis Turner
will eventually become that player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need that leadership role from an elder
statesman,'' Bibby said. ``No one's really taken over yet. (Senior
guards) Larry (Ayuso) and Adam (Spanich) are not that. We're
looking for an older person who can bring that.''
</P>
<P>
   A logical candidate would seem to be junior-college transfer
Brian Scalabrine, who leads USC in scoring (15.8 points) and
rebounding (7.5 per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's new,'' Bibby said. ``He's only played four games.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier shines: Sophomore guard Jeff Trepagnier has been the
hit of the young season, according to Bibby. He is the Trojans'
most complete player, averaging 10.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.75
blocks and 1.75 steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key to our team,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contribution is not on the stat sheet,'' Bibby added.
``It's his energy on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Swillis waiting: After not playing a single minute in the past
two games, forward Shannon Swillis met with Bibby earlier this week
about his role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he told Swillis to be patient as he tries to see what
some of the new players can contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Shannon Swillis can do. I know what he brings to
the table,'' Bibby said. ``I'm looking and fishing to see where
everybody fits in. Everybody can't be happy. Every player has to
find a role where he can help the basketball team. It's not
anything against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One way for Swillis to increase his minutes would be to switch
back to power forward from small forward. The coaching staff wasn't
exactly thrilled last year when Swillis expressed the desire to
become a small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice has been to take each practice one day at a time,''
Bibby said. ``We have to look past the selfish mode from last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Power player: Freshman forward Sam Clancy is USC's
second-leading rebounder, averaging 5.8 per game despite playing
just 13 minutes a game. Clancy is averaging a rebound every two
minutes.

   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange on Thursday failed to
ratify a $900 million plan to build a new trading complex in lower
Manhattan and said it would resume consideration of a move to New
Jersey, but a bit of last-minute tinkering appears to have saved
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials in New York, who had expected the
directors of the exchange to approve the deal Thursday, were
stunned to learn about the sudden revision in what had been a
carefully written script.
</P>
<P>
   But after several tense hours, Richard Grasso, the chairman of
the Big Board, drove to City Hall from Wall Street for a 5 p.m.
meeting with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The 60-minute parley ended
peacefully with an agreement to resolve what both sides described
as ``some minor issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and Dick Grasso just concluded a meeting,'' the
mayor's press secretary, Colleen Roche, said Thursday evening.
``They made good progress, and we expect to wrap up the deal in a
couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for the exchange, also said the
meeting resolved some open issues. ``We're hopeful there'll be a
speedy resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal appeared to have hit a serious snag earlier Thursday
when the exchange issued a statement: ``No vote was requested at
the board meeting. Discussions continue with the city and state of
New York and with the state of New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of dickering, city and state officials in New York
had agreed to acquire an entire block across the street from the
exchange's historic home on Wall Street and to build a trading
complex at an estimated cost of $450 million. The officials would
also provide the exchange with up to $160 million in tax breaks and
low-cost electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, in turn, would pay rent starting at $10 million a
year for the trading complex, which would rise on the block bound
by Wall Street and Exchange Place between Broad and William
streets. City and state officials hope to offset the estimated $300
million cost of acquiring the property by selling the right to
build a large office tower over the trading box.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials have been pursuing the stock market since
May, after exchange officials complained that City Hall seemed more
interested in building a new stadium for the Yankees than it was in
retaining the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has also talked to Mack Cali Realty Corp., which
was willing to build a 1.2-million-square-foot headquarters at its
Harborside Financial Center complex in Jersey City, N.J. But
real-estate executives on both sides of the Hudson River said there
was little chance that the exchange would leave Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   John Dyson, chairman of the mayor's council of economic
advisers, played down the brief contretemps with the exchange
Thursday and the threat to move to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like to let go of the Jersey card until the last
minute,'' Dyson said. ``We have a handshake deal with Grasso.
Honorable men do not easily give their handshake. We just have a
few details to work out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the deal with the New York Stock Exchange is completed, it
would end an often contentious, decade-long poker game in which
each of the city's four financial markets has threatened to flee to
New Jersey in order to extract a package of subsidies and tax
breaks. Bluff or not, the city has agreed to provide nearly $1
billion in subsidies, including $599 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of arrangement has prompted reproaches from Giuliani's
critics. ``The mayor's ideology of limited government obviously
excludes this kind of mega-handout of public resources for private
purposes,'' said Harvey Robins, the city's director of operations
under former Mayor David Dinkins. ``These resources are better
spent on the long-term investments in schools, transportation,
parks and libraries, which make the city a better, more competitive
place to live and to work for all New Yorkers.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The basketball referees are restless, jangly,
suspicious of a world without carefully painted lines and
half-circles underfoot. When the National Basketball Association's
doors locked on the players, the refs got their paychecks but not
their whistles or striped uniforms. So now they sit around at home
watching old game tapes and calling each other with pop quizzes.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a clear-path-to-the-basket foul or not? Answer yes or
no, fast.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bavetta, one of the best-known referees in the game, gets
out his trampoline and jumps on it, runs eight miles every day
around his neighborhood in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn, and
tops it off with a bike ride. He puts on his NBA cap and visits
hospital wards, his lean face instantly recognizable even to casual
basketball fans. He speaks to school assemblies that regard him
warily as some kind of hoops cop.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not enough to replay calls in his mind and keep his
58-year-old body taut, waiting for the call that a settlement has
been reached; there is more being lost in this lockout than the
orderly demonstration of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bavetta's other mission in life, almost as well-known as his
encyclopedic knowledge of the rule book, is to sandblast the
stone-faced image of the sports official, to soften it with humor,
spontaneity and even the occasional lindy with team mascots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to deliver the goods,'' he said Thursday in his
den, amid the exercise equipment. ``But once you've done that,
you've also got to show that you don't take yourself too seriously.
It's just part of my personality, and I just hope the league
doesn't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The league doesn't mind. In fact, among basketball insiders, who
trade Bavetta stories like sports cards, Bavetta's antics have
become some of the most memorable moments of the last few decades,
missed this season almost as much as the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time, a few years ago, when the Chicago Bulls
mascot trotted onto the court, followed by three small children
dressed as baby bulls. The littlest one kept tripping over her
costume, so Bavetta _ the father of two daughters _ ran out to
midcourt and carried her as she went through her mascot routine,
cozying up to players and even kicking the other two officials. The
crowd laughed hysterically.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, the Coyote mascot of the San Antonio Spurs
tried to get Bavetta into a mock punching match during a game,
urging the referee to really let him have it. Bavetta shrugged and
socked him in the mesh breathing area of the costume, sending the
coyote flying across the court.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went wild as attendants came and removed the mascot on
a stretcher, figuring it was all part of the act, but in fact
Bavetta had broken the actor's nose and knocked him unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, other league mascots have made an elaborate
show of avoiding the man they call Boom Boom Bavetta, whose job
description, of course, includes throwing out players for
unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he wears five pairs of socks to every game. He likes the
padding on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just one of the top referees in the game,'' said
Garry St. Jean, the former coach and now the general manager of the
Golden State Warriors. ``He's also the guy who will dance with the
mascots, and give the ball to a 5-year-old at his first game during
a time out, and say hello by name to the ball boys and equipment
managers. He just makes you light up when you see him on the floor,
even if he did call me for a technical once.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ruefully, ``Right now, we need more characters like
Dick Bavetta.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That wasn't the case back in the 1960s, when Bavetta was
frantically writing letters to the league, begging to be considered
for an official's job. He was working on Wall Street then,
officiating at weekend small-college games and occasionally for the
old Eastern Basketball Association, which became the Continental
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive out of my way to go by Madison Square Garden,
fantasizing that maybe one day I could referee a game in there,''
he said. ``I kept trying to get someone from the NBA to come to a
game where I was officiating. I guess by 1975 they just felt sorry
for me and let me in.''
</P>
<P>
   He became an energetic, gutsy official, never hesitating to make
big calls when games hung in the balance, a favorite among coaches
for his willingness to admit, after a game, that he might have
blown a call or two. (Assuming the tapes are incontrovertible, that
is.)
</P>
<P>
   Imposing order may have come naturally to the son of a New York
City police officer, whose brother was also a police detective.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, listening to his father
talk about prohibition and Al Capone, he saw officiating as the
perfect mixture of sports, show business and law enforcement, and
has sacrificed for it. His wife left him when he was hired by the
NBA, preferring a husband who was home for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And so, having fashioned his life around his role, he waits for
the phone to ring with good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is crying out to me, `Bavetta, what are you doing
speaking at a grammar school?''' he said. ```You should be in the
Meadowlands.' It's just because I love this more than anything.
We'll get back.''

`HOUDINI'S' APPEAL PROVES ILLUSORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Houdini, stud muffin.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the TNT movie ``Houdini'' threatens to send your eyes
rolling back into their sockets (hint: early, often), they put
actor Johnathon Schaech in a loincloth.
</P>
<P>
   And usually, right about then, somebody bangs on a gong.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't do much for me, frankly, but I'll presume that the
effect is positively volcanic on some sectors of the cable viewing
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Written, directed and produced by Pen Densham (``The Outer
Limits''), the film will show three times Sunday on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   You can find George Segal, Rhea Perlman, Ron Perlman, Paul
Sorvino and David Warner in the cast. But they're like illusionist
tricks themselves; now you see them, now you don't.
</P>
<P>
   The real principals are Schaech (he sounds like Harry Hamlin and
played the lead singer in ``That Thing You Do!'') as Houdini and
Stacy Edwards (``Chicago Hope'') as his wife, Bess.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and Grace Zabriskie, who proved in ``Twin Peaks'' that
she has an eye for the unusual. Here she's Houdini's mother, listed
in the credits as Mother.
</P>
<P>
   I would summarize the movie this way: I love my wife but oh, you
Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Mother is a Hungarian Jew who doesn't speak English. Zabriskie
plays her as a woman who has apparently entered the spirit realm
years before her death. She's icy, cadaverous and shows her eldest
son no physical affection.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, Harry is crazy about her. When she dies, he
scorches a path to every spiritual medium on the continent in hopes
of reaching her. Then he becomes obsessed with exposing all mediums
as charlatans. And meanwhile, Bess seeks comfort in a stout bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Schaech has a rather small screen presence to play the great
escape artist, who died on Halloween in 1926 and, so far as we
know, has not popped up for a bow.
</P>
<P>
   But give Schaech some credit. He does gamely throw himself into
several of Houdini's seemingly dangerous routines. Hence the
loincloth and gong wake-up calls.
</P>
<P>
   Densham professes to a long-standing fascination with Houdini.
Sure enough, the film is earnest and admiring. But watch-worthy?
Not really.

<P>
   _ Showtime's ``Girls' Night,'' showing Sunday, is a narrower
miss, and with even more knockout talent on display.
</P>
<P>
   The English film stars two Oscar nominees, Brenda Blethyn
(``Secrets &AMP; Lies'') and Julie Walters (``Educating Rita'').
Joining them, for the fun of it, is gnarly old Kris Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's rewarding to watch the women work. But ``Girls'
Night'' is achingly slow and, at least for me, ultimately
unaffecting.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn and Walters play sisters-in-law and factory co-workers
in northern England. Their predictable, somewhat forlorn lives are
brightened when they win a national jackpot at a bingo parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Then Blethyn learns that she has a cancerous brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls' Night'' gets a much-needed lift when the two women fly
to Las Vegas for an impulsive holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're bloody talking!'' exclaims Walters when she first
sees the massive casino at the Riviera, and by that stage of the
movie, I shared her sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas experience also includes Kristofferson as a
saddle-worn bachelor cowpoke who's doggone tired of being lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to England and another sag in the story. ``Girls'
Night'' ends as a shameless tearjerker. I was just checking the
clock.

 &HT;    With season in jeopardy, Jordan joins labor talks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Monday, NBA players lost their second pay day of
the locked out season. On Tuesday, teams were busy processing
refunds, plus 6 percent interest, to ticket holders for games lost
the month of November.
</P>
<P>
   With that as backdrop and the clock ticking toward a drop dead
date, the NBA and the players association were back at the
bargaining table late Thursday night in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was a small sign of optimism when Michael Jordan showed up
after an uneventful morning session, then returned at mid-evening
after a three-hour break for a personal appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be made
(by the owners), and he wanted to be there to listen to it,'' agent
David Falk said. ``You can read into it that he's continuing to be
involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the underlying pessimism of Deputy
Commissioner Russ Granik who saw small potential for compromise and
the combative thrust of at least one player, Miami's Alonzo
Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   The combustible player walked into the first session Thursday
throwing verbal darts at ownership. ``This lockout won't end until
the owners get as much as they can out of the players,'' said the
player who made $11.25 million last season. ``It comes down to
greed on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Danny Schayes of Orlando put matters into perspective,
commenting that ``It's not even about finding a middle ground that
both sides can be happy with, it's about finding a middle ground
that the sides can be equally unhappy with.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only the third full negotiating session since training
camp was canceled. Meetings Oct. 28 and Nov. 20 held some promise,
but showed no tangible results. Indeed, the only results appeared
to be a hardening of positions.
</P>
<P>
   But while both parties agreed to start with a fresh agenda, it
was learned that the owners and players instead tried to salvage
the work of the last session, which blew up with debris of charges
and counter-charges threatening to destroy the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the reality is that the players know they will miss at
least two more checks before the earliest possible starting date in
early January.
</P>
<P>
   The owners know they will be forced at the minimum to refund all
ticket money for December games on top of November. For the Hawks
that involves about 6,000 tickets a game, split among the Georgia
Dome and Georgia Tech so that costs cannot be specific. But for a
middle tier team like Orlando it came to this for the opening
month: a per-game refund cost of $640,000, based upon the average
ticket price of $46 with 13,900 season ticket-holder.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 percent or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if
spending on overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage
of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   After vowing not to exceed a 50-50 split, the owners moved to 53
percent on Nov. 20 and the players dropped to 57 percent.

CITY CHALLENGES STATE PLAN TO SPLIT TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arguing that the proposed tobacco lawsuit settlement
would shortchange New York City by as much as $2 billion, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani is contesting New York state's planned allocation
of its share of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's lawyers notified a state judge Thursday that the
city is challenging the state's formula for sharing the money and
reserving the right to drop out of the joint settlement and pursue
its own lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the state attorney general, Dennis Vacco, who is in charge
of the state lawsuit, defended the formula and said New York City
is being treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   New York state is part of the nationwide tobacco litigation,
which includes a proposed settlement estimated at $206 billion over
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide share of that is about $24 billion. Vacco's office
said the formula would split that amount about equally between the
state government and local governments, with New York City getting
$6.7 billion and the counties outside the city getting about $5.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement gives a higher allocation to counties outside
New York City on a population basis, on a damages basis, on almost
any basis you look at,'' said a senior adviser to the mayor,
Anthony Coles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is not going to allow a settlement that gives New
York City less than what it is entitled to. He is going to fight
for fairness, and he has directed the corporation counsel to be as
aggressive as he can be until and unless the city gets its fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the state formula appears to give New York City more
than its share based on population _ more than half the funds for
local governments, though the city represents less than half the
state's population. But the city contends in its court case that it
bears a greater burden in paying for tobacco-related illnesses than
other local governments. The city did not make clear Thursday night
how it arrived at its reckoning of a possible $2 billion shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The city was the first entity in New York to sue the tobacco
companies, but it joined with the state and the counties that
followed. Coles said the city is reserving its right to contest
whether the state as a whole is getting its fair share of the
proposed national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
the city said the scope of the litigation makes it ``a most
unusual, if not unique, case.'' The city complained that it needed
more time to study the ``extraordinarily complex'' formula, which
it said was disclosed only on Wednesday. An initial review, the
city said, indicated that counties outside the city ``will, on
average, get nearly twice their proportionate share.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the city's claims, the attorney general's spokesman,
Chris McKenna, said, ``Dennis Vacco worked extra hard to make sure
the settlement was more than fair to New York City.'' The city is
getting more than half the share for local governments statewide,
he said. The city's own lawyers ``were involved in crafting the
formula, so it's curious that this is coming up at the eleventh
hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, McKenna said, ``the city has a choice: They can opt out
of the settlement and proceed with their own suit.'' Friday is the
deadline for the city to make that choice, but part of its appeal
seeks to postpone that deadline and be given a chance to make its
argument in a ``fairness hearing'' in the state courts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city's actions come at an awkward moment politically.
Giuliani and Vacco are both Republicans, and the mayor campaigned
for the attorney general's re-election last month. The Democratic
challenger, Eliot Spitzer, has claimed victory, albeit by a thin
margin of about 21,000 votes, but Vacco has refused to concede.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who has criticized the proposed tobacco settlement on
other grounds, said Thursday night that the allocation issue offers
another reason for delay. Despite his bitter campaign exchanges
with the mayor, Spitzer said is willing to review the city's
claims.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ ``Mi Vida Loca'' (my crazy life) is
embroidered on his ring robe. Somehow, that does not begin to
describe the troubles that the bantamweight Johnny Tapia has
endured.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is amazing Tapia is still boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia's father was shot to death when his mother was pregnant
with Tapia. When he was 8 years old, his mother was kidnapped,
raped, hanged and stabbed to death with an ice pick by five men in
Albuquerque, N.M., the Tapias' hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very brutal murder,'' Tapia said. ``She was
stabbed 21 times. It had to do with jealousy. She was a beautiful
woman. I got from the DA the results of my mom's death and they got
all five of the guys. But, bless their hearts, they're all dead
now.''

   When he was 12, Tapia was a passenger on a bus that plunged 100
feet off a cliff. He walked away with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia has served time in jail for intimidating a witness in the
murder trial of a cousin. He is on probation for a spousal-abuse
charge in which he pulled a loaded gun on his wife and manager,
Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine addiction kept him out of the ring from 1990 to 1994.
When he returned to the ring, he went on a tear that made him one
of the most dangerous 115-pound boxers in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Through all his pain and failings, Tapia is undefeated (44-0-2)
and in good position to defeat Nana Yaw Konadu (39-3-1) in a World
Boxing Association championship bout at the new Atlantic City
Convention Center on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable in the ring, but outside the ring I'm a
very lonely person,'' Tapia, 31, said Thursday afternoon inside a
crowded, noisy meeting room at Bally's Park Place Casino before his
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got people in my life that love me for me now. I'm just
taking it one day at a time and having Jesus in my life to guide me
and protect me. I have a lot of faith in God, and what he has done
for me, to turn my life around, has been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia said he did not blame anyone for the bad things that had
occurred in his life, particularly the things that he brought on
himself. He seems to have made peace with his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of yesterday, because it's gone, and I don't
think of tomorrow, because it might never come,'' Tapia said.
</P>
<P>
   He is moving up in weight, adding 3 pounds to fight Konadu, a
hard-hitting puncher from Sunyani, Ghana, who once held the World
Boxing Council superflyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia has been saying he was going to move up to the
bantamweight division since 1988, but once he won the World Boxing
Organization junior-bantamweight title (115 pounds) with an
11th-round technical knockout of Henry Martinez on Oct. 12, 1994,
promoters kept putting a string of No. 1 contenders in front of
him, and he kept beating them. His thinking: Why mess with a steady
paycheck?
</P>
<P>
   Tapia added the International Boxing Federation
junior-bantamweight title when he won a 12-round decision over
Danny Romero on July 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That bout put Tapia more in the public eye. It was a
neighborhood feud played out on television. Tapia was friends with
Romero and was trained by Danny Romero Sr. before the two had a
bitter split.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Tapia has gone through trainers the way Murphy Brown
went through secretaries. He once hired the venerable trainer Eddie
Futch for three weeks to prepare him for a fight. He dismissed
Teddy Atlas, after Atlas objected to his wife's being at training
camp. He hired Freddie Roach, a Futch disciple who worked with the
heavyweight Michael Moorer and has a way with temperamental boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning, so I pick up things from different
trainers,'' Tapia said. ``As soon as I stop learning, I'll quit
boxing. I've found a good one this time, and a good friend.''

IS IT TIME FOR STEVENS' TOTAL ECLIPSE?
</HEADLINE>
 IN 15TH GRAPH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Is this the year Gary Stevens finally wins the
Eclipse Award as the nation's outstanding jockey?
</P>
<P>
   It could depend on which version of the ``official'' statistics
is mailed to Eclipse voters at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is based here in Southern California, ranks first
in earnings with more than $18.8 million in purses this year,
according to the list put out by the Equibase Company under the
auspices of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   But he's only third, with $16.2 million, behind Kentucky's Pat
Day ($17.2 million) and New York's Jerry Bailey ($17 million), in
the list published more widely by the Daily Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the Racing Form doesn't count races run
outside North America, costing Stevens credit for Silver Charm's
$2.4 million victory in the Dubai World Cup last March and other
foreign earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings isn't the definitive statistic when it comes to
comparing jockeys _ there is no definitive statistic _ but it's the
first one the voting reporters and racing executives are likely to
read. Thus, the Racing Form and the NTRA have a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to unify all the data,'' said Irwin
Cohen, a Racing Form senior vice president, whose goal is ``a level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eclipse is for North American jockeys, voters won't
be out of line if they consider the results of the Dubai World Cup,
which has emerged the past few years as one of the sport's biggest
events and always draws top U.S. horses and riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you really can overlook a race like the Dubai
World Cup when one of the leading horses (Silver Charm) in the
United States is going over there,'' said Chris Scherf, executive
VP of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, which runs the Eclipse
voting.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to give riders credit for purses earned when
they ride North America-based horses overseas but not when they
ride foreign-based horses overseas. That way, Stevens' Dubai World
Cup money would count, because 1997 Kentucky Derby winner Silver
Charm is all American, but the $250,000 Stevens earned in the Dubai
Duty Free the same week would not, because he won that race aboard
an Arab-based horse.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy would require judgment calls and produce more
controversy than it prevents.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Cohen said, the keepers of the racing statistics
will agree to include the Dubai World Cup and the Dubai among about
a dozen foreign races ``in which Americans routinely ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it will be up to Eclipse voters to decide which of each
jockey's accomplishments to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it works when voters compare the horses who are up
for divisional Eclipse Awards. Horses' foreign races are included
in the Racing Form past-performance charts that are mailed with the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 35, was voted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1997 but
has never won an Eclipse, although he's been close, coming in
second to Craig Perret in 1990 and to Bailey more recently.
</P>
<P>
   He has three factors going for him in '98:
</P>
<P>
   All of his important numbers compare well with the other
contenders. His horses' earnings per race ($22,481, if you include
Dubai) dwarf Bailey's $16,575 and Day's $14,051. His million-dollar
victories (five) dwarf Bailey's two and Day's one. And although
Bailey leads with 14 Grade I wins, five of those came aboard Skip
Away, two involved Banshee Breeze and two involved Escena; Stevens'
six Grade I wins involved six different horses.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens did well in the brightest spotlights, riding two winners
on Breeders' Cup Day and riding Victory Gallop to a dramatic win
over Real Quiet and Kent Desormeaux in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters might be tired of Bailey, who has won the award the past
three years, an Eclipse record for jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Stevens is out of the country again this week,
riding in Japan before returning to Hollywood Park on Sunday to
ride Manistique in the Bayakoa Handicap. Will the Japan earnings
count? We'll have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The weekend: &LR;  The race that produced Hollywood Park's
first-ever walkover in 1997 might be close to a one-horse race in
'98.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharp Cat circled the track alone to win the Bayakoa
Handicap. Sunday, Manistique might have only two opponents in the 1
1/16-mile race for fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Stripes and India Divina, South America-breds who have
yet to win a stakes in this country, are the only other confirmed
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique was the nation's hottest 3-year-old after she won her
first three races, including the Hollywood Oaks, by a combined 31
lengths. But she has been sidelined because of a throat infection
since finishing third to Banshee Breeze in the Alabama Stakes at
Saratoga in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have big plans for her,'' said John Shirreffs,
who trains the huge daughter of 1990 Kentucky Derby winner
Unbridled for owner Marshall Naify. ``But, for now, we just want to
get her through (the Bayakoa).''
</P>
<P>
   Not much will stand in her way. &QL;

SKIES DEFINITELY UNFRIENDLY IF YOUR AIRLINE TICKET'S A FAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With the holiday season under way, just about
everybody is looking for a cheap plane ticket -- and criminals are
willing to sell you one.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of burglaries and robberies at travel agencies in the
suburban San Fernando Valley in recent weeks is boosting an already
thriving underground market in stolen tickets, police said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as two dozen stolen or fraudulent tickets are seized
each month at Los Angeles International Airport, leaving hapless
travelers stranded or faced with paying the full price, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent to 10 percent of advertised budget fares involve
stolen or fake tickets, usually sold for less than the going price,
police said. But most often, these stolen tickets are sold on the
street by people hanging out near legitimate travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's too good to be true, then it (ITAL)is(END ITAL) too
good to be true,'' said Detective Al Aldaz of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Van Nuys Robbery Section.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves typically hand the tickets to a fraud ring that
prepares them for use by imprinting them with legitimate agent
codes from other businesses, said Detective Ron Ponzi, who
specializes in airline fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The rings also research the going rates for travel to various
regions so they can offer their stolen tickets for a hard-to-ignore
price, Ponzi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the travel-agent lingo,'' he said. ``It's a very
sophisticated and complex network of individuals involved in these
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have a difficult time breaking these
rings because travelers seldom can provide enough information. The
meetings between buyers and sellers usually are short, and
transactions often happen through a ``friend of a friend,'' Ponzi
said.
</P>
<P>
   With at least two Valley-area travel agencies robbed and one
burglarized within the past two months, batches of stolen airline
tickets have hit the market, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask TK Travel owner Laurie Stalick, who was robbed Nov. 3
of between 400 and 500 tickets by two masked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them pulled a gun from his waistband and cocked the
trigger and said: We want airline tickets. We're sorry that we had
to do this, but we lost our jobs and we want to go see our
families,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those tickets ended up being sold on the street, police
told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a time of year when they need quick cash, so I
think we're all vulnerable because cash flow is real tight,''
Stalick said at her office in suburban Northridge. ``I just think
we're living in a real sorry world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the New Age Travel Agency in suburban Sherman Oaks
was robbed by two armed men who stole 500 blank coupons that can be
made into about 100 usable airline tickets, Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Travel Mart in suburban Woodland Hills also reported
a burglary in which the thieves rammed a vehicle into the front
door to steal six boxes of coupons that can also be made into
usable airline tickets, said Detective Jary Quinones of the LAPD's
West Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported in the robberies and the burglary. As
of Thursday, no suspects had been arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the stolen tickets are usable, but any alert airline
ticket counter clerk should be able to tell by computer that they
are stolen by typing in the ticket's stock number, Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   But many times, the bogus tickets can slip through the airlines,
travel industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ticket agent has to be sharp,'' Ponzi said. ``If there's
20 people lined up to get on an airplane, that's the hard part. If
the ticket agent is really busy, sometimes they'll get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Salfen, director of consumer affairs at the International
Airline Passengers Association in Dallas, said agents often fail to
check stock numbers at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely assure you that they're not checking each
stock number,'' he said. ``They don't have time.''
</P>
<P>
   So in most cases, the passengers will go on board unnoticed,
Salfen said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some airline agents are trained to look for stolen
tickets, and if a passenger should get caught with a bad ticket, he
or she loses out and must pay the full fare to travel, Salfen said.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport in suburban Burbank sees an
average of one illegal ticket per month, said airport spokesman
Sean McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, an individual comes in and has been duped into buying
the ticket,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   At LAX, stolen tickets are immediately confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't let you get on the plane unless you pay for a new
full fare,'' said Sgt. Charles Oats of the Los Angeles Airport
Police, which during busy times can take in about a dozen stolen
tickets during a two-week period.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET-BUYING ADVICE: The following are tips for travelers to
avoid buying stolen or bogus airline tickets during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Police and airline officials say that before buying a ticket,
travelers should:
</P>
<P>
   --Try to do business directly with an airline or reputable
travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   --Check the ad for the travel agency's ``seller of travel''
number. The Attorney General's Office can confirm a travel agency's
legitimacy if the information is faxed to (213) 897-8846.
</P>
<P>
   --Call the American Society of Travel Agents at (800) ASK-ASTA
to check an agent's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   --Call the airline to make sure it travels to the place
indicated on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   --Have the seller book the reservation before handing over any
money, and check with the airline for your reservation before the
sale. Often, fraud rings will not bother making reservations.
</P>
<P>
   --Be wary of agencies or independent sellers who do not accept
credit cards. Never buy tickets off the street.
</P>
<P>
   --When buying tickets through a friend, track down the source of
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   --Get a receipt.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR LEADS EFFORT TO INFLUENCE CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting concerns among many Republican officials
that their national party is adrift, New York Gov. George Pataki
said Thursday that he and other Republican governors intend to play
a more forceful role in setting the party's agenda in Congress next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the tail of the dog,'' Pataki said in a
telephone interview from his New York City office. ``We want to
have a true, strong dialogue where decisions in Washington are
supportive of the efforts of what we are doing in the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is said to be pondering a run for national office,
plans to bring that message to Washington on Friday when he and
several other members of the executive board of the Republican
Governors Association are to meet with Rep. Robert Livingston,
R-La., who is virtually certain to be elected House speaker in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governors clearly view themselves as one of their
party's biggest success stories, and Pataki's cheerleading on their
behalf reflects their desire to flex more political muscle as the
party prepares for the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is considered a leading contender
for the party's presidential nomination. And Pataki, who has been
traveling the country trying to establish a national image, is one
of several Republican governors who have been mentioned as possible
vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Republicans lost one governor's seat in last month's
elections, they will still hold the governorships of 31 states in
January. In several large states, Republican incumbents, including
Pataki, breezed to victory. At the same time, the Republican Party
lost five seats in the House, prompting a shake-up in its
leadership, including the resignation of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican officials have complained that voters consider
their party members in Congress to be scandal-obsessed and
unconcerned about solving the nation's problems, a perception that
they worry could harm Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki echoed such concerns Thursday, saying the results of the
November elections showed that voters were willing to elect
Republicans governors who could point to tangible legislative
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that there was a clear recognition that
Republican governors across the country have done very well,''
Pataki said. ``You didn't see that in the Washington elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he and other Republican governors would urge
Livingston to press for a package of tax cuts in the coming
legislative session. He said the governors also want Congress to
enact legislation that gives states more control over job-training
programs, federal health-care funding and education aid. And he
said he would like to see Congress create a program that helps
states pay for water-treatment plants and clean-air initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he thought the Republicans in Congress could improve
their public image by taking up the governors' agenda. ``The
partnership between successful Republican governors and the
Republican leadership in Washington would be of benefit to that
leadership,'' he said, ``when those governors have had enormous
successes in their own states.''

PUBLIC OUTRAGE SPURS DECISION TO BAR EX-CON FROM TEACHING ASU
CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State University, inundated by angry calls, reversed
course Thursday and will not allow convicted murderer James Hamm to
teach criminal justice classes this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ASU said it would honor its contract with Hamm, and pay him the
$6,000 that he was to make as an adjunct professor. Hamm, however,
will be assigned to duties other than direct classroom instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reassigning Mr. Hamm to non-teaching duties is in the best
interest of the university,'' said Milton Glick, ASU provost and
senior vice president. ``The debate surrounding Mr. Hamm's
employment in the classroom at ASU would be too disruptive to the
educational environment, as evidenced by the reaction to his
hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU received scores of calls Thursday. Glick said he received
calls, as did President Lattie Coor's office, the ASU School of
Law, the School of Justice Studies, and other departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a lot of people were offended by the decision, and
the media coverage has been explosive,'' Glick said. ``I don't
think this is an issue of safety. It is more a matter of the
statement this hiring made to the public, that it offended their
values.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an adjunct professor in criminal justice studies
resigned in reaction to Hamm's hiring. Angry calls also flooded
into ``The Arizona Republic.'' Some people threatened to cut off
support for the university. Three callers to ``The Republic'' said
they intended to mail back their ASU diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as ASU opens, I plan on contacting the registrars
office and ask what methods it takes to expunge myself as a
graduate. I can't be associated with a facility that hires
executioners, drug dealers and murderers on their faculty,'' said a
caller, who identified himself as Chad Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said Thursday afternoon, ``Obviously, I am disappointed. I
would have prefered to have moved into teaching these two courses,
then expand that to more courses. (Teaching) is still my personal
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Glick would not answer directly when asked whether ASU would
hire Hamm in the future, but said he doubts it. ``I'm not dealing
with the future right now,'' he said. ``Obviously, there will be a
debate on this campus over the next year about this issue. I would
not predict he would be hired here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said he understands the university's concerns, and said he
is negotiating with the school over what his role will be.
</P>
<P>
   He declined the university's first offer _ helping with research
projects _ and said he is exploring other options, including
curriculum development and serving as a guest lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do something oriented toward my strengths, which are
corrections and rehabilitation. I think that is the core of what I
would bring to ASU, the unique perspective I could provide,'' Hamm
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glick said Hamm's contract is valid, and must be honored.
However, he said, Hamm would be paid with non-public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was paroled in 1992 after serving 17 years in prison. He
was convicted of killing Willard Morley in a drug deal gone sour
north of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Hamm has shaken up ASU. The first hubbub
came over the Law School's decision in 1993 to admit him.
</P>
<P>
   And just as with the Law School admission, ASU has decided to
overhaul its policies as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Glick announced Thursday that in the future, the dean of the
college where an adjunct professor will work will also have to
approve of the hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was hired last month by Dennis Palumbo, interim director of
the School of Justice Studies. Palumbo said he was on the verge of
canceling two classes because the ``four or five lawyers'' who
usually teach them were not interested this year. Then Hamm
applied, and he was hired to teach a class dealing with the Bill of
Rights called Individual Rights and Public Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the (hiring) decision,'' Glick said. ``He (Palumbo)
was working within the authority of his office, and he was making a
judgment call. Clearly, it is a judgment call I disagree with, but
that doesn't mean I question his integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Hamm was admitted to ASU Law School, Coor
announced that in the future, the school's dean would be required
to approve the admission of any convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm graduated from the ASU Law School in December 1997. He has
failed in his only bid to pass the state Bar Exam, but he said he
plans to take it again in February.
</P>
<P>
   Glick said there were a lot of conflicting emotions that went
into the decision to overhaul Hamm's hiring as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision we do not take lightly,'' Glick said. ``On
one hand, we have a person who has been deemed rehabilitated by the
state, and who has attended and graduated from our law school. On
the other hand, many people are concerned about the message sent by
Mr. Hamm as a part-time faculty associate and the impact that the
attention accompanying the debate can have on the university
climate and the surrounding community.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Foster, who attended law school with Hamm and now teaches
part-time in the justice studies program, e-mailed a letter to
Glick Thursday morning, resigning from his teaching position and
all other associations with ASU because of Hamm's hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many . . . qualified individuals that have
qualified to sit for and passed the Bar that could have been chosen
to teach these students,'' Foster wrote. ``The university has an
obligation to the community and its students to seek qualified
individuals; it has failed in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone later Thursday, Foster said he was
withdrawing his letter based on the change in ASU's hiring
decision, and hopes to teach next semester. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The rapid expansion of international law since the Second World
War was largely instigated by an American husband-and-wife team.
</P>
<P>
   The world's central legal institution, the United Nations, was
the brainchild of Franklin Roosevelt, who began planning for it
soon after the United States entered the war.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Eleanor, was one of the prime movers behind the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose 50th
anniversary will be celebrated on Dec. 10. The declaration became
the human-rights movement's founding document, the source from
which a stream of treaties have flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roosevelts were hardheaded political pragmatists. Both
would have been disappointed, but hardly surprised, that the Cold
War subsequently hobbled the U.N. and hampered the application of
international law for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin had tried to head off a return to such great-power
rivalry by constructing an international order founded on
great-power cooperation. And he knew that, to succeed, such
cooperation had to rest on some shared notions of justice and
legality, not just military might.
</P>
<P>
   So he accompanied his proposal for the ``four policemen'' of the
U.N. Security Council (later to become five) with an appeal to
``four freedoms'' _ freedom of expression and religion, freedom
from want and fear _ which eventually led to the Universal
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Roosevelts' enthusiasm for international law has been
replaced by a deep American ambivalence. Successive American
presidents have continued to proclaim human rights, democracy and
the rule of law as the guiding values of their foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   They have often invoked international law in their own defense,
and in criticizing others. Yet the United States has a sorry record
of shilly-shallying, or plain obstruction, in the development of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leading, America has ratified many human-rights
treaties only after most other countries have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   It took 40 years to ratify the Genocide Convention, 28 for the
Convention Against Racial Discrimination, 26 for even the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the most
important treaty of all.
</P>
<P>
   Over 160 countries have ratified the convention banning
discrimination against women _ but not the United States. Only two
in the world have not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the
Child; the other one is Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And even when America has ratified treaties, it has often
attached extensive reservations, making them inapplicable at home.
It has also paid scant respect to the monitoring mechanisms set up
by the treaties, and to the International Court of Justice in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the United States played the key role in setting
up tribunals to put on trial individuals accused of war crimes and
genocide in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, alone among its allies, it now opposes the permanent
international criminal court endorsed by 120 nations at a U.N.
conference last July _ primarily because it could not win an
absolute exemption for its own soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And that attitude is nothing new: successive American
governments have seen the corpus of international law as a useful
device to restrain or vilify other nations, while refusing to let
it apply to their own.
</P>
<P>
   How can the United States get away with this? The answer, as in
many other things, is simple: it is the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Its allies, recognizing that position, and aware that law alone
cannot preserve the peace (or their interests), usually grant it
the latitude necessary to act in a crisis _ and know well that it
would not take much notice if they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the United States _ let alone the world _ pays a high
price for its refusal to apply international law on human rights at
home, and its undue readiness to brush aside these or other aspects
of international law abroad whenever this seems convenient.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders thereby gain room for maneuver. But their
double standards also damage their credibility when they criticize
the illegalities or human-rights abuses of others, and reduce
American influence over the law's development.
</P>
<P>
   That was plain this week, when American officials hinted heavily
that General Augusto Pinochet, a former American protege, should be
returned to Chile. There are political arguments for that; but only
feeble ones in international law.
</P>
<P>
   If America must be the world's policeman, a role it often plays
only reluctantly, and quite often against a chorus of criticism, is
it better served by being seen as international law's champion, or
as a nation which regards itself as beyond the law? Franklin
Roosevelt would have known the answer. &QL;

SUIT SAYS MINORITY STUDENTS IN NEW YORK STATE GET INFERIOR
EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal
lawsuit Thursday against New York state contending that the
education that minority students receive is so inferior that it
constitutes discrimination under civil rights law.
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Department's own records show, the suit
asserts, that officials have discriminated against children in
predominantly minority schools by allowing them to be taught by
larger numbers of uncertified teachers, tolerating lower academic
standards, relegating them to dilapidated and unsafe schools,
supplying them with out-of-date textbooks and failing to provide
sufficient remedial instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, covers
schools that have minority enrollment of 80 percent or more, from
schools in Long Island and suburban Westchester County to Albany,
Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, but does not include New York
City, where a similar suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the lawsuit represents a departure from most
anti-discrimination lawsuits brought against school districts in
that it does not focus on equity of financing among school
districts but rather on student performance. In so doing, it
follows the reasoning of federal courts in a Yonkers desegregation
case, which said that patterns of poorer achievement by minority
students can be used as the basis to prove discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not bringing this litigation simply to force the state
to spend more money,'' said Norman Siegel, the executive director
of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ``We are challenging a range
of state educational practices that, while racially neutral on
their face, are having a discriminatory impact upon high minority
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit parallels an action involving New York City brought
last year by another group, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which,
following the more traditional model, contends that the state's
failure to provide adequate financing for city students constitutes
discrimination against them.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the two actions are the broadest legal challenge
to date against a state educational system that concedes it has not
applied the same academic standards to all students and, as a
result, has recently been moving to correct that disparity with
more rigorous academic requirements for all students.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers in the case filed Thursday argue that the state's
efforts to dictate new academic standards from the top have not
sufficiently ensured equal treatment for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New York State Education Department, Alan
Ray, declined to comment on the lawsuit, because the matter was
pending before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a remedy, the suit seeks to force the state to ensure that
minority students receive, among other things, equal access to
fully licensed teachers, adequate remedial instruction and courses
geared at helping them earn honors diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   The suit does not spell out how the state should accomplish this
goal. But a lawyer for the civil liberties union, Christopher Dunn,
said that state education officials could choose any number of
options, from taking over poorly performing schools to carrying out
court-ordered desegregation plans.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit represents about 80,000 minority students, many of
them attending school districts in some of the state's largest
cities. The average school district in the state has about 2,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in the suit are based on academic performance
records obtained from the state education department that date back
to 1989. Lawyers for the civil liberties union said it took them
more than two years to compile the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contentions of the suit are that students in
predominantly minority schools are twice as likely to be taught by
unlicensed teachers, six times as likely to be denied remedial
instruction, twice as likely to drop out and a third less likely to
earn the states highly competitive Regents high school diploma.

cooperation had to rest on some shared notions of justice and
legality, not just military might.
</P>
<P>
   So he accompanied his proposal for the ``four policemen'' of the
U.N. Security Council (later to become five) with an appeal to
``four freedoms'' _ freedom of expression and religion, freedom
from want and fear _ which eventually led to the Universal
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Roosevelts' enthusiasm for international law has been
replaced by a deep American ambivalence. Successive American
presidents have continued to proclaim human rights, democracy and
the rule of law as the guiding values of their foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   They have often invoked international law in their own defense,
and in criticizing others. Yet the United States has a sorry record
of shilly-shallying, or plain obstruction, in the development of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leading, America has ratified many human-rights
treaties only after most other countries have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   It took 40 years to ratify the Genocide Convention, 28 for the
Convention Against Racial Discrimination, 26 for even the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the most
important treaty of all.
</P>
<P>
   Over 160 countries have ratified the convention banning
discrimination against women _ but not the United States. Only two
in the world have not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the
Child; the other one is Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And even when America has ratified treaties, it has often
attached extensive reservations, making them inapplicable at home.
It has also paid scant respect to the monitoring mechanisms set up
by the treaties, and to the International Court of Justice in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the United States played the key role in setting
up tribunals to put on trial individuals accused of war crimes and
genocide in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, alone among its allies, it now opposes the permanent
international criminal court endorsed by 120 nations at a U.N.
conference last July _ primarily because it could not win an
absolute exemption for its own soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And that attitude is nothing new: successive American
governments have seen the corpus of international law as a useful
device to restrain or vilify other nations, while refusing to let
it apply to their own.
</P>
<P>
   How can the United States get away with this? The answer, as in
many other things, is simple: it is the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Its allies, recognizing that position, and aware that law alone
cannot preserve the peace (or their interests), usually grant it
the latitude necessary to act in a crisis _ and know well that it
would not take much notice if they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the United States _ let alone the world _ pays a high
price for its refusal to apply international law on human rights at
home, and its undue readiness to brush aside these or other aspects
of international law abroad whenever this seems convenient.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders thereby gain room for maneuver. But their
double standards also damage their credibility when they criticize
the illegalities or human-rights abuses of others, and reduce
American influence over the law's development.
</P>
<P>
   That was plain this week, when American officials hinted heavily
that General Augusto Pinochet, a former American protege, should be
returned to Chile. There are political arguments for that; but only
feeble ones in international law.
</P>
<P>
   If America must be the world's policeman, a role it often plays
only reluctantly, and quite often against a chorus of criticism, is
it better served by being seen as international law's champion, or
as a nation which regards itself as beyond the law? Franklin
Roosevelt would have known the answer. &QL;

   The rapid expansion of international law since the Second World
War was largely instigated by an American husband-and-wife team.
</P>
<P>
   The world's central legal institution, the United Nations, was
the brainchild of Franklin Roosevelt, who began planning for it
soon after the United States entered the war.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Eleanor, was one of the prime movers behind the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose 50th
anniversary will be celebrated on Dec. 10. The declaration became
the human-rights movement's founding document, the source from
which a stream of treaties have flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roosevelts were hardheaded political pragmatists. Both
would have been disappointed, but hardly surprised, that the Cold
War subsequently hobbled the U.N. and hampered the application of
international law for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin had tried to head off a return to such great-power
rivalry by constructing an international order founded on
great-power cooperation. And he knew that, to succeed, such
cooperation had to rest on some shared notions of justice and
legality, not just military might.
</P>
<P>
   So he accompanied his proposal for the ``four policemen'' of the
U.N. Security Council (later to become five) with an appeal to

from want and fear _ which eventually led to the Universal
