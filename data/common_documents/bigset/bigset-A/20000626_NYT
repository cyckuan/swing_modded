   CHINA-SNAKEHEADS (Fuzhou, China) _ Just days after British
authorities discovered the bodies of 58 illegal Chinese immigrants
who were being smuggled into England in the back of a tomato truck,
the grisly news was all the talk in the towns around Fuzhou, in
Fujian Province, home to some if not all of the dead. But most
people here regarded it with the same mix of sadness and
disengagement that frequent fliers have when they hear of a plane
crash. They may hesitate a moment, but they will go again. And that
despite a cost of up to $70,000 that must be paid to the smugglers
_ or ``snake heads'' _ who make the travel arrangements, and
despite the tortuous emigration sagas, which, at best, involve
flying through a series of countries with forged travel documents,
and, at worst, mean running across borders on foot or traversing
them packed in airless trucks, disguised as tomatoes. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.

   SIERRA-LEONE-FIRE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ In the end, it was
a simple candle, knocked over by one of the squatters, that put an
end to the famous City Hotel, lighting up the nighttime sky in
Freetown the way its guests had long ago. The City Hotel, which
Graham Greene turned into one of Africa's enduring literary
landmarks in ``The Heart of the Matter,'' had survived the end of
the British empire, the postcolonial slide into squalor and decay
and in the last decade, rebel invasions that destroyed many other
buildings on the street. By Norimitsu Onishi

Valley, the lowest spot in the United States. How a rich state that
helped lead the post-Sputnik push for public education in the 1960s
fell so far is a long and complex story. But it is one that a new
generation of state officials and union leaders find themselves
grappling with as they strive to return state spending to what
would seem a modest goal: the national average. By Todd S. Purdum.

RUIZ COMPLETES SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. _ To qualify for the Sydney Olympics, diver
Mark Ruiz leaped from tree branches, sneaked into hotel pools,
moved with his mother to the United States from Puerto Rico,
learned English, studied ballet and overcame a fear of heights.
</P>
<P>
   David Pichler traveled an even more arduous route. He spent a
year selling life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The two followed different paths but both will represent the
U.S. in men's platform diving. Having won the three-meter
springboard competition on Thursday, Ruiz won the 10-meter platform
Sunday in the final event of the U.S. Olympic Diving Trials at the
King County Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 Olympian, Pichler recovered from a disappointing
springboard performance and earned a return to the Olympics by
finishing second to Ruiz for the other platform berth.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, 21, grew up in Puerto Rico, where he developed as a diver
by leaping from tree branches on the riverbank and sneaking into
hotel pools (``The lifeguards got to know me,'' he said). At his
encouragement, Ruiz's mother, Lydia Torres, moved him to Orlando to
improve his training. She gave up her job and left behind a son in
college and a daughter with a child of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what every mother has to do,'' Torres said while wearing
a T-shirt and buttons with her son's name printed on them. ``That
kid has made me so proud, so happy. I was making pennies at the
beginning but I never doubted it wouldn't be worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's given up everything for me,'' Ruiz said. ``She gave up
her job and family, everything we had, just to give me the
opportunity. I owe it all to her.''
</P>
<P>
   With Torres working full-time and more as a hairstylist, Ruiz
often bussed and occasionally bicycled the six or so miles to the
pool for his training sessions. He studied Greg Louganis' diving
tape and took ballet as Louganis did to improve his flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little booger,'' said Jay Lerew, Ruiz's coach and the
newly named U.S. team coach. ``He'd cut in front of people in line.
You couldn't get rid of him. People were getting mad at him because
he had no manners. He didn't speak much English. He was a little
tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Pichler has a somewhat different story. He's from Pennsylvania
and is 31, which is old by diving standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be in your prime until you're about 26, 27, but at 28,
you're body starts giving out,'' Lerew said. ``Dave is very much
the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Pichler dove on the 1996 Olympic team, then sold life insurance
for a year before quitting to return full-time to diving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working was definitely interfering with my diving,'' he said.
``I said, `All right, I either need to retire from diving or put
more into diving.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, actuarial tables might have looked good to Pichler on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He led the springboard event throughout the competition before
botching his final dive and finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it was a good thing for me,'' Pichler said. ``You
can't really say not succeeding is ever a good thing but it gave me
a better outlook. It made me realize that if I didn't make the
team, it was not the catastrophe I thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it also kept him focusing on his dives, rather than his
opponents' scores. Which moved uncomfortably close to his own in
the first rounds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Ramirez received a 10 on consecutive dives to move to one
point shy of Pichler for second place after the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler maintained he ``had no idea how close it was,'' and
while Ramirez faded, he finished strong to take second place and
earn his spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   A top medal hopeful for Sydney, Ruiz nailed a near-perfect dive
in the final round on Thursday to win the springboard but led
throughout Sunday's final rounds of the platform, his best event
despite a fear of heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made it in the three-meter, it made me more relaxed for
the platform,'' Ruiz said. ``I wasn't thinking I just want to be in
the top two, I wanted to win. You start thinking I just want to
finish in the top two, that's when bad things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He pumped his fist after one dive and raised his arms in
celebration when the scoreboard displayed his final marks. This
qualifies as a significant display of emotion in diving, where the
national anthem before Sunday's final was performed by a man
playing a saw (this is not something you're likely to hear at the
Experience Music Project).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Diving) needs a little excitement. The more excitement, the
better it is for the sport,'' Ruiz said. ``But that's just me. I
can't help it. I just like to show emotion when I do a great dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even show it when I don't have a good dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres promised Ruiz that if he won the three-meter, she would
reward him with a special vacation _ a couple days at the Dorado
Hyatt in Puerto Rico, so he could finally use the pool as an actual
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, however, said there will be no diving involved in his
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing golf,'' he said.

TWICE AS NICE: DE FERRAN WINS G.I. JOE'S 200 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Gil de Ferran's race strategy was tried and
true. Drive off to a big lead, make a quick pit stop and return to
the track with enough cushion for victory.
</P>
<P>
   What the plan lacked in innovation, it made up for in efficiency
as de Ferran became the first repeat winner of the season in
Sunday's Freightliner/G.I. Joe's 200 and only the third driver to
win back-to-back CART races on Portland International Raceway's
1.9-mile road course.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as significant, de Ferran's victory was the third in the
past four races for Marlboro Team Penske, which had gone nearly
three years without a victory until this season. Team Penske is the
all-time winningest organization in Indy car racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, the faster I pushed the better the car
seemed to get,'' said de Ferran, who led by 21 seconds before
making his final pit stop on lap 89 of the 112-lap race. ``Roger
(Penske) just said `Go,' and I must say the car was fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ferran's Honda-powered Reynard rejoined the race in fourth
place and assumed the lead for good with seven laps remaining as
the three front-runners _ including Penske teammate Helio
Castroneves _ peeled off for their final fuel stops.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Moreno finished 2.525 seconds behind de Ferran in the
Patrick Racing Ford and claimed the CART points lead for the first
time in his seven-year career. Newman-Haas driver Christian
Fittipaldi rallied from an early mistake to finish a season-best
third, giving Brazilian drivers their first podium sweep in CART
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good for our country,'' said Moreno, who matched the
best finish of his career and was visibly pleased with his own turn
of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-year absence from CART, Moreno returned on a limited
basis in 1996. He earned the nickname ``Super Sub'' last year by
successfully filling in for injured drivers on the PacWest and
Newman-Haas teams.
</P>
<P>
   This is Moreno's first full-time CART job since 1986, and he's
determined to make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been so many years of hard work and I'm so grateful
just to have the opportunity to drive again,'' said Moreno, who
leads de Ferran by a single point in the championship standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended to be a super sub,'' he said. ``I always came
to these races during the past few years hoping someone would hire
me on a full-time basis. I just refused to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   That mindset proved true Sunday, although Moreno's bid to catch
de Ferran was thwarted by the lapped car of Patrick Carpentier, who
ran between the two leaders and refused to let Moreno get past him.
</P>
<P>
   Carpentier said he was confused about de Ferran's and Moreno's
positions and didn't realize they were racing for the lead.
Nonetheless, the young Canadian was fined $10,000 for failing to
yield the way.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-car accident on the first turn of the first lap brought
out the only caution flag and took many of the series' top drivers
out of the race, or at least out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tracy and Jimmy Vasser, who were first and second,
respectively, in the points standings, were involved in the mess.
Vasser didn't continue and finished 24th in the 25-car field,
dropping to fifth in the standings, 14 points behind Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy rejoined the race only to hit a retaining wall with 41
laps left. He finished 18th and fell to third in the standings,
nine points behind Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   With so many good cars _ including Tracy's Team KOOL Green
teammate Dario Franchitti and Team Rahal driver Max Papis _ out of
contention, polesitter Castroneves, Moreno and de Ferran set the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Castroneves, who won last week in Detroit, led the most laps
(85) and held a four-tenths of a second advantage on the field
before having to stop for a splash of fuel with seven laps
remaining. He returned to the race fourth, but his Honda ran out of
gas on the final turn and he finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fuel consumption came up just a half gallon short,'' said
Castroneves, who jumped from 11th to ninth in points. ``But it's
great that the team can carry this momentum heading to Cleveland
(this week).''

   &QL; 
SAN PEDRO CHAYUCO, Mexico _ Her husband had gone off to work in the
United States, but in a year, he had sent home less than $1,000 for
her and her infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Gonzalez's breasts ached trying to nourish an
18-month-old baby. She felt weak all the time.
</P>
<P>
   There was no money for baby formula. Or clothes. Or toys.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard that her husband, Hermilo Hernandez Velasco, was
sending money to other family members in Mexico. She heard he was
spending money on lovers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, she would ride in the back of a pickup or walk 8
miles from her destitute village in southern Mexico to the nearest
phone in the regional city of Santiago Juxtlahuaca. She would talk
to her husband in Portland, Ore., and plead for money.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of Yolanda's brothers, who also was living
illegally in the Portland area, told her he had saved enough money,
about $2,500, to get her and her baby, Elizama, out. They would
ride a bus for four days to the border, where a coyote, a smuggler
of illegal immigrants, would bring them across the Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``!Que milagro!,'' what a miracle, Yolanda's mother remembers
thinking. Only a handful of the village's women had ever gotten the
chance to live in the United States. And Yolanda would be reunited
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda and her family thought she would be traveling through
the cool hills of Tijuana and San Ysidro, Calif., where many others
from San Pedro Chayuco had crossed. About half the men from
Yolanda's village of 200 have made that trip, and then traveled on
to Portland to pick crops, work in restaurants or do other labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the coyotes who usually led the immigrants from her village
balked at taking Yolanda's baby along. They turned to a rogue
smuggler, who promised them streets of gold and gave them the
overheated cauldron of the Tohono O'odham Reservation. Then he
abandoned them on a cow trail on a burning, 110-degree day in late
May.
</P>
<P>
   The only miracle was that baby Elizama lived, an ounce of water
left in her bottle, her dead mother's arms wrapped around her. &QL; 
BEAUTY AND POVERTY
</P>
<P>
   San Pedro Chayuco is situated in a narrow valley with
alternating patches of forests and farm fields along slopes that
climb 2,000 feet. In the early morning, roosters crow and strands
of cotton-puff clouds cling to the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   But the natural beauty masks a grinding poverty that seems to
get worse with every passing year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the way of all mothers, Paula Galindo Flores believed
life would be better for her daughter than it was for her.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no getting married at age 15, no household of
kids to raise by age 20.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter would get more than six grades of education - maybe
enough even to become a teacher. She would have indoor plumbing,
not an outhouse draining into the pig sty.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo had married shortly after her quinceanera, or coming
out. She had met a good, hard-working man who owned land high above
the village. Although only 200 yards apart, the people on the hill
spoke Spanish rather than the Mixtec dialect of the lowlanders.
</P>
<P>
   The young couple started married life in a shack made of
discarded shipping crates and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   Luck soon visited them. Some wealthy vegetable growers from Baja
California, came around in the mid-1980s trumpeting how much money
people could make picking tomatoes and strawberries in northwest
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo, her husband and tiny Yolanda, lured by wages double the
$3 a day they were making in Oaxaca, decided to go. &QL; 
SAVED TO RETURN HOME
</P>
<P>
   For three years, they picked crops and saved their money. Then
they returned to San Pedro Chayuco and built a two-room house made
of brick.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake, coming back, Galindo now says. Work was hard to
get, and she began to see the patterns of her life repeating in
Yolanda's.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda was a headstrong girl with a pleasing personality and
strong love of family. She fell into a depression over her
grandmother's death and missed most of her second-grade year. But
she repeated the grade and began pulling in A's, especially in
mathematics. She had dreams of being a secretary, maybe even a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But free education in this part of rural Mexico stops at the end
of sixth grade. And that meant that 13-year-old Yolanda would stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   She kept busy feeding the chickens, pigs and horses. She washed
dishes in the outdoor sink and endlessly swept the floor of the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Then she met Hernandez, a handsome boy of 18 from a family in
the valley below with a gift of gab and dreams of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo saw it differently: He was, she said, `the biggest liar
of a family of liars.`
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda and Hernandez had been dating for two months when
Hernandez, accompanied by his father, came up the hill one night in
1996 to ask for Yolanda's hand in marriage. Galindo was devastated,
but Yolanda was insistent.
</P>
<P>
   `She was already 15 years old, what could I say?` Galindo said. &QL; 
MARRIED LIFE ROUGH
</P>
<P>
   The two got married in a Pentecostal church in a nearby village.
No photos were taken because neither family had a camera or the
money to hire a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Life instantly got much tougher for Yolanda, according to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was the third of five boys to marry, and all three
married couples lived under the same roof with his father and
mother. Yolanda got pregnant almost immediately but suffered a
miscarriage. Hernandez worked as a day laborer, picking crops.
</P>
<P>
   `She didn't get a new piece of clothing for three years,` said
Augustina Velasco, Yolanda's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   `She was like a slave to all those people in that house.
Hernandez also was seeing another woman and hit Yolanda real hard
in the back one night when she confronted him about it, leaving a
big mark. The only happiness she had was listening to the cassettes
of her evangelical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Yolanda became pregnant again, this time with Elizama. But
before the baby was 6 months old, Hernandez was gone. His relatives
living in Oregon had put enough money together for him to make the
trip. &QL; 
PROMISES TO SEND MONEY
</P>
<P>
   He left in May of last year, promising to send his wife $200 a
month, promising her that he would send for her and the baby. It
was the last time he would see his wife alive.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda moved back to her mother's house and waited.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who returned to Oaxaca after learning of his wife's
death, said he sent his wife the money he promised. He said he had
no idea she was coming north to find him. He never sent for her, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Augustina Velasco scoffed at that story last week as she made
tortillas over wood embers in a shed outside Galindo's house, rays
of sunlight filtering through the unevenly spaced boards.
</P>
<P>
   `He (Hernandez) came in this room on the night of Yolanda's
funeral and said, `I killed my wife,`' Velasco said, `Then, he
started weeping.` &QL; 
POOR VILLAGES
</P>
<P>
   The numerous Mixtec villages that dot western Oaxaca are some of
the poorest in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Poor cultivation practices over the years led to massive amounts
of soil erosion on the steep mountain slopes. Production of staples
like corn and beans lags far behind the rest of the country,
according to Oaxacan state agricultural statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And although the ideals of the Mexican Revolution of the early
1900s - breaking up large privately owned haciendas and
redistributing land to peasants - were popular, there was very
little follow-through in the Santiago Juxtlahuaca area of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   `There were eight prominent landowners in this area and they
angrily resisted any change,` said Candido Beristain Romero,
director of art and culture for the municipality of Santiago
Juxtlahuaca. `The only reform which came about was the creation of
one small ejido (an area of land redistributed to peasants) in all
of this area.`
</P>
<P>
   The poor families divided the little land they got into
ever-smaller parcels for their children and their children's
children, and they grew ever-more poor. &QL; 
SMALL PLOTS OF LAND
</P>
<P>
   Paula Galindo Flores and her family live on slightly less than 5
acres of land. Hermilo Hernandez Velasco and his family have just
more than 2 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The best months are April and May, when Galindo's corn ripens.
Last week, she cut eight dozen flowers from her land and sold them
at Santiago's central market for $5.
</P>
<P>
   For the other nine months of the year, Galindo is at the mercy
of her husband, who tired of the hand-to-mouth existence and
illegally emigrated about four years ago to Oregon to work in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   `My husband sends $300 to $400 a month,` Galindo said. ``Without
that, I don't know what we would do to survive.`
</P>
<P>
   The large number of men living in el norte has created social
problems at home, said Susana Carrasco, who owns a Juxtlahuaca shoe
store.
</P>
<P>
   `They come back for Christmas. The wife gets pregnant again.
They come back for the baptism of the child. The wife gets pregnant
again,` Carrasco said. `There's just more and more children without
their fathers around.` &QL; 
BATTLE TO SURVIVE
</P>
<P>
   Still, the men leave. Survival is just too difficult in a
country where the price of corn and beans is five times higher than
a decade ago, where eggs and milk cost 50 percent more than in a
Valley supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo and her son, Aureliano, 24, are reduced to catching
rainwater in a tarp to drink. They pay to ride in the back of a
pickup to get to Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   A van with Oregon license plates is parked in front of Galindo's
house: Aureliano's uncle brought it back from the United States a
year ago. But it needs at least $750 in repairs for new brakes, a
battery and electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of progress in Oaxaca: A water pipe was
laid to bring water down from the mountains. The houses now have
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough to keep Galindo's husband at home. It wasn't
enough for her daughter or her son-in-law. Galindo worries that it
won't be enough for little Elizama, who now lives with her
grandmother in the two-room house.
</P>
<P>
   It is a valid worry, said Beristain, the local cultural official
in Juxtlahuaca. He sat and listened to another bus rev its engine
on the street behind his home.
</P>
<P>
   `There are five buses a week that go directly from here to the
U.S. border,` Beristain said. `I've never seen one that wasn't
full.` &QL;

BLUE JAYS COMPLETE SWEEP OF RED SOX IN 13 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ There's a jagged rip in the ultimate safety net. With
Pedro Martinez hurting, the Red Sox are in free fall, a predicament
never more apparent than on their longest afternoon of the season,
when the arrival of newcomer Izzy Alcantara was not enough to save
them.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to claw for survival after an out-of-sorts Martinez
failed to hold a 5-2 lead under a barrage of Blue Jay home runs,
the Red Sox lasted 13 innings before succumbing to Toronto, 6-5,
Sunday on Tony Batista's two-out single. Batista's hit, which
followed a three-base error by Sox center fielder Carl Everett,
gave the Blue Jays a three-game sweep in SkyDome and a 2 1/2-game
advantage in the AL East over the third-place Sox, losers of eight
of their last 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who were 3 for 17 with runners in scoring position and
left two runners on in four of the last five innings, finally
cracked when Everett committed the team's fourth error of the day.
Everett missed Chris Woodward's two-out drive to deep left-center
field as he and left fielder Curtis Pride converged on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Human error may have been compounded by unusual circumstances.
Everett, who has played alongside the deaf Pride in only three
starts, appeared uncertain that Pride knew he was calling for the
ball, even though he was waving Pride off with one arm, and took a
shortened stride just before the ball cleared his glove untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't catch a ball I should have caught,'' Everett said,
dismissing any suggestion that Pride's condition came into play.
``There's no reason to go any deeper into the story than what I've
already said.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams wasn't as certain, and Pride said
afterward he thought Everett may have been spooked by his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't played together,'' Williams said. ``We understand
the human element of what's going on. I don't know if (Everett)
took his eye off the ball for a fraction of a second. I do know he
went hard after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista, who earlier had hit one of Toronto's three home runs
off Martinez, lined Bryce Florie's next pitch cleanly into right
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough game for both clubs,'' said Florie, the sixth
Sox pitcher during a 4-hour-25-minute exercise in which Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi used seven pitchers, and a rookie, Matt DeWitt,
emerged with his first major league win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best center fielder in the league (Everett)
missing a ball and the biggest pull hitter in the league (Batista)
shooting a ball to right field, all in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of those crazy things. It won't happen to him again
this year, I guarantee you. But that's baseball. They're going good
and we're going bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored five runs early against Blue Jays starter Chris
Carpenter. Nomar Garciaparra hit a two-run double off the New
Hampshire native in the first, Scott Hatteberg hit a two-run double
in the third, and when Pride doubled and scored on Jeff Frye's
single with one out in the fourth, Carpenter was done and Martinez
had more runs to work with than he'd had in any of his previous
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The ace almost had as many runs as the Sox had scored in his
previous five starts combined (8). But the league's most potent
collection of sluggers took full advantage of a hurting Martinez.
Shannon Stewart, the first batter Martinez faced, hit a home run,
then on his next at-bat was hit by the third of three straight
pitches that backed him off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pedro is very fortunate he pitches in the American
League,'' said Jays manager Jim Fregosi, whose general manager,
Gord Ash, was steaming in his private box after Stewart was
plunked. ``He pitches up and in. That's the way he always has been.
That's his trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi turned sarcastic. ``It was just a coincidence that the
guy he hit was the same guy who led off the game with a homer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Jays did not retaliate Charlie Nagy-style. They
struck back with their bats. After a two-out throwing error by
third baseman Wilton Veras, Brad Fullmer doubled home a run in the
third. Batista hit a two-out home run in the fifth. Then in the
seventh, Carlos Delgado, perhaps the league's MVP for the first
half of the season, crushed a full-count fastball from Martinez for
a two-run homer, the first home run Martinez has allowed with a
runner on since Sept. 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the score, and the game turned into a war of
attrition, no more so than in the 10th, when Derek Lowe staged a
dramatic duel with Homer Bush with Blue Jays on second and third
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   With Everett summoned by manager Williams to play the infield
between shortstop Garciaparra and third baseman Veras, Bush fouled
off seven pitches before hitting a one-hopper to Veras, who fielded
the ball on the line and threw to Hatteberg at the plate to retire
Jose Cruz Jr. Stewart then lined to the track in left to end the
inning, but it was only a temporary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, everybody was at their complete wit's end,''
Hatteberg said of the Lowe-Bush battle. ``You're so locked in and
intense, you're burned out after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jays' pen held the Sox scoreless over the last 9 2/3
innings. Two on, one out in the ninth, Garciaparra hit into a
double play. Two on, two out in the 10th, Pride whiffed. Two on,
two out in the 12th, pinch hitter Jason Varitek popped to short
left. Two on, two out in the 13th, Garciaparra (1 for 7) on the
day, flied to center against DeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate,'' Sox reliever Rod Beck said after a stretch
of a dozen games against the team's top two rivals in the AL East,
``that it's not September.''

MARTINEZ WINLESS FOR 3D STRAIGHT START 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Pedro Martinez's teammates will acknowledge what the
Red Sox ace adamantly refuses to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hurt, and everybody in here knows it,'' reliever Rod Beck
said Sunday in the aftermath of a 6-5, 13-inning loss to the
Toronto Blue Jays in which Martinez surrendered three home runs for
the second straight start and now has gone three starts in a row
without a win for the first time since last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that when we sent him out there,'' said Beck, who was
one of five relievers who held Toronto scoreless until Carl Everett
misplayed Chris Woodward's two-out fly ball for a three-base error
in the 13th and Tony Batista followed with a single to produce the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea what all his ailments are, but if he's
willing to go out there and battle, he's still better than just
about everybody else on the staff even when he isn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gutsy, that's (expletive) gutsy. That's why he's the
best there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martinez, who insisted he was fine and at one point
sarcastically said, ``This was the best I've felt all season,''
catcher Scott Hatteberg offered candor instead of camouflage. Is
Martinez hurting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Hatteberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say. He won't tell anybody what's wrong.
I knew something was bothering him. I guess it was his side, but I
don't know. He won't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't warm up like he normally does. It was like he
was pacing himself. He wasn't throwing 90 (miles per hour) in
warmups. Normally, he throws 90 in his sleep. When I looked up at
the scoreboard and saw 87, I knew he wasn't right. Then he almost
hit Batista with a curveball, and I knew he was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a valiant effort. He's in pain, but he knew that we
needed him bad, and he sucked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hung a curveball to Shannon Stewart with his second
pitch of the game and Stewart hit it high and far into the
left-field seats. That was the first home run Martinez has allowed
to a leadoff hitter since Nelson Liriano of the Pirates took him
deep in Montreal April 20, 1996. Martinez had pitched in 139
regular-season games since then.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez threw another curveball to the third Toronto
batter, Batista, that never broke and nearly clipped him, manager
Jimy Williams and trainer Jim Rowe both came to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him do something with his side,'' said Williams, mindful
that Martinez missed his scheduled start June 3 with a sore oblique
muscle on his left side and had been kept to a 100-pitch count in
his next two starts before stretching it out a little further last
Tuesday night against the Yankees, when he threw a 117 pitches in
eight innings in a 3-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he was pulling at his shirt or something,'' Williams
said. ``I thought I'd better ask, but he said it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story line Martinez never wavered from, even after giving
up a two-out home run to Batista in the fifth inning, and a tying,
two-out, two-run home run to Carlos Delgado in the seventh, the
first homer he has given up with a man on base since Sept. 24,
1998, a span of 325 innings over 43 regular-season starts.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's home run came one batter before Martinez finally was
lifted by Williams after throwing 133 pitches, the most he has
thrown in 26 regular-season starts, dating back to last July 7
against Tampa Bay, his last outing before the '99 All-Star break.
Twelve days later, after pitching brilliantly in the All-Star Game
then getting knocked out in the fourth inning by the Marlins in his
next start, Martinez went on the disabled list with a strained
muscle in the back of his throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   How can Martinez throw 133 pitches if he's hurt, especially when
he hit as high as 95 m.p.h. on the SkyDome radar readings later in
the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy wanted to take him out right after Delgado's home run,
but Pedro talked him out of it,'' Hatteberg said. ``Then (Brad)
Fullmer gets that cheap hit (a roller down the third-base line).
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took one for the team today and sucked it up. I don't
know what it was, but he seemed to get better as the game went
along. Maybe it loosened up for him a little bit, maybe it was
adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It may have been sheer will. He's an incredible
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has allowed seven earned runs in his last two starts.
That's just three fewer runs than he had allowed in his first dozen
starts combined. The six home runs he has allowed in his last two
outings are double what he gave up in his first dozen starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I was hurting,'' Martinez said about Williams's
first-inning visit. ``It was just a bad day, and I had to pitch
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez blamed his problems on a lack of command of all of his
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the start of the game,'' he said. ``It was a hard
day. I was trying to battle as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The home runs?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good hitters,'' he said, his eyes smoldering with barely
contained anger. ``It's good hitters. I'm human. What am I supposed
to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that I gave up those five runs, so you don't think
I'm a robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost relaxing for me, so you think I am normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez is not normal. The two-time Cy Young Award winner
is considered hands-down the best pitcher in the league and only
Randy Johnson challenges his status as the best pitcher in the
game. Three home runs in a game, two games in a row? Something
isn't right, and it isn't a secret.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates know.

WIMBLEDON SEEDINGS A PAIN FOR SPANIARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The pain in Spain lies mainly in a plain called
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask those upstanding Spaniards Alex Corretja, Juan Carlos
Ferrero, and Albert Costa _ the No. 11, 13, and 15 tennis laborers
in el mundo _ who believe their prospective parade has been rained
on by the insensitive, subjective (perhaps overly patriotic?) chaps
who operate the eldest of all tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja and Costa believe that despite being regarded as
conquistadores at home, and in numerous other locations, they are
being treated like peons at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet
Club. As a result, they said Sunday night that they'll walk Monday
_ that is, boycott the unfolding 114th edition of the Big W. An
issue of honor and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant teenager Ferrero already was out, withdrawn because of
a back injury. But he had looked forward to his Wimbledon debut,
and would have joined his compatriots' protest were he healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing comparable has happened here since the Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP) strike of 1973, when 79 men (among them
13 of 16 seeds, including such championship names as Arthur Ashe,
Rod Laver, John Newcombe, and Stan Smith) stayed away as a
counter-punch against the club's stiff-necked management of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As the trio's spokesman, the honorable Corretja was saying
earlier in the evening, ``Maybe we go on, play one game and quit.
It is a matter of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while it was: To play or not to play? However, there's no
Hamlet in these guys. They just feel like victims of the slings and
arrows of outrageous injustice because they aren't seeded while
colleagues ranked below them are. One of them happens to be a
homeboy, Greg Rusedski, pushed up to the 14th seed though he ranks
No. 21. Another is 1996 champ (thus a club member) Richard
Krajicek, seeded 11th, ranked No. 25. Is this taking care of your
own?
</P>
<P>
   The other two are Aussies Mark Philippoussis, No. 17 up to 10th,
and Patrick Rafter, No. 27 up to 12th. Also left out of the
seedings was No. 16, Moroccan Younes El Ayanoui.
</P>
<P>
   Seeding, traditional early-round protection given 16 players,
clearly has been earned by the Spaniards and El Ayanoui.
</P>
<P>
   The All England Clubbies obviously don't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards feel stripped of their identities: ``The rankings
. . . we have earned around the world as professionals,'' said
Corretja, French Open semifinalist two years ago and winner of the
prominent hard court stopover this year at Indian Wells (Calif.).
``We should be seeded according to those rankings as everywhere
else. Wimbledon is a great tournament. But (the All England Club)
is not respecting us, not treating us like some of the best in the
world, just because we haven't done well on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The AEC is the proprietor of a tournament that most of us call
Wimbledon, but is formally and simply entitled The Lawn Tennis
Championships, as if none other existed _ which was the case when
it appeared as though by divine fiat in 1877.
</P>
<P>
   That word ``Lawn'' is the catch. Once the primary surface, grass
began to wither in 1975 when the US Open opted for clay (three
years later, the present asphalt). Until then three of the four
majors were frolics on the green; the French forever European dirt.
Australia abandoned its lawn for asphalt in 1988, leaving Wimbledon
isolated in its elegance, a ghetto of greensward.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the planet was emptied of guys who understood how to
handle grassblades, which appeared so seldom on their dance cards.
Tricky stuff. Crazy, swift, low bounces. Different every day. A
unique test. The only one able to cope seems to be named Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon, the patriarch, always has tinkered with seedings,
catering to the cognoscenti of turf. It's also pretty much a law
unto itself, as it showed in 1973. Denying entry to the Yugoslav
ace, Nikki Pilic, because he was suspended by his country's tennis
federation for skipping a Davis Cup series, Wimbledon was trying to
bust the union, the newly founded ATP.
</P>
<P>
   Showing rare, principled solidarity, the ATP stood by its lodge
brother, declaring that if Pilic couldn't play, nobody else would
either. All but two members (Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie) hit the
bricks. Wimbledon, refusing to imagine that anybody would desert
the shrine, was emasculated for a year, and the ATP was in
business.
</P>
<P>
   It bungled that business this time by not supporting the
Spaniards. But four years ago, when the US Tennis Association
clumsily attempted to rig US Open seedings to give American guys an
edge, the ATP demanded _ and got _ proper seedings and a new draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted that,'' said Corretja. ``We sent a letter asking
that, but it was refused. We thought it was different this year.
This year the ATP insisted we play the four (majors) along with the
Masters Series, so we believe they should follow the rankings for
the seedings like the rest of the tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, underlining the fractured state of men's tennis, the
four majors go by their own rules, permitting them the prerogative
of disregarding rankings in awarding seedings.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon's new chairman, Tim Phillips, though considerably more
understanding of the players than most of his predecessors, defends
the seedings as ``in the public and the tournament's interest.''
He's running a show, and craves balance. That means making sure the
grass mavens don't bump into one another at the outset, regardless
of their rankings. Wimbledon is wary of so-called slow-court
players like the Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I haven't done well here, but I deserve the chance to
try to do better,'' Corretja said. ``My record, and Costa's,
deserves that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It's respect against show business.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said, sincerely, that he respects the Spaniards but
that he has to do what's best for his baby. Don't think he's
celebrating the 488th anniversary of the English victory over the
Spanish Armada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel bad to miss this great tournament. A professional
should be here,'' said Corretja. ``But we feel strong a change is
needed. Maybe what we do will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and ATP boss Mark Miles have agreed that an adjustment
needs to be made _ next year.
</P>
<P>
   The show goes on, sadly without the best of Spain. Corretja and
Costa go home, feeling like Don Quixote tilting against a gigantic
windmill on Church Road.

JACOBS NOT SURE WHAT TO RUN IN OLYMPIC TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Regina Jacobs is ready for a distance double in
the U.S. Olympic Trials next month. Which events, however, are open
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a two-time 1,500-meter silver medalist in the world
championships and American record-holder in the 5,000, was prepared
for a 1,500 and 5,000 double in the Trials in Sacramento. An 800
and 1,500 double became a possibility after Jacobs' victory in the
3,000 meters Sunday in the Adidas Oregon Track Classic on Sunday at
Lewis and Clark College.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 36, timed a meet-record 8 minutes, 42.55 seconds to turn
back 1992 Olympic 10,000-meter champion Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia,
who was second in 8:46.32.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' victory came less than 24 hours after a personal-best
performance of 1:58.08 to finish second in the 800 in the
Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I am going to encounter when I go to the
Olympics. Now, I just have to find another race for Tuesday,''
Jacobs said with a laugh. ``Right now, this if fine-tuning for the
Trials. This is really very positive. I am going to have to wake up
and run at 10 a.m. the first day and come back the next evening. It
really simulates the kind of fatigue that you have to run with the
second day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a 1981 graduate of Argyll Academy in Los Angeles (now
Campbell Hall) who lives in Oakland, had all she could handle in
Sunday's race with five runners in contention with two laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs broke free for a decisive victory from a pack that
included Tulu and Amy Rudolph, 1999 national 10,000 champion Libbie
Hickman and three-time defending U.S. cross country champion Deena
Drossin.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph was third in 8:47.13 with Hickman fourth in 8:49.75.
Drossin, a 1991 Agoura graduate, who towed the field through the
first four laps in 4:46.3, was fifth in 8:51.76.
</P>
<P>
   Despite temperatures in the high 80s, Jacobs was just off her
lifetime best and American indoor record of 8:39.14, run in placing
third in the 1999 world indoor championships. Tom Craig, Jacobs'
coach and husband, believes his wife is capable of running under
8:30 under ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs appeared to have plenty in reserve as she crossed the
line with her arms raised, followed by a victory jog down the
homestretch to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of worried,'' Jacobs said. ``I was running behind
Deena for a while. I thought, `Oh my God. Oh my God, the crowd is
going to start clapping and they are just going to pick it up.'
There were four or five women who could have won that race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs figures to contend for a top-three finish whether she
opts for the 800 or 5,000 as her second event in the U.S. Olympic
Trials in addition to the 1,500, an event in which she is an
eight-time outdoor national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs plans to make the final decision after running the mile
in the GMC Envoy Open at Stanford next Saturday in her last
competition before the U.S. Olympic Trials on July 14-23 in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) was more than I could have imagined,'' Jacobs said,
``since I don't get a lot of chances to run a lot of 800s. This is
really enticing if I can get in a race and have somebody pull me.
Then again, the 5,000 is going to be a fast race. If I am not in it
and someone goes under my 5,000 record, I am going to sit there and
wonder, `God, I wish I was in that race.' '' &QL;

<P>
   Gary Stuart grew up hearing stories about an event that took
place in his grandmother's Gallup, N.M., back yard four years
before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Riots. Gunshots. Peace officers wounded and killed.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Phoenix attorney was casting about for a subject on
which to base his first novel, his father suggested that explosive
incident might provide fodder for a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Stuart had his novel: (beginitalic)The Gallup
14(enditalic), gleaned from the trial of 14 Mexican immigrants and
striking mine workers held accountable when seven people were
wounded and three more left for dead after a bloody melee in April
1935. The local sheriff was killed - but by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Gallup native Stuart, a lawyer with the Phoenix firm Jennings,
Strouss &AMP; Salmon, had written several legal textbooks. Now he was
itching to try his hand at a novel.
</P>
<P>
   When his father recalled the saga of the Gallup 14, Stuart could
picture the alley where the incident had taken place. He'd played
stickball and hide-and-seek there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it very well,'' he said at his Phoenix home. ```That's
where the sheriff was killed,' Grandma would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Stuart began researching the story the way he
would have prepared for a trial. In Gallup, he pored over arrest
warrants and read 600 pages of court transcripts. He interviewed
almost 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in surrounding states had carried the story with
banner headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, the day of the shooting, the evening
(beginitalic)Phoenix Gazette(enditalic) put the news at the top of
its front page with a string of headlines: ``GUARDS ARREST 85 IN
GALLUP KILLING. RIOT IS PROBED; MAY CHARGE 20 WITH MURDER. Two Dead
as Unemployed Try to Free Trio From Custody.'' The next morning,
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic(enditalic) announced, ``Jury
Holds 25 In Riot Death.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from an engineer, Stuart examined the likely
trajectory of the bullet that killed Sheriff M.R. ``Mack''
Carmichael. Although he formed a theory about whose gun launched
the fatal bullet, he's keeping it to himself. The shooting was
accidental, he says, the family would be hurt by such suspicions,
and it's pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Even a novelist can't take such liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the story, Stuart invented two protagonists - young
attorney Billy Wade and his sweetheart, Mary Ann. Billy is all
fiction. The bright and feisty Mary Ann is based on Stuart's wife,
Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic)Through Mary Ann and Billy's narration,
(beginitalic)The Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14(enditalic) winds
its way leisurely through the events of 1935: First the eviction of
mine workers from company-owned housing, then the riot that
exploded in an alley. Ten men shot, more than 180 suspects jailed,
14 indicted, 10 brought to trial. Bigotry worked against those
arrested - most were Hispanic, many of them communists.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart modeled his writing style after the historic novels of
Irving Stone. He's also a fan of lawyers-turned-authors Scott Turow
and John Grisham, though not of the latter's depiction of lawyers,
which Stuart sees as unrelentingly negative.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 10 months of research and a year of writing while
working at his law firm full time. The University of New Mexico
Press published (beginitalic) Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14
(enditalic)this March. Now the book(beginitalic) (enditalic)is the
talk of Gallup, where Stuart and his wife still spend much of their
time. A favorable review from the bookseller's bible,
(beginitalic)Pubisher's Weekly(enditalic), has brought inquiries
from Hollywood, though no deals have yet been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart would welcome a movie contract but has heard horror
stories from other authors, including his friend, John Nichols, a
screenwriter and author of (beginitalic)The Milagro Beanfield
War(enditalic). Robert Redford turned that book into a 1988 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, burned by past deals that fell through, joked that he
will happily write the script for (beginitalic)The
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Gallup 14 (enditalic)''as soon as I get the
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart has written two more novels - ``somewhat experimental'' -
since (beginitalic)The(enditalic)(beginitalic) Gallup 14(enditalic)
and has no plans to publish them. But he is eagerly pursuing his
fourth, another historical novel about an outbreak of violence in
Gallup following the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee, S.D. The next day,
the young mayor of Gallup was beaten and taken hostage by Indian
protesters. Stuart was a classmate of Frank Emmett Garcia, who now
lives in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to tell the story of Wounded Knee,'' Stuart
said. ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in the back of Stuart's mind is the seed of yet
another novel based on actual events. In 1991, Stuart served as
independent counsel in the notorious AzScam scandal, in which more
than a score of Arizona legislators and lobbyists were fingered in
a sting over inducements to legalize gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart says he'll wait about 10 years to write that story,
giving the events some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Arizona in AzScam is fascinating,'' he said.
``And nobody knows it like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, recently appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents and
now practicing law part time, is banking on a future as a novelist
- history a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can achieve the acceptance with this fourth book as with
the first, I think I'll really have something I can expand,'' he
said. ``I'm just as thrilled as any human being can be. The psychic
and intellectual consequences of writing a novel are the thrill of
a lifetime.'' &QL;

LATINO ``RESURRECTION BLVD.' ISN'T AFRAID TO TAKE RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS renews the almost all-Black ``City of Angels'' for the fall
despite so-so ratings, acknowledging that the show's status as a
minority-heavy production made the network think twice about
canceling it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Showtime launches ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' a weekly drama
about an East Los Angeles family. The media, myself included,
dutifully report that the show is almost all Latino, both in front
of and behind the camera, giving the show more attention than we
would the latest Pauly Shore vehicle, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Seems as if you can make a pretty good argument that shows with
predominantly minority casts get treated differently than other
shows. Is this fair?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But neither is ignoring large segments of the
population just because advertisers - the real power in television
- think it's easier to sell a lily-white show than one with brown
or black faces in it. And that's gone on for years.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dennis E. Leoni, the Tucson native who created
``Resurrection Blvd.,'' knows that his show is getting more
attention than it might because of the color of his cast and crew,
and he's OK with that - up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is the old adage `There is no such thing as
bad publicity','' Leoni says. ``Obviously, I'm grateful for all of
the attention because we are the first Latino prime-time series in
front of and behind the camera, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at some point, I'm hoping that people will just focus on
the quality of the show. I feel it's important; it's about time,
all those things. On the other hand, I don't want people to start
feeling like `Resurrection Blvd.' is an affirmative action program.
It is not.''
</P>
<P>
   What it is, above all, is the story of a family, the Santiagos.
The patriarch trains his middle son to be a boxer, a sport that
touches all of the men in the family. Another son is a premed
student, one daughter works in a law firm, another is in high
school. No maids, no gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   `I got tired of looking at Latinos as secondary or ancillary
characters,` Leoni says, `because I'm primary in my home, and I
thought maybe somebody else wants to see a Latino who is primary in
a show and see what his life is like, as opposed to (being in)
servitude to somebody else.`
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' isn't perfect, but Leoni's determination
makes it a welcome change. The show sounds like a soap opera -
domestic strife, romantic troubles, that kind of thing. What lifts
it above that level is the acting. The cast, which includes Tony
Plana, Elizabeth Pena (EDITORS: tilde over``n'' in PENA), Michael
DeLorenzo, Nicholas Gonzalez and Marisol Nichols, all cq is
uniformly good.
</P>
<P>
   And the show occasionally touches on subjects - gang violence,
for instance - that might have been awkward for an Anglo writer to
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   `No one can say, 'Well, that's politically incorrect, and you've
got gang members in your show.'.` Leoni says. `Well, I do have
gang-bangers in Resurrection Blvd., and they are a fact of life.
They exist in East LA. And I show them.
</P>
<P>
   `But I also show the balance of Yolanda, who is trying to be an
attorney, going to law school and work in a law firm. And she's in
love with a Latino attorney who doesn't speak Spanish.... I think
what you have to do is show a balance, because that's really what
life is.`
</P>
<P>
   It's a better show than ``City of Angels,'' but even if it
weren't, ``Resurrection Blvd.'' wouldn't labor under at least one
of the pressures brought to bear upon that show: network Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about Showtime is we're not on the hot seat,
sort of,''Leoni says.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he had much choice about who would make the show. He
found that out when he shopped an earlier, autobiographical script
about a Latino family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed it around to some people around the networks,'' Leoni
says. ``I showed it to some people at some various studios. All of
them thought that it didn't have a chance in hell of being made
because of its all-Latino cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, then, that that's what's attracting so much attention
now. And thanks to the strength of that cast, ``Resurrection
Blvd.'' should be good enough to keep it.Reach Goodykoontz at

and has no plans to publish them. But he is eagerly pursuing his
fourth, another historical novel about an outbreak of violence in
Gallup following the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee, S.D. The next day,

14(enditalic), gleaned from the trial of 14 Mexican immigrants and
striking mine workers held accountable when seven people were
wounded and three more left for dead after a bloody melee in April
1935. The local sheriff was killed - but by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Gallup native Stuart, a lawyer with the Phoenix firm Jennings,
Strouss &AMP; Salmon, had written several legal textbooks. Now he was
itching to try his hand at a novel.
</P>
<P>
   When his father recalled the saga of the Gallup 14, Stuart could
picture the alley where the incident had taken place. He'd played
stickball and hide-and-seek there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it very well,'' he said at his Phoenix home. ```That's
where the sheriff was killed,' Grandma would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Stuart began researching the story the way he
would have prepared for a trial. In Gallup, he pored over arrest
warrants and read 600 pages of court transcripts. He interviewed
almost 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in surrounding states had carried the story with
banner headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, the day of the shooting, the evening
(beginitalic)Phoenix Gazette(enditalic) put the news at the top of
its front page with a string of headlines: ``GUARDS ARREST 85 IN
GALLUP KILLING. RIOT IS PROBED; MAY CHARGE 20 WITH MURDER. Two Dead
as Unemployed Try to Free Trio From Custody.'' The next morning,
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic(enditalic) announced, ``Jury
Holds 25 In Riot Death.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from an engineer, Stuart examined the likely
trajectory of the bullet that killed Sheriff M.R. ``Mack''
Carmichael. Although he formed a theory about whose gun launched
the fatal bullet, he's keeping it to himself. The shooting was
accidental, he says, the family would be hurt by such suspicions,
and it's pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Even a novelist can't take such liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the story, Stuart invented two protagonists - young
attorney Billy Wade and his sweetheart, Mary Ann. Billy is all
fiction. The bright and feisty Mary Ann is based on Stuart's wife,
Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic)Through Mary Ann and Billy's narration,
(beginitalic)The Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14(enditalic) winds
its way leisurely through the events of 1935: First the eviction of
mine workers from company-owned housing, then the riot that
exploded in an alley. Ten men shot, more than 180 suspects jailed,
14 indicted, 10 brought to trial. Bigotry worked against those
arrested - most were Hispanic, many of them communists.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart modeled his writing style after the historic novels of
Irving Stone. He's also a fan of lawyers-turned-authors Scott Turow
and John Grisham, though not of the latter's depiction of lawyers,
which Stuart sees as unrelentingly negative.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 10 months of research and a year of writing while
working at his law firm full time. The University of New Mexico
Press published (beginitalic) Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14
(enditalic)this March. Now the book(beginitalic) (enditalic)is the
talk of Gallup, where Stuart and his wife still spend much of their
time. A favorable review from the bookseller's bible,
(beginitalic)Pubisher's Weekly(enditalic), has brought inquiries
from Hollywood, though no deals have yet been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart would welcome a movie contract but has heard horror
stories from other authors, including his friend, John Nichols, a
screenwriter and author of (beginitalic)The Milagro Beanfield
War(enditalic). Robert Redford turned that book into a 1988 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, burned by past deals that fell through, joked that he
will happily write the script for (beginitalic)The
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Gallup 14 (enditalic)''as soon as I get the
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart has written two more novels - ``somewhat experimental'' -
since (beginitalic)The(enditalic)(beginitalic) Gallup 14(enditalic)
and has no plans to publish them. But he is eagerly pursuing his
fourth, another historical novel about an outbreak of violence in
Gallup following the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee, S.D. The next day,
the young mayor of Gallup was beaten and taken hostage by Indian
protesters. Stuart was a classmate of Frank Emmett Garcia, who now
lives in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to tell the story of Wounded Knee,'' Stuart
said. ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in the back of Stuart's mind is the seed of yet
another novel based on actual events. In 1991, Stuart served as
independent counsel in the notorious AzScam scandal, in which more
than a score of Arizona legislators and lobbyists were fingered in
a sting over inducements to legalize gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart says he'll wait about 10 years to write that story,
giving the events some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Arizona in AzScam is fascinating,'' he said.
``And nobody knows it like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, recently appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents and
now practicing law part time, is banking on a future as a novelist
- history a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can achieve the acceptance with this fourth book as with
the first, I think I'll really have something I can expand,'' he
said. ``I'm just as thrilled as any human being can be. The psychic
and intellectual consequences of writing a novel are the thrill of
a lifetime.'' &QL;

A MAJOR COUP FOR INKSTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ For as long as Juli Inkster had played golf,
she never had been involved in anything quite like what was going
on at DuPont Country Club Sunday in the final round of the LPGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was swirling, fairways were foreign land, greens were
impossible to hold, rough was swallowing golf balls, and trees were
getting in front of shots everywhere. ``I didn't think I was
playing that bad, but bogeys were so easy and birdies were so
hard,'' said Inkster, for whom the situation seemed made to order,
the toughest of competitors in the most demanding of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was, because Inkster defeated Italy's Stefania
Croce with a par on the second hole of a playoff to become just the
third back-to-back winner of this major championship.
</P>
<P>
   That Inkster, who shared the third-round lead with Wendy Ward at
7 under, won her sixth major is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   That she won despite shooting a 4-over 75 for a 281, making a
bogey on the 72d hole, and hitting just five fairways and 14 greens
is rather shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I shot 4 over, but a win's a win,'' said
Inkster, who turned 40 Saturday but is certainly not slowing down.
``It proves I can still play with these girls, that I'm still one
of the top players.''
</P>
<P>
   The final round offered drama of a different sort than last
year, when Inkster finished eagle-birdie-birdie to win here. It was
more a survival test, with players taking turns falling back at a
rapid clip on a day when the top 11 finishers were a combined
11-over par, the field average was nearly 74.00, and just 10 of 73
players posted sub-par rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of those was Croce, whose best finish since
joining the LPGA Tour in 1993 had been a third. Starting at
even-par, seven shots behind Inkster and Ward, Croce went out
birdie-birdie-birdie and said to herself: ``If I keep on going like
this, I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   She was laughing, of course, because Croce has been around long
enough to know that it is very hard to pass 13 players in one
round, ``so I just kept focused, but I didn't think I was going to
get into a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Croce made the turn in 2-under 33, birdied the par-5 11th, then
came home with seven solid pars to share the day's low round of 68.
At 3-under 281, she was simply thrilled with what she figured to be
a top 5 finish because a few weeks ago she was near tears talking
about her game when she called her father, Angelo, a club pro in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have sounded awful because he came over two days
later,'' said Croce. ``This week has been like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment that was not echoed by those at the top of
the leaderboard. Ward, for instance. The 27-year-old Texan, who was
making her first run at a major, birdied the opening hole to get to
8 under and owned a two-shot lead because Inkster had bogeyed the
par-4 third.
</P>
<P>
   That was as good as it would get for her. Ward bogeyed four
times in a six-hole stretch, starting at the sixth, and fell to 4
under, two behind Inkster. ``Conditions were the toughest we've
ever seen,'' said Ward, who fell to third behind Nancy Scranton,
whose frontside 33 had pushed her to 6 under, tied with Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   But Scranton, whose only major win came nine years ago, became
unglued at the 528-yard 11th. First she topped her layup 3-wood,
then she missed a 5-foot birdie try. ``I got flustered,'' she
conceded, though her play said it even louder.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-4 12th, Scranton pulled her drive under a pine tree
where her swing was restricted. It led to a double-bogey. The 13th
was a three-putt bogey and the 14th is where she left the hunt for
good, again driving it beneath a pine tree and making bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Inkster were not appreciably better. At the par-3 13th,
Ward made double-bogey thanks to a one-shot penalty she called on
herself when her ball moved as she stood over a putt.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but no thanks, said Inkster, who played the 390-yard,
par-4 14th like a 16-handicapper. She drove it right, then hit a
tree with her second shot. ``It was probably a stupid shot,'' she
said of her next attempt, which also hit the tree. ``I should have
just chipped out, got my bogey, and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-bogey, coupled with Ward's birdie, produced a
three-shot swing. Inkster was 4 under, Ward and Croce were a shot
back.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward (76) ran her approach through the green at 18 and
couldn't get it up-and-down, she fell to 2 under tied with Scranton
(73) and Se Ri Pak (71). Then she stood by to watch Inkster attempt
a 6-foot putt to save par and the win. Croce chose not to watch,
but to judge by the crowd's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they did not clap that hard, it meant I'm going to a
playoff,'' said Croce, who chipped a few balls, then heard groans.
Inkster, after burying her approach to the 72d hole into a bunker,
had fallen to 3-under with the bogey.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoff, the heralded Inkster and the unheralded Croce
each made par at the 18th. Then Croce's approach to the par-4 10th
went through the green into thick rough. She could not make the
near-impossible up-and-down to a pin cut tight on a green sloping
severely away from her, a situation that led to an easy two-putt
win for Inkster. But not to one of her trademark victory dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of myself for hanging in, but I didn't have any
reason to dance,'' said Inkster. ``I was too tired.''

incident might provide fodder for a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Stuart had his novel: (beginitalic)The Gallup
14(enditalic), gleaned from the trial of 14 Mexican immigrants and
striking mine workers held accountable when seven people were
wounded and three more left for dead after a bloody melee in April
1935. The local sheriff was killed - but by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Gallup native Stuart, a lawyer with the Phoenix firm Jennings,
Strouss &AMP; Salmon, had written several legal textbooks. Now he was
itching to try his hand at a novel.
</P>
<P>
   When his father recalled the saga of the Gallup 14, Stuart could
picture the alley where the incident had taken place. He'd played
stickball and hide-and-seek there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it very well,'' he said at his Phoenix home. ```That's
where the sheriff was killed,' Grandma would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Stuart began researching the story the way he
would have prepared for a trial. In Gallup, he pored over arrest
warrants and read 600 pages of court transcripts. He interviewed
almost 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in surrounding states had carried the story with
banner headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, the day of the shooting, the evening
(beginitalic)Phoenix Gazette(enditalic) put the news at the top of
its front page with a string of headlines: ``GUARDS ARREST 85 IN
GALLUP KILLING. RIOT IS PROBED; MAY CHARGE 20 WITH MURDER. Two Dead
as Unemployed Try to Free Trio From Custody.'' The next morning,
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic(enditalic) announced, ``Jury
Holds 25 In Riot Death.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from an engineer, Stuart examined the likely
trajectory of the bullet that killed Sheriff M.R. ``Mack''
Carmichael. Although he formed a theory about whose gun launched
the fatal bullet, he's keeping it to himself. The shooting was
accidental, he says, the family would be hurt by such suspicions,
and it's pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Even a novelist can't take such liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the story, Stuart invented two protagonists - young
attorney Billy Wade and his sweetheart, Mary Ann. Billy is all
fiction. The bright and feisty Mary Ann is based on Stuart's wife,
Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic)Through Mary Ann and Billy's narration,
(beginitalic)The Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14(enditalic) winds
its way leisurely through the events of 1935: First the eviction of
mine workers from company-owned housing, then the riot that
exploded in an alley. Ten men shot, more than 180 suspects jailed,
14 indicted, 10 brought to trial. Bigotry worked against those
arrested - most were Hispanic, many of them communists.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart modeled his writing style after the historic novels of
Irving Stone. He's also a fan of lawyers-turned-authors Scott Turow
and John Grisham, though not of the latter's depiction of lawyers,
which Stuart sees as unrelentingly negative.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 10 months of research and a year of writing while
working at his law firm full time. The University of New Mexico
Press published (beginitalic) Gallup (enditalic)(beginitalic)14
(enditalic)this March. Now the book(beginitalic) (enditalic)is the
talk of Gallup, where Stuart and his wife still spend much of their
time. A favorable review from the bookseller's bible,
(beginitalic)Pubisher's Weekly(enditalic), has brought inquiries
from Hollywood, though no deals have yet been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart would welcome a movie contract but has heard horror
stories from other authors, including his friend, John Nichols, a
screenwriter and author of (beginitalic)The Milagro Beanfield
War(enditalic). Robert Redford turned that book into a 1988 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, burned by past deals that fell through, joked that he
will happily write the script for (beginitalic)The
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Gallup 14 (enditalic)''as soon as I get the
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart has written two more novels - ``somewhat experimental'' -
since (beginitalic)The(enditalic)(beginitalic) Gallup 14(enditalic)
and has no plans to publish them. But he is eagerly pursuing his
fourth, another historical novel about an outbreak of violence in
Gallup following the 1973 siege at Wounded Knee, S.D. The next day,
the young mayor of Gallup was beaten and taken hostage by Indian
protesters. Stuart was a classmate of Frank Emmett Garcia, who now
lives in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to tell the story of Wounded Knee,'' Stuart
said. ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in the back of Stuart's mind is the seed of yet
another novel based on actual events. In 1991, Stuart served as
independent counsel in the notorious AzScam scandal, in which more
than a score of Arizona legislators and lobbyists were fingered in
a sting over inducements to legalize gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart says he'll wait about 10 years to write that story,
giving the events some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Arizona in AzScam is fascinating,'' he said.
``And nobody knows it like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, recently appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents and
now practicing law part time, is banking on a future as a novelist
- history a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can achieve the acceptance with this fourth book as with
the first, I think I'll really have something I can expand,'' he
said. ``I'm just as thrilled as any human being can be. The psychic
and intellectual consequences of writing a novel are the thrill of
a lifetime.'' &QL;

DELGADO SMOKED THIS FASTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
 JAYS-DELGADO-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The scene was pure bliss, Carlos Delgado rocking in a
leather easy chair, puffing on a fat cigar, his smile kilometers
wide, Delgado acting as if he were king of the baseball world.
Which he just might be at this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to enjoy a moment like this,'' said Delgado, puffing
out another cloud of smoke. ``Pedro makes good pitch and I make
good hit. You should enjoy it, you should react, you should let it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was Delgado's 28th birthday, but it was so much more. The
Blue Jays slugger had taken a curtain call from the 31,022 fans at
SkyDome. Delgado had had enough moments of flailing against Pedro
Martinez not to savor every delicious detail of that two-run homer
off Martinez in the seventh that tied the game and helped send the
Red Sox to a 6-5 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that good, me against Pedro,'' said Delgado of his history
against Martinez (3 for 24, 9 Ks, only 1 home run) when he stepped
to the plate in the seventh. ``I hit only one home run off him
before . . . only one . . . when he was with Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado had looked tentative, awkward, off-balance, and almost
overmatched on each at-bat before Martinez threw that 3-2 fastball
in the seventh. But Delgado, the American League's home run leader,
got his only good swing off Martinez on that pitch, ``a fastball
out over the plate,'' as the Blue Jay put it. A fastball that
seemed to have little movement.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, said Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi, ``Pedro had
thrown 130 pitches (into the seventh). It was a real tough game for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So the cause, a tiring Martinez, and the effect, Delgado's 27th
home run of the season, were related. Just as two errors by the
shaky Boston infield on grounders that would have ended the second
and third innings caused Martinez to face four more batters than he
should have. The errors, by Nomar Garciaparra and Wilton Veras,
caused no immediate harm, but they may have caused the later harm
of Martinez firing a flat fastball on his 128th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to enjoy it,'' said Delgado, blowing another puff
of smoke. ``Because this is a game we could have given up on
early.''
</P>
<P>
   A few lockers away, third baseman Tony Batista was detailing his
single in the 13th that finally ended this marathon and, yes, his
homer in the fifth off Martinez. ``I've hit only two off Pedro,''
said Batista. ``And this one, I think maybe he lose
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most happy Blue Jay might not have been Delgado or
Batista, but left fielder Shannon Stewart. After the Red Sox scored
two in the first, seemingly ending most games started by Martinez,
Stewart drove Martinez's second pitch of the game into the seats,
the first time in 257 games Martinez has given up a leadoff homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, we got the momentum back with that homer,''
said Delgado of Stewart's homer. ``Right off the bat they score two
runs and it's hard to play catchup against anybody, especially
against Pedro. But we cut the lead right in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he got a curve, and was ``surprised that I got a
pitch to hit so soon. Usually against Pedro, when you get a pitch
to hit, you've got to hit it. And this was a hanging curve and I
hit it pretty well. It went out of the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Stewart next stepped in against Martinez, in the third,
the pitcher threw close to him on a 1-2 count, even closer on 2-2,
then hit Stewart on a 3-2 pitch. This caused a rankled Fregosi to
say, ``Pedro Martinez is very fortunate he pitches in the American
League. It's no coincidence he threw inside three times against a
guy who just hit a homer off him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart did his best to bite his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking, `That's Pedro being Pedro,' '' said
Stewart. ``He's a great pitcher and I don't know if it was
intentional. (Red Sox catcher Scott) Hatteberg told me it wasn't
intentional but, you know, any time you get hit after hitting a
home run, when a guy throws up and in two or three times, you're
left wondering.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was asked if, after the first inside pitch, he felt
Martinez had delivered his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I was just thinking you never want a ball thrown
at you,'' said the Blue Jay. ``Only Pedro knows if it was
intentional. People were saying Pedro was having control problems,
but the guy is the best pitcher in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And over in the manager's office, Fregosi was most pleased,
``because when you're behind, 4-1 and 5-2, against Pedro Martinez,
usually that game is over. But he had to throw a lot of pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   And Delgado was rocking in his leather chair, cigar smoke
billowing, his team having swept the Red Sox and sent Boston back
across the border a beaten-down team.

HARVARD'S NOWAK A STAY-AT-HOME CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After dipping into the Swedish talent pool for their
first two selections (No. 7 and 27 overall Saturday), the Bruins
grabbed a homegrown player at the start of the second day of the
National Hockey League draft, which wrapped up in Calgary, Alberta,
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They picked Harvard center Brett Nowak, who is coming off his
freshman season, in the fourth round. Nowak, a 6-foot-2-inch,
198-pound native of New Haven, originally was rated much higher
than where the Bruins took him _ 103d overall. Central Scouting had
him ranked as high as No. 22 among North Americans, No. 14 in the
mid-term rankings, but a shoulder injury suffered after the World
Junior tournament seemed to cause his stock to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gorton, the top aide to assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell, said Nowak has good size, protects the puck well, and
his skating is improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a lot of the year injured, with a harness on his
shoulder, so he wasn't as offensively productive as a lot of people
thought he would be,'' said Gorton. ``He had a good tournament at
the World Juniors and was used more in a checking role. He's always
been thought of as an offensive guy, so some people might have gone
just on his numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 24 games with Harvard last season, he had five goals and 15
points. He is expected to return to school for his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth round (the Bruins had no fifth-round selection,
having traded it to Columbus Friday), Boston took Finnish
defenseman Jarmo Kultanen at No. 174. Kultanen, who is 6-2, 198
pounds, is 27 and was considered a late developer. He has been
playing in the Finnish Elite League the last several seasons.
O'Connell said that similar to the situation the Bruins had at last
year's draft, when they took forward Mikko Eloranta at the same
age, they believe Kultanen could be ready to step in and help shore
up the blue line this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh round, at No. 204, Boston grabbed center/left
wing Chris Berti, the only Canadian Major Junior Hockey League
player taken by the Bruins in this draft. Berti, who is 18, has
good size (6-5, 205) and is aggressive (131 penalty minutes in 62
games of junior hockey last year, with Berti estimating 100 of
those were from fighting majors) but is likely three or more years
from the NHL. Berti played for the Sarnia Sting (Ontario League)
last year and had eight goals and 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Czech native Zdenek Kutlak was the Bruins' eighth-round choice
(No. 237) and the 20-year-old defenseman is expected to attend
training camp. He's eligible to play in Providence if he doesn't
make the Boston roster. Kutlak is a big (6-3, 207) stay-at-home
defender but has been used on the power play with his Czech Elite
League team of Ceske Budejovice because of his powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston closed out the draft with a pair of ninth-round
selections. At No. 268, the Bruins chose defenseman Pavel Kolarik,
a 27-year-old native of the Czech Republic. Like Kultanen, the
Bruins believe Kolarik could make the team this fall. He played
last year with Slavia Praha of the Czech Elite League, where he had
five goals and three assists in 52 games. He's considered a strong
skater and played last year with former Bruin forward/enigma
Vladimir Ruzicka.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 279, which the Bruins acquired from Edmonton for Boston's
ninth-round selection next year, the team took left wing Andreas
Lindstrom, a 6-5, 210-pound native of Lulea, Sweden, who played in
the Swedish Junior League last year. Bruins Swedish scout, Svenake
Svensson, pushed hard for Lindstrom, which prompted the Bruins to
make the deal with the Oilers.

WITHOUT OTHER MOVES, PROSPECTS AREN'T GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As inspiring weekends go, what transpired in Calgary,
Alberta, the last three days didn't exactly rekindle the fervor for
hockey here in the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the Bruins' final line for Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday: No trades. No additions to the 2000-2001
roster. Two roster players sacrificed to expansion: Steve Heinze
and Mattias Timander.
</P>
<P>
   In Heinze's case, the Bruins had to sweeten the pot with the
addition of a draft pick to convince the Blue Jackets to take the
veteran wing in the expansion draft. That's right, it cost Boston a
draft pick to give the guy away. Imagine leaving an
old-but-functional gas grille out at the curb, with a ``Free _ Take
It'' sign taped to the front, and then having to resort to handing
some guy a sawbuck to heave it into his trunk. Ultimately, that's
what happened with Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   Bet the phone lines will be buzzing at the Causeway Street
season-ticket office this morning?
</P>
<P>
   While Mike Milbury ran amok in the process of bringing the
Islanders back from the dead with a flurry of trades and the
selection of Rick DiPietro as the No. 1 draft pick, Mssrs. Harry
Sinden and Mike O'Connell took the addition-by-subtraction route
for their Bruins. They lost two roster players. They then used
their first two selections in the entry draft Saturday to pick a
couple of Swedish prospects no one figures will be seen here for at
least a year or two. As with virtually all first-rounders, of
course, no one knows if they ever will be seen here (witness the
likes of Johnathan Aitken and Evgeny Ryabchikov).
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that the Bruins traded Ray Bourque in March,
and it sounds like veteran Don Sweeney will walk next month. He
becomes an unrestricted free agent Saturday. Given how old friend
Milbury is tossing around the coin _ he picked up John
Vanbiesbrouck from the Flyers as a DiPietro running mate Sunday for
a 2001 fourth-round draft choice _ Sweeney likely can figure on a
three-year deal worth $9 or $10 million getting FedExed to his
house at about 12:01 a.m. July 1.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still updating your roster at home, that would mean no
Bourque, no Sweeney, and no Timander when the season opens in
October. Don't forget, we are talking about a team that missed the
playoffs last season for the second time in four years. OK, half
the roster finished the season in a body cast, but it wasn't like,
even with Bourque still around, the whole thing was humming along
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Let me ask the obvious here: other than the prospects the Bruins
received in the Bourque deal _ Slammin' Sami Pahlsson and Maulin'
Martin Grenier _ where's the fix?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, based on how coach Pat Burns was talking a couple of
months ago when he was invited back for 2000-01, has to be in the
free agent market. Doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   By the way Burns was talking that day in mid-April, the front
office finally was about to abandon one half of its ``Stand Pat''
approach and buy him some players. Sinden and O'Connell said they
would stand Pat behind the bench, and then stop standing pat with
their wallet, abandon their price chopper ways, and go out and
bring in some viable big league players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as of this Saturday, shopping season officially opens. Now
we get to see the names Burns said brought a huge grin to his face
when he sat in the Causeway Street office and made friendly again
with Sinden and O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, there really isn't much in the free agent pool
that actually would make a grown man, uh, giddy. OK, as of Saturday
Eric Lindros could be a free agent, provided the Flyers don't want
to give him at least $8.5 million for another year's worth of
skating, shooting, checking, and shaking the cobwebs from his head.
</P>
<P>
   But, c'mon, L'Enfant Terrible here? For $8.5 million or more?
Tell me Habitat for Humanity is going to hand Jeremy Jacobs its
lifetime achievement award and I'll believe that first. Tell me
that ``Fenway 2 _ The Unbuildable'' is going to be constructed at
the old Fort Devens and I'll believe that second. But Lindros a
Bruin? The Bourque money ceiling ($6 million a year) has been
shattered, but that only means the shards fall on the shoulders of
those who are left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have been a budget operation for a long time, and
they're going to remain a budget operation for a whole lot longer.
There is no reason to believe that's going to change with some
big-name signings over the next couple of weeks. Companies like the
Boston Bruins Professional Hockey Club help Alan Greenspan fall
asleep at night without the need to count decimal points.
</P>
<P>
   What I see possibly happening is O'Connell, finally handed the
general manager's title in full, going out and signing Lyle Odelein
for the blue line and Gary Roberts for up front.
</P>
<P>
   A guy like Odelein, technically Blue Jackets property for the
next 5-6 days, could be a dash of A-1 Sauce for the blue line.
Roberts, on the Hurricanes' negotiating list until the weekend,
would spice up the front line. One thing Burns's club needs is some
nastiness. Odelein and Roberts offer that, as does Shayne Corson
(soon expected to be an ex-Canadien).
</P>
<P>
   What we're going to see here, in short, is what we saw over the
weekend and what we witnessed throughout the '90s: business as
usual. A couple of thirtysomethings will come in, patches for last
year's flat tire, and the product will roll along into 2000-2001,
just another team in the Original 30.
</P>
<P>
   Just another team.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS AWAITS PRZYBILLA 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-PRZYBILLA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The general manager of the Orlando Magic, sitting on
three lottery picks in Wednesday's NBA draft, has presided over
workouts, interviews, and dinners with more than three dozen
prospective rookies. Among those seen by John Gabriel was
20-year-old Joel Przybilla, a center who may be around when/if
Orlando picks first (No. 5), might be around when/if Orlando picks
second (No. 10), and definitely won't be around when the Magic make
their last pick (13th).
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla is a raw, 7-foot-1-inch player who bolted the
University of Minnesota in February because of problems with a
different coach and the same old, academic requirements. He is a
shot-blocker, an interior presence, a true stopper. He has, like
most of this unfinished class, a lot of upside, which is the
scouts' favorite word to describe a player who isn't quite ready
for the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents what this draft is all about,'' Gabriel said.
``And that is development.''
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla will be right at home on draft night, sitting in the
green room at the Target Center in Minneapolis. It's not far from
his home in Monticello, Minn., where he became the most
sought-after high school player in the state since Kevin McHale.
It's even closer to the U _ the university _ where Przybilla played
for 1 1/2 seasons until tensions with coach Don Monson and his own
decision to stop attending class led to his departure.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, he had 33 points and 14 rebounds in an upset win over
No. 10 Indiana and, for the second time, was named Big Ten Player
of the Week. He never played another game for the Gophers. He was
suspended Feb. 15 for skipping classes and, four days later, left
the program and the school.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent much of the last six weeks answering the same
questions posed by Gabriel as well as other GMs and personnel men:
Why would he bail out on his team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision I made and I have to live with it,'' Przybilla
said in a recent telephone interview. ``It wasn't easy to do. I was
close to a lot of guys on that team. I'm not sure I'd even do the
same thing if it happened again, but it's over, and I've got to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, it came down to Monson. Przybilla had been
recruited by, and been close to, Clem Haskins, whose tenure as
coach ended after the revelations of academic fraud. Monson and
Przybilla did not hit it off; by the time Przybilla left school,
they hadn't spoken for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that,'' Przybilla said, when asked if his
conflict with Monson was the main reason for his decision to leave
school. ``I was frustrated a lot. There wasn't a lot of
communication. I wanted to play for Clem Haskins. He was the main
reason I chose Minnesota in the first place and I'd probably still
be there if he was coaching. But it was hard, because I also felt I
should be loyal to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't because he wasn't playing, or that he wasn't playing
well. He led the Gophers in scoring at 14.2 points a game, in
rebounding (8.4), and in blocked shots (almost 4 per game). He also
shot 63 percent from the field, but that is misleading in that he's
an around-the-basket scorer. He shot only 49.5 percent from the
free throw line. Those statistics were for 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla was warned by Monson about repercussions for not
attending classes and study halls. He was well within the NCAA
guidelines for eligibility, but Minnesota had just instituted new
academic regulations in the wake of the Haskins scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a buildup of a lot of things,'' Przybilla said. ``It
was gradual.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took some flak immediately after leaving. Two days after
suspending Przybilla, Monson received a standing ovation when
introduced before the game with Illinois. Even worse, a fan was
booed during a halftime contest when it was revealed he also was
from Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Przybilla decided to leave school, his parents
already had talked to several player agents. All told them the same
thing: Your son is a lottery pick. The family settled on Bill Duffy
(a Minnesota alum) and he brought Przybilla out to San Francisco
for daily drills, weightlifting, and conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Przybilla put it, ``it was a lot of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the NBA lottery determined draft positions, Duffy started
setting up visits and workouts. Przybilla never made it to Boston;
the Celtics might like someone with his intimidation skills, but,
at 11, it's a reach. He just completed his final workout over the
weekend, visiting Chicago for a second time. He's also been to
Orlando, New Jersey, Vancouver, Houston, Cleveland, and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Of those teams, all are either in the hunt for a center or have
one who is on the edge of either free agency or retirement. The
Nets would take him only if they traded down _ there have been
rumors of a deal with the Magic _ while Vancouver seems a long shot
given it already has Big Country Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care where I go,'' Przybilla said. ``Every
place I've gone, the people have been great. But at the same time,
it's been tough. There are a lot of drills, and it's not like when
you're in college, when you can go back to the hotel and be with
your teammates. Here, you go back and you're alone.''
</P>
<P>
   How is he viewed? One general manager, preferring to remain
anonymous, said, ``he could be the next Jim McIlvaine,'' a
reference to the foul-prone, offensively challenged but
shot-blocking center for the Nets. ``McIlvaine was a shot-blocker
in college, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel thought that was a bit harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a big upside,'' Gabriel said. ``He is a legitimate
shot-blocker and there aren't many of them in the draft. Most teams
would like to have one. In workouts and interviews, he's been very
upfront and conscious of what he said and did and how it reflected
on him. I think it weighed heavy on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that is behind Przybilla now. He soon will become a very
wealthy man and an NBA player. That is what he envisioned when he
went to Minnesota. It's just coming sooner than he thought and
definitely not by design.

REVOLUTION PULLING TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ About 20 minutes after the conclusion of the
Revolution's 3-1 loss to Columbus at Crew Stadium Saturday night,
midfielder Leonel Alvarez instructed a teammate to close the door
to the coaches' office. Then, Alvarez gathered his Revolution
teammates around and, with Johnny Torres translating, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a lot of teams in this league that have been doing
well go into a slump and start losing. It's normal. Let's forget
about this game. If we stay together, we will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tension was broken, and the Revolution appeared
willing to follow Alvarez's advice. They need a rallying point
after failing to win for the third successive game and having their
advantage in the Eastern Division reduced to one point over the
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get down on ourselves,'' said Revolution captain
John Harkes, whose misplay of an Alvarez pass led to the
tiebreaking goal. ``But we are still fighting for first place and
if we fight as a team, we will be stronger. Instead of fighting
individual battles, we need to stick together, and if we do that,
we will come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we are not in the position of D.C. United, where
there is pressure to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution have completed nine successive weeks in
first place in the Eastern Division of Major League Soccer, which
makes them a candidate for most improved team of the year. But they
likely will lose their advantage to the MetroStars, who have
improved even more dramatically, and can gain the lead against San
Jose Wednesday. The Revolution will take two days off, then begin
preparing for a July 4 visit to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes could not resist making a comparison to D.C. United, his
former team, which remains in last place with 16 points. Harkes and
nearly half of his teammates have been rejected by their original
MLS teams.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Juergen Sommer made his first MLS appearance for the
Revolution after being acquired from Columbus, but was betrayed by
some ineffective defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some amateur mistakes and on the road you can't afford
mistakes like that because the other team will punish you,'' Sommer
said. ``It's disturbing that all three of their goals came from the
6-yard box. But we all have to look at ourselves. We got to where
we are for a reason. We just have to get back to basics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are tied for third in the MLS in goals with 30
but their lack of offense against the Crew highlighted their need
for a high-profile striker.
</P>
<P>
   Director of soccer operations Sunil Gulati said the Revolution
remain in contention for Jorge Cadete of Benfica. Cadete, 31, would
fit the profile of another player who has been rejected, for a
combination of reasons related to age and salary.
</P>
<P>
   Cadete scored 74 goals in 209 games in Portugal playing for
Benfica and Sporting; 25 goals in 31 games for Celtic Glasgow in
1996-97; and eight goals in 36 games for Celta Vigo in Spain from
1997-99. Cadete's first move outside Portugal was to Brescia in
Italy's Serie B in the 1995-96 season and he was loaned to Bradford
City in England last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cadete accepted the Revolution's offer two weeks ago, but then
decided to take a vacation before making a final decision. Cadete,
a 5-foot-11-inch, 160-pound native of Porto Amelia, Mozambique,
also has been linked to Estrella Amadora, which hoped to take him
on loan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defender Mauricio Wright will return from suspension, but
midfielder Mauricio Ramos will miss the Miami game after exceeding
the number of caution points (20) allowed . . . The Revolution have
been outscored, 22-9, and have never taken a regulation win in
Columbus in nine games.

   Back to square one _ again _ for the US Olympic softball team.
After an arbitrator ordered the federation to reselect the team in
April when unchosen gold-medal veteran Julie Smith protested,
alternate Kelly Kretschman objected to being dumped from the new
roster. So the federation has to reevaluate the 39-player pool and
choose again. Meanwhile, the team is on a barnstorming tour. It
will play a split doubleheader (2:30 and 6:30 p.m.) against local
all-star teams Sunday at Worcester State . . . Most US swimmers
don't have a gripe with the new ban on bodysuits at the Olympic
trials in August. ``If everyone had a fair opportunity to wear the
suits, then it would have been OK,'' said Lenny Krayzelburg, world
record-holder in both backstrokes. ``But if some of us got an
unfair advantage over the other swimmers, then I don't think it's
fair. The fair way to make the Olympic team is everyone racing on
even ground.'' Though the Americans will be allowed to use
bodysuits in Sydney, their top foreign rivals (like Australia's Ian
Thorpe and the Netherlands' Inge de Bruijn) already will have used
them in competition . . . How dominant is The Thorpedo? His
teammate, Michael Klim, the world record-holder in the 200
freestyle, won't even swim the event in Sydney. He figures his
chances of winning five gold medals are better in the 100 free, the
100 butterfly, and the relays.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Khalid Khannouchi saga isn't over. Though the new US citizen
will have missed both the US Olympic marathon and track and field
trials with a leg injury, he wants the US federation to put him on
the team anyway. Slim chance of that, though. Not only is an injury
waiver unprecedented (hurdler Greg Foster had to compete with a
broken arm at the 1988 trials), it would open the door for any
Olympic hopeful with a hamstring twinge . . . Even though Michelle
Akers hasn't played since last summer's World Cup and is coming off
shoulder surgery, US women's soccer coach April Heinrichs is
holding a spot for her _ for now. ``We're taking it week to week
with Michelle,'' said Heinrichs, who's also waiting on injured
captain Carla Overbeck. ``What we know is that even when she's
rusty, she's still a world-class player.'' . . . The US Olympic
rhythmic gymnastics trials, which will be held in Boston at the
same time as the August artistic trials, may be for naught. If
South Africa decides to send Michelle Cameron (who may be kept home
from Sydney because of the country's Olympic ``racial mix''
policy), the Americans won't move up from alternate status. Holding
her breath, meanwhile, is Jessica Howard, clearly the top US
contender. If she wins the trials, she may have to wait until the
Aug. 28 deadline for the South Africans to decide. Had Howard won
last year's Pan American Games (she missed by a thousandth of a
point), the US would have earned a wild-card spot . . .
Disappointing bowout for gymnast Jennie Thompson, who probably
would have made the US Olympic team but for a recurring ankle
injury. Thompson, who retired last week at 18, was a two-time world
team member.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympic rowing trials complete (except for the men's
lightweight four), the subjective part starts _ choosing the men's
and women's eights, the men's four, and the women's quad. Men's
sweep coach Mike Teti probably will select his four the week after
next for the last-chance Olympic qualifying event in Switzerland in
mid-July. Sculling coach Igor Grinko will pick a quad from eight
candidates for the Lucerne regatta. If it wins a medal there, odds
are it'll be the Olympic boat. If not, everybody's back in the mix
. . . The US rowers and kayakers may want to bring a weedwhacker to
Sydney along with their oars and paddles. The Penrith Lakes course
has some lush plant growth under the surface, which has snarled
some competitors during test events. The weeds will be cleared out
before the Games, organizers promise . . . Too bad that the
Olympics no longer has a team medal for modern pentathlon. The US
came home with the title at last weekend's world championships in
Italy as Velizar Iliev, Chad Senior, and James Gregory finished
6-10-15. Iliev and Senior will compete as individuals in Sydney . .
. With Russ Silvestri nailing down an Olympic spot at the recent
Finn world championships, the US sailors have qualified for Sydney
in all 11 classes. Returning from the 1996 squad are Lanee Butler
(women's Mistral), Mike Gebhardt (men's Mistral), Courtenay
Becker-Dey (Europe), Jeff Madrigali (Soling), Mark Reynolds (Star),
and John Lovell and Charlie Ogletree (Tornado) . . . Challenging
Olympic draw for the US men's water polo team _ World Cup champion
Hungary, Olympic runner-up Croatia, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands,
and Greece. The Yanks, who placed a disappointing seventh in
Atlanta, need to place in the top four to advance. The women,
making their Olympic debut, play a round-robin against the
Netherlands, Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Australia . . . How
close did top US diver Mark Ruiz cut it at last week's Olympic
springboard trials? He was sixth after the second of six dives and
needed to be near-perfect on his final shot to make the team.
``There were no worries,'' shrugged Ruiz, who ended up first after
nailing his reverse 3 1/2 somersault with a half twist. ``I thought
I was out of it.'' Ruiz topped the platform trials Sunday . . . On
the board of the USOC'S new independent anti-doping agency is
Brockton's Peter Breen, the former ice dancer who competed with
Wellesley's Rachel Mayer in the 1992 Winter Games. Breen is now a
certified athletic trainer . . . How likely is it that US West will
have to pay $1 million to a lucky fan if Maurice Greene breaks his
world mark (9.79) in the Olympic 100. Not very, if history is a
guide. Only once has the mark in that event been broken at the
Games, by American Jim Hines at altitude in Mexico City in 1968.

HOT MARINERS THINK THINGS CAN GET EVEN BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tom Lampkin knew what he had hit. That would be a
grand slam _ one that came in the bottom of the eighth inning
Sunday to give the Mariners a 4-2 victory and a sweep of the
nose-diving Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   What Lampkin did not know was what hit (begin italics) him (end
italics) when the Mariners catcher ran back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, along with base runners Stan Javier, Alex Rodriguez and
Mike Cameron, was the first Mariner to run up the dugout steps to
congratulate Lampkin by all but bashing Lampkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's an exciting time. It was a close game, their
starter was throwing an awesome game and it was low-scoring. For
awhile, it looked like a 2-0 game was pretty much going to hold up.
Then all of a sudden, he walks two guys, some magical things happen
and Lampkin makes a big hit,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream of moments like that as a hitter _ coming up to the
plate, two outs, bases loaded, you're down 2-nothing. That was just
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Buhner was wearing a fat grin while recounting
the winning moment at Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, meanwhile, joked that he was a little shaken up by the
raucous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been smacked around like that in the middle of a
game. I might wake up tomorrow with a sore neck. They were getting
me pretty good, not that I minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-fiving, back-slapping, head-pounding mob scene spoke
volumes about where this team is right now.
</P>
<P>
   And that place would be a confident, happy place, even if
Oakland keeps winning and denying the M's a chance to take first
place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   All in good time, seems the message in Marinerville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game you can feed off of. Things are great
right now,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you get on a roll, you feed off of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have won 16 of their past 21 games. They have won
their past seven series. If the season were to end right now, the
M's would be the wild card in the American League division series.
</P>
<P>
   But frankly, the Mariners do not seem eager to accept that
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the unofficial motto in Marinerville is: Oakland would
make an excellent wild card. The M's, of course, want the division
title and seem eager to make moves to enhance their chances.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of help do the M's need?
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, there was talk about Ken Caminiti, back before
the hard-hitting veteran found himself on the disabled list for the
next 10 weeks. Caminiti would have been perfect, especially since
he has a knack for getting big hits during September pennant
drives.
</P>
<P>
   The name Johnny Damon still sounds good, even if another
outfielder would clog things up with Rickey Henderson now on board
and contributing and Buhner having a solid season and Cameron
making everyone forget who used to play center field.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Mariners are looking to upgrade. In fact,
there is a sense that some club officials are downright eager for
Pat Gillick to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always making contact just to see. This is the time of
year clubs have to figure whether they're in it or out of it,''
vice president of baseball administration Lee Pelekoudas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some clubs might not be happy we're calling since that means
we think they're not in it anymore. They might have a different
opinion. But you never know when a club might be willing to listen.
Either you're going to bolster your club or trade veterans to get
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are taking calls for left-handed bats and
infielders, even if they have shown a reluctance to give up
prospects like Ryan Anderson or Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   Pelekoudas said the Mariners may be overvaluing their own
players. Still, he said there are deals they would make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to seem too anxious. But you hate to wait too
long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the reason the M's are talking about their
desire to improve the club is to make sure Rodriguez knows that the
organization is serious about winning.
</P>
<P>
   They're not going to pick up a Juan Gonzalez or a Sammy Sosa
because, Pelekoudas said: ``We've got that guy (in Rodriguez).
We're trying to improve the club, not only to show him but to show
everybody we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the team, the pitching (third-best in the AL) and the
defense and chemistry are undeniable. Every new player has been
able to find his role and contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a very relaxed clubhouse. There's not a lot of
media pressure. People can come in here and adjust real well. Lou's
a great manager, he just lets you come in and play,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody welcomes any addition that will help this
ballclub. And besides, look what they've done so far, making deals
to bring guys in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's are on a roll. No point in not trying to get a little
bit better. The M's say the phone lines are open.

IT ENDS AT ERSTAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Where would the Angels be without Darin
Erstad?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question for aesthetics on some days, but Sunday
evening the answer didn't require much philosophy, just math _
they'd simply be a game farther out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad homered to lead off the game, ran his way into being the
tying run in the seventh and then homered with two out in the
bottom of the 11th to deliver the Angels a much-needed 7-6 victory
over the Minnesota Twins before 19,391 on a hot, sticky evening at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this season the Angels ended a game with a
home run, and it couldn't have come at a better time. The win kept
the flagging Angels 5 games behind Oakland and 4 behind
second-place Seattle in the AL West. It also lifted their spirits
after blowing an early three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play well whoever we're playing,'' said Angels
manager Mike Scioscia, whose team begins a 10-game stretch Tuesday
against the Mariners and Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not halfway through the marathon yet, and we still have
our eyes on the leaders, but we need to get some momentum by
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody's playing better for the Angels this season than
Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   He ran his hitting streak to 10 games, upped his batting average
to .371, stole his team-leading 12th base, and his 57 RBI tie him
for the team lead with Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad production for a leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darin's not a leadoff man,'' Scioscia said. ``He bats No. 1 in
our lineup, but he could bat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in any lineup in the
league. Even by All-Star standards, he's having a phenomenal
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also took some heat off Scioscia, whose call for Orlando
Palmeiro to squeeze home the go-ahead run in the eighth with the
runners at first and third and nobody out backfired miserably when
Palmeiro popped into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad hit the first pitch he saw from Twins starter Mark Redman
and ripped it on a line just over the center-field fence. Garret
Anderson's three-run homer staked the Angels to a 4-1 lead in the
fourth, which looked good enough for Brian Cooper, whose sinker
earned him five double-play balls from an infield that included
reserves at third (Scott Speizio) and second base (Justin
Baughman).
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, who might be sent back to Triple-A Edmonton on
Wednesday when Ken Hill is expected to be activated from the
disabled list, fell apart in the sixth. Denny Hocking, Ron Coomer
and Corey Koskie ripped doubles off him, and by the time Al Levine
ended the inning, the Twins led 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels tied the score in the seventh when they took
advantage of shortstop Jason Maxwell's error and Erstad's single to
put runners at the corners. Erstad stole second and Benji Gil's
one-out groundout scored Baughman from third and moved Erstad to
third. He scored on Tim Salmon's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was surprised by his homer in the 11th, especially
because it came against left-hander Eddie Guardado, against whom
Erstad was 1 for 9 lifetime ``and the one was an infield hit,''
Erstad said.
</P>
<P>
   But Erstad, who popped up against Guardado in the ninth, drove a
1-0 slider over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had my number,'' Erstad said of Guardado. ``He's one of
the best left-handed relievers, if not the best. It was probably
the first mistake he's ever made to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trying to hit a home run. You just want to put a
ball in the gap with two outs and get into scoring position. For
me, if I start thinking about home runs, I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Or exactly where the Angels would be without him. &QL;

SCOISCIA SAYS ANGELES NOT HOMER-HAPPY BUNCH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels, who have hit 119 home runs this
season, rank third in the major leagues in that category and are
nearly two-thirds of the way toward the club record of 192 despite
being two weeks shy of the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Garret Anderson became the third Angel to reach the
20-homer plateau, joining Troy Glaus, who has 23, and Mo Vaughn,
who has 20.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon, at 17, and Darin Erstad, at 16, could make the
Angels the first team to have four 20-homer players at the All-Star
break since at least 1973, which is as far back as Elias Sports
Bureau researchers have dug.
</P>
<P>
   But has all the homer-happiness lured the Angels into swinging
for the heavens? Manager Mike Scioscia doesn't think so, even
though in the six games on the homestand, the Angels have relied on
home runs to score 22 of their 33 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club has a lot more to offer than hitting the ball out of
the ballpark,'' Scioscia said, citing the club's .358 on-base
percentage, which ranks fourth in the league. ``My vision of this
club is more than hitting home runs, even though that's been
carrying us for the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some situational hitters, some guys who can steal a
base or be part of a run-and-hit. This club can put a lot of
pressure on teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is the only one whose home runs are up _ he's two shy
of the career-high 21 he hit last season _ and whose batting
average (.241 compared to a career average of .300) has fallen off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've addressed that, particularly with Garret,'' Scioscia
said of players swinging for the fences. ``If all these guys were
hitting .210 and hitting home runs, then it would be something we'd
address.''
</P>
<P>
   A rare day off: !off!In what Scioscia termed a precautionary
move, Troy Glaus, after starting the first 73 games of the year,
took Sunday off after back spasms forced him from Saturday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus was in the on-deck circle in the eighth to hit for Justin
Baughman but was called back to the dugout after Orlando Palmeiro's
squeeze bunt backfired into a double play. Glaus is expected to be
in the lineup today at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play 162 (games),'' Scioscia said. ``We could DH
him, but in the big picture, we need him to play third base.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Brian Cooper faced a pair of former USC teammates
Sunday. Minnesota catcher Chad Moeller and center fielder Jacque
Jones, who played with Cooper on the Trojans' 1995 College World
Series runner-up, each had a hit in two at-bats against Cooper....
Justin Baughman, after spending the past six weeks at shortstop for
Triple-A Edmonton, made his 2000 debut for the Angels at second
base. He went 0 for 4 with a run scored and he made an error.

MORI WINS JAPAN VOTE, BUT PARTY LOSES SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's gaffe-prone prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, can
hold onto his job. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese voters cast their ballots for the status quo Sunday and
returned Mori and his coalition government to power as expected.
But the Liberal Democratic Party lost seats in parliament and is
now dependent on its coalition partners to stay in power, casting
doubts on Mori's political longevity.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where fads and trends come and go with dizzying
speed, politics continues to change at a glacial pace. Despite a
decade of economic malaise, rising crime, and social anxiety, the
LDP has shown, yet again, that it faces no serious challenge to its
nearly half a century of dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity and stability remain the guiding principles in
Japanese politics, particularly among the country's rural voters
and large elderly population. ``Even though Mori's character has
been criticized, my family has always voted for the LDP. It's
tradition, and I feel comfortable with it,'' said Sadao Naruse, 81,
after voting at a polling station in downtown Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP _ and its two coalition partners _ campaigned on
promises of continued public spending, in hopes of bolstering the
flagging economy, despite running up Japan's debt to the highest of
any industrialized nation. The economy grew slightly last year, but
unemployment remains near record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Election results have given Mori a reprieve, but he remains
unpopular _ both inside his own party and with Japanese voters, who
still consider the former rugby player a buffoon. He has made
several verbal blunders since taking office in April, when
then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a fatal stroke. Last
month, Mori called Japan ``a divine nation, with the emperor at its
core,'' a comment that rekindled memories of Japan's war-time
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, Mori is expected to face pressure to resign
from some factions within his party. On election night, the
bickering had already begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those men in the LDP are incompetent and change within the
LDP is needed,'' said party member Makiko Tanaka, as she celebrated
winning her second term.
</P>
<P>
   The governing coalition won 56 percent of the lower house seats,
compared with 65 percent in the previous government.
</P>
<P>
   Mori was considered such a hindrance in the election that few
district party offices invited him to their constituencies to speak
in support of local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Voters say they cast their ballots not for Mori, but for his
party.
</P>
<P>
   The position of prime minister counts very much less than most
other parliamentary democracies. Japanese politics is a systematic,
intensely local affair, with voters supporting candidates based on
personal connections and pork barrel largesse.
</P>
<P>
   The election results have underscored how, in many ways, Japan
functions more like a one-party state than a democracy. ``It does
appear extraordinary, particularly if you're looking at it from a
Western political perspective,'' said Roger Buckley, professor of
history at the International Christian University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is the fact that the LDP has organized so well, it's
so experienced, it's had half a century of power, and the voters
are prepared to vote for the party almost regardless of who happens
to be the prime minister of the moment,'' Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, there is a disconnect between voters and
politicians. Many Japanese, regardless of who they support, express
a common belief that politics is becoming more irrelevant. They say
the problems affecting their lives cannot be solved by any kind of
politician. Even the lackluster economy, according to many voters,
is something they don't believe can be solved in the political
arena. Clearly, it's not enough in Japan to simply say ``the
economy, stupid'' to throw out a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people trust politicians less. It's that the
weight of politics has gone down. People don't feel they need
politicians,'' said political analyst Takashi Inoguchi.
</P>
<P>
   At 63 percent, voter turnout was the second-lowest on record.
Analysts say apathy _ combined with a rainy election day _ kept
voters away.
</P>
<P>
   Kana Fushimi, 28, who voted for one of the smaller opposition
parties, says she is tired of the inertia. ``Japanese people
deserve a government that never changes because no one makes any
effort to change things. I'm so fed up with that kind of
attitude,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators consider the election results muddy. ``This is
an election that nobody won,'' observed one TV analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The fractured opposition, which had looked strong several weeks
ago, failed to capture voters' imaginations. They blamed the often
byzantine electoral system the LDP has managed to construct over
the decades. ``The walls of the voting system are thick,'' said
Kiyomi Tujimoto, who regained her parliamentary seat with the
opposition Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the largest opposition party, Minshuto, managed to gain
seats, even as smaller opposition parties lost ground. Analysts say
that could be a sign that Japan might slowly evolve into more of a
two-party system.

GREEN PARTY CHOOSES NADER AS ITS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Jubilant Green Party members made consumer advocate
Ralph Nader their official nominee for president Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrived here the vote was but a formality, a fact
reflected in the final tally: Nader, introduced by radio
commentator Jim Hightower as ``the lanky, somewhat disheveled, and
always true embodiment of reform,'' won 295 votes. His two
competitors each won 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   After Nader was installed as the nominee by unanimous
acclamation, and delegates cut loose some of the green, white, and
blue balloons overhead, organizers showed an edgy, fast-cut video
montage of moments from his 35-year career, which was overlaid with
dance music and bold graphics that read ``End Corporate Welfare''
and ``Consumers (EQ) Voters.'' The crowd cheered loudest for
footage of the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle last
fall. It was a sharp contrast to the long, low-key acceptance
speech that followed, which stretched on for almost two hours, and
was far more typical of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 4 1/2 months,'' he told the 1,000 party members
in attendance, ``this campaign must challenge the campaigns of the
Bush and Gore duopoly in every locality by running with the people,
not as Bush and Gore do, parading around the country looking for
photo opportunities and staged events.'' That brought loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, has been campaigning for the nomination since March.
He has visited all 50 states, reintroducing himself to some who
might have forgotten him, and introducing himself to those too
young to remember the man who indicted General Motors's safety
record in his 1965 book, ``Unsafe at Any Speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been pushing his longtime principles: universal health
care, public financing of campaigns, and stronger labor laws, among
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is polling at about 4 percent nationally. In California,
his share jumps to 9 percent in some surveys. His profile has risen
higher in recent weeks after the United Auto Workers and the
Teamsters praised his stand on trade.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party politics have been mostly fractious until now. But
more state Green parties have joined the Association of State Green
Parties than ever before, said Tom Sevigny, cochairman of the
association. The convention brought together 313 delegates from 39
states. Another national organization of Green parties, Green
Parties USA, was also at the convention, but because that group
prefers direct action to electoral politics, its members did not
participate in the votes. On Friday night, delegates resolved that
the two Green organizations meet in the next two months to
negotiate and form one national organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has stayed away from internal politics and is not a member
of the party, preferring, he says, to concentrate on running for
office. But his success is also the party's: If he wins 5 percent
of the vote in November, the Greens will be eligible for federal
matching funds in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader has attracted so much attention,'' said Stacey Cordiero,
cochairwoman of the Massachusetts Green Party. ``We're talking
about multiplying the size of our organization in a matter of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Nader has the nomination, he and the party will turn
their energies to the presidential debates, the first of which will
be held Oct. 3 in Boston. Nader will not be included in the debates
unless he polls 15 percent or more nationally. Green Party members
have vowed to disrupt the debates if Nader is excluded.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference before the final vote, Nader was asked if
he was worried that his candidacy would take votes from Gore, and,
in a close race, hand the presidency to Bush. As usual, he scoffed
at the question, arguing that there was no difference between the
two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you ask Albert Gore, `Are you worried about
defeating Ralph Nader?' '' he said. He said the Texas governor's
ascension to the White House would be ``a do-nothing replacing a
do-little, Tweedledee replacing Tweedledum.''

PRI SUBTLY TWISTING ARMS AS VOTE NEARS, OPPOSITION SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico _ If one believes the opposition, the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party used to resort to blatant
election day tactics like ballot box stuffing and outright vote
tampering to make sure it did not lose elections in this northern
city called ``Victory.'' And then there was the time when party
workers reportedly buried two ballot boxes to keep the votes from
being counted.
</P>
<P>
   This year is different. Many specialists and government
officials predict that the presidential election on July 2 will be
the closest and cleanest in Mexico's history, thanks mostly to a
new independent agency that will oversee the balloting, a large
contingent of international observers, and stricter laws against
blatant abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But voters and opposition leaders say the only real change is in
the tactics of the governing party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their specialty used to be election day strategies, but they
know they can't do that anymore without getting caught,'' said
Gustavo Cardenas, former mayor of Ciudad Victoria and an opposition
candidate for Senate. ``Now, their methods are more subtle, but the
goal is the same _ winning by intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciudad Victoria is the capital of Tamaulipas, a border state
south of Brownsville, Texas, whose mix of industrial, agricultural,
and petroleum industries has long made it a PRI stronghold. But its
leaders say that it is not fraud but years of effective,
street-level organizing that has made the PRI the state's dominant
party and the odds-on favorite to win the state again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, however, allege a list of complaints involving
misuse of government workers: public workers being ordered to paste
bumper stickers on cars; professors at public universities being
told to gather signed pledges from voters to support the PRI; and
welfare offices withholding benefit checks one month only to
distribute two-month checks later at public ceremonies featuring
banners bearing the PRI's red, white, and green logo.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters and analysts say the Federal Electoral Institute, or
IFE, a nonpartisan watchdog agency established four years ago, will
help limit election day fraud. But PRI's opponents in Tamaulipas
are not taking their complaints to the agency. They say that
witnesses and victims are too scared to come forward or that PRI's
questionable methods, while unethical by international standards,
are not considered illegal under Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things may be immoral, but they're not altogether
illegal,'' said Luis Miguel Rionda, a political analyst at the
University of Guanajuato and a member of the watchdog organization.
``IFE's power is limited in these situations because it's hard to
make connections between a benefit or a threat and someone's
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders in Tamaulipas flatly deny accusations of fraud,
subtle or obvious. The complaints, they say, are fabricated by
``lazy'' opposition parties that have not worked hard enough to
build their own political machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, the only way to win is to work hard, and no other party
does that in Tamaulipas but the PRI,'' said Juan Miguel Garcia, the
party's state general secretary. The opposition parties ``wait
until election year to work, and then they make up these
accusations as excuses when they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia calls the party's Tamaulipas organization ``the PRI
army,'' and it's easy to see why. With more than 20,000 workers and
volunteers in this state of 3 million people, the party is by far
the dominant machine. It has organizers for each of the state's
1,739 voting precincts, who recruit 12,000 ``promoters'' to reach
out to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The party's main office is a four-story building near downtown,
one of the tallest and most easily recognized in the city. Across
the street, in a building named Fundacion Colosio, a civic
organization named after a PRI presidential candidate who was
assassinated in 1994, a half-dozen party workers clip and count
PRI-related articles from the state's 48 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the center-left opposition coalition is based in a
small two-story building, where the only two large rooms double as
offices and meeting rooms. The coalition has about 43 local groups
charged with forming ``base committees'' in each voting district,
but fewer than half are in place.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials here are so confident of their prospects that they
have promised party leaders in Mexico City, who often use
Tamaulipas as an organizing model, to deliver more than 500,000
votes out of an expected total of 1.7 million. The governor, Tomas
Yarrington of PRI, has also guaranteed easy victories in the state
for presidential candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa and all the
party's congressional hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents know that they have neither the organization nor the
money to compete with the PRI in Tamaulipas, so they rely on their
own tactics. To counter voter fears about PRI intimidation, workers
for both the center-left and center-right coalitions are reminding
residents that their votes are secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them to go ahead and sign those silly papers''
pledging to vote for PRI, said one volunteer for the center-right
opposition National Action Party, or PAN. ``But when it comes time
to vote, no one will know except them and God.''
</P>
<P>
   This presidential election is expected to be the tightest in
Mexican history and could unseat the PRI after 71 years of
uninterrupted rule. A national poll released Wednesday by
Reuters/Zogby showed Labastida and PAN candidate Vicente Fox
Quesada in a statistical tie. Former Mexico City mayor and Party of
the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is a
distant third, followed by two others.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Alonso Perez, the PRD's general secretary in Tamaulipas,
and Gustavo Cardenas, the PAN senate candidate from Tamaulipas,
agree that their biggest challenge is to field enough precinct
representatives on election day to make sure the voting is clean
and fair. So far, the opposition parties say they've recruited
500,000 representatives to cover all of Mexico's polling places.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just make sure that we have the people we need to
watch the polls to make sure people can vote without a problem,
then I think we can crack this machine,'' Cardenas said. ``But the
PRI is known for buying off our representatives, too. Getting a
good polling representative is almost as hard as getting someone's
vote.''

BRITISH SOCCER FANS LIVE DOWN TO IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Having watched their national soccer team beat Germany
for the first time in almost 34 years, English fans last week did
what comes naturally: They rioted.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the riot ended, 921 English fans had been arrested
by police in Charleroi, Belgium, where England had staged one of
its more dramatic victories in recent years, ending a drought
against the Germans that had lasted, in case you're counting, 33
years, 10 months, 14 days, 4 hours and 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had England defeated its arch rivals from the country
against which it had fought two world wars, its soccer hooligans
had reaffirmed their place as the most boorish, violent and racist
fans in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not exactly a good way to impress the international
committee weighing England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Back here in the capital, which would host the title game in
soccer's _ and the world's _ ultimate tournament, the poohbahs who
run the Football Association, the ruling body for English soccer,
nervously tried to reassure World Cup organizers that the goons who
trashed parts of Belgium during the European championships would be
on a much tighter leash at home.
</P>
<P>
   Football Association head David Davies sounded exasperated when
he claimed that, ``We have done everything in our power to
eradicate the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the continually drunk and quarrelsome Gallagher
brothers, who front the rock band Oasis, there are few things more
embarrassing to English people than their soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   Letter writers to conservative newspapers suggested the
hooligans are the natural byproduct of a society that discourages
the celebration of English pride. Some blamed the violence on Prime
Minister Tony Blair, saying his government fostered self-loathing
among the English but was too liberal to allow police to round up
suspected hooligans before international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said it was time for the English to stop
excusing the inexcusable behavior of its fans by pointing
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Young, a columnist for The Guardian, said England deserves
to be banned from international competitions until it can prove its
fans won't trash every city they visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``English football has become a threat to England, a curse on
football, a menace to the citizens of every country where it's
played. And in Belgium, June 2000, it has run out of alibis,''
Young fumed. ``We are the experts in drunken violence, racist
aggression, head-banging nationalism, copycat provocation, serial
thuggery and the sniveling whine about other people's policemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheesh! Tell us how you really feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some here point to Young's self-flagellation as part of the
problem. This theory holds that the postimperial English are so
beaten down, as they have watched the Scottish and Welsh get their
own parliaments and the Irish run circles around them economically,
as the rest of Europe seems pointed in one direction and them in
the other, that the chaos on the streets of foreign capitals is an
understandable reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the Belgian cafe owners who watched English yobs
hurl their tables and chairs around like they were horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some here pointed to the rioting in Los Angeles after the Lakers
won the NBA title on Monday as evidence that such behavior is not
limited to English soccer fans. And there was no serious trouble
after England's other matches in the European championships against
Portugal and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   But those games took place on weekdays. The Germany match was on
a weekend, when the yobs _ most of whom, contrary to stereotypes,
have jobs _ could show up to cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There is a great irony that the oafish behavior of English fans
probably will persuade World Cup organizers to reject England's bid
for the 2006 finals in favor of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Someone attending the World Cup in South Africa will have a
higher statistical chance of falling victim to crime than here in
England, where violent crime is far less prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   But they will have a considerable less chance of being beaten up
by some drunk named Nigel using the flag of St. George to cover his
beer belly.

VOTERS WEIGH IN ON ZIMBABWE'S FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NHEDZIWA, Zimbabwe _ Picking his way down the rocky dirt road
that leads through the center of this far-off village near the
Mozambique border, Jonathan Munjoma cut the profile of a diehard
supporter of Zimbabwe's ruling party. He is landless and poor and,
steadying his gait with a cane, belongs to the aging generation
that waged war against colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   But when Munjoma cast his ballot Sunday in elections offering
Zimbabweans a choice between truly competitive parties for the
first time in 20 years, Munjoma voted against his peers. More
striking still, he gave his support to one of President Robert
Mugabe's favorite villains _ a wealthy, white farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old guys, we know: Most things have changed for the
worse,'' Munjoma said. ``I grew up under a white government. They
did us a lot of good, unlike our leaders now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the racially charged atmosphere surrounding Zimbabwe's
parliamentary election over the weekend, some might have called
Munjoma's vote an act of treason. Faced with the threat of losing
power after two decades of unimpeded rule, Mugabe lashed out with
the rhetoric of a revolutionary, blaming white farmers, the British
government, and white South Africans for sabotaging Zimbabwe's
economy and starving the people of land.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the liberation war, goaded by the president, waged a
four-month campaign of terror against white commercial farmers,
invading their land, destroying crops, and beating their black
workers. Mugabe cast the opposition, which draws some of its
financial support from whites and South Africans, as a puppet of
the region's erstwhile racist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   But playing the race card may not have worked as well as Mugabe
hoped. Voters turned out in record numbers during the two-day poll,
which closed Sunday night. In Nhedziwa and other villages within
the voting district of Chimanimani _ one of only two rural voting
districts where white candidates are running against the ruling
party _ most black voters said Mugabe was blaming whites to mask
his government's record of economic mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The only racists in Zimbabwe, many said, were the president and
his thugs _ and they said it was time for them to leave. ``Mugabe
wants people to go backward 20 years to the liberation war,'' said
Ngaazwni Machinguru, an elderly resident of Nhedziwa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violent campaign season, in which at least 30 people
were killed, teams of international observers reported that the
voting went off with only scattered reports of intimidation. The
European Union's monitoring team said the ballot counting, which
began Monday, would have to be carefully monitored, but that the
voting process was largely successful. Results are expected
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are 120 parliamentary seats at stake. At least 55 percent
of voters cast ballots, almost twice as high a turnout as in the
last parliamentary poll five years ago. Both sides said that the
enthusiastic response augured well for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe is history,'' said opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai
Sunday. ``There is life beyond Mugabe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, retorted John Nkomo, chairman of the ruling party,
``No other party has a chance. . . . We have done our work and the
results will speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, hoping to tap into deep popular frustration over
high unemployment and rampant corruption, based its campaign on
severe economic decline. Mugabe's party exploited the land
question. Give white-owned farms to blacks, the president argued,
and the majority will finally control the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Land has always been a volatile issue in Zimbabwe. Farms became
battlegrounds during the liberation war. Twenty years after
independence, however, most of the best agricultural plots still
rest in the hands of a tiny white community, while much of the
black majority remains poor and landless.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months before the election, as the war veterans
attacked more than 1,300 commercial farms, many black Zimbabweans
said the ruling party was only deepening the country's economic
woes. The tobacco crop alone accounts for 40 of annual foreign
currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And when voters in Chimanimani district had a chance to elect a
new government, they did not seem bothered by the color of the
opposition candidate's skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is something awkward to us,'' said Julius Zvarevashe, a
middle-aged man outside a cafe in the village of Wengazi. ``We
don't want to lose those people. They are Zimbabweans.''

YOU HAVE ONLY YOURSELF TO BLAME FOR HIGH LONG-DISTANCE BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. has taken a lot of heat lately from government
regulators and consumer advocates for trying to hike the
long-distance calling rates of tens of millions of customers on its
basic calling plan, but I could care less.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission earlier this month signed
off on a deal lowering the costs of long-distance companies, hoping
those savings would be passed along to customers. AT&AMP;T responded by
eliminating the monthly minimum fee on its basic calling plan and
increasing the per-minute rate. Net result: Higher rates for most
customers on the plan. AT&AMP;T backed off, at least temporarily, after
the FCC squawked.
</P>
<P>
   What AT&AMP;T did was incredibly stupid from a public relations
standpoint, but I don't have much sympathy for customers on its
basic calling plan. The plan is AT&AMP;T's most expensive. It charges
26 cents a minute weekdays, 16 cents a minute weeknights, and 11.5
cents a minute on weekends. I figure the only people on it are
those who don't mind paying excessive rates or who are too lazy to
sign up for a discount plan.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns me more is AT&AMP;T's decision to discontinue as of
July 31 its connect'n'save service. Connect'n'save is a prepaid
phone-to-phone service that routes calls over the Internet. It can
be used to supplement your existing long-distance provider or
replace it entirely. It's available in major cities in
Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grant canceled his long-distance carrier and went with
connect'n'save because it was so easy to use. It cost 7.5 cents a
minute using a local access number and 15 cents using toll-free
access, and it came with none of the fees and charges typical of
long distance.
</P>
<P>
   Like Grant, more and more customers are looking for an
alternative to their existing long-distance providers. Dean Dakin,
for example, is tired of paying an 8.6 percent universal service
fee to AT&AMP;T, which amounted to $5.78 on a recent bill. (The
universal service fee, which varies dramatically from company to
company, finances Internet access for schools and libraries and
makes phone service affordable for low-income and rural residents.)
</P>
<P>
   Tauby Warriner began thinking about dumping AT&AMP;T after her
daughter moved back to Massachusetts. Her only concern was whether
there were any hidden pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who cut the chord to his long-distance carrier six
months ago, I'd say go for it. You will probably have to dial more
numbers to make a call, but you can control your costs better and
avoid all those annoying fees and taxes that show up on your
long-distance bill every month regardless of whether you make any
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you have to do is sever your ties to your
long-distance carrier. Your local phone company can handle that for
you. Bell Atlantic charges a one-time fee of $5 to make the switch.
It has been imposing a $1.04 monthly charge to cover the cost of
long-distance access, but that is slated to disappear July 1.
</P>
<P>
   There are several options for making long-distance calls without
a long-distance carrier. You can use prepaid calling cards or 10-10
dial-around services, which let you make calls with a special
access code and be billed monthly on your local phone bill. Many of
these services don't offer directory assistance, so you will have
to locate numbers using your local phone company, Internet
telephone directories, or directory assistance services that can be
accessed independently.
</P>
<P>
   What was nice about AT&AMP;T's connect'n'save service was its
simplicity. You purchased calling time in advance with a credit
card. To make a call, you had to dial a local access number or a
toll-free number, then punch in a personal identification number
and the number being called. (The PIN could be skipped when calling
from home.) There were no monthly fees, so if you didn't make a
call during the month, you weren't charged anything.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T launched connect'n'save in Boston in 1998 to learn about
carrying calls over the Internet. But after making a substantial
investment in Net2Phone, an industry leader in Internet telephony,
AT&AMP;T decided to drop its own service.
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone's comparable service costs less _ 3.9 cents a minute
using a local access number and 6.9 cents a minute using a
toll-free number _ but it comes with a 99-cent monthly charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are other options. The 10-10 dial-around
offerings are easy to use, but they often come with a catch or a
hidden fee. Two popular ones are Excel's 10-10-297 and PT-1's
10-16-868. They charge 10 cents a minute and 7.9 cents a minute,
respectively, along with universal service fees.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid calling cards are popular, but require the buyer to go
shopping for one. They also often carry hidden fees. One of my
favorite prepaid cards is put out by Conexus. Its rates aren't the
lowest (10 cents a minute using a local access number and 15 cents
with a toll-free number), but there are no hidden fees and the card
can be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bell Atlantic, which is just entering the long-distance
market, is moving in the prepaid direction with a customer-friendly
offering. Its SmartTouch calling plan charges 8 cents a minute at
all times with no additional fees. And unlike calling cards or
10-10 offerings, you don't have to dial any extra numbers to place
a call.
</P>
<P>
   The best deal I've heard of so far is BigZoo.com. The price _
3.9 cents a minute all the time using a toll-free access number _
is great and there are no hidden charges. It does require you to
dial the access number, input a PIN number and then the number you
are calling, but for low-volume callers that's not too big a
burden.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Stevenson has been using BigZoo for months and loves
it. She says she has been charged occasionally for calls that
aren't answered or calls that get a busy signal (something that
shouldn't happen, according to BigZoo's Web site), but other than
that it's worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other services I've mentioned, you can try
BigZoo as a supplement to your existing long-distance carrier to
see if you like it. ``The service has been flawless,'' Stevenson
said. ``I think this is definitely worth looking into.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael J. Egan, a Southwest Airlines captain, calls himself a
``couch potato kind of investor'' who over the years has been able
to build a nest egg worth more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 53-year-old is ready to get off the couch and try his
hand at picking from among thousands of stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds in part of his 401(k). For the first time next week, his
employer-sponsored plan is offering a so-called self-directed
brokerage account, giving him virtually unlimited choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does give me a little bit more flexibility to `play' with
my money, for lack of a better word,'' said Egan, who will still
keep most of his 401(k) money in the dozen or so core mutual funds
his plan currently offers. ``A little more risk wouldn't bother me
for a greater return.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest trend in 401(k)s, a small but growing percentage
of plans are giving participants the chance to invest their
retirement money in almost anything, through their own brokerage
accounts. A natural extension of the ever-expanding options
available to investors, 401(k) brokerage accounts _ and related IRA
brokerage accounts _ tap into the growing public interest in the
stock market and all things relating to investing.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone favors giving employees more responsibility for
their 401(k) investments. With more choice comes some potential
pitfalls: The risk of day-trading away your retirement money or
otherwise making bad investments, and the paralysis of having too
many options.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a big unknown in this expanding area. Who's liable
if plan participants lose money or invest in something that's
inappropriate for their retirement savings? Some pension rights
advocates criticize this latest 401(k) trend as a dangerous option
for most people.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and others see things differently.
``The next logical progression in the empowerment of participants
is to give them broader choice through self-directed brokerage,''
said Walter W. Bettinger II, chief operating officer and senior
vice president for Schwab, which has seen its 401(k) brokerage
option business grow dramatically in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's Personal Choice Retirement Account is the 401(k)
brokerage option that Egan and other participants in the Southwest
Airlines Pilots' Retirement Savings Plan will have access to
beginning next week. PeopleSoft, Pacific Investment Management Co.,
Morningstar Inc., and Excite(at)Home are among some of the other
companies offering Schwab's PCRA to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, the proportion of 401(k) plans
offering a brokerage option has grown from less than 1 percent to
between 5 and 11 percent, according to data from consultants Hewitt
Associates and Spectrem Group, brokerage firms including Fidelity
Investments and Schwab, and the nonprofit Profit Sharing/401(k)
Council of America.
</P>
<P>
   But pension rights advocates see brokerage plans as another
example of the erosion of the traditional company pension, which
features a defined benefit backed by federal guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of studies show people think they know a lot more about
investing than they actually do,'' said Karen Friedman, director of
the Pension Fairness Project at the Pension Rights Center, a
consumer rights group based in Washington. ``If you lose your
retirement money because of a bad investment or the market goes
down, the individual is on the hook. Who are they going to sue?
Where's the protection?''
</P>
<P>
   Because this expansion of what is also known as a brokerage
window is so recent, ``no cases have come down on this yet,'' said
John Hotz, deputy director of the Pension Rights Center. ``The real
issue with a brokerage window is where does fiduciary
responsibility begin and, more importantly, where does it end?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in providing 401(k) participants with as much
information as possible, said Drew Lawton, executive vice president
for investment services for Fidelity, which has seen its 401(k)
brokerage option business grow dramatically over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was more case law in place, then people would have
more of a handle,'' said Lawton. ``It's an open question at this
point. We're all a little bit up in the air as to what could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to do what's in their own best interest for
retirement,'' he added. ``If self-directed brokerage doesn't bring
enhanced return over time, then plan participants themselves will
question if they're doing the right thing. We really have to focus
on education, to make people aware of the opportunities and the
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from providing education, employers and other plan
sponsors may seek to put in such safeguards as a ban on risky
investments such as derivatives, a limit on the portion of a
participant's 401(k) that can be transferred out of core mutual
funds and into a brokerage account, and additional fees for the
brokerage option.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Airlines brokerage option, for instance, will
allow participants to transfer only 25 percent of their 401(k) out
of core mutual funds and into the Schwab account, said Richard
Doherty, director of member benefits for the Southwest Airlines
Pilots' Association, which administers the employer-sponsored plan.
Trades within the 401(k) brokerage account will follow Schwab's
standard fee schedule. While there is no limit on trades, ``If I
see somebody excessively trading, I'll make them aware of what
they're doing,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) brokerage window at Fidelity also follows the
standard fee schedule for trades, but employers may opt to charge
participants $50 to $100 for making use of the option, according to
Fidelity's Lawton.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 1, 2001, Massachusetts will be offering a brokerage
window for the first time in its Section 457 deferred compensation
plan for government employees. But details about which brokerage
firm, fees, and account limits have not yet been worked out,
according to Dwight Robson, spokesman for state treasurer Shannon
P. O'Brien's office.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage Individual Retirement Account works in a similar
fashion, with standard fees for trades usually applying but without
an employer or other sponsoring organization to put safeguards in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The forces driving the increase in 401(k) brokerage accounts _
increased investor sophistication, demand for more choice, and
growing interest in the stock market _ also appear to be affecting
the IRA brokerage business, if Fidelity's experience is an
indication. Robert Corcoran, Fidelity's vice president of
retirement product development, said that for the first time, as of
the first five months of 2000, there's a 50/50 split in where new
IRA money flows _ with half going into individual stocks and half
into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, most new IRA money has gone into mutual funds, not
stocks, Corcoran said. Last year, it was a 60/40 split, with 60
percent into mutual funds and 40 percent into stocks. And in 1998,
it was an 80/20 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen sort of an interesting phenomenon develop, really,
over the last two years,'' Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   But using a brokerage account for retirement money may not be
what everyone wants, or needs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a private nonprofit group based in Washington, said EBRI
has long offered a 401(k) brokerage window to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the current 25 or so employees, and those who have left
over the years, ``It's probably a total of 50 employees who had the
option of using the brokerage window. In all those years, only one
person chose to do it,'' said Salisbury. ``It's just not what
individuals are interested in spending their time doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian FitzSimons, chairman of the retirement plan committee for
the law firm Arter &AMP; Hadden LLP and managing partner of the
Cleveland office, advises against the brokerage option, even though
the firm was one of the first to sign up with Schwab's PCRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really discourage our staff and everybody from doing that.
If you really think you're that good at this game, change jobs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, out of 1,144 total participants in the firm's
401(k) plan as of March 31, 2000, only 37, or 3 percent, have the
brokerage account. And out of the $94 million in total plan assets
as of that date, only $3.9 million, or 4 percent, was in the
brokerage option, according to FitzSimons.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, ``I do have some people who think they are
God's gift to investment.''
</P>
<P>
   While FitzSimons doesn't put himself in that category, he
recently opened up his own 401(k) brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's 53, FitzSimons is using the account to reduce his
exposure, taking some money out of stock mutual funds in the
401(k)'s core menu and putting it into individual bonds to hold to
maturity. He said he didn't want to use the bond mutual fund in the
core selection because of the interest-rate risk that could affect
the fund's value.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, the Southwest Airlines captain who lives west of Boston,
said he's generally a buy-and-hold, moderately aggressive investor
who has been happy with the performance of his 401(k) through the
core mutual funds. Much of his nest egg comes from his Southwest
profit-sharing plan he has been in for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there's ``nothing like having control of your own
money.'' He may use the 401(k) brokerage account to buy some
beat-up stocks he's been interested in, such as Disney, Coca-Cola,
or Boeing. ``They're things that I know about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egan knows his limits, as he jokes: ``How do you make a
pilot a millionaire? Give him a billion dollars.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking with astrologers who do market analysis is about as
mystical as a trip to the accountant. Too bad. The superstitious
investor had hoped for a little more ``Twilight Zone'' music _ OK,
a lot more ``Twilight Zone'' music _ being as the market has always
seemed just plain weird and under the spell of a very dark star, if
not the devil himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says Henry Weingarten, who manages The Astrologers
Fund Inc. in New York, investing under $4 million for private
clients. He talks at Internet speed about expanding into a major
mutual fund in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   For him and others in the trade, astrology is just one more tool
on the desk. There's the economy, company earnings records, the old
buy and sell, stock market cycles, and, oh yes, the positions of
Jupiter and Saturn, which happened to be moving into conjunction
this spring and probably helped toss the Nasdaq into the dumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between one-third and one-half of all the market's surprises
are callable by astrology,'' says Weingarten in his machine-gun
delivery, adding that he also relies on good, solid math and logic.
</P>
<P>
   He gets written up in Barrons and leaves his predictions on his
Web site for years so that people can see if he was right _ which
he was about the 1987 US market crash, the 1990 Tokyo economic
dive, the Mexican financial crisis, and the sickly euro.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks New Age sensibilities are making people more
receptive to the ancient art of tracking the heavens, he snorts
into the phone. ``Look at the world,'' he snaps, ticking off wars
and famine and ethnic cleansing. There's only one reason astrology
is on Wall Street, he says _ it makes sense, in its place, as long
as a person doesn't go wacko with it.
</P>
<P>
   He's one more technocrat in an age of technocrats, marshaling
methodology and data to explain even the occult. He makes a person
long for a gypsy in a tent, someone who gazes trancelike into the
crystal ball and whispers: ``You will meet a tall, dark Scorpio
selling Lycos,'' or ``Beware of geeks bearing Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The superstitious investor had hoped for a screaming nut,
someone who sported a garlic necklace and babbled about vampires on
Wall Street. Wouldn't we all feel a little better about investing
in a dud if supernatural forces had taken hold of the portfolio.
``Hey, man, it's vampires. No wonder I lost my shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But market astrologers do not so much as twitch. Ray Merriman,
president of the International Society for Astrological Research
and author of the newsletter ``Merriman Market Analyst,'' launches
into a lecture on the cycle theory of economics.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with ``the Kondratieff wave,'' named for Russian
economist Nicolai Kondratieff, who studied 54-year trends. Then
Merriman explains that there are also 18-year, four-year,
three-year, and 22 1/2-month cycles, which experts study as
carefully as the position of Pluto.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Scorpio with the Lycos, Ray? Moon in Libra.
Pisces rising. Married to a Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astrology is just a study of static market timing,'' he says.
``You need the technical analysis along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if we don't want it? What if we'd rather go with
sunspots?
</P>
<P>
   Arch Crawford says that's fine, as long as we understand the
science. The Arizona author of the newsletter ``Crawford
Perspectives'' explains that storms on the sun cause
electromagnetic energy to hit the earth, which rattles the human
psyche and makes people uneasy _ so the market usually drops and
gold rises.
</P>
<P>
   He has been using astrology in his market analysis for nearly 40
years and has tracked astrological events against percentage
changes in the market back to 1896. ``Straight statistical
analysis,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a horoscope is as good as using a balance sheet,'' says
Richard Mogey, who runs an Oregon money management firm. ``We use
technical analysis. We study economics, demographics, and trends.
And we use several indices that are strictly planetary.''
</P>
<P>
   Indices. Great. And the gypsy probably has them on a computer
now. (itals)Look deep into my indices. You will feel yourself
growing drowsy . . . drowsy . . . very drowsy.(unitals0

TIMING COULD HARDLY BE WORSE, BUT FUND CHOICES ARE FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I invested in my four funds on March 8, two days before the
stock market took a big loss. Should I take my loss of about $6,000
and change to other funds? All of my positions are negative, except
in the Index 500 fund. My investment time frame is nine years.
Would I have been better off if I had chosen Vanguard LifeStrategy
Growth Balanced, or maybe Vanguard Total Stock Market fund? I have
other funds with fixed-income portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   I.T., Tennessee &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, your timing certainly couldn't have been much worse. In
all likelihood, you'd be under water with this portfolio, whichever
funds you chose, given the date of your investment.
</P>
<P>
   I think you have the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds a bit mixed up.
There is a Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth fund, a
LifeStrategy Moderate Growth, and a Vanguard Balanced Index fund.
All of these are balanced funds, dividing their assets among the
stock and bond markets. LifeStrategy Conservative is the most
cautious of the three, holding 62 percent of its assets in bonds.
LifeStrategy Moderate Growth holds 43 percent in bonds, and the
Balanced Index fund has 39 percent in bonds. The use of any of
these funds would have moderated your loss _ but you would still be
under water.
</P>
<P>
   Since you mention you hold other funds and all of them have
fixed-income portfolios, I presume your thinking was that by taking
positions in the stock funds you would thus be creating a balanced
portfolio, similar to what a balanced fund would give you. Since
you set your investment time frame at nine years, that would be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Your selection of funds was good _ all have proven track records
and all should deliver solid results in the long run. Only Janus
Mercury could be viewed as an aggressive investment, with a
portfolio concentrated in only 72 stocks and with a
price-to-earnings ratio of 53.5 as this is written; it was
doubtless much higher when you made your investment. The only thing
that wasn't appropriate, as it turned out, was your timing.
</P>
<P>
   Should you be ready to jump ship after only four months? If I
have correctly characterized your strategy _ building a balanced
portfolio by countering your fixed-income positions in other funds
with these four stock funds _ I think you should hang on. A
four-month period is simply too short to decide that your thinking
was wrong, and even a year would be inadequate to assess whether a
nine-year investment strategy was ill-conceived.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you feel the whiplash that can come from
stock positions is too much for you, you certainly would find that
any of the three balanced funds I started out discussing would
deliver a smoother ride. But by turning to one of these, you also
would be limiting the upside potential of your long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have no savings or investments; my expenses equal my net
income of $2,000 a month. In seven years, I will be able to retire,
receiving about $1,500 a month pension. My hope is to work part
time after retirement to make up the difference in income. Soon, I
will inherit about $120,000 and I am trying to decide how to best
put this money to use. I am considering paying off the mortgage,
making some renovations, paying off my credit cards, making some
charitable donations, and investing the remaining $5,000. After
paying off the mortgage, I hope to invest $600 a month until I
retire. Is this a wise plan?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Austin, Texas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's begin with the assumption that you have firmly decided
to pay off your credit cards, renovate your home, and make the
charitable donations. That leaves $80,000, all of which might be
invested, or most of which might be used to pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose you decide to invest all of that money, selecting
as an investment the Vanguard Balanced Index fund. You might
reasonably expect the fund to deliver 9 percent average annual
gains over the next seven years. That would take the accumulation
from $80,000 to $149,837.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's project what would happen if you put $5,000 in the
same fund, adding $600 a month. After seven years with the same
presumed growth rate, you would have $79,214.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first case, you would still have the mortgage on your
hands, with another 20 years of payments ahead. I'm making the
assumption that about $190 of your monthly payment represents
taxes, and about $600 of it goes toward interest and principal.
Thus, I'm estimating that in seven years the balance would be about
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the figures, you would be about $10,000 ahead if you
invested in the fund and kept banging away at the mortgage, month
by month. But the next step is to reread the letter above, noting
how unhappy the writer is with his investments. Working out
projections of investment returns is easy _ you simply establish a
projected rate of return and bang the figures into the computer.
But there is no assurance those returns will be as estimated.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that having an extra $10,000 after seven years is
not worth the risk inherent in investing in funds with major
stock-market exposure. Moreover, the month-by-month saving
procedure you propose represents an investment discipline called
dollar-cost averaging, and it is much safer than making a lump-sum
investment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's up to you, but if it were my money, I'd take
the safer course and pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am new to investments. When I asked my broker about
Vanguard funds, she said she had no information.
</P>
<P>
   L.J., Santee, S.C. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're not apt to find out much about Vanguard, or any other
no-load fund family, from a stockbroker, since there is no way for
a broker to collect a commission, either from you or the fund
family, when you buy a no-load fund.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean your broker is being mean or evasive? No. Brokers
provide a real and important service, particularly to investors who
have not yet gained very much experience. They will assess your
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and many other factors, and
then make a recommendation tailored to your particular situation.
If you decide to buy individual stocks or bonds, you will be
charged commissions, a good part of which goes to the broker.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbrokers can also sell mutual funds, but invariably there
will be a fee. With many funds, you can choose various classes of
shares with different fee structures _ either an upfront sales
charge, a sales charge sometimes called a level load that takes the
form of higher fund expenses, or a rear-end load, which is levied
when you sell the shares. However you buy the shares, the
stockbroker gets paid.
</P>
<P>
   No-load mutual funds are designed for investors who feel they
know enough to analyze their own needs, market conditions, and
their appetite for risk. Some no-load funds, such as those in the
Vanguard Group, merge no-load status with quite low expenses and
fairly conservative portfolio management. Since Vanguard is a
mutual company _ owned by the funds in the family _ there is no
parent institution looking for dividends. Other no-load funds are
managed by investment companies, which seek to reap a profit;
accordingly the expenses are usually higher, often much higher.
Remember, making an analysis of a fund's expenses is part of the
work you would be paying a broker to do if you bought a fund
through a brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   I encourage you to hesitate to invest until you're sure you have
educated yourself about what you are buying, the costs, what are
reasonable expectations of returns, the risk of losses, and so
forth. If you aren't confident that you fully understand what
you're doing, it might be wiser to go with your broker's advice.
</P>
<P>
   There a variety of ways you can educate yourself about mutual
funds, including literature from the funds themselves. Libraries
have a wealth of knowledge about mutual funds. And if you have a
computer, you can learn a great deal by going to the Web site of
Morningstar Mutual Funds, a company that tracks and analyzes them.
At www.morningstar.com you can find copious information about most
funds, including Vanguard's. But a better place to start are the
pages called Morningstar University, which you will see at the top
of Morningstar's home page.
</P>
<P>
   When you're ready to look at particular funds, call Vanguard at
1-800-662-7447, or write to Vanguard Group, Vanguard Financial
Center, P.O. Box 2600, Valley Forge, PA 19482.

WEB SITES OFFER ANALYSTS` REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without question, a handful of high-power analysts have the
ability to move markets. When the financial beau monde say a stock
is about to jump, Wall Street just wants to know how high.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, for example, Lehman Brothers analyst Dan Niles said
he thought Intel Corp. would earn $3.10 per share this year, up
three pennies from an earlier projection. Shares of the world's
biggest computer chip maker went crazy, gaining more than 8 percent
by the end of the day. Following Intel's lead, the Nasdaq Composite
index gained 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such influence works in both directions, of course, and on more
than a single stock.
</P>
<P>
   In prose only a Fed chairman could love, Goldman Sachs's leading
bull, Abby Joseph Cohen, wrote March 28 that ``the market is not as
undervalued as it was.'' Innocuous though it sounded, Cohen's
comment was the talk of the investing world that day, and the
Nasdaq tumbled 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Headline-grabbing comments, though, tend to be the exception for
the roughly 4,000 Wall Street analysts. More often, they spend
their days poring over corporate and financial minutiae to crank
out reports in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced
that it was investigating ways to force analysts to disclose
conflicts of interest when they talk stocks up or down.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts have long been criticized for refusing to say
anything negative about companies they cover (out of fear they'll
lose coveted access to insiders) and for giving their reports to
high-roller clients days or weeks before turning them over to the
unwashed masses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, critics contend, the real value of analysts' reports is
in the aggregate. Looking at the consensus earnings forecast of two
dozen analysts who follow a company _ and how the group's
collective opinion has changed in recent weeks or months _ might be
more valuable than reading one analyst's comments.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the price is better.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Web sites now offer varying degrees of free access
to databases of analyst predictions. To buy a single analyst report
through the normal channels, on the other hand, would set you back
anywhere from $5 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.bulldogresearch.com is the newest and strangest entry in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last month, the site is built around the concept of
rating analysts based on the accuracy and consistency of their
forecasts. Peripherally, it includes consensus analyst numbers for
such areas as 12-month target price, quarterly and annual earnings,
price-earnings ratio and, of course, buy/sell recommendations (on a
scale of 1, ``strong buy,'' to 5, ``strong sell'').
</P>
<P>
   Using Waltham-based I/B/E/S International for its database of
3,000 analysts from 350 US companies, the site gives first-,
second-, and third-place ``Bulldog Awards'' to analysts whose
recommendations come closest to hitting the mark, both in the
latest quarter and over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at it strictly on the basis of its consensus numbers and
investment tools, Bulldog Research offers less than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing some accountability on analysts is a laudible goal,
though, and makes the site worth a visit. (Firms that haven't
agreed to participate are still included in the rankings, but their
analysts are identified only as ``unattributed.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ www.multexinvestor.com is a clearinghouse for research reports
from the major brokerages, including Credit Suisse First Boston,
Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill
Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reports are for sale, but a couple are always free.
When I asked for information on Microsoft shares, for example, the
site offered up a pair of (no-cost) reports prepared by Multex and
31 (at full cost) from the brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer to read any of
the reports, but it's a free and easy download. And the free
reports do a relatively good job of encapsulating the consensus
estimates in a wide range of areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.thomsoninvest.net uses Boston-based First Call as its data
provider.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, First Call will probably merge with I/B/E/S,
since The Thompson Corp. (parent company of First Call) bought
Primark (parent company of I/B/E/S) on June 5. Whether that will
mean consolidation in the number of sites that provide consensus
estimates remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Thompson Investors Network provides much the
same kind of service as Multex Investor. It offers a ``tip sheet''
that shows a stock's intraday and longer-term performance, along
with consensus estimates on earnings and buy/hold recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   If you want complete reports, which the site offers, it will
cost you. Most other investment tools on the site also require you
to subscribe to the service, which costs $34.95 a year for a basic
membership. (First Call reports are extra.)
</P>
<P>
   _ www.zacks.com gave my Netscape browser the most trouble of the
sites reviewed, but for good reason: It has so many things going
on.
</P>
<P>
   A full-service investment site, Zacks offers portfolio tracking,
charts, news, commentary, e-mail alerts, earnings surprises, an
earnings calendar, and plenty of information on analysts' reports.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to tracking and consolidating those reports, Zacks
is the best of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   After you punch in a ticker symbol, the site lists every analyst
who covers the stock _ not by name, but as either a regional,
national, or institutional broker. For each one, you can review the
quarterly and annual earnings estimates, the five-year growth rate,
the recommendation, and when that analyst's last report was issued.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer, you can skip the detail and head straight for the
consensus numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.stockselector.com is the best of a group of similar sites
that feature oodles of information about analysts' recommendations
and ratings, but not the consensus estimates. Others include
www.financialweb.com and http://investor.cnet.com.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bedrock of our economy: Nine-tenths, 99 cents, 99
dollars
 &HT;    For release June 28, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't buy a precise gallon of gasoline because you haven't
got nine-tenths of a cent. Analysts tell us the average price of a
gallon of gasoline in the past two weeks has risen 4.11 cents to a
nationwide average of $1.7134.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If gasoline prices rise and fall by hundredths or
thousandths of a cent, then how come the pump price never
fluctuates from nine-tenths of a cent? Why is the price of gasoline
never something like 1.71 and three-tenths of a cent, if that's
what the average really is? You can bet it's posted as 1.71 and
nine-tenths of a cent, thereby lifting another six-tenths of a cent
out of your purse.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a U.S. quirk. As an example, in England, a liter of
gas will cost .799 pence; not 8 pence.
</P>
<P>
   What began as mind games has perpetuated itself.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept of nine-tenths of a cent is no different
than what retailers in the clothing industry do: everything ends in
95 up to 99 cents. A shirt never costs $34.25 or $34.00; it's
always $34.99 or $34.95. Its intent: to keep the number from
spilling over to the next highest dollar: $35. The psychology is
that you might balk at paying $35, but $34.99 appears to be a
dollar cheaper _ which, of course, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs play the game as well: The poached salmon goes for
$16.95, not $17. The iced tea is $1.69, not $1.70. Some might argue
that this is saving the consumers a penny every time but we all
know that is not the case. The cost of a glass of iced tea or even
an entree in a restaurant is arbitrary, not market driven. It can
end in any fraction of a dollar, or _ heaven forbid! _ even be
rounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the local office supply store, a package of copying
paper costs $3.19 not $3.20, toner for my laser printer is $39.99
not $40 and the ink cartridges are $23.99 not $24 and certainly not
$23.45 or $23.60.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is advertising its Think Paid Series 1250 at $2,099. Oh,
give me a break!
</P>
<P>
   You want to lease a car? Here are some options in today's local
paper: Jaguar 2000 at $499 a month, Infiniti I30 at $399 a month,
Volvo S70 at $399 a month. Plus tax, of course, which knocks the 99
cents barrier totally out of comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   In Virgin Atlantic Airlines advertisements for London travel
packages, each of the eight options ended in nine dollars.
Continental will take you on a package to Puerto Rico for $479; to
Bermuda for $589; to Mexico for $599; to Israel for $1,579 --
always it ends in ``9.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the psychology of marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is subliminal. Mark it $399 so it won't appear to be
$400; mark it 99 cents so it won't appear to be a dollar, 79 cents
so it won't appear to be 80 cents. I wish I had saved my last super
market register tape to see what percentage of the items I
purchased ended in 99 cents. Probably most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Question: when you pass a gas station and see the posted price
of $1.71 and nine-tenths of a cent, does your mind tell you that
gallon of gas costs $1.72, or does it tell you $1.71?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I'm unique in seeing it at the lower price, until
my mind clicks up a notch and says it's really $1.72. It has only
been recently that I have managed to conquer this subliminal
brainwash.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are running out of pennies -- and never had tenths of
a cent (called mills) at all. Interestingly, many restaurants (and
some convenience stores) now keep a little container near their
cash registers where you may help yourself to, or leave, a penny or
two when paying for your purchase.
</P>
<P>
   That proves how petty is the penny; it's a throwaway coin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, retailers continue to play the penny game on their price
tags and gasoline stations (and dealers) continue to manufacture
that nine-tenths of a cent vigorish at the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody seems to want to do anything about it.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Death penalty, gay rights have America talking
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two matters that had seemed among the Great Immutables of
American life are showing distinct signs of wobble. It is unclear
where the startlingly sudden conversation about the death penalty
is headed, but the drift in what is loosely called gay rights seems
fairly clear. The surprise there is that the momentum is
accumulating so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine of the largest 500 companies now offer, or have said
they will soon, spouse-like benefits to the same-sex partners of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   That, as social change goes, is almost whiplash speed,
considering that the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which tracks such
matters, counts the big breakthrough as occurring just nine years
ago with Lotus, the software company.
</P>
<P>
   The process leaped ahead recently with the announcement that the
United Auto Workers union and the Big Three carmakers have agreed
to same-sex partner benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to figure that an even bigger step was taken just
days later when the Coca-Cola company of Atlanta made a similar
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is seen as almost the archetypal southern company, though
not altogether fairly. It has been a sophisticated international
corporation for years, its vestigial southern drawls richly salted
with a polyglot of accents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, totemistically and really, it does represent its region,
one that is widely counted the nation's most socially conservative
_ again a bit unfairly but, frankly, in this instance, fairly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the belle of southern commerce, at the very locus of the
Bible Belt, adopts benefit equity for gay households, it seems a
fair guess the decade will end with few of those 500 biggest
corporations still holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   For decades even to bring up capital punishment was considered
socially gauche and politically suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, support has slipped from well over 70 percent to just over
60 and even many in that majority are having doubts. The striking
drop in serious crime has cleared space for dialogue and DNA
technology has forced the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   So many on death rows have been cleared by that and other means
that the Republican governor of Illinois has called a moratorium on
executions, something the American Bar Association has been urging
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Bills in Congress would require even post-appeal DNA testing if
that becomes possible and would let juries be told that life
without parole is among the sentence options. Any reforms, to be at
all conscionable, must include a universal, skilled public-defender
system. The court-appointed attorney racket in Texas most
notoriously and in many other states is farcical and fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best reforms would leave the ultimate -- and, lest we
forget, our only irreversible _ sanction tilted against the poor
and the socially and emotionally marginal. Still, let not the
perfect bar the good.
</P>
<P>
   Little connects these two matters, except this: a welcome
reminder that the innate American sense of fair play can still kick
in when we aren't distracted from it. We've been too long
distracted.

<P>
   Q: I would like to send a letter to former Lady Longhorn
basketball star Edwina Brown, who is currently playing in the WNBA
with the Detroit Shock, but I have been unable to locate an address
for the team. Could you provide an address for the Detroit Shock
organization?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Selected third in the 2000 WNBA draft, Brown is enjoying her
stint with the Shock, scoring nine points in the team's opening
game this season. Write to her at 2 Championship Drive, Auburn
Hills, Mich. 48326.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a relative who is going crazy because she can't find
out who sang the song on ``Providence'' when Syd was coming out of
her coma just as the show was ending.

<P>
   A: Do not use paper towels or tissue, which may scratch the
surface, or silver dips, which remove a bit of the silver along
with the tarnish, advises Rewards owner Claudia Stromberg. What
does this purveyor of silver jewelry recommend? Storing silver
jewelry in Pacific cloth and cleaning it with a soft cloth
containing a little polish. Want to try it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we find the bags to make sandbags out of? We want
to be prepared in case of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane Roberts
</P>
<P>
   A: This spurt of rain really has you worried. Sandbags divert
water but are not designed to seal out all water. Fill them about
half full and stack with the folded top face down. If exposed to
the elements for several months, a sandbag will deteriorate. Order
100 bags for $26 plus shipping from the Sacramento Bag Co. at (800)
287-BAGS. Burlap bags for sand are also available, but at twice the
cost. Sand is preferable, but sandbags work with most any kind of
top soil.

out.

   Q: During the NHL finals, my brother and I placed a wager
regarding the Stanley Cup. He thinks they add a section to the Cup
as the years go by; thus, the trophy continues to grow. I think the
NHL has used several different Cups _ once one trophy is filled to
capacity, they purchase another trophy and begin to engrave the
players' names onto it. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   _ Traci Cuellar
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither one of you. The original Stanley Cup Trophy (really a
bowl) is the oldest trophy for which professional athletes in North
America vie. It is named for Frederick Allen Lord Stanley of
Preston and is on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.
The current Stanley Cup, weighing in at 36 pounds and standing 35
1/4 inches high, adds and retires rings as necessary, says NHL
historian John Halligan. How else could the names of all those
players and teams fit? Now, a moment of silence for the Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm decorating a '60s/'70s room. Do you know where I can find
an old artifact called a color box? It hooks up to your stereo and

 &HT;    Fast, furious fun with ``Street Fighter''
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of gamers _ those who still love ``Street
Fighter,'' and those who have long abandoned it to play more modern
3-D fighting games or who never liked the series in the first
place. For the former, there is Street FighterAlpha 3 ($30 for
Playstation, $50 for Dreamcast; www. capcom.com), a jam-packed game
with 33 characters from all the original games, including your old
favorites Chun Li, Ken and Ryu. Both games are extremely playable
old-school fighters. Advantage goes to the Playstation version for
game control (nothing short of an arcade stick beats Sony's Dual
Shock controller), but the Sega Dreamcast version lets you download
and unlock characters, choose character development modes and use
up to three players in a two-on-one match. Whichever version is
chosen, the game, like most of the Street Fighter titles, is fast,
furious action in 2-D cartoon style. Invite some friends over and
start a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Banging one's head against a brick wall and then using the
scattered chunks of mortar to file one's teeth without anaesthetic
is about as much fun as installing Microprose's Gunship! ($50; www.
hasbro-inter-active.com; for Windows). Third in a venerable series
of helicopter sims, the glitchy, buggy, prone-to-freeze Gunship
makes an effort to appeal to action fans and forgoes its roots
entirely. Variable complexity and options ranging from improbably
``realistic'' to aggressively exaggerated effects merely make this
game a gloriously graphic blow'em-up festival, not an aficionado's
technically immersive simulator. Gunship! is a lot of fun when it
is up and running, but getting there is half the problem _ the
other half being the fact that arcade-style flying firefight games
are a dime a dozen.

 &HT;    AOL's instant messaging can mangle one's privacy
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When does instant messaging stop being a useful tool
for keeping up with your online pals and become one big pain in the
neck _ or even an invasion of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   With so much discussion of privacy on the Net and the potential
of e-commerce sites to take our credit card numbers and pass them
out to every con artist from here to Singapore, the fact that
almost all of America Online's 25 million members can find out if
you're online and send you all kinds of messages for all kinds of
things should be equally disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a user logs on to AOL, he or she sees a Buddy List in
the right-hand corner of the screen. Users set up these lists so
they'll know when their friends, family and co-workers are online.
That way you can send them instant messages, real-time notes that
pop up on the left side of your screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is very popular with teenagers who love
chatting online with their friends, and in many households it has
replaced the telephone as the teen communication method of choice.
Teens can talk to each other via ``IMs'' or invite all their
friends to a chat room for a virtual gab session. It's also handy
for companies with far-flung employees to message each other or
hold impromptu meetings when employees are online but not
necessarily in the same city or even the same state.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who have IM chats with faraway relatives for
hours and rave about the joys of real-time contact with loved ones
that would cost a small fortune if they used the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages and real-time chat have always been the
``secret sauce'' that separates AOL from other online services,
some of which no longer exist. The minute you log on to AOL, you
most likely will get a perky message telling you that ``you've got
mail'' and, even better, a look at all the people you know who are
online right there with you.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the knee-jerk reaction to seeing that a friend or
colleague is online is to send him or her a chirpy note to say
hello. Just because your friends are online, however, doesn't
necessarily mean they want to talk to you. There's a story that
Charles DeGaulle, the late president of France, had a telephone in
his home that did not accept incoming calls. He reasoned that just
because people wanted to talk to him, it didn't necessarily follow
that he wanted to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Apply this to the concept of the instant message. Your best
friend may be online, but he or she may be busy talking with
someone else or engaged in some online task, lacking the time to
trade hellos with you.
</P>
<P>
   I send few, if any, IMs these days, and let me tell you why. A
friend of mine tells an embarrassing story about being online with
her boss and a co-worker doing research for a project when her
boyfriend sent her an IM that, from what I understand, isn't the
kind of thing you need your boss to see and probably violated at
least six points of AOL's infamous terms of service. She was
mortified and closed the window as soon as she could, but it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Another less dramatic story is the time I came to work one day
to be greeted by a co-worker who said, ``Boy, you were online for a
long time last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I was online for a long time, doing a variety of things,
some work-related, some not. But what really bothered me was that
the co-worker _ not an especially close friend _ had added me to
his buddy list and knew I was online every time he was online. It
felt like an invasion of privacy and of my right to spend as much
time as I want on the Backstreets Web site reading articles about
Bruce Springsteen, without the whole world _ or just one annoying
colleague _ watching.
</P>
<P>
   Several of my friends lend their screen names to family members,
who are often bewildered by the range of people and messages that
pop up while they're using AOL. I once sent a very chatty, personal
message to a friend and after a while I got a short one-line reply:
``This isn't Linda. This is her mother.'' Oops.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you are tempted to dash off a quick note to
someone, remember that it might not be your buddy you are
messaging. As the old saying goes: ``On the Internet, no one knows
if you're a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you've logged on and discovered all your friends
are online, try to resist the urge to send them an IM. Give your
friends a little space and fight the urge to watch them by closing
the Buddy List ``peephole'' when it pops up. You can also go to the
Buddy List preferences and select how public you want your online
presence to be. I found that button right after my workplace
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that buddy lists can't be a fun way to keep
up with your friends and family, but remember, even if it's
somebody you know, you're still being watched, and you can _ and
sometimes should _ control who knows when you're online.

 &HT;    A rough and tumble radio
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As much a contractor's job site radio as a
gadget for the home, the DeWalt Radio/Charger ($130;
www.dewalt.com) is sure to make Dad the Home Handyman feel like a
pro as he putzes around the house. Extremely durable and encased in
a rough and tumble cage, the DW911 is not just an
industrial-strength radio (complete with audio inputs for CD
players and the like), it's also a battery charger for 9.6-volt
through 18-volt DeWalt rechargeables that make all those must-have
DeWalt cordless tools go. The unit boasts a ludicrously speedy
one-hour recharge time, which effectively eliminates at least one
excuse for that backyard project delay. Also, the radio will run on
one of those rechargeable batteries just in case there's no AC
nearby. Get to work, Dad.

   TV AND DVD IN ONE
</P>
<P>
   The best part about entry-level products: A friendly price often
offsets the uncertainty factor. Enter Konka's TD138U ($349; www.
konkausa.com), a 13-inch color TV with a built-in DVD player and
full remote control. Suited to the college dorm, the guest room or
the cottage, this novel unit offers a compact taste of video
viewing in the digital age. Naturally unable to compete with
separate, high-end components of similar ilk, the TD138U's
combination feature is one of its stronger assets. More
importantly, picture and sound quality offered by even a
middling-caliber DVD player is still notably better than that of
VHS standards, a fact well illustrated on the sharp, clear screen
and diminutive stereo speakers. The TD138U also contains most of
the features associated with DVD, including malleable screen ratios
for widescreen viewing or the unabashedly hacked ``formatted for
TV'' look. There are also language and subtitle options, AC3
output, etc. The TV itself comes complete with modern conveniences
such as a sleep timer, trilingual on-screen menu displays, close
captioning and audio/video inputs for VHS tape players or video

 &HT;    Creating an umlaut easy
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me how to type an umlaut?
</P>
<P>
   _ Horst Kuehne, Elyria, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: First, let's explain what an umlaut is. It's used in Asian
and European languages that are written in the Roman alphabet. An
umlaut appears over a vowel to indicate a vowel change. The
characters would look like this: , I, O, E, A.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ha, looks like a bunch of funny-looking smiley faces to
me. Just kidding. Creating an umlaut is easy whether you are using
a Mac or PC. On the PC, open the Character Map (depending on
whether you are using Windows 95 or 98, it's either in Accessories
or Systems Tools). Locate the vowel with the umlaut accent and
click it. Click Select, then Copy. Go to your document and paste in
the character where you want it to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On the Mac, use your Keycaps application. It is usually
located in your Apple Menu Items pull-down menu. If you hold down
the Option key, you will see the umlaut character. Click it. You'll
then be able to select the correct vowel. Copy and paste it into
your document.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   What would cause a computer clock to suddenly show one hour
earlier? I put my PC on standby last night, and today, the time was
an hour earlier than yesterday. I got this computer in November
'99. Last year, my computer at work did the same thing. Whenever I
fixed the time, it would always go back an hour. I gave up. I later
left the company, so I don't know if it was ever resolved. Strange
that it happened again. Please solve the mystery!
</P>
<P>
   _ Ron Dombcik, Aurora, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I was bitten by something similar awhile back. Do you
think there's a possibility that a change was made inadvertently to
your daylight saving time and/or time zone settings?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's definitely worth checking. To get to the Date/Time
Control Panel, click on the Start button, scroll up to Settings and
over to Control Panels. If you're using Win95, click the Time Zone
tab and see if ``automatically adjust clock for daylight saving
changes'' is selected.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Although your computer is fairly new, you might look into
the possibility that your system battery is malfunctioning if the
problem persists. The issues could mean the battery is losing juice
and needs to be replaced. That could be quite simple or extremely
tricky, depending on the computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Some batteries are removable; some are soldered to the
motherboard. You could look for a computer shop, or if you're up
for doing a battery install, go to hardwarecentral.com and click on
the Tutorials link for a how-to.

 &HT;    E-mail service dishes out pearls to make you appear cultured
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Dear Jack,'' the e-mail press release begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``How great would it feel to be surrounded by a group of
intellectual people and impress them with a magnificent fact about
Mozart?''
</P>
<P>
   The mind reels, then conjures a scene at a cocktail party.
Dressed as usual in rumpled sports shirt, patched twill pants and
sock-eating shoes, I casually join a group in evening wear. It's
clear they're already impressed; they're just trying to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's obvious to me,'' a lady in a black dress is saying.
``That particular verse refers to the Beatles in Shea Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' muses a guy in a cummerbund, ``but what do all
those football references mean? I've listened to `American Pie' 200
times, and I've consulted every source I can find, and I still
don't have a handle on that.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, time to drop the bomb on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I say, cunningly catching their intention. ``Didja know
that Mozart once fainted dead away when he heard an off-key
trumpet? Magnificent, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' sighs black dress. She drifts away. Cummerbund
follows. I'm left with a sharp-faced girl in a black pantsuit and
rimless glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got that from Zooba, didn't you?'' she sneers. ``H.C. Robbins
Landon says that little trumpet story is almost certainly
apocryphal. Who let you in here, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Zooba (www.zooba.com), according to my breathless ``Dear Jack''
e-mail, ``is the revolutionary link to being a smarter, more
cultured person. It's the online destination when you want to know
more about a particular subject, but you don't have the time to sit
and read a book. Once you become a member of Zooba, it creates and
delivers personalized e-mails, containing rich content based on the
topics that you choose. ... It's a great way to brush up on any
subject and to appear worldly.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that anyone who doesn't have time to sit and read a
book could still find time to read one standing up, or is probably
so busy making wheelbarrows full of money that he could afford to
hire a lackey to follow him around, reading a book aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly is easy to do, anyway. I used to do worldly pretty well,
back when I smoked. Worldly people always smoke. French cigarettes
are best, or Picayunes. Do they still make Picayunes? Probably not
since they invented marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Any rate, all you do is put on a trench coat and sit around with
a sullen look and a lit cigarette hanging out of the corner of your
mouth. It takes some practice not to let the smoke make your eye
water, unless you're doing brokenhearted worldly.
</P>
<P>
   And keep your mouth shut. The minute you start blabbering
magnificent facts, you're revealed for what you are _ an unworldly
geek who subscribes to Zooba.
</P>
<P>
   Zooba's press release concludes with this grand aphorism:
</P>
<P>
   ``NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, YOU CAN ALWAYS BE SMARTER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got that right, baby,'' I muttered as I hit the delete
key.

 &HT;    Upon further review, merits of MP3 become obvious
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Driving to work, I often make mental lists of all my
mistakes. I could drive to Oregon and back and still not get bored.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the time, at 23, when I bought a $29.95
wig at J.C. Penney with the conviction it would forever change my
life. It did. I looked so weird _ very much like I was wearing a
dead possum _ that I had to move from my native Arkansas in shame.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't done much better with my high-tech predictions.
</P>
<P>
   There was my fearless pronouncement, years ago, that AOL would
soon bite the dust. AOL not only stayed around, it's the world's
largest ISP. Then there was the column in which I explained in
great and logical detail how the telephone companies such as AT&AMP;T
would soon dominate the ISP business. As usual, I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The real experts don't do much better. When I was a kid, Popular
Science put a Buick with wings on its cover, explaining we'd all be
flying to work before long in cars with fold-down wings. Anyone who
tells you he can see the future of technology is either a
multibillionaire or a liar or has to fold down his angel wings to
sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't feel too bad telling you I was mistaken when I said
MP3 _ that's the technology that lets you download music right from
the Internet in highly compressed data files _ had the same
prospects for mass success as a polka band.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I was sincere, logical and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of my problems is that I learn best by actually using a
technology on a daily basis. While I had messed with MP3 enough to
know how it works, I didn't spend enough time with it.
</P>
<P>
   I got that chance thanks to my car. It's an aging 1991 Nissan
300ZX that is falling apart at the same pace as its owner. The car
stereo developed a high-pitched squeal that sounded expensive. So I
decided to try MP3 again.
</P>
<P>
   Since I didn't particularly want to search the Internet for
music and download it, I began converting some of my favorite music
to MP3. The software that comes with the MP3 player makes that
easy. You just put a regular music CD in the CD drive of your
computer, and the software converts it to an MP3 file and stores it
in a music library on your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, I started to understand some stuff I had missed
about MP3. My favorite songs and albums were now on my hard disk.
And the software automatically filled in the names of the artists
and the album name. So, unlike using my CD player at home, I could
search the hard disk for just the kind of music I wanted and
assemble custom playlists easily just by pointing and clicking. I
could assemble playlists that suited my taste, skipping songs that
I didn't like, mixing artists at will.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I transferred the first tunes to my MP3 player
(about the size of a package of cigarettes), I was using the
computer's sound system to listen to my own custom mixes of music
while I typed away at the Great American Novel. It is very much
like owning your own FM radio station and being able to pick the
programming you want, mixing in Cole Porter with Chuck Berry to
suit your own whim.
</P>
<P>
   Then, encouraged by all that, I transferred an hour's worth of
music to the tiny player. That's easy, too. The player comes with a
docking station that attaches to the parallel port of my computer
(the same connection used by the printer). I simply click to select
the tunes I want to transfer, and then _ in a few minutes _ they
are recorded by the MP3 player. The sound quality is terrific.
According to the specs, it isn't as high a quality as that from the
CD player, but I don't hear the difference. And I sure enjoy the
freedom of being my own musical programmer.
</P>
<P>
   That means I can vary the playlist for my morning's drive easily
and quickly. If I want to take the player along on a jog, it's easy
to add music suitable for running _ something with enough oomph to
make me forget I have middle-aged knees.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you have a high-speed connection to the Internet,
chances are your computer is being attacked daily.
</P>
<P>
   A novice hacker, with some basic networking knowledge, could
easily capture all of your Internet activity, including e-mails and
most log-ons and passwords. Even a neighbor, armed with mild
curiosity, could peek at every file on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Users can block most attacks by using firewalls and configuring
their systems correctly, but some of the attacks are invisible,
said Lincoln David Stein, author of ``Web Security: A Step by Step
Reference Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on your (Internet provider) doing it right,''
he said. ``And people who don't protect themselves could be
wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not a theoretical problem. The FBI's nine-person
computer crime squad in Atlanta receives several complaints a week
from high-speed Internet customers who believe they have been
victimized by hackers, supervisory special agent David Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (consumers) don't realize the importance of
firewalls,'' said Ford, who heads the squad. ``Many people do
online banking. ... They have financial data, personal letters and
graphics files that they wouldn't want to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers of high-speed Internet access say they are gradually
upgrading equipment to fix many of the security problems. In the
meantime, however, your system could be a theme park ride for
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, computer programmer David Green wanted to see how
easily his cable company's Internet traffic could be intercepted.
He ran a packet-sniffing program designed to capture data being
transmitted from any computer connected to his cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   All Internet information undergoes a transformation as it
travels around the electronic universe. It is broken into packets _
small bundles of data _ before being transferred and then
reassembled when it is received. After the packets leave a
computer, however, they can be silently captured and viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Completely invisible to the other users, Green was able to make
a copy of virtually all the Internet traffic over the system. In
one hour, the software collected 20 megabytes of information,
including Web pages, e-mails and dozens of log-ons and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   By configuring the software to search for one Internet address,
he could have viewed everything a specific person was sending and
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could easily get into a person's e-mail, read it ... and
the person would never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those packets could also include information about logging on to
employers' computers and other password-restricted Internet sites
that allow access to remote computers, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Green said, encrypted Web sites _ including banking
and retail sites _ are safe from having passwords stolen from
packets. However, since many people use the same passwords for
everything, those sites could be vulnerable, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green, speaking of his activities, said: ``Am I going to get in
trouble for this? I don't see why, the cable company is the one
pouring this into my network cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said his five computers were attacked recently when
someone scanned his machines for a specific security hole.
</P>
<P>
   His firewall blocked the attack, and he tracked down the owner
of the Internet address where the attack came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had broken into his system and was using it to attack
other machines,'' he said. ``Once (the hacker) got on, he
downloaded his (port) scanning software to this guy's machine and
used it to gain access to other machines,'' masking his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Flatt, director of broadband technology for CCS
Technologies in Norcross, said the growth of small-business and
home computer networks has increased the vulnerability
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he visited a home to inspect a home network and
illustrate some of the security holes in other computers connected
to Charter Communications' cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   He plugged his laptop into the network and in 15 minutes was
able to download and install a program capable of scanning other
computers connected to Charter's network.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt said cable modem and digital subscriber line users are
particularly vulnerable to such probes because they often use an
Internet number, or IP address, that never changes. In addition,
hackers can narrow their search because the addresses are made up
of a string of four numbers, separated by periods, that are in a
relatively close range.
</P>
<P>
   After five minutes of searching potential IP addresses, the
program found 97 cable company customers' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, about 20 commercial and residential computers were
running software that permitted some level of anonymous access to
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you most of these guys have no idea what they are
running,'' CCS Technologies' Tim Sunde said.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on a few computers that reported running Windows NT
or 2000, which come with software that enables the computer to
deliver Web pages and other remote access.
</P>
<P>
   He typed in the IP address into his Web browser, and the Windows
default Web page popped on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even know what they are running,'' Sunde concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He then used another protocol and was able to log on to several
computers anonymously, free to upload and download at will.
</P>
<P>
   Given such access, it would be possible Network icon on their
PC's Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's harmless because the computer's hard drives are
not accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most users don't know how to set up a network correctly,''
he said. ``These are direct connections to the Internet, with all
the disadvantages and advantages of a direct connection. And if you
don't set it up correctly, you leave yourself wide open to anyone.
They can virtually take control of you entire machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is to allow a hard drive to be shared across the
network. Sometimes, Flatt said, new computers are delivered with
that feature turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded when residential users install small
networks in their home, allowing families with more than one
computer to share each other's files and printers as well as one
high-speed Internet connection, Flatt said.
</P>
<P>
   If that network is incorrectly configured, or is not
password-protected, other cable modem customers could have complete
access to the family's network.

 &HT;    Fast, furious fun with ``Street Fighter''
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of gamers _ those who still love ``Street
Fighter,'' and those who have long abandoned it to play more modern
3-D fighting games or who never liked the series in the first
place. For the former, there is Street FighterAlpha 3 ($30 for
Playstation, $50 for Dreamcast; www. capcom.com), a jam-packed game
with 33 characters from all the original games, including your old
favorites Chun Li, Ken and Ryu. Both games are extremely playable
old-school fighters. Advantage goes to the Playstation version for
game control (nothing short of an arcade stick beats Sony's Dual
Shock controller), but the Sega Dreamcast version lets you download
and unlock characters, choose character development modes and use
up to three players in a two-on-one match. Whichever version is
chosen, the game, like most of the Street Fighter titles, is fast,
furious action in 2-D cartoon style. Invite some friends over and
start a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Banging one's head against a brick wall and then using the
scattered chunks of mortar to file one's teeth without anaesthetic
is about as much fun as installing Microprose's Gunship! ($50; www.
hasbro-inter-active.com; for Windows). Third in a venerable series
of helicopter sims, the glitchy, buggy, prone-to-freeze Gunship
makes an effort to appeal to action fans and forgoes its roots
entirely. Variable complexity and options ranging from improbably
``realistic'' to aggressively exaggerated effects merely make this
game a gloriously graphic blow'em-up festival, not an aficionado's
technically immersive simulator. Gunship! is a lot of fun when it
is up and running, but getting there is half the problem _ the
other half being the fact that arcade-style flying firefight games
are a dime a dozen.

   Designed with sporting events, nature loving and people watching
in mind, Carson Optical's X-Scope ($23; www.carson-optical.com) is
a multi-purpose ``optical pocket tool'' for all your see-the-sights
needs. Its diminutive stature belies its six-function versatility
as a 30x power microscope (bug watcher), a 6x telescope (people
watcher) and a 3x foldout magnifier (up close and personal people
watcher). The X-scope also includes a wee flashlight, a signal
whistle, and directional compass. Not just a cheap novelty item,
the X-Scope's lenses are all glass, which ensures consistently
sharp, clear viewing with the passage of time. Two AAA batteries
not included.

<P>
   Makeup Mindy ($20; www.eToys. com) Hasbro has developed one heck
of a cool product that will have your little girl playing out her
own salon scene. Don't worry, this makeup is mess-free; after
chilling Mindy's beauty accessories (beauty mask and makeup
applicator) in the freezer for a couple of hours you can use them
to apply eye shadow, blush, nail polish and lipstick. Mindy also
comes with a hair dryer that blows cold air and changes her hair
color from her natural shade to bright pink and purple. Recommended
age, three and up. The blow dryer requires two AA batteries.

<P>
   Disney's Dinosaur Activity Center ($30;
www.disneyinteractive.com; for Windows and Mac) is everything ``I
See Sue'' isn't . . . that's the good news and the bad news.
Whereas ``Sue'' is a clunker built around a real creature,
``Dinosaur'' is a fantastic, personality-filled CD-ROM based on
those fictional, Disnified creatures-with-human-faces from the hit
movie of the same name. Of the three great arcade and logic
strategy games here (not including the silly Lemur Love Match),
Colossal Fossil Face Off is the best. It's a simplified chess-type
game of dino vs. dino, where each player's beasts have their own
special moves. The object is to discover which of your opponent's
creatures is hiding the dinosaur egg. There's a fun dinosaur puzzle
maker, which lets kids mix and match dino parts and record their
own voice-over roars, and, with an Internet connection, the
dinosaur creations can be e-mailed to friends. Children won't learn
much about real dinosaurs here, but they won't be bored to tears
after five minutes and they'll pick up some logic and strategy
skills along the way. (Ages 5 and up).

 &HT;    AOL's instant messaging can mangle one's privacy
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When does instant messaging stop being a useful tool
for keeping up with your online pals and become one big pain in the
neck _ or even an invasion of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   With so much discussion of privacy on the Net and the potential
of e-commerce sites to take our credit card numbers and pass them
out to every con artist from here to Singapore, the fact that
almost all of America Online's 25 million members can find out if
you're online and send you all kinds of messages for all kinds of
things should be equally disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a user logs on to AOL, he or she sees a Buddy List in
the right-hand corner of the screen. Users set up these lists so
they'll know when their friends, family and co-workers are online.
That way you can send them instant messages, real-time notes that
pop up on the left side of your screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is very popular with teenagers who love
chatting online with their friends, and in many households it has
replaced the telephone as the teen communication method of choice.
Teens can talk to each other via ``IMs'' or invite all their
friends to a chat room for a virtual gab session. It's also handy
for companies with far-flung employees to message each other or
hold impromptu meetings when employees are online but not
necessarily in the same city or even the same state.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who have IM chats with faraway relatives for
hours and rave about the joys of real-time contact with loved ones
that would cost a small fortune if they used the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages and real-time chat have always been the
``secret sauce'' that separates AOL from other online services,
some of which no longer exist. The minute you log on to AOL, you
most likely will get a perky message telling you that ``you've got
mail'' and, even better, a look at all the people you know who are
online right there with you.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the knee-jerk reaction to seeing that a friend or
colleague is online is to send him or her a chirpy note to say
hello. Just because your friends are online, however, doesn't
necessarily mean they want to talk to you. There's a story that
Charles DeGaulle, the late president of France, had a telephone in
his home that did not accept incoming calls. He reasoned that just
because people wanted to talk to him, it didn't necessarily follow
that he wanted to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Apply this to the concept of the instant message. Your best
friend may be online, but he or she may be busy talking with
someone else or engaged in some online task, lacking the time to
trade hellos with you.
</P>
<P>
   I send few, if any, IMs these days, and let me tell you why. A
friend of mine tells an embarrassing story about being online with
her boss and a co-worker doing research for a project when her
boyfriend sent her an IM that, from what I understand, isn't the
kind of thing you need your boss to see and probably violated at
least six points of AOL's infamous terms of service. She was
mortified and closed the window as soon as she could, but it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Another less dramatic story is the time I came to work one day
to be greeted by a co-worker who said, ``Boy, you were online for a
long time last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I was online for a long time, doing a variety of things,
some work-related, some not. But what really bothered me was that
the co-worker _ not an especially close friend _ had added me to
his buddy list and knew I was online every time he was online. It
felt like an invasion of privacy and of my right to spend as much
time as I want on the Backstreets Web site reading articles about
Bruce Springsteen, without the whole world _ or just one annoying
colleague _ watching.
</P>
<P>
   Several of my friends lend their screen names to family members,
who are often bewildered by the range of people and messages that
pop up while they're using AOL. I once sent a very chatty, personal
message to a friend and after a while I got a short one-line reply:
``This isn't Linda. This is her mother.'' Oops.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you are tempted to dash off a quick note to
someone, remember that it might not be your buddy you are
messaging. As the old saying goes: ``On the Internet, no one knows
if you're a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you've logged on and discovered all your friends
are online, try to resist the urge to send them an IM. Give your
friends a little space and fight the urge to watch them by closing
the Buddy List ``peephole'' when it pops up. You can also go to the
Buddy List preferences and select how public you wat your online
presence to be. I found that button right after my workplace
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that buddy lists can't be a fun way to keep
up with your friends and family, but remember, even if it's
somebody you know, you're still being watched, and you can _ and
sometimes should _ control who knows when you're online.

 &HT;    Fast, furious fun with ``Street Fighter''
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of gamers _ those who still love ``Street
Fighter,'' and those who have long abandoned it to play more modern
3-D fighting games or who never liked the series in the first
place. For the former, there is Street FighterAlpha 3 ($30 for
Playstation, $50 for Dreamcast; www. capcom.com), a jam-packed game
with 33 characters from all the original games, including your old
favorites Chun Li, Ken and Ryu. Both games are extremely playable
old-school fighters. Advantage goes to the Playstation version for
game control (nothing short of an arcade stick beats Sony's Dual
Shock controller), but the Sega Dreamcast version lets you download
and unlock characters, choose character development modes and use
up to three players in a two-on-one match. Whichever version is
chosen, the game, like most of the Street Fighter titles, is fast,
furious action in 2-D cartoon style. Invite some friends over and
start a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Banging one's head against a brick wall and then using the
scattered chunks of mortar to file one's teeth without anaesthetic
is about as much fun as installing Microprose's Gunship! ($50; www.
hasbro-inter-active.com; for Windows). Third in a venerable series
of helicopter sims, the glitchy, buggy, prone-to-freeze Gunship
makes an effort to appeal to action fans and forgoes its roots
entirely. Variable complexity and options ranging from improbably
``realistic'' to aggressively exaggerated effects merely make this
game a gloriously graphic blow'em-up festival, not an aficionado's
technically immersive simulator. Gunship! is a lot of fun when it
is up and running, but getting there is half the problem _ the
other half being the fact that arcade-style flying firefight games

 &HT;    A rough and tumble radio
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As much a contractor's job site radio as a
gadget for the home, the DeWalt Radio/Charger ($130;
www.dewalt.com) is sure to make Dad the Home Handyman feel like a
pro as he putzes around the house. Extremely durable and encased in
a rough and tumble cage, the DW911 is not just an
industrial-strength radio (complete with audio inputs for CD
players and the like), it's also a battery charger for 9.6-volt
through 18-volt DeWalt rechargeables that make all those must-have
DeWalt cordless tools go. The unit boasts a ludicrously speedy
one-hour recharge time, which effectively eliminates at least one
excuse for that backyard project delay. Also, the radio will run on
one of those rechargeable batteries just in case there's no AC
nearby. Get to work, Dad.

   TV AND DVD IN ONE
</P>
<P>
   The best part about entry-level products: A friendly price often
offsets the uncertainty factor. Enter Konka's TD138U ($349; www.
konkausa.com), a 13-inch color TV with a built-in DVD player and
full remote control. Suited to the college dorm, the guest room or
the cottage, this novel unit offers a compact taste of video
viewing in the digital age. Naturally unable to compete with
separate, high-end components of similar ilk, the TD138U's
combination feature is one of its stronger assets. More
importantly, picture and sound quality offered by even a
middling-caliber DVD player is still notably better than that of
VHS standards, a fact well illustrated on the sharp, clear screen
and diminutive stereo speakers. The TD138U also contains most of
the features associated with DVD, including malleable screen ratios
for widescreen viewing or the unabashedly hacked ``formatted for
TV'' look. There are also language and subtitle options, AC3
output, etc. The TV itself comes complete with modern conveniences
such as a sleep timer, trilingual on-screen menu displays, close
captioning and audio/video inputs for VHS tape players or video
game

   ATLANTA _ Driving to work, I often make mental lists of all my
mistakes. I could drive to Oregon and back and still not get bored.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the time, at 23, when I bought a $29.95
wig at J.C. Penney with the conviction it would forever change my
life. It did. I looked so weird _ very much like I was wearing a
dead possum _ that I had to move from my native Arkansas in shame.

   I haven't done much better with my high-tech predictions.

   There was my fearless pronouncement, years ago, that AOL would

 &HT;    Headphones cancel out unwanted noise
 &HT;    By James Cummings

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A type of noise-canceling stereo headphones
introduced last year for American Airline's international premium
passengers now is available to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Cancelling headset from Bose is
designed to block or compensate for background noise so the audio
that reaches the listener's ears will be identical to what he would
hear in a quiet room.
</P>
<P>
   The QuietComfort headset reduces noise both physically and
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The overhead band and arms of the headset are designed to hold
the ear cups over the ears at a natural angle that lets the
listener wear them comfortably for hours. Their padded shell keeps
most noises from reaching the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ear cups, microphones detect any noise that gets
through the outer shell. The headset then compares that sound to
the desired sound produced by an in-flight movie soundtrack,
portable CD player or other source.
</P>
<P>
   If the microphones detect an unwanted sound, the headset
produces a signal ``opposite'' to the noise to cancel it out.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers in jet aircraft typically experience sound levels
from 75 to 85 decibels, and commuter turboprop planes are even
noisier, according to Bose The National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health say workers exposed to 85 decibels all day should
wear ear protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bose said the QuietComfort headset lets passengers reach their
destinations more rested and with less stress. QuietComfort
Acoustic Noise Cancelling headsets sell for $299 and can be ordered
direct from Bose by calling (800) 650-2673 (650-BOSE) or visiting
www.bose.com.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you have a high-speed connection to the Internet,
chances are your computer is being attacked daily.
</P>
<P>
   A novice hacker, with some basic networking knowledge, could
easily capture all of your Internet activity, including e-mails and
most log-ons and passwords. Even a neighbor, armed with mild
curiosity, could peek at every file on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Users can block most attacks by using firewalls and configuring
their systems correctly, but some of the attacks are invisible,
said Lincoln David Stein, author of ``Web Security: A Step by Step
Reference Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on your (Internet provider) doing it right,''
he said. ``And people who don't protect themselves could be
wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not a theoretical problem. The FBI's nine-person
computer crime squad in Atlanta receives several complaints a week
from high-speed Internet customers who believe they have been
victimized by hackers, supervisory special agent David Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (consumers) don't realize the importance of
firewalls,'' said Ford, who heads the squad. ``Many people do
online banking. ... They have financial data, personal letters and
graphics files that they wouldn't want to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers of high-speed Internet access say they are gradually
upgrading equipment to fix many of the security problems. In the
meantime, however, your system could be a theme park ride for
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, computer programmer David Green wanted to see how
easily his cable company's Internet traffic could be intercepted.
He ran a packet-sniffing program designed to capture data being
transmitted from any computer connected to his cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   All Internet information undergoes a transformation as it
travels around the electronic universe. It is broken into packets _
small bundles of data _ before being transferred and then
reassembled when it is received. After the packets leave a
computer, however, they can be silently captured and viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Completely invisible to the other users, Green was able to make
a copy of virtually all the Internet traffic over the system. In
one hour, the software collected 20 megabytes of information,
including Web pages, e-mails and dozens of log-ons and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   By configuring the software to search for one Internet address,
he could have viewed everything a specific person was sending and
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could easily get into a person's e-mail, read it ... and
the person would never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those packets could also include information about logging on to
employers' computers and other password-restricted Internet sites
that allow access to remote computers, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Green said, encrypted Web sites _ including banking
and retail sites _ are safe from having passwords stolen from
packets. However, since many people use the same passwords for
everything, those sites could be vulnerable, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green, speaking of his activities, said: ``Am I going to get in
trouble for this? I don't see why, the cable company is the one
pouring this into my network cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said his five computers were attacked recently when
someone scanned his machines for a specific security hole.
</P>
<P>
   His firewall blocked the attack, and he tracked down the owner
of the Internet address where the attack came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had broken into his system and was using it to attack
other machines,'' he said. ``Once (the hacker) got on, he
downloaded his (port) scanning software to this guy's machine and
used it to gain access to other machines,'' masking his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Flatt, director of broadband technology for CCS
Technologies in Norcross, said the growth of small-business and
home computer networks has increased the vulnerability
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he visited a home to inspect a home network and
illustrate some of the security holes in other computers connected
to Charter Communications' cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   He plugged his laptop into the network and in 15 minutes was
able to download and install a program capable of scanning other
computers connected to Charter's network.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt said cable modem and digital subscriber line users are
particularly vulnerable to such probes because they often use an
Internet number, or IP address, that never changes. In addition,
hackers can narrow their search because the addresses are made up
of a string of four numbers, separated by periods, that are in a
relatively close range.
</P>
<P>
   After five minutes of searching potential IP addresses, the
program found 97 cable company customers' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, about 20 commercial and residential computers were
running software that permitted some level of anonymous access to
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you most of these guys have no idea what they are
running,'' CCS Technologies' Tim Sunde said.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on a few computers that reported running Windows NT
or 2000, which come with software that enables the computer to
deliver Web pages and other remote access.
</P>
<P>
   He typed in the IP address into his Web browser, and the Windows
default Web page popped on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even know what they are running,'' Sunde concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He then used another protocol and was able to log on to several
computers anonymously, free to upload and download at will.
</P>
<P>
   Given such access, it would be possible to plant viruses or
other stealth programs on a computer that could give complete
access to the machine by a hacker.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt doesn't believe sophisticated hackers are that interested
attacking small businesses or home users _ they are too busy
breaking into large corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats, he said, come from novice hackers, often teens,
who are vaguely familiar with computer networking and can download,
as he did, a few network administrative tools from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some invasions, however, may also come from the least
sophisticated computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt said some cable modem customers are able to browse the
hard drives of other computers connected to their system by
clicking on the Neighborhood Network icon on their PC's Windows
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's harmless because the computer's hard drives are
not accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most users don't know how to set up a network correctly,''
he said. ``These are direct connections to the Internet, with all
the disadvantages and advantages of a direct connection. And if you
don't set it up correctly, you leave yourself wide open to anyone.
They can virtually take control of you entire machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is to allow a hard drive to be shared across the
network. Sometimes, Flatt said, new computers are delivered with
that feature turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded when residential users install small
networks in their home, allowing families with more than one
computer to share each other's files and printers as well as one
high-speed Internet connection, Flatt said.
</P>
<P>
   If that network is incorrectly configured, or is not
password-protected, other cable modem customers could have complete
access to the family's network.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if a person knew the IP address of the home network's
primary computer, he or she could even browse that hard drive from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Emmendorfer, a network engineer with St. Louis-based
cable company Charter Communications, said such lapses are the
greatest security threat to all high-speed Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, conveying that message has been left to the cable
modem installer.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, however, his company will give its customers
a guide to network security that would, in part, explain how to
avoid the most common security mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to rigorously educate our customers,''
Emmendorfer promised.

 &HT;    Some of TV's second fiddles shouldn't go solo
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Chester on ``Gunsmoke'' . . . Ethel on ``I Love
Lucy'' . . . Radar on ``MASH'' . . . Mimi on ``Drew Carey'' . . .
Jack on ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   We love 'em, but only in small doses, and there's nothing wrong
with that. Some folks were born to twinkle brilliantly in the
background. We can't all be top stars, although some people insist
on standing front and center when they're better off shining from
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   After a handful of failed attempts to star in his own TV series,
Tony Danza has finally realized his destiny is to be a supporting
player. He's joining CBS's ``Family Law'' this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Danza came to national attention in 1978 as a member of the
stellar ``Taxi'' ensemble and then bounced back in '84 as the
co-lead in ``Who's the Boss.'' But after that, his sitcom pilots
bit the dust on a regular basis. It became a running joke among
critics that at least one network would have a Danza sitcom every
September. And it would be gone by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michael Richards, who leapt to fame as Kramer, the
wild-haired neighbor on ``Seinfeld,'' is starring in a new fall
sitcom on NBC. Most people don't even recognize Richards by his
real name, but just about everyone knows Kramer. NBC is hoping
millions of ``Seinfeld'' fans will follow Richards to his new gig
as a bumbling detective.
</P>
<P>
   But will they? If tradition holds, probably not. Richards has
``supporting player'' written all over his clumsy, lanky frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prediction is that 'The Michael Richards Show' probably
won't survive its freshman season,'' says Mike Greco, vice
president of broadcast research for the ad-buying agency OMD USA in
New York. ``That's based on the pilot and the scheduling. It's in a
really tough time period, opposite 'Millionaire' and 'JAG.' But
besides that, there are some roles that lend themselves better to
supporting characters than lead characters. He's not playing
Kramer, but he sort of is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Richards' show flops, as more than one media analyst has
predicted, maybe the actor will return later in the better-suited
role of co-star. Danza seems happy with his decision, and good for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the actor viewers love in bits but can't take in
bulk; sometimes it's a character that's been too closely aligned
with the actor and bleeds into the next role. It's not impossible
to turn a co-star into a star, but it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be done with the right writing and a good supporting
cast,'' Greco says. ``Star vehicles are always harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As funny as Jack is on ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and Mimi is on ``Drew
Carey,'' entire sitcoms devoted to those or similarly outrageous
characters would be too much of a good thing. Ted Knight, the
hilariously empty-headed anchorman on ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show,'' landed his own sitcom, ``The Ted Knight Show,'' in 1978.
Although he played the head of an escort service and not an
anchorman, viewers saw him as Ted Baxter and were tired of him. He
was canceled in a month.
</P>
<P>
   George Wendt got his own self-titled show after ``Cheers,'' but
it was a quick exit, too. Viewers who loved him as Norm, the chubby
beer swiller who delivered zingers from a Boston bar stool, had no
interest in his new incarnation as half of a radio host duo
dispensing car advice.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to every rule, and ``Frasier'' is ongoing,
brilliant proof that some supporting players can blossom into
full-blown stars. Through most of the decade-long run of
``Cheers,'' the snobby shrink was a minuscule contributor. He'd
swagger in for maybe five minutes a month to receive consolation or
ribbing about his sorry love life, hardly the stuff of a successful
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really skeptical about that one,'' Greco says.
``But the success of 'Frasier' goes beyond Kelsey Grammer. The show
has a terrific supporting cast and terrific writing. It takes a lot
of pieces for a show to succeed, and the actor is just one of those
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   In his spinoff, Grammer went from playing a lonely shrink in
Boston to playing a radio call-in shrink in Seattle who has a
hilarious brother, crusty old father, wacky radio sidekick and
charming English helper. Same character; different surroundings.
Another spinoff of ``MTM'' succeeded for the same reasons. When
``Lou Grant'' arrived, the blustery TV news director had become a
veteran newspaper city editor surrounded by interesting characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is shows make stars; stars don't make shows,''
Greco says. ``What a star does is bring viewers in to sample the
program, cutting through the clutter of the fall schedule. But the
show will live and die on its own merit. People will tune in to see
what 'Michael Richards' is all about, but they won't come back if
they don't like the program. That's why Kelsey Grammer made it and
Shelley Long didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And unless the current revamping of ``The Michael Richards
Show'' is extreme, the former Kramer will be headed for
second-banana status again soon _ not that there's anything wrong
with that.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recent photos of Mars reveal that water may exist near
the surface _ a sign that life could exist on the planet. That
doesn't mean life definitely exists on Earth's neighbor, but
conditions on the planet make it possible, scientists say.
Never-before-seen gullies, trenches and channels appear in 250
photos taken by a special camera on the Mars Global Surveyor.
Scientists examining the images think the trenches and channels may
have been formed by sudden surges of water.

<P>
   The new images may reignite interest in NASA's Mars exploration

   SUMMER OF OUR DISCONTENT
</P>
<P>
   Soaring gasoline prices have fueled calls for a government
investigation into possible price-gouging at pumps in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are high throughout the nation, but states such as
Wisconsin and Illinois have been hit particularly hard. Average
prices in those states top $2 for a gallon of regular gas. The
national average is about $1.64.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices and cleaner-burning gasolines could account
for some, but not all, of the price hikes, President Clinton says.
In some cities hit hardest, a price drop already has begun. Experts
predict price reliefthroughout the nation by the end of summer.

   GORE UNDER FIRE FOR FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official wants to know if Vice President Al
Gore lied about his fund-raising role during the 1996 campaign,
U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad, the head of Justice's campaign finance task
force, has asked the attorney general to appoint a special lawyer
to investigate the matter. The uproar revolves around a 1996 event
at a Buddhist temple that raised $65,000 in illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he didn't know the event was a fund-raiser when he
attended. He said he thought it was a ``community outreach'' event.
</P>
<P>
   P.E. NO LONGER REQUIRED
</P>
<P>
   Georgia middle school students are no longer required by the
state to take 90 hours of physical education and health classes
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the State Board of Education has told local school
districts to decide how much P.E. and health their students should
take. The change comes as part of the governor's school reform law,
which mandates that middle school students get an extra 30 minutes
a day of academic course work beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The P.E. change will take effect this fall.

 &HT;    The key to happiness and fulfillment is in your hands
 &HT;    By Vicki Kabat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Everyone knows children get bored in the
summertime. It's part of what summer is about: free time, few
scheduled activities, letting the mind rest. When you get to middle
age, we call that a vacation and are darned grateful for it.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom in children may be annoying (especially to parents), but
it usually isn't a signal to a bigger problem. In adults, however,
it can be.
</P>
<P>
   In an article titled ``Do You Have the Silent Symptom?'' in a
recent issue of Prevention magazine, writer Linday Mooney cites
research in which 21 percent of Americans say they are regularly
bored. It is described as an ``overwhelming absence of feeling . .
. that can drive us to self-destructive acts.''
</P>
<P>
   If we don't do something about it, the article states, boredom
can manifest itself in depression, pain, illness, even death.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think adults say are the 10 most boring tasks?
According to a national survey by the Boring Institute (hey, that
sounds like a fun place to work), they are opening junk mail,
watching political debates, housework, weeding the garden or lawn,
exercising, dieting, meetings, commuting, laundry and No. 1:
standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO
</P>
<P>
   Well, my mother used to tell me during those long boring summers
on the farm, where your nearest friend lived seven miles away, that
boredom was a choice. I can still hear her: ``It doesn't say much
about your powers of creativity if you decide to be bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you hate it when moms are right? Don't you hate it even
more when you find yourself parroting your mother's advice to your
own children?
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do we choose to be bored? This isn't rocket science,
people. If you're bored, mix something up a bit in your life. Do
something different. Do something a little crazy. Go parasailing or
bungee jumping. When you're free-falling tied to nothing more than
an elastic band, tell me then that you're bored. Sign up for a
class. Redecorate your house. Write a book. Get a new pet. Take
your mind off yourself and volunteer to help others. Read a good
book. Train for a marathon. You get my point.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we choose to be bored because we're lazy. It's much easier
to sit around griping about boredom than to do something about it.
Of course, this is true with any problem we encounter in life. It's
easier to complain about it than to change it. That doesn't make us
very pleasant or effective people, though.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE INITIATIVE NEVER HURT ANYONE
</P>
<P>
   Bored with your responsibilities at work? Think about ways you
can be more productive to the company, write it up in a proposal
and take it to your boss. Don't like the way your church committee
is operating? Focus on the problem the committee is addressing,
outline the pros and cons, identify strengths of individual
committee members and overhaul the process.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend your time around the office water cooler or the
church coffee pot denigrating the process, people or problem . . .
or you can spend your time thinking creatively about solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason we don't choose to make changes is because we
feel it isn't our responsibility. ``Hey, not my problem. I don't
get paid to worry about that. Let somebody else fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   If we're invested enough in a situation to be there, we ought to
bring all our faculties to it. We're all a part of the process. And
if you've invested in something for a long time with sincere effort
and you can't effect change, leave. Life is too short to settle for
less. Go where your gifts will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom is epidemic. Happiness and fulfillment can be, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's your choice.

 &HT;    Floppies fade as files find fresh fields
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ We're turning the car around, I announced
to the tune of squealing tires. I had left a needed floppy disk at
home and had to go back for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A floppy?'' my son asked. ``How 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   And there I was again, being technologically quaint and caught
at it by a teen-ager. Shoot. I felt some small relief he hadn't
said 1889. He might as well have.
</P>
<P>
   As though a perfectly serviceable floppy disk _ carefully marked
``misc. files'' like six others scattered around the house _ was an
artifact fit for a glass case.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect this is an ancient intergenerational tension. ``But
da-a-a-d, people will think we're Hittites or something with that
old bronze spear. Everybody uses the steel now. We'll be the
biggest dorks in the raiding party.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is the age of the Internet, the Web-based virtual hard
drive, the rewriteable CD and teeny little thumb-sized hard drives.
Even Zip discs _ each one can hold a Gibbon's ``Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire,'' a ``Complete Works of Shakespeare,'' the
archives of the Confederate Navy and still have room for a pretty
good solitaire program _ are beginning to seem a little too 1999
for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who try to keep just two steps behind
technology, I knew this day would come.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue came in 1998. I scoffed when Apple Computers
unveiled their classy iMacs. Sleek and small and colorful, but no
place for a floppy-disk. What were they thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Not needed, the Apple folks explained. Smart people move their
files on the Internet and over networks and software comes on CDs.
Need a floppy drive? Like 23-skidoo, man. How Blondie and Dagwood.
How 1989.
</P>
<P>
   I chuckled at this techno-arrogance, but it was a nervous laugh.
The laugh of a man who sensed what was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead was going to be another box in the garage. Next to the one
with $100 worth software on the older five-and-quarter-inch floppy
disks. Next to the box of vinyl phonograph records, warped into the
shape of salad dishes from heat and humidity, but they have such
neat covers.
</P>
<P>
   (The unfairness of life: When my eyes were young and supple, I
lived in a world that had record covers with huge pictures and big
print. Now that I'm old enough to squint at details, CDs come with
album notes smaller than the legal disclaimers on aspirin bottles.)
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready for much more obsolescence at home. Where my kids
react joyously to all that is new and better and cooler, I see only
more perfectly good hardware and software packed in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to face up to it. In my attempt to bridge my home
office with the newsroom, I have changed my ways. No more floppies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this column was, at one point in its processing,
uploaded to a Web site that advertises itself as a free storage
place, a ``virtual hard drive.'' I dumped this column somewhere out
in the Internet ether and downloaded it back at the office.
Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of Web sites that do this _ Driveway.com,
i-drive.com, Xdrive.com, MySpace.com ... . It's very 1999 of me to
think this is new and exciting, but I was thrilled at the idea of a
free locker for my virtual stuff. I haven't the foggiest idea how
they intend to make money.
</P>
<P>
   All very cool, but I will miss the four-and-a-half inch floppy.
It could fit snugly in your front pocket. In 1990 this identified
you as a digital kind of guy. (Which is not as a great a
babe-magnet as it sounds.) And you could nervously flick their
little aluminum spring-loaded doors open and closed with a
satisfying snap while wondering if the system would come up again.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, you could convert promotional disks for your own
data use. Not like today's free CDs. Coasters are the best
alternative use I've found for the CDs America Online hands out. I
don't know if they'd work for skeet shooting and they make poor
Frisbees.
</P>
<P>
   Will our eyes well up some year in the future when we find these
things in attics? Will we look fondly on the simpler days of
unconnected computing? Can't say.
</P>
<P>
   But at least I'll be able to fit them all in a shoe-box when the
time comes. That shouldn't take up much garage space. You can't ask
much more of a technology.

 &HT;    Salt sensitivity more of an issue for specific groups than
individualsBy Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Federal health bureaucrats have long talked about
high blood pressure as though salting food is barely more safe than
sprinkling it with chips of lead paint.
</P>
<P>
   Their single-minded harping on sodium is troubling to people who
research high blood pressure without a political agenda. They worry
that people will figure they can eat as many hot fudge sundaes as
they want as long as the peanuts are unsalted.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is recommending a diet based on the tops of margarita
glasses, and some people should restrict their salt very carefully.
For them, blood pressure goes up and down in concert with their
salt intake. Just as blondes and redheads must be more careful
about the sun than those who can get tan watching the Travel
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It's even true that high salt consumption leads to high blood
pressure as a general rule, which is important news for general
people but of dwindling concern to individuals. Health and medical
research are progressing quickly beyond the crutch of most
one-size-fits-all directives and recognizing that variations in
diets and medications can affect different people quite
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we know about genes and individuals, the more we
understand that not everybody is salt-sensitive,'' says Dr. Suzanne
Oparil, who directs the vascular biology and hypertension program
at the University of Alabama-Birmingham and is one of the world's
leading researchers into salt and high blood pressure. Oparil spoke
at Wright State University's med school last month at about the
same time the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHBLI)
reopened its attack on salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is complicated, and so politicized,'' she says.
Researchers haven't found a gene for salt-sensitivity, but they
have identified groups of the population whose blood pressure is
more likely to respond to salt. They are blacks, the obese and
people older than 45, and the biological explanation appears to be
that they don't excrete sodium as efficiently as others.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Oparil discloses that she receives $3,000 a year
from the Salt Institute for telling it the same thing she tells
anyone else who asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the general population, salt restriction is not a
very wise thing to push,'' she says. ``Although it does help some
people, the general population is not helped all that much. I don't
think most people are all that salt-sensitive, and it's a very
unpleasant kind of diet to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   She is talking about a diet with 1,500 milligrams of sodium a
day, which was one of three amounts in the recent DASH II trial,
named after the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension research
that yielded the DASH diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reducing their dietary sodium to 1,500 milligrams a day,
all Americans, and especially those at high risk for hypertension,
can decrease their chance of developing high blood pressure as they
age,'' says Eva Obarzenek, a Ph.D. nutritionist with the NHBLI.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, says Oparil, is ``Nobody could eat only that on their
own.'' And at the other two measured levels, she says there was
little impact in dropping from 3,300 milligrams to 2,400,
especially for those without high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just that the NHBLI is clinging stubbornly to
old ideas. It is that focusing on salt to control blood pressure
also diverts attention from the more proven techniques of limiting
calories or increasing activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will pick one that they're going to do,'' Oparil says.
``And if they pick the salt restriction, they'll get a very minor
benefit, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, salt scares distract us from more significant
warnings. Contrary to previous beliefs, the top-number systolic
blood pressure is more important than the diastolic as people get
older. The difference between the two numbers might be even more
important. And for people with diabetes or kidney disease, the
upper limits of 140 and 90 drop at least to 135 and 85.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure is a dangerous disease that kills 41,634
Americans and contributes to another 202,000 deaths a year,
according to the American Heart Association. It's increasing in a
society that's ``getting fatter and more sedentary,'' as Oparil
bluntly says, largely because so many jobs involve little exertion
beyond pushing elevator buttons.
</P>
<P>
   We can't afford to forget the most basic precautions of getting
enough activity, keeping our weight down, not smoking and eating
plenty of the fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy in the DASH
diet. ``Rather than focus on one little nutrient,'' Oparil says,
``try to eat a balanced diet.''

 &HT;    Did somebody say rhubarb?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Got any rhubarb?'' Gene is asking Cal as I
pick up my morning cup of decaf and take it to the empty seat
between them. ``I'll trade you lettuce for some rhubarb.'' Cal
squints, nods and smiles. Being a newcomer, Gene thinks this means
he's got himself a deal but that's not it. It means Cal hasn't
heard a word Gene's saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet we've had 50 or 60 messes already, and it keeps
coming on,'' Gene explains. ``How much can you use?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mess a what?'' Cal asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lettuce. How much do you want?'' Gene answers.
</P>
<P>
   Cal cups his ear, and then turns to me. ``What'd he say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know how much lettuce you want?'' I holler at his
good side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any lettuce,'' Cal says. ``Already got more'n we
can eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene looks surprised and asks, ``But what about the rhubarb?''
Cal answers. ``Don't need any thanks. Got more a that than we need,
too. Besides, I don't like it except in pudding.'' Then he looks
around the table and asks in general: ``Anybody need some rhubarb
for pies?''
</P>
<P>
   Gene, looking a little bumfuzzled, says he does.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of non-communication goes on every morning. Cal
doesn't hear very well. Says it's because of all the years he spent
on a noisy tractor. Gene hears a little better, but not much. Don't
know what his excuse is. He had a radio station before he sold it
and retired about a year ago to 10 acres and a row of tomato plants
just outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   About this time Amos walks in, the screen door slapping behind
him, and wraps his fingers around the handle of the cup Robin hands
him as he passes the counter. ``So,'' he asks, ``what're we talking
about this morning?'' Somebody says rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want some?'' Amos looks around for takers. Cal asks some what?
Amos leans over to Cal's good ear and hollers, RHUBARB!
</P>
<P>
   ``Why's everybody trying to give me something?'' Cal wants to
know. ``I got rhubarb and I got lettuce, and I don't particularly
like either one. Who wants some?''
</P>
<P>
   Amos says he doesn't. A couple of other guys say they don't
either. Cal looks at me. I shake my head a no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want some rhubarb,'' Gene says loud and slow. ``My wife is
in a good mood today and says she'll bake me a pie if I can find
some.'' Cal hears that and wisecracks that it must be pretty rare
for Gene's wife to be in a good mood, considering the guy she's
married to. Gene pulls a funny face and lets it go.
</P>
<P>
   Amos asks Gene what kind of rhubarb he wants and Gene says he
didn't know it came in ``kinds.'' Amos brings him up to speed. ``I
got Martha Washington rhubarb. It's been in my yard since my
grandmother planted it when she was new-married.'' Amos is 78.
</P>
<P>
   Cal says his plants are King George and he doesn't know how old
they are except they've been there as long as he can remember. Cal
is 77.
</P>

   Gene says the kind doesn't matter as long as it makes good pie.
He wants to know when's a good time for him to come dig some up.
Amos looks shocked and tells him rhubarb is cut, not dug like
lettuce. Gene's talking again when he should be listening and
hollers WHAT? at Amos who repeats what he just said, only louder.
</P>
<P>
   Cal catches the tail end of it. ``Why the holy heck does
everybody keep talking about lettuce when I'm talking about
rhubarb?''
</P>
<P>
   The confusion is becoming funnier by the minute because each of
them is processing only a portion of what he's hearing, but
everybody keeps on talking anyway. Since it's only rhubarb and
lettuce they're discussing, and not national defense, I stay out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm thinking that at the rate they're going, rhubarb season
is likely to be over before Gene gets his pie.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ ``Got any rhubarb?'' Gene
is asking Cal as I pick up my morning cup of decaf and take it to
the empty seat between them. ``I'll trade you lettuce for some
rhubarb.'' Cal squints, nods and smiles. Being a newcomer, Gene
thinks this means he's got himself a deal but that's not it. It

qualms about his art, including some 600 pieces, being marketed by
a discount retailer. He's just happy the masses are finally being

   VIOLENT-FANS (San Francisco) _ Jerry M. Lewis, professor of
sociology at Kent State University, studies violent behavior by
sports fans, and his material never gets stale. England and Germany
meet in a soccer match in Belgium; hooligans trash a town square.
Lakers win the NBA title; police cars go up in smoke. Lewis
predicted Monday's flareup outside the Staples Center. He has
discovered a formula for crowd combustion, and the Lakers' win in
Game 6 met three of the criteria. By GWEN KNAPP.

   BASEBALL-CARD (San Francisco) _ The legendary Honus Wagner
tobacco card soon will be on the auction block again, and this
time, there's speculation it may become the first baseball card to
top $1 million. EBay, Robert Edward and MastroNet have entered into
a high-stakes partnership on the card, which will be auctioned on
eBay from July 1-15, and on Robert Edward's telephone auction July
15-16. By The San Francisco Examiner.

<P>
   GOLF-TIGER (San Francisco) _ Every journalist who covered the
U.S. Open has heard from friends in the business, ``You must be
running out of things to say about Tiger Woods.'' Well, no. He
doesn't allow that. Fans aren't tired of watching him, as evident
by the record TV ratings of his walk in the Pebble Beach park last
Sunday, and so the media have no cause to tire of writing about
him. By SUSAN FORNOFF.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Michael Bannister lost his leg
in a climbing accident last year. This summer, just six months
later, Bannister is guiding rafting trips on rivers, climbing the
slopes of Mount Shasta, and was hired this month as a wilderness
guide and outfitter. By TOM STIENSTRA.

   FIESTAWARE (Undated) _ Fiestaware, the art deco pottery from the
mid-1930s, became a mainstay in the dish cupboard because of its
soft pastel or bright and bold colors. It is easy to mix and match
this solid-color dishware to create table settings to go with any
decor. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Bill Gates must be a little short on
pocket change, because a new issue of the consumer version of
Windows is on its way, and you have to decide whether to pony up
the bucks for an upgrade. Since an upgrade will cost around $100 _
and since the consumer version of the more robust Windows 2000 is
just around the corner _ chances are many users will take a pass.
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.

<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ Sometimes an employer facing
discrimination complaint can persuade the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance to change the violation to a lesser one. That
usually happens if the facts don't back up what the agency said was
the original violation or if the employer comes in with additional
evidence. Either way, it takes time and resources. By L.M. SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-BEETLE-SHOW (Roswell, N.M.) _ Even though the New Beetle is
different from the original, the first national New Beetle car show
in Roswell, N.M., proved a point: Beetle people like the New Beetle
as much as they did the old one. And there are a lot of young
people who never were around the original Beetle, but who have
become as enamored with the new one as we baby boomers were with
the old. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

<P>
   AUTO-BRIEFS (Undated) _ The Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan, a large
luxury sedan with equally large prices ($70,000 and up) leads the
list of passenger cars that have the highest insurance losses for
theft, according to new figures from the Highway Loss Data
Institute. The institute, which is supported by the auto insurance
industry, says the S-class' losses from theft are 10 times higher
than the average for all passenger cars. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS

   MEXICAN-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ When Mexicans go to the polls
on Sunday, they'll be electing more than a president: They'll be
choosing the kind of future they want and passing judgment on the
past. As they do that, they could remake their country entirely.
More than

   just a simple election, July 2 could be Mexico's version of

   AIDS-DRUGS (San Francisco) _ While world leaders and
pharmaceutical behemoths wrangle over whether and how people in
developing countries get access to the expensive cocktail of drugs
that keeps HIV in check, activists in the Bay Area are collecting
surplus medicines and shipping them off to countries where most of
the world's AIDS victims are dying. By ULYSSESS TORASSA.

   SF-SCHOOLS (Washington, D.C.) _ Arlene Ackerman, who will leave
her post as the District of Columbia schools superintendent July 17
to take the helm of the San Francisco public schools Aug. 1, is
shaped and motivated by inequities. ``In everything I do and see, I
ask whether it's equitable for all children,'' Ackerman said. ``My
job is not about making adults happy. I have little patience for
adult issues that get in the way of children.'' By JULIAN GUTHRIE.

WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Hawaiian researchers say that men
who eat two or more servings of tofu a week can experience
``accelerated brain aging.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   This does not surprise me very much because I've always thought
you needed to be suffering from accelerated brain aging to be
eating tofu in the first place. The way I look at it, if I want to
eat tasteless glop, I'll go to a McDonald's. They're more
convenient than Japanese health-food stores, plus they have
Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   The research is troubling for health-food nuts but it's also
troubling for people like me who don't eat tofu and yet still feel
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I think I began experiencing the symptoms of accelerated brain
aging around age 20 when I realized I couldn't follow the Perry
Mason TV show. The plots took lots of twists and turns, sure, but I
don't think that was the problem. When Perry told his client,
``Don't worry about me fee,'' my mind would detach itself from its
moorings and begin floating on a sea of unreality where the
innocent are always vindicated and smug, chain-smoking district
attorneys never win.
</P>
<P>
   There are many possible signs of accelerated brain aging.
Attending a Monkees reunion concert is certainly one. Paying
$500,000 for a ride on the space station Mir is another. Recently,
I've lost the ability to remember names. While I can remember the
names of my wife and son (Teri and _ oh, whatsisname the tall kid
with big feet who likes to stand in front of the open refrigerator
until his nose hairs turn white _ Michael!), anybody I see fewer
than 10 times a day draws a blank. It is much easier to get around
this with men, whom I can simply refer to as ``big guy,'' ``hoss''
or the always-appropriate ``bubba.'' With women, it's more
difficult. Calling them ``sweetheart'' or ``hon'' seems
inappropriate at best and a sexual harassment suit at worst. I
usually opt for the more formal ``ma'am'' for females over the age
of 12 and ``young lady'' for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   How has this happened? Galloping senility is the easy answer,
but it's not a very comforting diagnosis for someone who is still
on the spry side of 50. It is tempting to blame it on the
tofu-eaters, who perhaps have the power to project brain-aging rays
into the heads of anyone standing in their vicinity. Still, if
tofu, which has all the snack appeal of unflavored wallpaper paste,
can cause that much damage, what about other, tastier foods like
double-bacon cheeseburgers, stuffed-crust pizza and fried chicken?
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Chicken Council, the average American
will eat a record 81 pounds of chicken this year, far outpacing
consumption of beef or pork.
</P>
<P>
   I eat at least that much chicken, most of it cooked on my
propane grill that was last cleaned around the time Al Gore
invented the Internet. The black, greasy smoke that pours out when
I fire it up can turn daylight into night and cause birds to drop
from the sky. The barbecued chicken that emerges from this smudge
pot is, like most highly carcinogenic foods, delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Can I blame my problem with names and my inability to follow
Perry Mason reruns on 81 pounds of scorched chicken wings? Or are
the names and the reruns the cause of my problems, not the
symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   A thorny question, to be sure. Better throw a few drumsticks on
the grill and think about it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; JEM (AND SAM) &LR;  By Ferdinand Mount. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95. This
novel of Restoration London is about a drinking buddy of Samuel
Pepys (and possibly the author's ancestor) who struggles mightily
to overcome his envy of Pepys' career, connections and wife. The
result is ``a brilliant pastiche of 17th-century prose'' in which
``the historical detail feels rich and accurate,'' Michael Upchurch
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMBRACING DEFEAT: Japan in the Wake of World War II &LR;  By John W.
Dower. Norton/New Press, $15.95. A historian assesses the impact of
the Allied occupation of Japan between 1945 and 1952 on modern
Japanese history. His nuanced account, which won a Pulitzer Prize
and a National Book Award, dissects the pretensions and practices
of the operation, as well as the ambiguities, bad policy-making and
bureaucratic bungling of the period. He finds much to praise and to
deplore in the occupation's legacy. Last year in The New York Times
Book Review, J.A.A. Stockwin called this ``a magisterial and
beautifully written book'' that includes ``many amazing documentary
photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WOMAN WHO CUT OFF HER LEG AT THE MAIDSTONE CLUB: And Other
Stories &LR;  By Julia Slavin. John Macrae/Picador USA, $12. These tales
of suburbia and the fears and self-destructive impulses underlying
family commitments are infused with the grotesque: One woman grows
teeth all over her body, while another swallows the yard worker she
lusts after. ``Slavin's uncluttered, room-temperature prose renders
the monstrous familiar, even beautiful,'' Charles Taylor wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNGRY OCEAN: A Swordboat Captain's Journey &LR;  By Linda
Greenlaw. Hyperion, $14. A female fisherman (not a fisherwoman, she
insists) describes her grueling seafaring life and her many voyages
off the Atlantic coast. ``It is a story of triumph, of a woman not
only making it but succeeding at the highest level in one of the
most male-dominated and most dangerous professions,'' Douglas
Whynott wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONE VOYAGER: The Extraordinary Adventures of Howard Blackburn,
Hero Fisherman of Gloucester &LR; , by Joseph E. Garland
(Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13), tells of a sailor who survived
for five days alone in an open dory during a winter storm off
Newfoundland in 1883 by allowing his hands to freeze to the oars as
he pulled for land. This account of his ordeal (he lost all his
fingers) and his subsequent exploits is told with ``scrupulous
detail and much narrative skill,'' Henry Beetle Hough wrote in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDISCOVERED CHEKHOV: Forty-Three New Stories &LR;  By Anton
Chekhov. Translated by Peter Constantine. Seven Stories, $16.95. By
the time he was 26, Chekhov had published more than 400 stories and
vignettes in popular Russian magazines. This collection of early
tales, which has been reissued with five additional stories, is a
``delightful compilation,'' Donald Fanger wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDNIGHT CHAMPAGNE &LR;  By A. Manette Ansay. Harper Perennial, $13.
This novel explores the thwarted romantic lives of guests at the
Wisconsin wedding of a young couple who have known each other only
briefly. The author ``weaves in and out of the sundry dramas with
grace, warmth and a good deal of humor,'' Laura Jamison wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DREAMS OUR STUFF IS MADE OF: How Science Fiction Conquered
the World &LR;  By Thomas M. Disch. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. A
well-regarded science-fiction novelist argues for the genre's
literary merits while blaming it for encouraging delusory popular
fantasies and wacko religious cults. ``Disch is an eloquent
storyteller and polemicist'' and his book ``is consistently
rewarding,'' Alexander Star wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MORAL LIFE OF CHILDREN &LR;  By Robert Coles. Atlantic Monthly,
$13.50. Traveling to the world's trouble spots, a child
psychiatrist interviews a wide variety of children to examine the
way they develop their moral awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion volume,  &UR; THE POLITICAL LIFE OF CHILDREN &LR; 
($13.50), also reissued by Atlantic Monthly, he studies the way
youngsters think about politics. ``There is no one who is more
interested in what children say, sing, don't say or don't sing _
and why _ than Robert Coles,'' Neil Postman wrote in 1986. ``He is
to the stories that children have to tell what Homer was to the
tale of the Trojan War.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITE WIDOW &LR;  By Jim Lehrer. PublicAffairs, $12. Set in the
1950s, this novel revolves around a happily married bus driver in
small-town Texas whose life unravels when he becomes obsessed with
a mysterious woman passenger. The result is ``an oddly affecting
morality tale,'' The New York Times Book Review said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUXTON SPICE &LR;  By Oonya Kempadoo. Plume, $11.95. This tale of
village life in Guyana, narrated in a rich creole by a girl, is set
in the 1970s during a period of racial turmoil. ```Buxton Spice' is
a superb, and superbly written, novel of childhood and childhood's
end,'' Patrick Markee wrote last year.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At 4 a.m. on a still-black Monday morning, 76-year-old Robert
Kilgalen came to the emergency room gripping his stomach. His wife
said he'd been alternating between explosive diarrhea and vomiting
for two hours.
 &HT;    He was so dizzy from loss of fluid that he could hardly stand,
and his temperature was 101.5 degrees.
 &HT;    The staff started him on fluids intravenously, then began to
examine him for clues. Toxic chemicals, viruses and pathogenic
bacteria such as shigella, E. coli and salmonella can cause
debilitating diarrhea. But sometimes chronic intestinal
inflammation can provoke it too.
 &HT;    The first step was to examine blood and stool cultures for
infection. The following day, Ellie, the lab technician, came up
from the microbiology lab. She held a small glass vial of stool
culture up to the light. ``Look. There's nothing, not even normal
flora.''
 &HT;    The antibiotics the patient had taken on the way to the hospital
had wiped out any telltale signs. The other lab results indicated
only dehydration and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. We
hadn't a clue what was wrong.
 &HT;    But before long, a feverish 8-year-old girl arrived, sick from
vomiting and diarrhea. Then an 81-year-old woman and a 3-month-old
boy came in with the same symptoms.
 &HT;    Was this the start of an epidemic? None of the new patients had
taken antibiotics, so I hoped one of the cultures would be
positive.
 &HT;    The following morning Ellie showed me the tubes. I could see
that the samples teemed with bacterial colonies. She took small
samples of the fluid and spread it out on agar plates specially
prepared to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and suppress
normal gut flora.
 &HT;    The next morning I went into the lab and Ellie opened the
incubator containing the cultures. She held the agar plate under
the light. There were hundreds of shiny black colonies _
salmonella. All three cultures, she said, were positive.
 &HT;    As many as 4 million salmonella cases break out in the United
States each year, making it the country's most common food
poisoning. More than 2,000 varieties of the bacterium live in the
guts of such animals as pigs, cows and chickens, without causing
them harm. (The infection can also pass from a hen to her eggs.)
 &HT;    One type _ Salmonella typhi _ lives only in humans. It causes
typhoid fever, which can be deadly. While typhoid fever is not
uncommon in countries with poor sewage treatment, it is rare in the
United States.
 &HT;    To thrive in a human, salmonellae must survive the acidic
conditions in the stomach, reach the small intestine and attach to
its lining. If enough live salmonellae get to the intestine,
diarrhea and vomiting _ the host's effort to expel the pathogen _
will follow within six to 48 hours.
 &HT;    In severe cases, the bacteria can slip into the bloodstream and
cause systemic infections. And in rare instances, mostly occurring
in the very young, weak or old, salmonella infection can lead to
death from dehydration or septic shock.
 &HT;    Given the timing of their illnesses, I guessed that all four
patients must have had a common source of infection. I talked with
each patient's doctor and learned that all but the 3-month-old had
recently eaten tapioca at a local restaurant. The 3-month-old,
whose parents were turkey farmers, proved to be infected with a
different type of salmonella.
 &HT;    Next I notified the state board of health. An inspector found
the problem: The restaurant's tapioca cooker wasn't heating the
pudding enough to kill bacteria. Instead it was warming the pudding
just enough to help bacteria grow. In the end, 13 diners at the
restaurant were diagnosed with salmonella food poisoning.
 &HT;    The key to controlling salmonella is understanding its rapid
growth. Bacterial colonies can double every 20 minutes, a rate of
growth so exponential that a single colony bred under perfect
conditions could reach the size of Earth in less than 48 hours.
 &HT;    Salmonellae grow best at about 100 degrees, making the human
body a great host. Keeping food colder than 40 degrees or hotter
than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation
period.
 &HT;    This week I went back to the restaurant for a fine traditional
meal: mashed potatoes, fresh bread and fried chicken. Tapioca
pudding wasn't on the menu.

 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At 4 a.m. on a still-black Monday morning, 76-year-old Robert
Kilgalen came to the emergency room gripping his stomach. His wife
said he'd been alternating between explosive diarrhea and vomiting
for two hours.
 &HT;    He was so dizzy from loss of fluid that he could hardly stand,
and his temperature was 101.5 degrees.
 &HT;    The staff started him on fluids intravenously, then began to
examine him for clues. Toxic chemicals, viruses and pathogenic
bacteria such as shigella, E. coli and salmonella can cause
debilitating diarrhea. But sometimes chronic intestinal
inflammation can provoke it too.
 &HT;    The first step was to examine blood and stool cultures for
infection. The following day, Ellie, the lab technician, came up
from the microbiology lab. She held a small glass vial of stool
culture up to the light. ``Look. There's nothing, not even normal
flora.''
 &HT;    The antibiotics the patient had taken on the way to the hospital
had wiped out any telltale signs. The other lab results indicated
only dehydration and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. We
hadn't a clue what was wrong.
 &HT;    But before long, a feverish 8-year-old girl arrived, sick from
vomiting and diarrhea. Then an 81-year-old woman and a 3-month-old
boy came in with the same symptoms.
 &HT;    Was this the start of an epidemic? None of the new patients had
taken antibiotics, so I hoped one of the cultures would be
positive.
 &HT;    The following morning Ellie showed me the tubes. I could see
that the samples teemed with bacterial colonies. She took small
samples of the fluid and spread it out on agar plates specially
prepared to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and suppress
normal gut flora.
 &HT;    The next morning I went into the lab and Ellie opened the
incubator containing the cultures. She held the agar plate under
the light. There were hundreds of shiny black colonies _
salmonella. All three cultures, she said, were positive.
 &HT;    As many as 4 million salmonella cases break out in the United
States each year, making it the country's most common food
poisoning. More than 2,000 varieties of the bacterium live in the
guts of such animals as pigs, cows and chickens, without causing
them harm. (The infection can also pass from a hen to her eggs.)
 &HT;    One type _ Salmonella typhi _ lives only in humans. It causes
typhoid fever, which can be deadly. While typhoid fever is not
uncommon in countries with poor sewage treatment, it is rare in the
United States.
 &HT;    To thrive in a human, salmonellae must survive the acidic
conditions in the stomach, reach the small intestine and attach to
its lining. If enough live salmonellae get to the intestine,
diarrhea and vomiting _ the host's effort to expel the pathogen _
will follow within six to 48 hours.
 &HT;    In severe cases, the bacteria can slip into the bloodstream and
cause systemic infections. And in rare instances, mostly occurring
in the very young, weak or old, salmonella infection can lead to
death from dehydration or septic shock.
 &HT;    Given the timing of their illnesses, I guessed that all four
patients must have had a common source of infection. I talked with
each patient's doctor and learned that all but the 3-month-old had
recently eaten tapioca at a local restaurant. The 3-month-old,
whose parents were turkey farmers, proved to be infected with a
different type of salmonella.
 &HT;    Next I notified the state board of health. An inspector found
the problem: The restaurant's tapioca cooker wasn't heating the
pudding enough to kill bacteria. Instead it was warming the pudding
just enough to help bacteria grow. In the end, 13 diners at the
restaurant were diagnosed with salmonella food poisoning.
 &HT;    The key to controlling salmonella is understanding its rapid
growth. Bacterial colonies can double every 20 minutes, a rate of
growth so exponential that a single colony bred under perfect
conditions could reach the size of Earth in less than 48 hours.
 &HT;    Salmonellae grow best at about 100 degrees, making the human
body a great host. Keeping food colder than 40 degrees or hotter
than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation
period.
 &HT;    This week I went back to the restaurant for a fine traditional
meal: mashed potatoes, fresh bread and fried chicken. Tapioca
pudding wasn't on the menu.

 By WILLIAM SPEED WEED 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

 By WILLIAM SPEED WEED 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

<P>
   MILAN _ Lancome has found its American beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple years, the French beauty brand has
assembled a glittering cast of megawatt spokesmodels, all of them
European. Two years ago, executives in Paris and New York began
casting about for a face that would strike a deep chord of
recognition within the U.S. market. The new beauty: Uma Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   Her entrance _ made at a gala reception on the edge of Paris _
was the climax of a special presentation of Lancome's new women's
fragrance, called Miracle. The scent, a major initiative of Lancome
and its parent L'Oreal, will be launched in Europe in the fall. And
Thurman, who has signed a two-year renewable contract, will be the
face of the global advertising.
</P>
<P>
   She is joining a glamorous group of Lancome faces: Juliette
Binoche, Marie Gillain, Cristiana Reali and Ines Sastre. As a
group, they collectively replaced Lancome's longtime face, Isabella
Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thurman, known for her performances in ``Pulp Fiction''
and ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' starring in a fragrance commercial is
certainly a change of pace. And she enjoyed filming the new Miracle
ad in Provence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total departure,'' she noted in a telephone
interview from Paris. And even though Thurman says she had never
thought about working in the cosmetics industry before the job was
offered, it doesn't seem alien to her. She had always been drawn to
the ``aesthetic of the (Lancome) advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Isabella and Juliette were portrayed, the way they
represented women in the way I as a woman would like to be
represented _ it was something that captured me as I would be
flipping through the pages of a magazine,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   She sees her new role in the business world as an ``experiment''
at a time when there are other major changes in her life like
becoming a mother. But the actual work is not so different from
doing photo sessions for Vanity Fair or ``endless shoots'' to
promote her films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's familiar terrain,'' she noted, ``but what is not so
familiar is how to open myself to being used in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Thurman acknowledged an advantage to the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I feel empowered in making creative choices as an
actor,'' she said, indicating that having the Lancome work may give
her a little more confidence to become choosier in picking movie
roles.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Thurman says she feels ``flattered'' to be asked
to do modeling at age 30. ``Most people are being kicked out of
modeling at that age,'' she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman described the work as a mixture of modeling and acting
that allows her to be herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about me has to be changed. I don't have to become
something else. They don't have to clean me up or fiddle with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she's able to fold it into her artistic life. The
shoot for the Miracle commercial dovetailed with a scheduled
appearance in nearby Cannes for the screening of her two new movies
_ ``Vatel,'' a period drama with Gerard Depardieu and Tim Roth, and
a Merchant Ivory production of Henry James novel ``The Golden
Bowl,'' with Nick Nolte, Anjelica Huston and Jeremy Northam. Both
will be released in the fall. Then she headed north to Paris for
the Miracle presentation.
</P>
<P>
   She views it all in purely professional terms. Thurman says she
dislikes the term spokesmodel because it implies an expertise in a
particular subject that she doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of L'Oreal executives, she may be selling
herself a bit short. Luc Nadeau, senior vice president and general
manager of Lancome USA in New York, can barely restrain himself in
ticking off the pluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, she is international, uniquely beautiful and
women can relate to her as a wife, a mother and an actor,'' Nadeau
said. ``As an actress, she has shown great versatility,'' he added,
referring to Thurman's ability to float from directional art-house
films to local studio fare and back again.
</P>
<P>
   And her first project, Miracle, is of pivotal importance to
Lancome and L'Oreal. Like the decade-old Tresor, it's a broad-based
major fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not break out sales projections or reveal
promotional budgets. However, industry sources estimate that
Miracle could generate a wholesale volume in its first full year of
approximately $100 million worldwide. That would place it in the
top five women's prestige fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. target is an estimated $30 million to $40 million in
wholesale volume for the first year following its introduction in
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the industry figure that Lancome will invest $10
million to $15 million in media to back the launch in Europe, which
is set for the end of September. The rest of the world will follow
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Details have not been set for the U.S. introduction, but sources
estimate the advertising budget will be similar to the European
one.
</P>
<P>
   Counting extra promotional costs, including point-of-sale
animation and sell-through specialists, the American budget could
climb as high as $15 million to $20 million, especially if sales
climb toward $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible significance of this launch goes well beyond
volume estimates and speculation about the size of the war chest.
Lancome has been locked in a worldwide duel with the Este Lauder
brand for at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   L'Oreal executives say that Lancome has emerged from the fray
with the No. 1 global ranking in color cosmetics and skin care. But
Lauder moves ahead when the company's immense fragrance business is
added to the equation.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Lauder's fragrance superiority, Lancome has
counterattacked with Tresor, which still ranks third in the world
and sixth in the United States, according to Lancome executives.
Poeme, which was launched in 1995, placed in the top 20 worldwide,
while O Oui, a 1998 entry, was a niche move aimed at attracting
new, younger customers.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle, therefore, could join Tresor in a second step toward
building a powerful fragrance stable. Marc Menesguen, director
general of Lancome International, stated, ``We definitely are No 1
(in color and treatment). We still have a way to go with
fragrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen noted that he expects good growth from fragrance in
the coming year. Then he added that the company intends ``to speed
the rhythm of fragrance launches.''
</P>
<P>
   The target audience for Miracle is similar to that of Tresor,
women aged 25 to 45, with a core of 25- to 35-year-olds. The price
points are slightly higher than Tresor's.
</P>
<P>
   But the positionings are strikingly different. Tresor, a floral
oriental, is a fragrance of intimacy with a positioning predicated
on private moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracle is for a woman who is more open to the world, more
open and willing to make her life what it can be,'' Menesguen said.
``She knows she can create a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial that was shot outdoors in a village in Provence
shows Thurman gazing at a sunrise, ``signifying the miracle of
life, the miracle of love,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was directed by Darius Khonji, and the
photographer for the print ad is Michel Comte.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome executives absolutely refused to discuss any terms of
their contract with Thurman. But industry executives, who have
experience making deals with superstars, speculate that Thurman was
paid $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   She will appear in Miracle advertising worldwide, and then
Lancome will use her image on ``two or three'' new cosmetics
products set to launch next year.
</P>
<P>
   All the launches will be global, and Menesguen stressed that
Lancome picks its models for their international appeal. He noted
that the company had been looking for the new spokesmodel for 18
months when Thurman was decided upon.
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen said the company was looking for someone with American
appeal, since about one-third of Lancome's global volume is done in
the United States. He was careful to say that the search was not
necessarily for an American, although the executive admitted that
there are few people with a high U.S. profile who aren't American.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome executives pointed out that Thurman, who has a Swedish
mother, is well known in Europe thanks to her movies.
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen seemed to take delight in pointing out that not only
did Lancome fall in love with Thurman, but she wanted to work with
them. ``She chose us,'' Menesguen proudly stated. &QL;

<P>
   MILAN _ Lancome has found its American beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple years, the French beauty brand has
assembled a glittering cast of megawatt spokesmodels, all of them
European. Two years ago, executives in Paris and New York began
casting about for a face that would strike a deep chord of
recognition within the U.S. market. The new beauty: Uma Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   Her entrance _ made at a gala reception on the edge of Paris _
was the climax of a special presentation of Lancome's new women's
fragrance, called Miracle. The scent, a major initiative of Lancome
and its parent L'Oreal, will be launched in Europe in the fall. And
Thurman, who has signed a two-year renewable contract, will be the
face of the global advertising.
</P>
<P>
   She is joining a glamorous group of Lancome faces: Juliette
Binoche, Marie Gillain, Cristiana Reali and Ines Sastre. As a
group, they collectively replaced Lancome's longtime face, Isabella
Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thurman, known for her performances in ``Pulp Fiction''
and ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' starring in a fragrance commercial is
certainly a change of pace. And she enjoyed filming the new Miracle
ad in Provence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total departure,'' she noted in a telephone
interview from Paris. And even though Thurman says she had never
thought about working in the cosmetics industry before the job was
offered, it doesn't seem alien to her. She had always been drawn to
the ``aesthetic of the (Lancome) advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Isabella and Juliette were portrayed, the way they
represented women in the way I as a woman would like to be
represented _ it was something that captured me as I would be
flipping through the pages of a magazine,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   She sees her new role in the business world as an ``experiment''
at a time when there are other major changes in her life like
becoming a mother. But the actual work is not so different from
doing photo sessions for Vanity Fair or ``endless shoots'' to
promote her films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's familiar terrain,'' she noted, ``but what is not so
familiar is how to open myself to being used in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Thurman acknowledged an advantage to the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I feel empowered in making creative choices as an
actor,'' she said, indicating that having the Lancome work may give
her a little more confidence to become choosier in picking movie
roles.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Thurman says she feels ``flattered'' to be asked
to do modeling at age 30. ``Most people are being kicked out of
modeling at that age,'' she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman described the work as a mixture of modeling and acting
that allows her to be herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about me has to be changed. I don't have to become
something else. They don't have to clean me up or fiddle with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she's able to fold it into her artistic life. The
shoot for the Miracle commercial dovetailed with a scheduled
appearance in nearby Cannes for the screening of her two new movies
_ ``Vatel,'' a period drama with Gerard Depardieu and Tim Roth, and
a Merchant Ivory production of Henry James novel ``The Golden
Bowl,'' with Nick Nolte, Anjelica Huston and Jeremy Northam. Both
will be released in the fall. Then she headed north to Paris for
the Miracle presentation.
</P>
<P>
   She views it all in purely professional terms. Thurman says she
dislikes the term spokesmodel because it implies an expertise in a
particular subject that she doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of L'Oreal executives, she may be selling
herself a bit short. Luc Nadeau, senior vice president and general
manager of Lancome USA in New York, can barely restrain himself in
ticking off the pluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, she is international, uniquely beautiful and
women can relate to her as a wife, a mother and an actor,'' Nadeau
said. ``As an actress, she has shown great versatility,'' he added,
referring to Thurman's ability to float from directional art-house
films to local studio fare and back again.
</P>
<P>
   And her first project, Miracle, is of pivotal importance to
Lancome and L'Oreal. Like the decade-old Tresor, it's a broad-based
major fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not break out sales projections or reveal
promotional budgets. However, industry sources estimate that
Miracle could generate a wholesale volume in its first full year of
approximately $100 million worldwide. That would place it in the
top five women's prestige fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. target is an estimated $30 million to $40 million in
wholesale volume for the first year following its introduction in
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the industry figure that Lancome will invest $10
million to $15 million in media to back the launch in Europe, which
is set for the end of September. The rest of the world will follow
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Details have not been set for the U.S. introduction, but sources
estimate the advertising budget will be similar to the European
one.
</P>
<P>
   Counting extra promotional costs, including point-of-sale
animation and sell-through specialists, the American budget could
climb as high as $15 million to $20 million, especially if sales
climb toward $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible significance of this launch goes well beyond
volume estimates and speculation about the size of the war chest.
Lancome has been locked in a worldwide duel with the Este Lauder
brand for at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   L'Oreal executives say that Lancome has emerged from the fray
with the No. 1 global ranking in color cosmetics and skin care. But
Lauder moves ahead when the company's immense fragrance business is
added to the equation.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Lauder's fragrance superiority, Lancome has
counterattacked with Tresor, which still ranks third in the world
and sixth in the United States, according to Lancome executives.
Poeme, which was launched in 1995, placed in the top 20 worldwide,
while O Oui, a 1998 entry, was a niche move aimed at attracting
new, younger customers.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle, therefore, could join Tresor in a second step toward
building a powerful fragrance stable. Marc Menesguen, director
general of Lancome International, stated, ``We definitely are No 1
(in color and treatment). We still have a way to go with
fragrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen noted that he expects good growth from fragrance in
the coming year. Then he added that the company intends ``to speed
the rhythm of fragrance launches.''
</P>
<P>
   The target audience for Miracle is similar to that of Tresor,
women aged 25 to 45, with a core of 25- to 35-year-olds. The price
points are slightly higher than Tresor's.
</P>
<P>
   But the positionings are strikingly different. Tresor, a floral
oriental, is a fragrance of intimacy with a positioning predicated
on private moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracle is for a woman who is more open to the world, more
open and willing to make her life what it can be,'' Menesguen said.
``She knows she can create a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial that was shot outdoors in a village in Provence
shows Thurman gazing at a sunrise, ``signifying the miracle of
life, the miracle of love,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was directed by Darius Khonji, and the
photographer for the print ad is Michel Comte.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome executives absolutely refused to discuss any terms of
their contract with Thurman. But industry executives, who have
experience making deals with superstars, speculate that Thurman was
paid $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   She will appear in Miracle advertising worldwide, and then
Lancome will use her image on ``two or three'' new cosmetics
products set to launch next year.
</P>
<P>
   All the launches will be global, and Menesguen stressed that
Lancome picks its models for their international appeal. He noted
that the company had been looking for the new spokesmodel for 18
months when Thurman was decided upon.
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen said the company was looking for someone with American
appeal, since about one-third of Lancome's global volume is done in
the United States. He was careful to say that the search was not
necessarily for an American, although the executive admitted that
there are few people with a high U.S. profile who aren't American.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome executives pointed out that Thurman, who has a Swedish
mother, is well known in Europe thanks to her movies.
</P>
<P>
   Menesguen seemed to take delight in pointing out that not only
did Lancome fall in love with Thurman, but she wanted to work with
them. ``She chose us,'' Menesguen proudly stated. &QL;

$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there

cost for the September departures is $1,395.

the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power in
Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in which the
incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose subsequent

   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards. Indeed, for the first time in history, the
proportion of the world's population that lives in countries that
can claim to be broadly democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
Closer scrutiny, however, finds several imposters in the crowd:
countries still ``in transition'' towards full democracy. &QL;

   Three months after Vladimir Putin won Russia's presidency, some
ugly things have been happening in his benighted country. The new
man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip. He has
sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former vassal
states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening towards
Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command. Things may
yet change but, for the time being at least, Putin remains on
probation. &QL;

   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it

the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising. Governments and health-care providers have much to learn
from studying the structure and performance of other countries'
health systems. But what may matter more for public policy than the
rankings in the WHO report are four general conclusions about
health care. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On June 22, the California Environmental
Dialogue, a new 32-member group including _ improbably _ General
Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the Sierra Club and Environmental
Defense, published a paper on the state's transport policy. In it,
they endorsed the principle that the ``user should pay'' for road
use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' _ a first for the big oil and car firms.
Drivers' groups, however, are opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a
state senator from freeway-laced Los Angeles, calls road-pricing a
middle-class fantasy dreamed up by ``some dweeb in a dark room
doing quantitative analysis.'' &QL;

   BEIRUT _ When is a border less than a border? When it is blue.
So, at least, runs the contention of the United Nations officials
trying to confirm the Israeli army's retreat from south Lebanon.
They have invented a new, blue ``withdrawal line'' where it thinks
the Lebanese border should run. But the Lebanese government, which
already has to cope with green, red, black and purple lines left
behind by the country's civil war, is reluctant to add another
shade to the spectrum. It argues that the new boundary leaves
several chunks of Lebanese territory inside Israel. &QL;

drivers, paying record prices for gasoline, may think the crunch
has come already, but the gas market suffering this particular
price shock is largely unaffected by gyrations in oil price.
Although few outside the industry have noticed, prices for natural
gas in the U.S. have shot up in the past year _ a rise which has
surprised even old industry hands. &QL;

<P>
   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bloodletting of the 1910-17 revolution led to the
emergence in the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), power in Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in
which the incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose
subsequent electoral victory was a formality, achieved when
necessary by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July 2 a
historic event.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is uncertain. After months of campaigning, the
latest opinion polls give only the narrowest of leads to the PRI's
Francisco Labastida over Vicente Fox of the opposition National
Action Party (PAN). The leftish Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trails in third
place.
</P>
<P>
   But if Fox has at least a chance of winning, it is also because
of a second big change. This is the first presidential election to
be supervised not by the government but by an independent institute
whose probity is accepted by all.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough to ensure a clean vote? A swelling chorus
has arisen recently to complain that the PRI has been up to its old
tricks, showering voters with largesse (ranging from washing
machines to bicycles and cash) and threats (to withdraw
anti-poverty funds from opposition supporters, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Such reports should be kept in perspective: even the opposition
says their effect is confined to relatively few voters, mainly in
rural areas. Even so, such tactics are worrying: in a tight
election, they may prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to hope for is thus that the election should
produce a clean and clear winner, relieving Mexico of protracted
dispute about the result.
</P>
<P>
   But better still if that winner were to be Fox. He is not
without flaws. He combines stubbornness with an impulsive tendency
to flip-flop on issues. Some Mexicans are offended by his rude
language; others by his militant Catholicism and his opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two overriding reasons for desiring an opposition
victory. First, it would, almost by definition, complete Mexico's
transition from one-party state to plural democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And the alternation of power would be beneficial in itself,
because many of Mexico's problems stem from the fusing by the PRI
of the functions and interests of party, state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Fox, a former businessman (and Coca-Cola manager) looks,
on balance, to be the candidate likeliest to push forward with the
reforms his country needs. That is not immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   However slowly, Mexico has changed much in the past 20 years,
especially under President Ernesto Zedillo. That is not least
because of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
is drawing the country's economy, and perhaps its politics, into
ever-closer association with those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the currency collapse and deep recession of 1994-95,
Zedillo has started to put Mexico on the road to sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic management has been less opaque than in the past.
So, too, has been the selection of the PRI's candidate: Labastida
was chosen by an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Provided the election comes off cleanly, those changes have
increased the chance that this year Mexico will avoid the economic
or political crises that have marked the start of the past four
presidential terms _ despite some signs of economic overheating,
and worries about the possible impact of a slowing economy north of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's record, and the PRI's adaptability, might seem to be
strong arguments for Labastida. He is an experienced politician
known for his negotiating skills, though he is not a liberal
technocrat like Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But change and its benefits have been distributed unequally. If
all Mexicans are to get full value from NAFTA and from economic
growth, their next president needs to complement an emerging
democracy with a market economy and a reformed state. That involves
separating political and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is still burdened by the PRI's corporatist history: the
state let favored businessmen enrich themselves in return for
political loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   One costly result was a banking crisis which deprived most
Mexicans of credit during Zedillo's term, and left a bill of $100
billion for bailing out the banks (and some of the bankers).
</P>
<P>
   Another has been a monopolized economy. State monopolies still
control electricity distribution and oil. A privatized
near-monopoly, Telmex (whose boss, Carlos Slim, is Latin America's
richest man), has used its political clout to delay a fully
competitive telecoms market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mutual backscratching, Mexico needs impartial
regulation of its economy to promote competition, and deregulation
of government, and also, in some ways, its expansion: petty
officialdom still exacts its venal toll, while the state does far
too little to give its poorest citizens decent schooling and
health.
</P>
<P>
   The next government also needs to do much more to combat crime,
corruption and powerful drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida claims to help those who suffer from change. But as
the chief beneficiary of the old ways, the PRI is unlikely to be as
vigorous in trying to abolish them as Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the election will probably face a Congress divided
three ways, as it has been since 1997. Governing Mexico will thus
not be easy; reforming it harder still. That is another reason for
wishing the election to be both clear-cut and clean. &QL;

<P>
   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, the proportion of the world's
population that lives in countries that can claim to be broadly
democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 120 out of the world's 190 or so states can now
plausibly claim to have democracies.
</P>
<P>
   If you think, with Winston Churchill, that although democracy
has its flaws, it is the least bad political system yet invented,
this offers genuine cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, next week a ``World Forum on Democracy'' will meet
in Poland, organized privately by Freedom House (an American
pro-democracy think-tank) and a Polish foundation, but hosted by
the Polish government. It will be addressed by such luminaries as
Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state, and Kofi Annan,
the secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a parallel meeting, foreign ministers from more than 100
countries will discuss ways of further strengthening the democratic
cause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   And there is even better news on the way, if you believe the
Internet enthusiasts. Direct democracy through computerized voting
at home is a long way off virtually everywhere, given still-low
levels of Internet access in most countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Net, and associated advances in communications
technology, could soon have a beneficial effect on government, as
people begin to press for public services to be delivered or
administered online, and then to demand the same standards of
service _ speed, reliability, courtesy, innovation _ from their
local or national governments as they do from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If voters can force their governments to treat them like
customers, rather than just as cattle who are fed nicely every few
years when an election happens along, it will add a powerful new
pressure for democratic accountability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is all moving pleasingly in the right direction. Yet there
are also forces pressing in less benign ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, progress is not always permanent. From time to
time, countries that were democracies, or looked like becoming
them, lapse into their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Recently two Pacific tiddlers, the Solomon Islands and Fiji,
disappeared from Freedom House's list of electoral democracies
after coups or other mayhem. Pakistan was counted as one for a
time, albeit of a rough and not very ready sort, until General
Pervez Musharraf took over the reins of power last October.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, however, a more sinister phenomenon, one which
bears more thought than it usually gets. Freedom House and the
other organizers of next week's meetings are well aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory number of 120 or so broad, electoral democracies
includes a considerable list of countries whose citizens are far
from free, in the true sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom House's own rankings count only 86 countries as properly
free. Which, since more than 100 will be at the meetings, means
that there will be quite a number of impostors at the feast.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic way of putting this is that some countries are
``in transition'' towards full democracy, and that conferences like
this, with all the public exposure and discussion that they bring,
can help jostle them along that path.
</P>
<P>
   It will persuade them that ballot boxes may be necessary for
democracy, but are far from sufficient: you also need free speech
and a free press; an independent judiciary; and, supervised by that
judiciary, the impartial enforcement of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is an example of a transition in progress, though it has
been painfully slow. Indonesia is finding it hard to establish
proper judging and policing overnight after decades of
dictatorship, let alone a full set of legitimate laws and a
clear-out of corruption. Yet with help, patience and encouragement,
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can. But often it isn't, and willfully so. For another
good word for the many partial democracies is this: phoneys.
</P>
<P>
   They are not as phoney as the old Soviet Union, with its 99.999
percent votes for Comrade Stalin. But in some ways they are worse,
because their appearances deceive.
</P>
<P>
   And, increasingly, the suspicion must be that the deception is
deliberately designed to gain just enough respectability to attract
private foreign capital, and to qualify more readily for the public
sort, from multilateral bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the phoneys have been exposed. Peru, whose President
Alberto Fujimori recently rigged his (unconstitutional)
re-election, is one of them; Haiti, its democracy supposedly
restored by American intervention in 1994, is another.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a cleverer deceiver, and has been more prone in
post-Soviet times to be given the benefit of the doubt. Now, the
doubts about its newly elected president, Vladimir Putin, are
mounting, both because of the way he was elected in March and
because of his conduct since.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting a western capital, such as Berlin last week, he
plays the democratic part. Back in Moscow, however, the script
changes and things begin to become murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, too, is a phoney, despite its noisy shunning of the
IMF. Its prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, abides by democratic
procedures (and was re-elected in November), yet meanwhile has
imprisoned his chief rival (Anwar Ibrahim, whose wife will speak at
the Forum) on trumped up charges, has throttled the press and has
suborned the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Is this worse than no democracy at all?
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's vote this weekend may yet prove, despite all the
violence and rigging, that the right to vote can still be made to
count. Yet it can often be worse, for the strongman, with his
rigged press and gagged courts, gains a form of international
approval _ and even money _ adding to the frustration, and perhaps
eventual violence, of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to use words as plainly as possible. Call a phoney a
phoney. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Three months after Vladimir Putin won Russia's presidency, some
ugly things have been happening in his benighted country.
</P>
<P>
   The new man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip.
He has sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former
vassal states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening
towards Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command.
</P>
<P>
   He has told the leaders of the outlying regions within Russia
that they must step back into the Kremlin's line _ or else. And he
has frightened the press by resorting to the bullying of media
groups and journalists critical of the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the owner of the only independent nationwide
television station, Vladimir Gusinsky, was arrested earlier this
month, and freed without charge a few days later, amid
flimsy-sounding allegations of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire country presumed that Putin, who breezily
denied foreknowledge of the arrest, simply wanted to silence the
voice of opposition. Yet, despite all this, it is still possible to
paint a less bleak picture.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years with the wayward Boris Yeltsin fitfully in
charge, Russians _ it can be argued _ need an energetic,
clear-minded leader to restore to their country some direction,
discipline and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Putin has a cooperative parliament that
broadly backs a coalition government in which economic reformers
seem to have been given their head.
</P>
<P>
   Already, for instance, a bold law has been enacted to reduce
income tax to 13 percent across the board, in the hope of bringing
millions of tax-dodgers back into the revenue net.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin's approach to foreigners may also be reaping rewards:
stalled arms-cutting deals with America are again being struck.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, western leaders are giving a new Russian czar the
benefit of doubt. If those good things come with nasty addenda,
such as an upsurge of authoritarian intolerance at home and a
crescendo of snarls abroad, that _ so the Putin-boosters argue _ is
the price to be paid for reviving a humiliated and pauperized
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it will be better for the world if the country
becomes prosperous and confident, however roughly that is achieved.
Only then, say those who see the merit of Putin a la Pinochet,
might Russia become something it has never been _ a law-based and
liberal society.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the rub. Can Russia become prosperous without first
entrenching a proper legal system to underpin a genuine free
market?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is still unclear how, or indeed whether, Putin
intends to fulfill his promise to bring to justice the influential
tycoons who have gobbled up so much of the state's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, an independent judiciary, without the say-so of the
president, would simply set about prosecuting all cases of
corruption, starting with the most blatant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even if Putin were sincere in his wish to clean
up, he would probably not at this early stage in his presidency
have the power to do so _ without recourse to strong-arm methods
that are themselves illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Gusinsky, no angel despite his courage as chief
upholder of a free press, reeks of despotism. But if, for instance,
the Putin-prompted prosecutors were instead to take on Boris
Berezovsky, widely seen as the most malign and powerful of the
plutocrats, the action might reasonably be regarded as just as
politically inspired.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the taming of the oligarchs appears to be all about
power play and very little about justice.
</P>
<P>
   It is early days. In the three months since the election, Putin
has moved cautiously, apart from the rash attack on Gusinsky, which
may turn out to have been his first big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his critics' suspicions, and his defenders' hopes, it
is still unclear whether the new president is an autocrat or a
democrat, his own man or the servant of others.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it is unclear whether he is keen to collude with
the tycoons, several of whom helped him to power, or to cut them
down. At present, his emerging team is a rum mix of economic
reformers, former KGB people and tycoons. In any event, outsiders
probably have little influence at present.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes clear that Putin's desire to bring strong
government to his people means trashing their rights, then Russia's
expulsion from the Council of Europe is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He should certainly not be allowed to believe that the West
would merely wink at greater authoritarianism. On the other hand, a
concerted effort to encourage the judiciary to uphold the rule of
law impartially should be warmly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no government money from the West should go to
Putin's Russia. A better home for western cash can be found among
the more hopeful countries on Russia's rim.
</P>
<P>
   Things may change, but, for the time being at least, Putin
remains on probation. &QL;

<P>
   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it
took 3 percent of gross world product; now, says a new report from
the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising.
</P>
<P>
   That is reasonable: as people and countries get richer and
older, they naturally want to spend more of their incomes on
health, as on other services.
</P>
<P>
   But health is not as simple as, say, hairdressing: how the
system is organized and paid for critically affects what you get
for your money. That makes international comparisons of health care
extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report, which tries for the first time to rank
countries' performance, is thus welcome. Governments and
health-care providers have much to learn from studying the
structure and performance of other countries' health systems.
</P>
<P>
   But what may matter more for public policy than the rankings in
the WHO report are four more general conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the lack of any clear connection between inputs
(more spending, say) and desired outputs (better health). There is
only a tenuous link between health-care spending and broader
measures of health: if the latter are the goal, spending more on
things like housing or education often does more to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   But even on health-care systems' own ground, the WHO cites
evidence of hugely wasteful spending. Those governments that appear
to think that more money is all that is needed to improve
health-care performance should think again: structural and
management reforms to raise efficiency can count for a lot more
than cash.
</P>
<P>
   The low ranking of America in the WHO tables supports this view
_ for America spends far more on health than any other country. Yet
the main reason for dissatisfaction with America's performance is
not its extravagance: it is the numbers of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans with health insurance, as the WHO report says, the
system is highly responsive and impressive. But the poor health
care dished out to the 44 million-odd Americans who lack any
regular health-insurance coverage drags down the country's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the second conclusion: if the American system (and that of
other countries with similar gaps) is to improve, some way must be
found to spread insurance coverage, whether publicly or privately
financed, across the whole population.
</P>
<P>
   A third conclusion is that health-care delivery, as opposed to
finance, is showing some encouraging signs of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   From the purchaser/provider split in Britain's National Health
Service to America's health-maintenance organizations, countries
are moving in the direction of a form of ``managed care,'' in which
doctors, hospitals and other providers operate within certain
budget constraints, and there is some effort to foster both
consumer choice and producer competition.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to yoke a form of market forces into the
health-care business is well worth pursuing, even if professionals
and their trade unions squeal about it.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth conclusion is that the boundaries between public and
private health care should be eroded. As the WHO report complains,
health ministries tend to look solely at public health-care
systems, ignoring the role that private provision and finance can
play.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, public finance, whether from taxes or from
social insurance, is likely to predominate in health care; but it
need not obstruct private insurance or some out-of-pocket spending,
which can be useful safety valves, especially for people in rich
countries who wish to spend more than their governments would like.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should there be a rigid demarcation between public and
private providers: distinctions are better drawn over
responsiveness and efficiency than over ownership. For most of us,
after all, health care is far too important to be left to the
state. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Strange bedfellows are part of the California
scene. Even so, the sight of car companies, oil firms and
environmentalists snuggling up together seems a bit odd; even odder
is the idea of them coming out in favor of an idea normally
associated with right-wing economists.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, the California Environmental Dialogue, a new
32-member group including General Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the
Sierra Club and Environmental Defense, published a paper on the
state's transport policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the CED proposes in its paper is pretty tame stuff
_ patching up rickety bridges before they become unsafe, buses for
the young, old and infirm, more bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   But endorsing the principle that the ``user should pay'' for
road use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' is a first for the big oil and car firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine the CED coalition coming apart over
more of the details. But its existence is a good indication of the
growing controversy over Californian sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   After little investment in infrastructure for 25 years, the
state's transport system is groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses complain about potential employees turning down job
offers that would compel them to spend hours a day commuting. Car
makers worry that unless air quality improves they will be ordered
to meet yet stricter design standards.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing has long been championed by economists, keen to
impose more of the external costs of driving on road-users by
charging them a fee that reflects not just the distance travelled
(which is loosely what gasoline taxes do) but also the time and
route of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Driving imposes a heavier burden of externalities when it is
done at rush hour (it adds to delays and is less energy-efficient)
so such journeys ought to cost a driver more. In theory, drivers
will then adjust their departure times and smooth out the flow of
traffic through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have been understandably nervous about any system
that charges their customers. But motorists are a tolerant lot. Car
ownership and use has continued to rise even as road-building
levelled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Greens too are much more willing nowadays to accept ``market''
solutions to environmental problems: witness the growth in
emissions trading.
</P>
<P>
   The most nervous people are probably politicians. Voters seem to
tolerate tolls to finance the construction of roads _ the sort of
thing levied on some bridges and roads. But charging money
specifically to discourage driving is a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers' groups, such as the American Automobile Association,
are firmly opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a state senator from
Los Angeles, argues that charging money for what are currently free
roads would be unfair on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing, he says, is a middle-class fantasy dreamed up by
``some dweeb in a dark room doing quantitative analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The dweebs say their critics oversimplify things. Bob Poole, of
the libertarian Reason Foundation, points out that, rather than
just imposing new charges on currently free but crowded roads,
California could make use of its network of (largely unpopular and
underused) high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on roads: these could
be opened to single drivers who choose to pay a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California is home to two of America's four working
examples of high-occupancy toll lanes or HOTs (the other ones are
in Texas and Florida). One, SR-91 in Orange County, allows drivers
to pay an amount that depends on the time of day to jump into an
HOV lane.
</P>
<P>
   The other, on Interstate 15 north of San Diego, is closer to the
theoreticians' dream of adjusting price to demand: its fee varies
from 50 cents to $4, depending on the volume of traffic in the HOT
lane, with the current price flashed up on screens half a mile
before the lane starts. (An electronic transponder system means
that there is no need to stop at a toll booth.)
</P>
<P>
   HOT lanes have generally been well received once drivers
understand them. But the opportunities to install them are limited
to places with existing HOV lanes. And they will not change the
overall pattern of behavior in California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the complaints, average commuting time remained
stable through the 1990s, but the average distance travelled grew.
People seem to like living further away from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their main response to any easing in congestion is to go
and live even further away. That psychology will take more than
road-pricing to change. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's quadrennial search for a designated
mourner at the funerals of foreign dignitaries _ otherwise known as
the vice president _ is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Short-lists are being drawn up. Short-lists are being narrowed
down. Candidates are being grilled by selection teams. Candidates
are being grilled on television. Candidates are filling in endless
forms, hoping to avoid unexpectedly embarrassing their boss later
on.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is taking place against the traditional frenzied
speculation that is the inevitable consequence of not having much
else to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some current hopefuls, together with their main
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bush side: Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania? Too pro-choice.
(The Republican right might stampede.)
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth of Missouri? Too dignified. (He makes Bush look
shallow. Anyway, he's ruled himself out.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole? Uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   John Kasich of Ohio? Looks like a boy scout.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keating of Oklahoma? Said homicide is the best way to deal
with an unfriendly State teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   It is not much better for Gore: His front-runner is Evan Bayh.
Very telegenic. Very handsome. Very much an unknown from Indiana.
Very like Dan Quayle (though with more brains).
</P>
<P>
   How about Dianne Feinstein of California? Too married: her
husband has business dealings with China _ not ideal for a vice
president who shudders each time he hears ``Buddhist temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, then? Never been elected to anything in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary? Just kidding. The last
batch of military secrets lost by his Los Alamos laboratories were
later found behind the photocopying machine. You couldn't invent
that kind of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   A natural reaction is to say that none of it matters anyway. The
last time a vice president made a difference in an election was in
1960, when Lyndon Johnson helped deliver Texas to John Kennedy in a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   If George Bush senior could anoint Quayle vice president and
still get elected in 1988, then his son could appoint a plasticine
chicken in 2000 and not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The only person to whom the appointment seems to make any
difference is the appointee him- or herself.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, with the exception of Quayle, all vice presidential
candidates who have later sought their party's nomination for
president have got it. But so what? Except for President Bush, they
all lost the subsequent election.
</P>
<P>
   So is the veepstakes the creation of bored pundits with too much
time on their hands? Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there is a slim chance the choice of running mate
could actually make a difference. It would not do so directly, as
LBJ did. Hardly anyone has the sort of favorite-son status that can
deliver big blocks of votes. But it could do so indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom he chooses, George W. Bush could alter the
dynamic of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far the debate has focused on what a potential number two can
add to a ticket (with the general answer being, not much). But the
question can also be posed in a different way: will the choice
transform the way that the number one is seen?
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, it is hard to see how. He has a well-defined national
reputation anyway, which cannot be transformed at a stroke. And the
pool of Democratic heavyweights who could make a difference is
small.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, for instance, whom he defeated in the primaries,
would not make much of an impact, even if he were persuadable.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not true of Bush. It is easy to forget when you look
at the Gore campaign, but Bush is the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   He has things to prove in the campaign, of which the most
important are that he has national stature, not just state-wide
popularity, and that he is more than just the choice of the
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He can make both points at once by picking as his running mate
someone of real substance from outside the charmed circle of the
Bush dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Only two men fit the bill. The first is that perennial favorite,
Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
has relentlessly refused attempts to lure him into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Were Bush to persuade Powell to join him, it would be a stunning
coup. The harsh fact remains, though, that there are no signs of
the general changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the lure of a man who could also transform peoples'
opinions of Bush and may be (slightly) more temptable: John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The important point about McCain is not that he has a track
record of attracting independents, though that is obviously not to
be sneered at.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it that he (again like Powell) provides Bush with
credibility in foreign affairs. Nor is it even that McCain can
savage Gore on the embarrassing campaign-finance irregularities of
the 1996 election _ though that again is useful.
</P>
<P>
   No, the main value of choosing McCain is what it tells voters
about Bush. It suggests that Bush really can, as he claims, show
leadership, by persuading an independent politician, with a mind of
his own, to choose to run with him.
</P>
<P>
   It says he is a man of the center, not just because he makes a
lot of speeches about compassionate conservatism but because he has
picked someone whom conservatives loathe.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it implies he can work with people who do not agree with
him on everything and who do not kowtow to the Bush name-brand.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an essential attribute of governing in the next
administration, because one of the few near-certainties of 2001 is
that whichever party ends up with a majority in Congress will do so
by only the narrowest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to demonstrate your capacity to work with
opponents _ and distinguish yourself from Gore, who has a
reputation for divisiveness _ than to appoint a man who was, until
recently, trying to bash the living daylights out of you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain, still smarting from the bitter primary
campaign, says he does not want the job. That only increases the
prize. Bush's ability to persuade him to accept it would speak even
more loudly for his claim to be able to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership, after all, does not consist of selectively rewarding
those who want to please you. Rather, it means persuading someone
to do something they do not want to do for the sake of the greater
good _ or in this case, for your own electability. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ When is a border less than a border? When it is blue.
So, at least, runs the contention of the United Nations officials
trying to confirm the Israeli army's retreat from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978, the Security Council
called on it to pull back to Lebanon's ``internationally recognized
boundaries.'' But by the time Israel eventually got around to doing
so last month, no one could agree any more on where the boundary
lay.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.N., trying to fudge the issue, invented a new, blue
``withdrawal line'' where it thought the border should run. In
theory, this semantic sleight-of-hand allows it to certify Israel's
compliance with the resolution without getting involved in the
difficulties of defining the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government, which already has to cope with
green, red, black and purple lines left behind by the country's
civil war, is reluctant to add another shade to the spectrum. It
argues that the new boundary leaves several chunks of Lebanese
territory inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.N. officials repeat the phrase ``without prejudice''
until their faces are as blue as their line, Lebanon is fearful
that it has next-to-no chance of securing a future readjustment. So
it insists that it will not allow U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the
border until the dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, says it will take a
few more days to make sure the Israelis are honoring the U.N.'s
line, but once that is in no doubt the peacekeepers must be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   After some hesitation, the Security Council has sided with him,
putting its seal of approval on the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Lebanon has won little sympathy for its case. Its
ally, Syria, at first pressed it to make things difficult for the
Israelis in the hope of luring them to joint peace talks. But the
death of Hafez Assad, Syria's president for 30 years, has left
Lebanon with a distracted backer at best.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the area in question is laughably small: all of the
alleged incursions, bar one, cover no more than a few hundred
square meters.
</P>
<P>
   The exception, known as the Shibaa farms, has, in the words of a
local shepherd, grass to graze 10,000 goats. But it falls within
the slice of Syria occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. argues, not unreasonably, that any adjustments to the
Syrian-Lebanese border can wait until the land reverts to Syrian
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with the weight of world opinion against it, the
Lebanese government will probably bow to the inevitable and accept
the U.N.'s writ. In the meantime, the border remains a potential
flash point.
</P>
<P>
   The government has petulantly refused to send its soldiers south
to take control. The Hezbollah guerrillas, who led the battle to
eject the Israelis, remain on the prowl, and have threatened to
resume fighting unless Israel accepts Lebanon's interpretation of
the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. troops manning roadblocks, a disgruntled, or hired,
Lebanese or Palestinian would not find it hard to shoot a rocket or
two over the border into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Such an incident, in turn, could provoke a return to the
conflict from which Lebanon and Israel have only just emerged. &QL;

<P>
   HARARE _ All he does is stuff envelopes for Zimbabwe's main
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But
since the MDC represents the first serious threat in 20 years to
President Robert Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, Deligent Marowa's humdrum
job is hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, six thugs kidnapped him at gunpoint, handcuffed him,
beat him, drove bicycle spokes up his urethra and left him for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he made it to a hospital. The same pistol-toting thugs
tried to abduct him from his sickbed, but fled when another patient
raised the alarm. Marowa can walk again, but he will never have
children.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal was intended to frighten Marowa into abandoning the
MDC. It had the opposite effect. Brandishing his X-rays like a
banner of protest, he declares: ``We have to throw these criminals
out of power. And we will.''
</P>
<P>
   In a free and fair election, the ruling party would stand no
chance. Mugabe's government is violent, corrupt, incompetent and
detested. But ZANU enjoys the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned media applaud its unrealistic manifesto _ free
land, free houses, jobs for all, cheap food and gasoline, and so on
and so forth _ while ``uncovering'' MDC plots to bring back
colonialism and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU receives public finance; opposition parties do not. A fifth
of the country's parliamentarians are appointed by the president.
Constituencies are gerrymandered, the electoral roll is out of
date, and a ZANU hack is in charge of the count.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite this head start, the ruling party could still lose
its majority (it currently controls 147 of the 150 seats).
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe himself does not have to run for re-election until 2002,
but a defeat for his party would weaken him considerably, and
perhaps even prompt ZANU to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, Mugabe is trying to terrorize the voters. He is
an old hand at this. When ZANU was a guerrilla movement, suspected
``sellouts'' had their ears and lips cut off.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1980, Mugabe would have won a free election,
but cheated anyway. His more violent followers prevented rivals
from campaigning in almost a third of the country, and murdered
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Mugabe's soldiers killed thousands of
dissidents in Matabeleland, and tortured many more.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign of intimidation has been less murderous,
but more systematic. Bands of ruffians, some of them veterans of
the liberation war, others merely pretending to be, have invaded
over 1,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders say they are reclaiming land stolen from their
ancestors by white colonialists, but they make little effort to
cultivate it. Instead, they beat up farm workers, burn their shacks
and force them to attend ZANU rallies _ where they are whipped if
they chant the slogans with insufficient ardor.
</P>
<P>
   All this is organized and paid for by the security services,
reportedly commanded by the man behind the Matabeleland atrocities,
a cousin of Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   Various cruelties have been inflicted on teachers, nurses and
others who, because they can read and write, are assumed to be
opposition supporters. At least 30 people have been killed, and
many women gang-raped. Worse will follow, or so goes the warning,
if ZANU loses the election.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Zimbabweans, however, refuse to be cowed. Despite
the perils, the MDC has put up candidates in every constituency.
Several of them, having been assaulted or threatened with death,
are in hiding. But still they campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where it is too dangerous to stick up MDC posters by
day, they do it stealthily by night, or drop leaflets from light
aircraft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Although the state media refuse to air their message, the
independent press continues to maul Mugabe, and nongovernmental
organizations spread the word that the ballot will be secret.
</P>
<P>
   Many farm workers, despite their welts and bruises, remain
quietly defiant. On a road between tobacco fields in rural Macheke,
the scene of several farm invasions, a freshly-beaten worker
muttered: ``The so-called veterans can't just carry us where they
want, as if we were bags.'' Another said: ``If it is time to die,
we can die.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at ZANU rallies is joyless. Despite generous
handouts of beer and T-shirts to those who show up, few do. Rows of
shiny portapotties stay fresh and unused. Sparse crowds clap
listlessly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MDC rallies throb with enthusiasm. Throngs of
people wave red cards to signal, in a footballing analogy, that it
is time Mugabe was sent off.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at ZANU rallies, especially Mugabe himself, blather on
about the party's heroic deeds during the liberation struggle, but
gloss over the two decades in which ZANU has been in charge of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some bigwigs are so out of touch that they are genuinely baffled
by their unpopularity. Vice President Simon Muzenda has told
disgruntled party members that they should vote for the candidates
ZANU chooses, even if ZANU were to choose a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? It is impossible to predict. Pessimists fear that
pluck and popularity will not be enough to defeat a cunning old
despot who is determined to use all the machinery of the state to
preserve his power.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists counter that Mugabe cheated during a referendum in
February, and still lost. This showed Zimbabweans that change was
possible, giving heart to the opposition. But it also jolted ZANU
out of its complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The party is cheating much more energetically now than before
the referendum. A recent opinion poll suggested that the MDC would
win 70 seats. This would give it a majority of the seats contested
but not, because of the 30 MPs Mugabe can appoint, a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation, the poll probably
underestimated opposition support.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the election result will depend on the answers to
two questions. First, will the presence of the international
observers, invited by Mugabe to maintain the illusion of fairness,
prevent excessive ballot-stuffing? They will be fairly sparse on
the ground; a large number of other would-be monitors have been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Second, has Mugabe's thuggery so frightened people that they
will be afraid to vote his party out of office? Or has it so
enraged them that they will risk its retribution? &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ ``The big American gas crunch is coming,'' says Mark
Papa, the boss of EOG, an American energy company.
</P>
<P>
   Angry American drivers, paying record prices for gasoline, may
think the crunch has come already. But the gas market suffering
this particular price shock is largely unaffected by gyrations in
oil price.
</P>
<P>
   Although few outside the industry have noticed, prices for
natural gas in the United States have shot up in the past year. The
rise has surprised even old industry hands.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, there was so much gas available that supply
consistently outpaced demand. Prices were soft and margins weak. No
longer. Supply is, at long last, becoming tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the gas consumed in America comes from domestic
sources or from neighboring Canada. Many of these fields are now
past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Denhardt of WEFA, an industry consultancy, reckons that the
rate at which output from America's offshore gas fields is
declining has risen in recent years, from below 20 percent a year
to well above 40 percent. That also means that firms investing in
new wells are extracting declining amounts of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand is soaring. As America's decaying power grid
groans under the annual strain of heat waves, such as a recent one
in California that led to blackouts in Silicon Valley, demand for
power is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic recent advances in gas-turbine technology, which have
made gas plants much less expensive than rival options, mean that
almost all new plants use gas. GE, the leading manufacturer of gas
turbines, has an order backlog several years long.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, gas now has cachet as a green fuel. Burning gas
produces fewer greenhouse gases than do other fossil fuels,
especially coal (coal-fired generation still makes up over half of
America's installed power base).
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's recent attacks on old coal
plants in the Midwest have spurred the dash to gas. Natural-gas
prices are also likely to remain high because of the decline in
stored gas.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, firms store a certain amount of gas to sell during
the cold months of winter, when demand for heating is strong. This
year, however, the amount of gas in storage has plunged, and
industry analysts say that shortfall will increase.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that firms, tempted by the current high prices,
are selling gas that they might otherwise have stored. Another,
says Denhardt, is that the growth of supply from decaying fields
has not kept pace with demand, so that there is simply less surplus
gas to store.
</P>
<P>
   In most commodity markets, soaring prices eventually bring an
adjustment of supply or demand. However, gas is unlike most
commodities, for it is difficult to handle and costly to store and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike oil, which can be transported in anything from gallon
jugs to gigantic tankers, gas usually requires extensive, expensive
pipelines to be in place from the wellhead all the way through to
customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one response that high prices produce in other
commodity markets _ a diversion of supplies from places where
prices are lower _ cannot happen easily.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is gas that is compressed into liquid form (LNG);
but this is so costly that it accounts for less than 1 percent of
America's gas.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. William McCormick, head of CMS Energy, which
runs America's biggest LNG terminal, says that prices for gas have
to be over $3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for LNG
imports to make economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident that gas prices will remain above that level
that he plans to increase his firm's terminal size by a third. He
reckons that LNG imports could, in time, make up 4-5 percent of
America's total supply.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this is that even higher prices may be on the
way. Some worry that prices may rise to the once unthinkable level
of $6 per mBtu.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, worries Paul Portney of Resources for the
Future, a respected think-tank, ``the federal government might then
step in, as it did in the 1970s, to regulate who can use gas
(homeowners and utilities, say) and who can't (industrial
customers, maybe).''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative possibility, described by Papa, is that the sheer
scarcity of gas could force demand down. Or worse, force it out: he
points to the recent flight to gas-rich Trinidad of a firm that
makes ammonia, an energy-intensive process, and insists that ``the
chemicals industry is next.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa's firm and others are lobbying the government for
permission to drill on federal land and on offshore sites that are
off limits. They would also love tax credits for exploration. But
for the moment, America's politicians seem too preoccupied with the
other ``gas'' crisis to heed such calls.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas will be a seller's market for some time to come. &QL;

   AMATA CITY AND SAMRONG _ They are cheap, educated, friendly and
fastidious, and Ralph-Rainer Ohlsen loves them.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles benignly at the women and men assembling BMW 318s and
328s in the light-flooded, squeaky-clean factory in Thailand's
Rayong province that he opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Thais even take their shoes off when they get in the
cars,'' he enthuses. ``It's great.'' That sort of thing never
happens at BMW's South African factory, which he previously ran;
nor, for that matter, at its Dingolfing plant in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford last year and GM in April, BMW is the latest western
carmaker to set up in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem odd in a country where car sales plummeted by 70
percent during the Asian crisis and production is still well below
pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new study of the car market in the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) by the Economist Intelligence
Unit, a sister company of The Economist, suggests that car sales in
the region will return to pre-crisis levels only after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and Europeans come to Thailand with a vision that
differs from that of the Japanese companies which dominate the
region. Whereas the Japanese treat each ASEAN country as a distinct
market, the Americans and Europeans are planning for a day when
trade is free across the region.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jochen Legewie, a car expert at the German
Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, this ``power shift'' away
from the Japanese, who today make nine out of ten cars and trucks
sold in ASEAN, towards western producers will prove the biggest
force for change in the economics and politics of car-making in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for westerners is global economies of scale. If they
reach it, the Japanese will lose out.
</P>
<P>
   Visit, for instance, the factory of Toyota in Samrong, an hour
north of Bangkok, and you see trucks unloading Thai parts from Thai
suppliers for assembly lines that make cars for Thai consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At Toyota's plants in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia,
it is the same story. Everywhere in the region, Toyota and other
Japanese carmakers have, in effect, recreated a whole supply chain
in order to serve the local market.
</P>
<P>
   This is inefficient, and Toyota, for one, is losing money in the
region. But the Japanese have had little choice, because politics
has dictated their Asian strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN countries used to subscribe to import substitution as a
development philosophy, and to burden foreign investors with
onerous local-content requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Some also have their own ``national'' car projects, such as
Malaysia's Proton, and are hostile to foreign competition. Tariffs
on cars and car parts, high to begin with, went higher still during
the crisis of the late 1990s, as countries tried in vain to
conserve hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched American trade unionists bash Japanese cars in
Detroit in the 1980s, says Yoshiaki Muramatsu, president of Toyota
in Thailand, the Japanese decided to follow a strategy of
``harmonious growth'' in the region, in effect sacrificing bigger
economies of scale to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes of liberalizing trade in ASEAN have revived. Since
1996, companies in ASEAN have been able to apply for a reduction in
tariffs on parts traded within the region. But the bureaucracies
empowered to grant the reductions have tended to block any
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hope now is for an Asian Free-Trade Area (AFTA) to
take effect in January 2002. If it goes ahead, tariffs on cars and
parts will be limited to a ceiling of 5 percent, low enough to
allow the development of a genuine pan-regional marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is this prospect that so excites the western companies. GM,
for instance, plans to export up to 90 percent of the Zafira vans
that it makes at its Thai factory to the rest of the region, and
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now makes several models with sub-optimal efficiency, but
it has designed its plant to convert to making one model highly
efficiently for export around the region.
</P>
<P>
   As for BMW, it sees three phases for its plant. In the first, it
makes cars for Thailand, in the second it expands production and
starts exporting, and in the third it sources from, and exports to,
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all depends on AFTA going ahead, says Ohlsen. ``If
phases two and three happen, it's a hat-trick,'' he says. ``I'm
convinced it won't go pear-shaped.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much rides on trade liberalization, westerners are
lobbying hard for it. Kitcha Minakan, a director at Thailand's
Ministry of Industry, says ``the Japanese come and ask what our
laws are and then try to please us. The Europeans look at our laws,
say they cannot abide by them entirely, but then try as much as
possible. But the Americans come in and say, ``This is all wrong,
you have to change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Minakan and Thailand will not be the biggest obstacles
to AFTA, because Thailand, as the production base of choice for the
westerners, has the most to gain from liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   The main foot-dragger will be Malaysia, which fears for its
Proton. But the westerners are undaunted. They look forward to
being able to put their factories wherever the combination of
labor, suppliers and transport works best, and to export from them
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical point. Their way is different from ours,''
says Toyota's Muramatsu. ``We must study how we, too, can enjoy
further liberalization.'' That is as close as a Japanese executive
ever comes to saying, ``We are worried.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Company executives in search of wisdom are turning
from psychotherapy and religion to the cleverest thinkers of all:
ancient philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   For corporations, philosophy has become the latest management
fad.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morris, author of ``If Aristotle Ran General Motors: The New
Soul of Business,'' earns $30,000 an hour _ one of the highest fees
for a non-celebrity speaker in America _ for teaching Socrates and
Hegel to the likes of IBM, Campbell Soup, General Electric and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marinoff, who wrote a popular book published last autumn,
called ``Plato, not Prozac! Applying Philosophy to Everyday
Problems,'' is spearheading the rise of ``philosophy counselling,''
which has roots in Europe in the early 1980s but is new to America.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff has founded the grand-sounding American Philosophical
Practitioners Association, which has trained around 70 philosophy
counsellors so far and has backing from a local assemblyman to
certify the practice in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff, who charges $100 an hour (in line with
clinical-psychology rates), says many of his clients are
``refugees'' from psychology and psychiatry. ``Philosophy deals
with big questions _ purpose, ethics, moral quandaries _ without
messing up their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Alain de Botton's best-seller, ``How Proust Can
Change Your Life,'' has spawned an agony column in a Sunday
newspaper. His latest book, ``The Consolations of Philosophy,''
pops philosophers like pills: take Socrates for unpopularity,
Epicurus for lack of money, Seneca for frustration and Montaigne
for inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton, being a cerebral sort of chap (and much consoled by
making a successful television series on his book), has not yet
moved seriously into the business of management counselling. When
he does, he will find that there is now a brand-new market for the
sages: failed Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher McCullough, a self-styled ``clinical philosopher''
based in San Francisco, says that half his practice consists of
``manic start-up types who can smell the money, but see it
disappearing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who runs a philosophy cafe in a local Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookshop and is soon opening his own cafe, prescribes the example
of Epictetus, a noted Stoic philosopher, to teach people how to
stay serene when they have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Epictetus is just the thing for those with underwater stock
options. He led a life of exemplary contentment, simplicity and
virtue, living in a small hut furnished with only a bed and a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's success in prescribing him suggests that
high-achieving entrepreneurs prefer intellectual discussion to
treatment for depression or anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much less tissue and couch use in philosophy
counselling,'' says McCullough. ``And I have more room to be
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Socrates, he must be guffawing in his tomb. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bloodletting of the 1910-17 revolution led to the
emergence in the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), power in Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in
which the incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose
subsequent electoral victory was a formality, achieved when
necessary by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July 2 a
historic event.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is uncertain. After months of campaigning, the
latest opinion polls give only the narrowest of leads to the PRI's
Francisco Labastida over Vicente Fox of the opposition National
Action Party (PAN). The leftish Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trails in third
place.
</P>
<P>
   But if Fox has at least a chance of winning, it is also because
of a second big change. This is the first presidential election to
be supervised not by the government but by an independent institute
whose probity is accepted by all.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough to ensure a clean vote? A swelling chorus
has arisen recently to complain that the PRI has been up to its old
tricks, showering voters with largesse (ranging from washing
machines to bicycles and cash) and threats (to withdraw
anti-poverty funds from opposition supporters, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Such reports should be kept in perspective: even the opposition
says their effect is confined to relatively few voters, mainly in
rural areas. Even so, such tactics are worrying: in a tight
election, they may prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to hope for is thus that the election should
produce a clean and clear winner, relieving Mexico of protracted
dispute about the result.
</P>
<P>
   But better still if that winner were to be Fox. He is not
without flaws. He combines stubbornness with an impulsive tendency
to flip-flop on issues. Some Mexicans are offended by his rude
language; others by his militant Catholicism and his opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two overriding reasons for desiring an opposition
victory. First, it would, almost by definition, complete Mexico's
transition from one-party state to plural democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And the alternation of power would be beneficial in itself,
because many of Mexico's problems stem from the fusing by the PRI
of the functions and interests of party, state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Fox, a former businessman (and Coca-Cola manager) looks,
on balance, to be the candidate likeliest to push forward with the
reforms his country needs. That is not immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   However slowly, Mexico has changed much in the past 20 years,
especially under President Ernesto Zedillo. That is not least
because of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
is drawing the country's economy, and perhaps its politics, into
ever-closer association with those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the currency collapse and deep recession of 1994-95,
Zedillo has started to put Mexico on the road to sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic management has been less opaque than in the past.
So, too, has been the selection of the PRI's candidate: Labastida
was chosen by an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Provided the election comes off cleanly, those changes have
increased the chance that this year Mexico will avoid the economic
or political crises that have marked the start of the past four
presidential terms _ despite some signs of economic overheating,
and worries about the possible impact of a slowing economy north of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's record, and the PRI's adaptability, might seem to be
strong arguments for Labastida. He is an experienced politician
known for his negotiating skills, though he is not a liberal
technocrat like Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But change and its benefits have been distributed unequally. If
all Mexicans are to get full value from NAFTA and from economic
growth, their next president needs to complement an emerging
democracy with a market economy and a reformed state. That involves
separating political and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is still burdened by the PRI's corporatist history: the
state let favored businessmen enrich themselves in return for
political loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   One costly result was a banking crisis which deprived most
Mexicans of credit during Zedillo's term, and left a bill of $100
billion for bailing out the banks (and some of the bankers).
</P>
<P>
   Another has been a monopolized economy. State monopolies still
control electricity distribution and oil. A privatized
near-monopoly, Telmex (whose boss, Carlos Slim, is Latin America's
richest man), has used its political clout to delay a fully
competitive telecoms market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mutual backscratching, Mexico needs impartial
regulation of its economy to promote competition, and deregulation
of government, and also, in some ways, its expansion: petty
officialdom still exacts its venal toll, while the state does far
too little to give its poorest citizens decent schooling and
health.
</P>
<P>
   The next government also needs to do much more to combat crime,
corruption and powerful drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida claims to help those who suffer from change. But as
the chief beneficiary of the old ways, the PRI is unlikely to be as
vigorous in trying to abolish them as Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the election will probably face a Congress divided
three ways, as it has been since 1997. Governing Mexico will thus
not be easy; reforming it harder still. That is another reason for
wishing the election to be both clear-cut and clean. &QL;

<P>
   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, the proportion of the world's
population that lives in countries that can claim to be broadly
democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 120 out of the world's 190 or so states can now
plausibly claim to have democracies.
</P>
<P>
   If you think, with Winston Churchill, that although democracy
has its flaws, it is the least bad political system yet invented,
this offers genuine cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, next week a ``World Forum on Democracy'' will meet
in Poland, organized privately by Freedom House (an American
pro-democracy think-tank) and a Polish foundation, but hosted by
the Polish government. It will be addressed by such luminaries as
Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state, and Kofi Annan,
the secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a parallel meeting, foreign ministers from more than 100
countries will discuss ways of further strengthening the democratic
cause. &QL;

<P>
   And there is even better news on the way, if you believe the
Internet enthusiasts. Direct democracy through computerized voting
at home is a long way off virtually everywhere, given still-low
levels of Internet access in most countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Net, and associated advances in communications
technology, could soon have a beneficial effect on government, as
people begin to press for public services to be delivered or
administered online, and then to demand the same standards of
service _ speed, reliability, courtesy, innovation _ from their
local or national governments as they do from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If voters can force their governments to treat them like
customers, rather than just as cattle who are fed nicely every few
years when an election happens along, it will add a powerful new
pressure for democratic accountability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is all moving pleasingly in the right direction. Yet there
are also forces pressing in less benign ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, progress is not always permanent. From time to
time, countries that were democracies, or looked like becoming
them, lapse into their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Recently two Pacific tiddlers, the Solomon Islands and Fiji,
disappeared from Freedom House's list of electoral democracies
after coups or other mayhem. Pakistan was counted as one for a
time, albeit of a rough and not very ready sort, until General
Pervez Musharraf took over the reins of power last October.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, however, a more sinister phenomenon, one which
bears more thought than it usually gets. Freedom House and the
other organizers of next week's meetings are well aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory number of 120 or so broad, electoral democracies
includes a considerable list of countries whose citizens are far
from free, in the true sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom House's own rankings count only 86 countries as properly
free. Which, since more than 100 will be at the meetings, means
that there will be quite a number of impostors at the feast.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic way of putting this is that some countries are
``in transition'' towards full democracy, and that conferences like
this, with all the public exposure and discussion that they bring,
can help jostle them along that path.
</P>
<P>
   It will persuade them that ballot boxes may be necessary for
democracy, but are far from sufficient: you also need free speech
and a free press; an independent judiciary; and, supervised by that
judiciary, the impartial enforcement of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is an example of a transition in progress, though it has
been painfully slow. Indonesia is finding it hard to establish
proper judging and policing overnight after decades of
dictatorship, let alone a full set of legitimate laws and a
clear-out of corruption. Yet with help, patience and encouragement,
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can. But often it isn't, and willfully so. For another
good word for the many partial democracies is this: phoneys.
</P>
<P>
   They are not as phoney as the old Soviet Union, with its 99.999
percent votes for Comrade Stalin. But in some ways they are worse,
because their appearances deceive.
</P>
<P>
   And, increasingly, the suspicion must be that the deception is
deliberately designed to gain just enough respectability to attract
private foreign capital, and to qualify more readily for the public
sort, from multilateral bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the phoneys have been exposed. Peru, whose President
Alberto Fujimori recently rigged his (unconstitutional)
re-election, is one of them; Haiti, its democracy supposedly
restored by American intervention in 1994, is another.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a cleverer deceiver, and has been more prone in
post-Soviet times to be given the benefit of the doubt. Now, the
doubts about its newly elected president, Vladimir Putin, are
mounting, both because of the way he was elected in March and
because of his conduct since.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting a western capital, such as Berlin last week, he
plays the democratic part. Back in Moscow, however, the script
changes and things begin to become murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, too, is a phoney, despite its noisy shunning of the
IMF. Its prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, abides by democratic
procedures (and was re-elected in November), yet meanwhile has
imprisoned his chief rival (Anwar Ibrahim, whose wife will speak at
the Forum) on trumped up charges, has throttled the press and has
suborned the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Is this worse than no democracy at all?
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's vote this weekend may yet prove, despite all the
violence and rigging, that the right to vote can still be made to
count. Yet it can often be worse, for the strongman, with his
rigged press and gagged courts, gains a form of international
approval _ and even money _ adding to the frustration, and perhaps
eventual violence, of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to use words as plainly as possible. Call a phoney a
phoney. &QL;

STUDENT MAJORITY CANNOT COERCE MINORITY TO PRAY 
</HEADLINE>

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 19, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school
districts cannot authorize students to lead prayers at school
football games (Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe). It
is a sweeping decision that follows the core meaning of the
Establishment Clause _ a government entity cannot support or
endorse a religion and coerce those who do not believe in that
religion to participate in its worship.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling follows the rationale of the high court's 1992
decision (Lee vs. Weisman) which found graduation prayers a
violation of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at the underbelly of this case shows what can happen when
a school district puts its seal of approval on a particular
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the pseudonym ``Doe'' in the title of the case was
used to protect the Catholic and Mormon students who brought this
case to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Independent School District is a political
subdivision of Texas, governed by an elected, seven-person Board of
Trustees. The trustees apparently take the word ``Independent'' in
the name of their district too seriously. They openly allowed
prayer at graduation, despite the Supreme Court's 1992 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district court that first heard this case noted that
one of the student plaintiffs, Jane Doe II was ridiculed by her
seventh-grade history teacher when he found out she is a Mormon.
The teacher, according to court documents, ``launched into a
diatribe about the non-Christian, cult-like nature of Mormonism and
its general evils.'' Jane Doe II's classmates picked up the
religious prejudice of the teacher and called her faith ``evil''
and ``kind of like the KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district even tried to find out the names of the
students who had filed the lawsuit _ presumably to harass them into
dropping the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The district court had to warn the school administration,
teachers and other school employees to cease trying ``to ferret out
the identities of the plaintiffs'' or ``face the harshest possible
contempt sanctions from this court, and may additionally face
criminal liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The court explained it ``wants these proceedings addressed on
their merits, and not on the basis of intimidation or harassment of
the participants on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a warning is extremely rare and speaks volumes about
religious arrogance and intolerance in circumstances where a
religious majority thinks it has a right to harass, belittle and
treat religious minorities as if they do not matter. This is
precisely the underlying reason for the Establishment Clause _ to
keep religious liberty free of the tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights
cannot be overturned by the vote of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Santa Fe school district enacted a policy entitled
``Prayer at Football Games'' that allowed high school students to
vote to choose whether to ``deliver a prayer at varsity football
games.'' And then vote to determine who would deliver those
prayers. Apparently, the school district thought if students
conducted the prayers, the policy and district would be insulated
from a constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A later policy omits the word ``prayer'' and substitutes
``messages'' and ``invocations'' _ another transparent attempt to
get around the meaning of the Establishment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   The school district argued there was no government coercion of
students to participate in religious observances because the
invocations at football games was a product of student elections.
And further, there was no coercion because students didn't have to
attend their school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The district also argued the invocations were merely to
solemnize the football games. Whatever happened to singing the
``Star Spangled Banner''? one might legitimately ask.
</P>
<P>
   And most ridiculously, the district argued that these
``messages'' are private student speech, not public speech. Prayer
intoned over a loud speaker system at a school function cannot be,
by any stretch of the imagination, classified as private speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, as interpreted by the high court, has never
prohibited public school students from voluntarily engaging in
private prayer during school hours. But prayer boomed out at a
football game is anything but private.
</P>
<P>
   None of the federal courts _ from district court to appellate
court to the Supreme Court _ were fooled by such obvious ploys.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion for the 6-3
majority. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a dissent which was
joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that the football game policy was voted on by the
district trustees. In other words, the district gave the students
permission to deliver prayers at games. He also noted the prayers
were delivered at a school function on school property using school
sound equipment _ all under school control. People who attended
these varsity football games would understandably think the prayers
given at the games were sponsored or endorsed by the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   High school football games in many small towns in Texas are
events which bring out the entire community. It isn't fair to
students in the religious minority to be subjected to the religious
majority's prayers in order to attend their own school's football
games and see their friends play.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote: ``School sponsorship of a religious message is
impermissible because it sends the ancillary message to members of
the audience who are nonadherents `that they are outsiders, not
full members of the political community, and an accompanying
message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the
political community.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping conclusion, the decision states: ``Through its
election scheme, the district has established a governmental
electoral mechanism that turns the school into a forum for
religious debate. It further empowers the student body majority
with the authority to subject students of minority views to
constitutionally improper messages. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a system encourages divisiveness along religious lines
and threatens the imposition of coercion upon those students not
desiring to participate in a religious exercise. Simply by
establishing this school-related procedure, which entrusts the
inherently nongovernmental subject of religion to a majoritarian
vote, a constitutional violation has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That essentially means the court will strike down any school
district policy that authorizes public school students to vote to
deliver prayers at a school function.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the court understand the meaning of the
Establishment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   There is no hope for Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas on this issue.
They simply ignore constitutional history. Their vote would allow
government policies that fracture communities along religious
lines, which inevitably leads to intolerance and religious
persecution.

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Three months after Vladimir Putin won Russia's presidency, some
ugly things have been happening in his benighted country.
</P>
<P>
   The new man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip.
He has sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former
vassal states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening
towards Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command.
</P>
<P>
   He has told the leaders of the outlying regions within Russia
that they must step back into the Kremlin's line _ or else. And he
has frightened the press by resorting to the bullying of media
groups and journalists critical of the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the owner of the only independent nationwide
television station, Vladimir Gusinsky, was arrested earlier this
month, and freed without charge a few days later, amid
flimsy-sounding allegations of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire country presumed that Putin, who breezily
denied foreknowledge of the arrest, simply wanted to silence the
voice of opposition. Yet, despite all this, it is still possible to
paint a less bleak picture.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years with the wayward Boris Yeltsin fitfully in
charge, Russians _ it can be argued _ need an energetic,
clear-minded leader to restore to their country some direction,
discipline and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Putin has a cooperative parliament that
broadly backs a coalition government in which economic reformers
seem to have been given their head.
</P>
<P>
   Already, for instance, a bold law has been enacted to reduce
income tax to 13 percent across the board, in the hope of bringing
millions of tax-dodgers back into the revenue net.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin's approach to foreigners may also be reaping rewards:
stalled arms-cutting deals with America are again being struck.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, western leaders are giving a new Russian czar the
benefit of doubt. If those good things come with nasty addenda,
such as an upsurge of authoritarian intolerance at home and a
crescendo of snarls abroad, that _ so the Putin-boosters argue _ is
the price to be paid for reviving a humiliated and pauperized
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it will be better for the world if the country
becomes prosperous and confident, however roughly that is achieved.
Only then, say those who see the merit of Putin a la Pinochet,
might Russia become something it has never been _ a law-based and
liberal society.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the rub. Can Russia become prosperous without first
entrenching a proper legal system to underpin a genuine free
market?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is still unclear how, or indeed whether, Putin
intends to fulfill his promise to bring to justice the influential
tycoons who have gobbled up so much of the state's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, an independent judiciary, without the say-so of the
president, would simply set about prosecuting all cases of
corruption, starting with the most blatant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even if Putin were sincere in his wish to clean
up, he would probably not at this early stage in his presidency
have the power to do so _ without recourse to strong-arm methods
that are themselves illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Gusinsky, no angel despite his courage as chief
upholder of a free press, reeks of despotism. But if, for instance,
the Putin-prompted prosecutors were instead to take on Boris
Berezovsky, widely seen as the most malign and powerful of the
plutocrats, the action might reasonably be regarded as just as
politically inspired.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the taming of the oligarchs appears to be all about
power play and very little about justice.
</P>
<P>
   It is early days. In the three months since the election, Putin
has moved cautiously, apart from the rash attack on Gusinsky, which
may turn out to have been his first big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his critics' suspicions, and his defenders' hopes, it
is still unclear whether the new president is an autocrat or a
democrat, his own man or the servant of others.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it is unclear whether he is keen to collude with
the tycoons, several of whom helped him to power, or to cut them
down. At present, his emerging team is a rum mix of economic
reformers, former KGB people and tycoons. In any event, outsiders
probably have little influence at present.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes clear that Putin's desire to bring strong
government to his people means trashing their rights, then Russia's
expulsion from the Council of Europe is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He should certainly not be allowed to believe that the West
would merely wink at greater authoritarianism. On the other hand, a
concerted effort to encourage the judiciary to uphold the rule of
law impartially should be warmly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no government money from the West should go to
Putin's Russia. A better home for western cash can be found among
the more hopeful countries on Russia's rim.
</P>
<P>
   Things may change, but, for the time being at least, Putin
remains on probation. &QL;

<P>
   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it
took 3 percent of gross world product; now, says a new report from
the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising.
</P>
<P>
   That is reasonable: as people and countries get richer and
older, they naturally want to spend more of their incomes on
health, as on other services.
</P>
<P>
   But health is not as simple as, say, hairdressing: how the
system is organized and paid for critically affects what you get
for your money. That makes international comparisons of health care
extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report, which tries for the first time to rank
countries' performance, is thus welcome. Governments and
health-care providers have much to learn from studying the
structure and performance of other countries' health systems.
</P>
<P>
   But what may matter more for public policy than the rankings in
the WHO report are four more general conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the lack of any clear connection between inputs
(more spending, say) and desired outputs (better health). There is
only a tenuous link between health-care spending and broader
measures of health: if the latter are the goal, spending more on
things like housing or education often does more to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   But even on health-care systems' own ground, the WHO cites
evidence of hugely wasteful spending. Those governments that appear
to think that more money is all that is needed to improve
health-care performance should think again: structural and
management reforms to raise efficiency can count for a lot more
than cash.
</P>
<P>
   The low ranking of America in the WHO tables supports this view
_ for America spends far more on health than any other country. Yet
the main reason for dissatisfaction with America's performance is
not its extravagance: it is the numbers of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans with health insurance, as the WHO report says, the
system is highly responsive and impressive. But the poor health
care dished out to the 44 million-odd Americans who lack any
regular health-insurance coverage drags down the country's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the second conclusion: if the American system (and that of
other countries with similar gaps) is to improve, some way must be
found to spread insurance coverage, whether publicly or privately
financed, across the whole population.
</P>
<P>
   A third conclusion is that health-care delivery, as opposed to
finance, is showing some encouraging signs of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   From the purchaser/provider split in Britain's National Health
Service to America's health-maintenance organizations, countries
are moving in the direction of a form of ``managed care,'' in which
doctors, hospitals and other providers operate within certain
budget constraints, and there is some effort to foster both
consumer choice and producer competition.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to yoke a form of market forces into the
health-care business is well worth pursuing, even if professionals
and their trade unions squeal about it.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth conclusion is that the boundaries between public and
private health care should be eroded. As the WHO report complains,
health ministries tend to look solely at public health-care
systems, ignoring the role that private provision and finance can
play.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, public finance, whether from taxes or from
social insurance, is likely to predominate in health care; but it
need not obstruct private insurance or some out-of-pocket spending,
which can be useful safety valves, especially for people in rich
countries who wish to spend more than their governments would like.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should there be a rigid demarcation between public and
private providers: distinctions are better drawn over
responsiveness and efficiency than over ownership. For most of us,
after all, health care is far too important to be left to the
state. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Strange bedfellows are part of the California
scene. Even so, the sight of car companies, oil firms and
environmentalists snuggling up together seems a bit odd; even odder
is the idea of them coming out in favor of an idea normally
associated with right-wing economists.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, the California Environmental Dialogue, a new
32-member group including General Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the
Sierra Club and Environmental Defense, published a paper on the
state's transport policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the CED proposes in its paper is pretty tame stuff
_ patching up rickety bridges before they become unsafe, buses for
the young, old and infirm, more bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   But endorsing the principle that the ``user should pay'' for
road use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' is a first for the big oil and car firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine the CED coalition coming apart over
more of the details. But its existence is a good indication of the
growing controversy over Californian sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   After little investment in infrastructure for 25 years, the
state's transport system is groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses complain about potential employees turning down job
offers that would compel them to spend hours a day commuting. Car
makers worry that unless air quality improves they will be ordered
to meet yet stricter design standards.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing has long been championed by economists, keen to
impose more of the external costs of driving on road-users by
charging them a fee that reflects not just the distance travelled
(which is loosely what gasoline taxes do) but also the time and
route of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Driving imposes a heavier burden of externalities when it is
done at rush hour (it adds to delays and is less energy-efficient)
so such journeys ought to cost a driver more. In theory, drivers
will then adjust their departure times and smooth out the flow of
traffic through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have been understandably nervous about any system
that charges their customers. But motorists are a tolerant lot. Car
ownership and use has continued to rise even as road-building
levelled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Greens too are much more willing nowadays to accept ``market''
solutions to environmental problems: witness the growth in
emissions trading.
</P>
<P>
   The most nervous people are probably politicians. Voters seem to
tolerate tolls to finance the construction of roads _ the sort of
thing levied on some bridges and roads. But charging money
specifically to discourage driving is a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers' groups, such as the American Automobile Association,
are firmly opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a state senator from
Los Angeles, argues that charging money for what are currently free
roads would be unfair on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing, he says, is a middle-class fantasy dreamed up by
``some dweeb in a dark room doing quantitative analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The dweebs say their critics oversimplify things. Bob Poole, of
the libertarian Reason Foundation, points out that, rather than
just imposing new charges on currently free but crowded roads,
California could make use of its network of (largely unpopular and
underused) high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on roads: these could
be opened to single drivers who choose to pay a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California is home to two of America's four working
examples of high-occupancy toll lanes or HOTs (the other ones are
in Texas and Florida). One, SR-91 in Orange County, allows drivers
to pay an amount that depends on the time of day to jump into an
HOV lane.
</P>
<P>
   The other, on Interstate 15 north of San Diego, is closer to the
theoreticians' dream of adjusting price to demand: its fee varies
from 50 cents to $4, depending on the volume of traffic in the HOT
lane, with the current price flashed up on screens half a mile
before the lane starts. (An electronic transponder system means
that there is no need to stop at a toll booth.)
</P>
<P>
   HOT lanes have generally been well received once drivers
understand them. But the opportunities to install them are limited
to places with existing HOV lanes. And they will not change the
overall pattern of behavior in California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the complaints, average commuting time remained
stable through the 1990s, but the average distance travelled grew.
People seem to like living further away from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their main response to any easing in congestion is to go
and live even further away. That psychology will take more than
road-pricing to change. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's quadrennial search for a designated
mourner at the funerals of foreign dignitaries _ otherwise known as
the vice president _ is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Short-lists are being drawn up. Short-lists are being narrowed
down. Candidates are being grilled by selection teams. Candidates
are being grilled on television. Candidates are filling in endless
forms, hoping to avoid unexpectedly embarrassing their boss later
on.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is taking place against the traditional frenzied
speculation that is the inevitable consequence of not having much
else to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some current hopefuls, together with their main
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bush side: Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania? Too pro-choice.
(The Republican right might stampede.)
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth of Missouri? Too dignified. (He makes Bush look
shallow. Anyway, he's ruled himself out.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole? Uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   John Kasich of Ohio? Looks like a boy scout.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keating of Oklahoma? Said homicide is the best way to deal
with an unfriendly State teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   It is not much better for Gore: His front-runner is Evan Bayh.
Very telegenic. Very handsome. Very much an unknown from Indiana.
Very like Dan Quayle (though with more brains).
</P>
<P>
   How about Dianne Feinstein of California? Too married: her
husband has business dealings with China _ not ideal for a vice
president who shudders each time he hears ``Buddhist temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, then? Never been elected to anything in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary? Just kidding. The last
batch of military secrets lost by his Los Alamos laboratories were
later found behind the photocopying machine. You couldn't invent
that kind of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   A natural reaction is to say that none of it matters anyway. The
last time a vice president made a difference in an election was in
1960, when Lyndon Johnson helped deliver Texas to John Kennedy in a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   If George Bush senior could anoint Quayle vice president and
still get elected in 1988, then his son could appoint a plasticine
chicken in 2000 and not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The only person to whom the appointment seems to make any
difference is the appointee him- or herself.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, with the exception of Quayle, all vice presidential
candidates who have later sought their party's nomination for
president have got it. But so what? Except for President Bush, they
all lost the subsequent election.
</P>
<P>
   So is the veepstakes the creation of bored pundits with too much
time on their hands? Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there is a slim chance the choice of running mate
could actually make a difference. It would not do so directly, as
LBJ did. Hardly anyone has the sort of favorite-son status that can
deliver big blocks of votes. But it could do so indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom he chooses, George W. Bush could alter the
dynamic of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far the debate has focused on what a potential number two can
add to a ticket (with the general answer being, not much). But the
question can also be posed in a different way: will the choice
transform the way that the number one is seen?
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, it is hard to see how. He has a well-defined national
reputation anyway, which cannot be transformed at a stroke. And the
pool of Democratic heavyweights who could make a difference is
small.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, for instance, whom he defeated in the primaries,
would not make much of an impact, even if he were persuadable.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not true of Bush. It is easy to forget when you look
at the Gore campaign, but Bush is the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   He has things to prove in the campaign, of which the most
important are that he has national stature, not just state-wide
popularity, and that he is more than just the choice of the
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He can make both points at once by picking as his running mate
someone of real substance from outside the charmed circle of the
Bush dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Only two men fit the bill. The first is that perennial favorite,
Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
has relentlessly refused attempts to lure him into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Were Bush to persuade Powell to join him, it would be a stunning
coup. The harsh fact remains, though, that there are no signs of
the general changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the lure of a man who could also transform peoples'
opinions of Bush and may be (slightly) more temptable: John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The important point about McCain is not that he has a track
record of attracting independents, though that is obviously not to
be sneered at.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it that he (again like Powell) provides Bush with
credibility in foreign affairs. Nor is it even that McCain can
savage Gore on the embarrassing campaign-finance irregularities of
the 1996 election _ though that again is useful.
</P>
<P>
   No, the main value of choosing McCain is what it tells voters
about Bush. It suggests that Bush really can, as he claims, show
leadership, by persuading an independent politician, with a mind of
his own, to choose to run with him.
</P>
<P>
   It says he is a man of the center, not just because he makes a
lot of speeches about compassionate conservatism but because he has
picked someone whom conservatives loathe.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it implies he can work with people who do not agree with
him on everything and who do not kowtow to the Bush name-brand.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an essential attribute of governing in the next
administration, because one of the few near-certainties of 2001 is
that whichever party ends up with a majority in Congress will do so
by only the narrowest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to demonstrate your capacity to work with
opponents _ and distinguish yourself from Gore, who has a
reputation for divisiveness _ than to appoint a man who was, until
recently, trying to bash the living daylights out of you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain, still smarting from the bitter primary
campaign, says he does not want the job. That only increases the
prize. Bush's ability to persuade him to accept it would speak even
more loudly for his claim to be able to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership, after all, does not consist of selectively rewarding
those who want to please you. Rather, it means persuading someone
to do something they do not want to do for the sake of the greater
good _ or in this case, for your own electability. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: World of difference separates
groups at execution
 &HT;    EDs: This is a re-worked version of a news feature that moved
last week.
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas -- Outside the walls of Huntsville prison, the
distance was hardly a hundred yards that divided the two designated
camps, those opposing the execution of Gary Graham and those
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all the difference in the world -- the difference
between good and evil, truth and lies, justice and injustice, black
and white.
</P>
<P>
   Which was which depended on who you were and where you stood.
</P>
<P>
   G. George, 40, of Houston, who was holding high a sign that
said, ``Send Graham to Hell,'' knew where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   George, who identified his occupation only as being employed
inside the city of Houston, had been to protests before, but not in
a long time -- not since he was a little boy ``being dragged
around'' by his parents at Vietnam rallies in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when you ask him, he'll tell you he can't even remember
which side his parents were on.
</P>
<P>
   What he will tell you is that he wants to go back to that era as
far as Texas prisons are concerned, a time of ``electric chairs and
hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to eat, let them grow their own food. If they
want clothes, let them make their own. That's the way it used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``Everything is out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, under a banner saying ``Give Innocence A
Chance,'' Lynn Furay, 67, also of Houston, looked exactly what she
was, a gray-haired, retired school teacher very much out of place
among those protesting the execution.
</P>
<P>
   But her feelings were the same as theirs: ``I'm against the
death penalty and in this case I think Graham did not have a fair
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1989, when she moved to Houston from Michigan,
where there is no death penalty, that she became an activist.
Before that, ``I really didn't think about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a taxpayer, she said that she felt that she was ``in
cahoots with Texas executions'' unless she took a stand against it.
</P>
<P>
   Furay said she writes letters, lobbies, is very political but
also ``very bashful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being here,'' she said, ``but I think it is an
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaleb Ortiz, 29, a senior majoring in criminal justice at Sam
Houston State University in Huntsville, didn't seem at all bashful
about standing next to someone waving the Confederate Battle Flag.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a group like the Klan wouldn't have someone like
him, an Hispanic, for a member. Neither would the Nation of Islam
or the New Black Panthers, who were among those protesting across
the way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who said he had visited both camps, ``can't hate anyone.
God loves everyone here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes speaking like a lawyer, sometimes like a preacher,
Ortiz said in any ``man-made'' system of justice there would be
instances of the innocent being punished and the guilty going free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say,'' he added, ``that in this particular case, I
think the state is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Another young man, age 24, was of the opposite opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a mask fashioned from a mechanic's dirty red rag, he
declined to give his name, acknowledging only that he was a member
of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was there because he was ``very much aware of what is
happening to young black men,'' that ``they are being shot at,
arrested and harassed by racist police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under communism,'' he said, ``there wouldn't be a death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although white himself, he had suffered similarly, ``mainly
because they (police) didn't like the way I looked.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he said he came to realize ``you need an
organization to spearhead the struggle for human rights for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't here to riot, ``but I'm not here to get beat
up either.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the masses of people here, I don't know what might happen
if the execution goes ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime before the execution went ahead, the young man went to
jail, chased down as he was running through police lines and waving
a giant red flag.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Ray, 48, a bookseller from Conroe, Texas, was here to
wave the Confederate flag and hold a sign that said, ``Die N-Word
Die.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he came because he was ``tired of the media glorifying
Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you will excuse me for saying so,'' he told a group of
reporters, ``the media has been acting like dogs in heat.''
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures in the 90s, the heat of the late afternoon had
members of the New Black Panthers using a Texas flag to wipe the
sweat from their faces, then throwing it down in the dust of the
street and stomping it with their boots.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Ashanti Chimurengh, a gray-haired black woman and a
member of the Gary Graham Justice Coalition, was speaking to the
crowd over a loud speaker, flanked by pictures of George Bush and
the message, ``The burning Bush burns black men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two black men children and everyday I face the fear of
them being killed by racist cops. Everyday we face it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what will happen today, but I'm a warrior
princess, and we're going to win this g_d_ war.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is important that whatever happens we must take this
struggle forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It was later that night that what was scheduled to happen, after
several legal delays, happened _ and nothing said or done outside
the walls of Huntsville prison had made any difference.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, in the months leading up the November presidential
election, it's scheduled to continue to happen on an average of
almost one a week.

<P>
   BEIRUT _ When is a border less than a border? When it is blue.
So, at least, runs the contention of the United Nations officials
trying to confirm the Israeli army's retreat from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978, the Security Council
called on it to pull back to Lebanon's ``internationally recognized
boundaries.'' But by the time Israel eventually got around to doing
so last month, no one could agree any more on where the boundary
lay.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.N., trying to fudge the issue, invented a new, blue
``withdrawal line'' where it thought the border should run. In
theory, this semantic sleight-of-hand allows it to certify Israel's
compliance with the resolution without getting involved in the
difficulties of defining the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government, which already has to cope with
green, red, black and purple lines left behind by the country's
civil war, is reluctant to add another shade to the spectrum. It
argues that the new boundary leaves several chunks of Lebanese
territory inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.N. officials repeat the phrase ``without prejudice''
until their faces are as blue as their line, Lebanon is fearful
that it has next-to-no chance of securing a future readjustment. So
it insists that it will not allow U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the
border until the dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, says it will take a
few more days to make sure the Israelis are honoring the U.N.'s
line, but once that is in no doubt the peacekeepers must be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   After some hesitation, the Security Council has sided with him,
putting its seal of approval on the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Lebanon has won little sympathy for its case. Its
ally, Syria, at first pressed it to make things difficult for the
Israelis in the hope of luring them to joint peace talks. But the
death of Hafez Assad, Syria's president for 30 years, has left
Lebanon with a distracted backer at best.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the area in question is laughably small: all of the
alleged incursions, bar one, cover no more than a few hundred
square meters.
</P>
<P>
   The exception, known as the Shibaa farms, has, in the words of a
local shepherd, grass to graze 10,000 goats. But it falls within
the slice of Syria occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. argues, not unreasonably, that any adjustments to the
Syrian-Lebanese border can wait until the land reverts to Syrian
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with the weight of world opinion against it, the
Lebanese government will probably bow to the inevitable and accept
the U.N.'s writ. In the meantime, the border remains a potential
flash point.
</P>
<P>
   The government has petulantly refused to send its soldiers south
to take control. The Hezbollah guerrillas, who led the battle to
eject the Israelis, remain on the prowl, and have threatened to
resume fighting unless Israel accepts Lebanon's interpretation of
the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. troops manning roadblocks, a disgruntled, or hired,
Lebanese or Palestinian would not find it hard to shoot a rocket or
two over the border into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Such an incident, in turn, could provoke a return to the
conflict from which Lebanon and Israel have only just emerged. &QL;

   HARARE _ All he does is stuff envelopes for Zimbabwe's main
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But
since the MDC represents the first serious threat in 20 years to
President Robert Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, Deligent Marowa's humdrum
job is hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, six thugs kidnapped him at gunpoint, handcuffed him,
beat him, drove bicycle spokes up his urethra and left him for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he made it to a hospital. The same pistol-toting thugs
tried to abduct him from his sickbed, but fled when another patient
raised the alarm. Marowa can walk again, but he will never have
children.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal was intended to frighten Marowa into abandoning the
MDC. It had the opposite effect. Brandishing his X-rays like a
banner of protest, he declares: ``We have to throw these criminals
out of power. And we will.''
</P>
<P>
   In a free and fair election, the ruling party would stand no
chance. Mugabe's government is violent, corrupt, incompetent and
detested. But ZANU enjoys the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned media applaud its unrealistic manifesto _ free
land, free houses, jobs for all, cheap food and gasoline, and so on
and so forth _ while ``uncovering'' MDC plots to bring back
colonialism and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU receives public finance; opposition parties do not. A fifth
of the country's parliamentarians are appointed by the president.
Constituencies are gerrymandered, the electoral roll is out of
date, and a ZANU hack is in charge of the count.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite this head start, the ruling party could still lose
its majority (it currently controls 147 of the 150 seats).
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe himself does not have to run for re-election until 2002,
but a defeat for his party would weaken him considerably, and
perhaps even prompt ZANU to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, Mugabe is trying to terrorize the voters. He is
an old hand at this. When ZANU was a guerrilla movement, suspected
``sellouts'' had their ears and lips cut off.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1980, Mugabe would have won a free election,
but cheated anyway. His more violent followers prevented rivals
from campaigning in almost a third of the country, and murdered
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Mugabe's soldiers killed thousands of
dissidents in Matabeleland, and tortured many more.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign of intimidation has been less murderous,
but more systematic. Bands of ruffians, some of them veterans of
the liberation war, others merely pretending to be, have invaded
over 1,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders say they are reclaiming land stolen from their
ancestors by white colonialists, but they make little effort to
cultivate it. Instead, they beat up farm workers, burn their shacks
and force them to attend ZANU rallies _ where they are whipped if
they chant the slogans with insufficient ardor.
</P>
<P>
   All this is organized and paid for by the security services,
reportedly commanded by the man behind the Matabeleland atrocities,
a cousin of Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   Various cruelties have been inflicted on teachers, nurses and
others who, because they can read and write, are assumed to be
opposition supporters. At least 30 people have been killed, and
many women gang-raped. Worse will follow, or so goes the warning,
if ZANU loses the election.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Zimbabweans, however, refuse to be cowed. Despite
the perils, the MDC has put up candidates in every constituency.
Several of them, having been assaulted or threatened with death,
are in hiding. But still they campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where it is too dangerous to stick up MDC posters by
day, they do it stealthily by night, or drop leaflets from light
aircraft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Although the state media refuse to air their message, the
independent press continues to maul Mugabe, and nongovernmental
organizations spread the word that the ballot will be secret.
</P>
<P>
   Many farm workers, despite their welts and bruises, remain
quietly defiant. On a road between tobacco fields in rural Macheke,
the scene of several farm invasions, a freshly-beaten worker
muttered: ``The so-called veterans can't just carry us where they
want, as if we were bags.'' Another said: ``If it is time to die,
we can die.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at ZANU rallies is joyless. Despite generous
handouts of beer and T-shirts to those who show up, few do. Rows of
shiny portapotties stay fresh and unused. Sparse crowds clap
listlessly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MDC rallies throb with enthusiasm. Throngs of
people wave red cards to signal, in a footballing analogy, that it
is time Mugabe was sent off.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at ZANU rallies, especially Mugabe himself, blather on
about the party's heroic deeds during the liberation struggle, but
gloss over the two decades in which ZANU has been in charge of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some bigwigs are so out of touch that they are genuinely baffled
by their unpopularity. Vice President Simon Muzenda has told
disgruntled party members that they should vote for the candidates
ZANU chooses, even if ZANU were to choose a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? It is impossible to predict. Pessimists fear that
pluck and popularity will not be enough to defeat a cunning old
despot who is determined to use all the machinery of the state to
preserve his power.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists counter that Mugabe cheated during a referendum in
February, and still lost. This showed Zimbabweans that change was
possible, giving heart to the opposition. But it also jolted ZANU
out of its complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The party is cheating much more energetically now than before
the referendum. A recent opinion poll suggested that the MDC would
win 70 seats. This would give it a majority of the seats contested
but not, because of the 30 MPs Mugabe can appoint, a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation, the poll probably
underestimated opposition support.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the election result will depend on the answers to
two questions. First, will the presence of the international
observers, invited by Mugabe to maintain the illusion of fairness,
prevent excessive ballot-stuffing? They will be fairly sparse on
the ground; a large number of other would-be monitors have been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Second, has Mugabe's thuggery so frightened people that they
will be afraid to vote his party out of office? Or has it so
enraged them that they will risk its retribution? &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``The big American gas crunch is coming,'' says Mark
Papa, the boss of EOG, an American energy company.
</P>
<P>
   Angry American drivers, paying record prices for gasoline, may
think the crunch has come already. But the gas market suffering
this particular price shock is largely unaffected by gyrations in
oil price.
</P>
<P>
   Although few outside the industry have noticed, prices for
natural gas in the United States have shot up in the past year. The
rise has surprised even old industry hands.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, there was so much gas available that supply
consistently outpaced demand. Prices were soft and margins weak. No
longer. Supply is, at long last, becoming tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the gas consumed in America comes from domestic
sources or from neighboring Canada. Many of these fields are now
past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Denhardt of WEFA, an industry consultancy, reckons that the
rate at which output from America's offshore gas fields is
declining has risen in recent years, from below 20 percent a year
to well above 40 percent. That also means that firms investing in
new wells are extracting declining amounts of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand is soaring. As America's decaying power grid
groans under the annual strain of heat waves, such as a recent one
in California that led to blackouts in Silicon Valley, demand for
power is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic recent advances in gas-turbine technology, which have
made gas plants much less expensive than rival options, mean that
almost all new plants use gas. GE, the leading manufacturer of gas
turbines, has an order backlog several years long.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, gas now has cachet as a green fuel. Burning gas
produces fewer greenhouse gases than do other fossil fuels,
especially coal (coal-fired generation still makes up over half of
America's installed power base).
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's recent attacks on old coal
plants in the Midwest have spurred the dash to gas. Natural-gas
prices are also likely to remain high because of the decline in
stored gas.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, firms store a certain amount of gas to sell during
the cold months of winter, when demand for heating is strong. This
year, however, the amount of gas in storage has plunged, and
industry analysts say that shortfall will increase.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that firms, tempted by the current high prices,
are selling gas that they might otherwise have stored. Another,
says Denhardt, is that the growth of supply from decaying fields
has not kept pace with demand, so that there is simply less surplus
gas to store.
</P>
<P>
   In most commodity markets, soaring prices eventually bring an
adjustment of supply or demand. However, gas is unlike most
commodities, for it is difficult to handle and costly to store and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike oil, which can be transported in anything from gallon
jugs to gigantic tankers, gas usually requires extensive, expensive
pipelines to be in place from the wellhead all the way through to
customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one response that high prices produce in other
commodity markets _ a diversion of supplies from places where
prices are lower _ cannot happen easily.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is gas that is compressed into liquid form (LNG);
but this is so costly that it accounts for less than 1 percent of
America's gas.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. William McCormick, head of CMS Energy, which
runs America's biggest LNG terminal, says that prices for gas have
to be over $3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for LNG
imports to make economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident that gas prices will remain above that level
that he plans to increase his firm's terminal size by a third. He
reckons that LNG imports could, in time, make up 4-5 percent of
America's total supply.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this is that even higher prices may be on the
way. Some worry that prices may rise to the once unthinkable level
of $6 per mBtu.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, worries Paul Portney of Resources for the
Future, a respected think-tank, ``the federal government might then
step in, as it did in the 1970s, to regulate who can use gas
(homeowners and utilities, say) and who can't (industrial
customers, maybe).''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative possibility, described by Papa, is that the sheer
scarcity of gas could force demand down. Or worse, force it out: he
points to the recent flight to gas-rich Trinidad of a firm that
makes ammonia, an energy-intensive process, and insists that ``the
chemicals industry is next.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa's firm and others are lobbying the government for
permission to drill on federal land and on offshore sites that are
off limits. They would also love tax credits for exploration. But
for the moment, America's politicians seem too preoccupied with the
other ``gas'' crisis to heed such calls.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas will be a seller's market for some time to come. &QL;

<P>
   AMATA CITY AND SAMRONG _ They are cheap, educated, friendly and
fastidious, and Ralph-Rainer Ohlsen loves them.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles benignly at the women and men assembling BMW 318s and
328s in the light-flooded, squeaky-clean factory in Thailand's
Rayong province that he opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Thais even take their shoes off when they get in the
cars,'' he enthuses. ``It's great.'' That sort of thing never
happens at BMW's South African factory, which he previously ran;
nor, for that matter, at its Dingolfing plant in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford last year and GM in April, BMW is the latest western
carmaker to set up in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem odd in a country where car sales plummeted by 70
percent during the Asian crisis and production is still well below
pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new study of the car market in the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) by the Economist Intelligence
Unit, a sister company of The Economist, suggests that car sales in
the region will return to pre-crisis levels only after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and Europeans come to Thailand with a vision that
differs from that of the Japanese companies which dominate the
region. Whereas the Japanese treat each ASEAN country as a distinct
market, the Americans and Europeans are planning for a day when
trade is free across the region.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jochen Legewie, a car expert at the German
Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, this ``power shift'' away
from the Japanese, who today make nine out of ten cars and trucks
sold in ASEAN, towards western producers will prove the biggest
force for change in the economics and politics of car-making in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for westerners is global economies of scale. If they
reach it, the Japanese will lose out.
</P>
<P>
   Visit, for instance, the factory of Toyota in Samrong, an hour
north of Bangkok, and you see trucks unloading Thai parts from Thai
suppliers for assembly lines that make cars for Thai consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At Toyota's plants in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia,
it is the same story. Everywhere in the region, Toyota and other
Japanese carmakers have, in effect, recreated a whole supply chain
in order to serve the local market.
</P>
<P>
   This is inefficient, and Toyota, for one, is losing money in the
region. But the Japanese have had little choice, because politics
has dictated their Asian strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN countries used to subscribe to import substitution as a
development philosophy, and to burden foreign investors with
onerous local-content requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Some also have their own ``national'' car projects, such as
Malaysia's Proton, and are hostile to foreign competition. Tariffs
on cars and car parts, high to begin with, went higher still during
the crisis of the late 1990s, as countries tried in vain to
conserve hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched American trade unionists bash Japanese cars in
Detroit in the 1980s, says Yoshiaki Muramatsu, president of Toyota
in Thailand, the Japanese decided to follow a strategy of
``harmonious growth'' in the region, in effect sacrificing bigger
economies of scale to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes of liberalizing trade in ASEAN have revived. Since
1996, companies in ASEAN have been able to apply for a reduction in
tariffs on parts traded within the region. But the bureaucracies
empowered to grant the reductions have tended to block any
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hope now is for an Asian Free-Trade Area (AFTA) to
take effect in January 2002. If it goes ahead, tariffs on cars and
parts will be limited to a ceiling of 5 percent, low enough to
allow the development of a genuine pan-regional marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is this prospect that so excites the western companies. GM,
for instance, plans to export up to 90 percent of the Zafira vans
that it makes at its Thai factory to the rest of the region, and
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now makes several models with sub-optimal efficiency, but
it has designed its plant to convert to making one model highly
efficiently for export around the region.
</P>
<P>
   As for BMW, it sees three phases for its plant. In the first, it
makes cars for Thailand, in the second it expands production and
starts exporting, and in the third it sources from, and exports to,
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all depends on AFTA going ahead, says Ohlsen. ``If
phases two and three happen, it's a hat-trick,'' he says. ``I'm
convinced it won't go pear-shaped.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much rides on trade liberalization, westerners are
lobbying hard for it. Kitcha Minakan, a director at Thailand's
Ministry of Industry, says ``the Japanese come and ask what our
laws are and then try to please us. The Europeans look at our laws,
say they cannot abide by them entirely, but then try as much as
possible. But the Americans come in and say, ``This is all wrong,
you have to change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Minakan and Thailand will not be the biggest obstacles
to AFTA, because Thailand, as the production base of choice for the
westerners, has the most to gain from liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   The main foot-dragger will be Malaysia, which fears for its
Proton. But the westerners are undaunted. They look forward to
being able to put their factories wherever the combination of
labor, suppliers and transport works best, and to export from them
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical point. Their way is different from ours,''
says Toyota's Muramatsu. ``We must study how we, too, can enjoy
further liberalization.'' That is as close as a Japanese executive
ever comes to saying, ``We are worried.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Company executives in search of wisdom are turning
from psychotherapy and religion to the cleverest thinkers of all:
ancient philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   For corporations, philosophy has become the latest management
fad.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morris, author of ``If Aristotle Ran General Motors: The New
Soul of Business,'' earns $30,000 an hour _ one of the highest fees
for a non-celebrity speaker in America _ for teaching Socrates and
Hegel to the likes of IBM, Campbell Soup, General Electric and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marinoff, who wrote a popular book published last autumn,
called ``Plato, not Prozac! Applying Philosophy to Everyday
Problems,'' is spearheading the rise of ``philosophy counselling,''
which has roots in Europe in the early 1980s but is new to America.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff has founded the grand-sounding American Philosophical
Practitioners Association, which has trained around 70 philosophy
counsellors so far and has backing from a local assemblyman to
certify the practice in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff, who charges $100 an hour (in line with
clinical-psychology rates), says many of his clients are
``refugees'' from psychology and psychiatry. ``Philosophy deals
with big questions _ purpose, ethics, moral quandaries _ without
messing up their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Alain de Botton's best-seller, ``How Proust Can
Change Your Life,'' has spawned an agony column in a Sunday
newspaper. His latest book, ``The Consolations of Philosophy,''
pops philosophers like pills: take Socrates for unpopularity,
Epicurus for lack of money, Seneca for frustration and Montaigne
for inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton, being a cerebral sort of chap (and much consoled by
making a successful television series on his book), has not yet
moved seriously into the business of management counselling. When
he does, he will find that there is now a brand-new market for the
sages: failed Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher McCullough, a self-styled ``clinical philosopher''
based in San Francisco, says that half his practice consists of
``manic start-up types who can smell the money, but see it
disappearing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who runs a philosophy cafe in a local Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookshop and is soon opening his own cafe, prescribes the example
of Epictetus, a noted Stoic philosopher, to teach people how to
stay serene when they have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Epictetus is just the thing for those with underwater stock
options. He led a life of exemplary contentment, simplicity and
virtue, living in a small hut furnished with only a bed and a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's success in prescribing him suggests that
high-achieving entrepreneurs prefer intellectual discussion to
treatment for depression or anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much less tissue and couch use in philosophy
counselling,'' says McCullough. ``And I have more room to be
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Socrates, he must be guffawing in his tomb. &QL;

LAZIO CAMPAIGN RELIES ON OUTSIDER'S INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man in charge of crushing the hopes of Hillary
Rodham Clinton is not your typical Republican consultant. He's been
called ``an evil genius,'' a ``mad scientist,'' and a man
``desperately in need of adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   And those are his friends talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an iconoclastic, weird personality, no doubt about it,''
confessed Mike Murphy, the hired-gun in question, as he knocked
back another Diet Coke in the Four Seasons hotel bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, half-annoyed, half-sly, ``I'm not as crazy as
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after Rick Lazio suddenly became Clinton's
Republican opponent in the nation's hottest Senate race, he shocked
all the local pols by picking Murphy as his media strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had just come from playing the same role in Senator John
McCain's rollicking presidential campaign, and had ticked off the
New York Republican establishment by trying to crash its coronation
of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was Murphy who coined McCain's most biting slogans in his
fight to get on the New York ballot, comparing the Republican
committee to the Soviet Politburo, calling Governor George Pataki
``Comrade Pataki,'' and staging a photo-op in front of the Russian
consulate to complain that the former Communist Empire now had more
democratic elections than the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   And now here was Lazio _ Pataki's handpicked choice, after Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the race _ rejecting the state
GOP's lineup of advisers and going with McCain's loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Some dismissed Murphy as too brash, too much the self-promoter,
too new to New York politics. But others see these traits as giving
Lazio an edge.
</P>
<P>
   George Arzt, a Democratic consultant, said, ``Most of the people
who do this in-state, you know exactly what they're going to do.
Murphy operates as a guerrilla unit against the old guard. You
don't know what he's going to do. That's the scariest thing to a
rival campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain, the ingredients were ready-made for Murphy's
image-machine _ war hero, stoic torture victim, fat-cat-busting
party rebel. With Lazio, he has a tougher challenge: turning the
boy next door with a middle-of-the-road record into the man of the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy started out easy when Lazio hit the campaign trail last
month. The candidate painted himself as a mainstream native New
Yorker, and took mild jabs at Clinton as an out-of-town extremist.
Very quickly, the two were tied in the polls, and Clinton's
strategists went negative, airing TV spots that challenged Lazio's
centrist claims, and slammed him for opposing a hate-crimes law and
a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and her aides may have had no choice _ they needed to
define the little-known Lazio before he did. But they played into
Lazio's _ and Murphy's _ hands. Last week, he bounced back with a
response ad: ``It's a lot easier for Mrs. Clinton to attack me than
to name a single thing she has ever done for New York,'' the
candidate says, then adds, ``So, Mrs. Clinton, you can run the
negative campaign about tearing people down _ I'm going to run a
campaign about building New York up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was widely considered a clever punch _ anti-negative and
slashingly negative all at once.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing is Murphy's specialty. His license plate used
to read ``GO NEG.'' He once described his strategy as ``Make a
charge, then have the other guy spend $1 million to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   But something else is driving Murphy in this campaign _ a dread
of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary,'' he said, ``has this typically leftist tactic of
lying to get in power. I don't know her personally. I know
ideologically I disagree with her. I want to deny her political
power because I think she'll hurt the country and I'm a patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   This remark, uttered with stark seriousness, seems out of whack
with Murphy's otherwise fun-and-games demeanor _ 38, unmarried,
disheveled blond hair, fashionably geeky glasses, a slight stubble
that betrays a rush job with the morning razor, and a fondness for
black leather jackets and Hawaiian shirts.
</P>
<P>
   On McCain's campaign bus, he sat at the candidate's side,
cracking jokes and spinning the press. McCain called him, at the
time, ``one of the funniest guys I've ever met in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lazio campaign is over, Murphy wants to get out of
politics for a while, write movies for Hollywood, and fly
gyrocopters, a sort of wind-glider with rotary blades on top. The
gyrocopter industry has its annual convention next month. Murphy
plans to take two days off, in the middle of the campaign, to go.
</P>
<P>
   He's also keen on antique mechanical watches (``I own about 20
of them,'' he said), locksmithing, construction cranes, and
high-end consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love eccentric hobbies,'' he said, ``and I have a lot of
them. When I'm in a campaign, I give my life to it, but it's not my
life. I have a sense of perspective. I want to have a fun life.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy grew up in the Detroit suburbs, his father a lawyer, his
mother, a writer and a Democratic Party activist. His politics
turned staunchly conservative while studying foreign policy at
Georgetown University. He took a leave of absence his senior year,
to work on a political campaign, and never came back. But he still
reads up on military strategy _ and was lured to McCain for his
hawkish views.
</P>
<P>
   He met Lazio a year ago. One of Murphy's staffers was friends
with one of Lazio's aides. Lazio was thinking about challenging
Giuliani in a primary for the Senate race, and Murphy thought he
would make the stronger candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Rick played better upstate, and I thought the
problem Rudy would have is running for Senate and running New York
City at the same time,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy boasts of running 20 general-election campaigns and
winning 18. The winners include New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Michigan Senator Spencer
Abraham. One loser was Iran-Contra schemer Oliver North in his
Senate run from Virginia. He has also worked for some losing
presidential candidates _ McCain, Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, while immersed in the McCain campaign, he sold
his consulting company _ Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome, based on
Falls Church, Va. _ for, as he put it, ``millions of dollars.''
Murphy still runs the company, which is split roughly 60-40 between
corporate and political clients.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio seems to be giving Murphy more control than McCain did.
Murphy is writing all of Lazio's commercials, but did only one for
McCain and it was widely considered a disaster _ an ad during the
South Carolina primary that likened Bush to President Clinton. It
was McCain's first negative ad and, though the candidate pulled it
quickly, it went against his above-the-board image and, some say,
gave Bush an opening to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's campaign manager, conceded the ad was a
``mistake,'' but defends Murphy. ``There was a unanimous decision
to put that ad up,'' he said. ``It wasn't just Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's defense of that ad is more revealing. ``The problem was
we didn't run it enough,'' he said. ``Did I make a lot of dumb
mistakes in the McCain campaign? Sure. That wasn't one of them.''

BLUEBERRY FESTIVAL TOWN WINS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALAIS, Maine _ Three years ago, Ebrahim Haroon was presented
with a professional choice for which his training had not prepared
him: Mitchell, S.D., home to Mitchell's Corn Palace; Moultrie, Ga.,
deep in tobacco country; or Machias, Maine, proud host of the
Blueberry Festival?
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the three places had in common was that American
doctors won't take jobs there. Since 1997, the state Office of
Rural Health has placed 39 foreign doctors in Maine's most remote
corners. There's a Syrian pediatrician in Norway, an Indian
internist in Fort Kent, and two Filipino psychiatrists in
Washington County.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to work in underserved areas, they get a three-year
extension on their J-1 visas, which foreign-trained physicians
receive when they join US residency programs. Nearly a quarter of
the doctors practicing in the United States are foreign-trained,
according to the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The J-1 visa waiver is a new inducement to work in northern
Maine, but doctors have long been attracted to the region by the
National Health Service Corps, the model for TV's ``Northern
Exposure.'' Fifty-one NHSC doctors are in small-town jobs in
exchange for student loan repayments that can reach $120,000 over
four years, according to Sophie Glidden, director of the state's
Office of Rural Health and Primary Care Services.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, 300 doctors have taken jobs in rural
Maine through the NHSC _ in Washington County, psychiatrists Mary
Beth Lardizabal and Sue Bailey were placed through the program _
and retention studies show about half of those doctors chose to
remain in the towns to which they were posted, Glidden said.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his way across Washington County the first time,
Haroon heard Billy Joel's ``Moving Out'' on his car radio, and he
wondered whether he could make it here. In some ways, though,
small-town America makes better sense to Haroon, who came from
India, than big-city America. Family relationships seem closer than
he had come to expect from Americans, he said, and people's mood
disorders and emotional problems seem to spring from the closeness
of relationships rather than the absence of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like in India. They make eye contact a lot,''
he said. ``When you get on the subway in Boston, people pull up
their books and start reading.''

SAFE CHOICE, HIGH PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE LOTH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1991, just as the Soviet Union was breaking apart, Madeleine
Albright joined a tour of 17 countries that surveyed public
attitudes about life in emerging democracies. Albright and other
consultants to the survey, conducted by the Times-Mirror Center for
the People &AMP; the Press, held detailed interviews with citizens from
Russia to Hungary to Bulgaria to Poland, and they uncovered a
striking theme:
</P>
<P>
   In place after place, women were less likely than men to embrace
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A profound gender gap in attitudes towards democracy and the
change to a market economy was evident in every former Communist
country,'' the researchers concluded. Women were less likely than
men to believe that free speech rights should extend to people
expressing unpopular views, for example, and they supported greater
restraints on political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The female preference for safety over freedom is not confined to
developing countries. Increasingly, Americans are being asked to
choose between the liberty that is central to our democracy and the
safety we crave in a perilous world. And where these transcendant
American values clash _ from gun control to the V chip _ women are
less likely to fight for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   In an October 1999 poll of public attitudes and social values,
the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of women thought
``books that contain dangerous ideas should be banned from school
libraries.'' Only 48 percent of men thought that.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent of women said freedom of speech should not
extend to groups like the Communist party or Ku Klux Klan. Only 33
percent of men thought that.
</P>
<P>
   And 50 percent of the women thought the police should be allowed
to search the houses of known drug dealers without a court order.
Only 40 percent of men thought that.
</P>
<P>
   These double-digit gender gaps recur in any number of other
contemporary social issues where freedom and security conflict. Gun
control is a well-known example, where women of both parties are
more likely to say controlling the use of firearms is a higher
priority than protecting the rights of Americans to own guns.
</P>
<P>
   Women generally support establishing buffer zones around
abortion clinics to allow patients to safely visit their doctors,
even though abortion protesters say their free speech rights are
curtailed unconstitutionally by such laws. The US Supreme Court
will take up a Colorado case on precisely those grounds sometime
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely to support restrictions on lewd or violent
media, to censor the Internet, or to ban hate speech; they agree
with expanding the definition of sexual harassment to include the
creation of ``a hostile environment'' even if that means another
worker's right to hang a Playboy calendar in the office is
curtailed. They feel less confined by seat-belt laws or metal
detectors. They are even more likely to support antismoking
ordinances that pit the rights of smokers to pursue their habit
against the health and safety of nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``freedom gap'' may make sense in countries that are just
emerging from Communism. Albright, asked recently about it,
cautioned against ``placing our value system'' on women who don't
have the luxury of ideological debate. ``They were just worrying
about their daily lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about elsewhere? Why do women seem so dismissive of the
free expression rights that the United States were founded upon? It
could be that women _ and minorities and anyone too poor to own
property, for that matter _ were not extended these benefits when
the Bill of Rights was written and so have less invested in them.
All things being equal, women would just as soon have the
government step in and regulate the so-called freedoms that can
overwhelm or threaten them.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Marshall, the chief justice of the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court, put it this way: ``People who are more
vulnerable are more willing to let the state protect them.''
Because women are also more likely to be the ones in charge of
caring for children, who are even more vulnerable, they are doubly
inclined to give up a few rights in the name of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Minow, a family law professor at Harvard Law School, says
that security is in many ways a precondition for freedom. ``If
there is no social order there can be no exercise of any right,''
she says. `In the name of social order, society has thrown out lots
of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's not that women value liberty less, but that they
value community more. Some see the conflict not so much as freedom
vs. security but as freedom vs. equality, putting the First
Amendment at odds with the 14th, which guarantees equal protection
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is that if women, minorites and others not in the
mainstream culture can't be heard, their free speech rights are
lost. So special efforts must be made to ensure the participation
of every American in public debate, even if that sometimes requires
the muting of other voices.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting this view say that the founders' intent with
the First Amendment was primarily to ensure vigorous debate, as
opposed to civil libertarians who say it was all about individual
expression, indifferent to any social purpose other than to keep a
tyrranical government from squelching dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support campaign finance reform laws, for example,
argue against the US Supreme Court's 1980 ruling that a campaign
contribution, i.e., money, is a kind of speech and so cannot be
restricted. The reformers say that money's ``voice'' is so powerful
it drowns out other voices, so caps or bans on contributions should
be allowed to endure open debate.
</P>
<P>
   Owen M. Fiss, Sterling professor of Law at Yale, is author of
``The Irony of Free Speech,'' in which he argues that free
expression can actually be enhanced by restrictions on the First
Amendment, by allowing other voices that would not otherwise be
heard to emerge from the oppression of the prevailing chorus.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the US Supreme Court has not validated this view. In the
most significant cases examining restrictions on free speech, the
court stuck to the precedents that were established in a case
called Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire in 1942, which said speech could
be restricted only when the words spoken ``tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace,'' the old chestnut about shouting
''fire!'' in a crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 Minnesota case (RAV v. St. Paul), the court ruled that
cross-burning was expressive speech, not action, and therefore
could not be prosecuted (except insofar as it violated trespassing
or other property laws). In the decision, Justice Antonin Scalia
raised the bar even further by requiring that any restrictions on
speech must be what he called ``content-neutral,'' which will also
be at the center of the Colorado abortion protesters' case before
the Court this year.
</P>
<P>
   And not a single hate-speech restriction on a public college
campus has been upheld by this Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably a good thing in a pluralistic society, where
almost anything said or done is likely to offend somebody. As Minow
put it, ``Any restriction on speech will be selectively
administered.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than cutting off expression would be taking steps toward
a society in which there is enough opportunity for every voice to
be heard. Society can isolate hate speech (or smoking, or abortion
protesters, or Ku Klux Klaners, or firearms) or make them socially
unacceptable. But it is too dangerous to our essential Americanism
to ban them.
</P>
<P>
   Women need to be brought into this equation. If the power
relationships are skewed in contemporary American society so that
the voices of women or minorities are not heard, we should attack
that reality _ the inequitable distribution of power _ until a
critical mass of all Americans can feel secure enough to fully let
freedom ring.

CHARLES BAXTER CHARTS THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE FEAST OF LOVE 
By Charles Baxter. Pantheon. 308 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you let loose Puck and his love potions on the flatlands of
contemporary Michigan, you're bound to come up with something
quirky and fabulous at once: comically wrong romantic interludes,
punk lovers with big hearts and body piercings, golden moments of
summer softball and empty football stadiums that nod to Van
Morrison as well as to Shakespeare. But where ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' performed its magic under the canopies of night and fairy
power, Charles Baxter has bestowed his novel with the enchanting
spell of a ventriloquist's touch. ``The Feast of Love'' is a marvel
of narrative voices, each one so genuinely crafted, then inhabited,
that it seems perfectly feasible to run into these characters at
Starbucks. But let's make that Jitters, which is the name of the
local coffeehouse in this Ann Arbor. Next to Jitters _ both for
human ambience and for dreamlike possibility _ Starbucks would
never stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer of novels and short stories as well as poetry,
Baxter has long been admired by his peers for his particularly
careful vision: He has the heart of a novelist but the sensibility
of a poet, a combination that has sometimes seemed to obscure his
work instead of illuminating it. He can bury something beautiful
and odd between a couple of commas: ``the moon, the earth's mad
companion, is belting out show tunes.'' Line by line, this trait
can make you want to follow him anywhere, but his past work has
generally seemed quieter _ more ethereal _ than a lot of the
pyrotechnics lighting up contemporary fiction's sky. ``The Feast of
Love'' is quiet and ethereal both; it is also luminescent. And its
story line _ the interweaving tales, past and present, of a motley
gang tumbling around in life's forest _ seems as charmed in its own
right as it is beholden to Shakespeare's romantic comedy. Through
half a dozen narrators and several years of memories, there's
barely a false note in sight.
</P>
<P>
   A little night music, in other words, soft and erudite and under
your skin in the best of ways. ``The Feast of Love'' opens with a
Puck-like Charles Baxter, wracked by insomnia, taking a
post-midnight walk around Ann Arbor's football stadium, where he
runs into a guy he used to know named Bradley. Soon enough Baxter
the character-author fades into omniscient oblivion: While his
initial appearance could seem self-referential or cerebral, it
instead serves the purpose of showing off the architecture of the
novel _ then opens it up to happenstance and witness, leaving its
heft and intent to the characters telling the tale. This is a risky
way to structure a novel, full of potential ego-driven or technical
pitfalls, and could have failed in a number of minor ways. The fact
that it doesn't is testimony to the book's authenticity and
control, so carefully rendered as to be invisible. Voice is
everything in ``The Feast of Love,'' whether it's the hapless
nice-guy tenor of Bradley or the querulous, rock 'n' roll soprano
of Chloe _ a girl-child waitress at Jitters who believes in karmic
whiplash, a recovering outlaw named Oscar, and the walk-in
fortunetellers up the road in Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley and Chloe provide the two dominant voices of the
novel, it is their lucklessness in love and life that paves the way
for the rest of the cast. A painter manque turned coffee
entrepreneur, Bradley has two mismatch marriages behind him, the
first to a well-intentioned lesbian, the next to a fierce lawyer
named Diana who describes herself in one perfect phrase: ``I lack
usable tenderness.'' Chloe has found true love with her tattooed
and pierced ex-druggie, though Oscar's father _ a banal little
piece of evil nicknamed the Bat _ casts a shadow that seems as
prescient as it is oppressive. Providing the hovering wisdom of
this loosely linked community is a task best left to Bradley's
neighbors, Harry and Esther Ginsberg. A philosophy professor and
biochemist, the Ginsbergs have three grown children, one of them,
Aaron, a walking tragedy. In a small homage to the Rosenbergs, they
have named their goldfish Julius and Ethel _ hoping they'll have
better luck there than they have thus far with the prodigal son.
</P>
<P>
   These tendrils of plot only hint at the cumulative power of
``The Feast of Love,'' which lies in the elaborate map of human
depth and detail that each narrative helps to construct. Bradley is
a guy so sweet but clueless that he named his dog Bradley, too,
then had to kidnap him back from his Cruella De Vil sister. (``My
inner life lacks dignity,'' he confesses.) Taking pity on their
continually wifeless neighbor (as with a doomed restaurant
location, women keep moving into Bradley's house, then leaving),
the Ginsbergs go over for dinner one night and get a glimpse of his
paintings _ including the one he's buried in the basement, a
magnificent study in light and abundance called ``The Feast of
Love.'' Gasping with admiration, Esther asks her host why there are
no people in the canvas. Because, Bradley tells her, ``no one's
ever allowed to go there. You can see it but you can't reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is a man intent on giving up his dreams, though the
omniscient mischief-maker meddling with his love life will not let
him off the hook so easily. Like Shakespeare's comedy, this
dreamlike story provides a smorgasbord of romance; it also, in the
classic tradition, has plenty of misery _ much of it salved by hope
but scarcely diminished. ``The Feast of Love'' is full of aches and
tensions and elbow pokes and dead-end alleys; if its foibles
provide its action, they also provide Baxter with material that is
sometimes downright hilarious. The Michigan scene pieces here, from
pay-at-the-door scenery to Mrs. Maggaroulian the psychic, are
delightfully rendered; so, too, is the concision with which Baxter
can describe something as weirdly commonplace as backyard ceramics:
``They had the mean cuteness of painted souvenirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Page by page, not a lot happens in ``The Feast of Love,'' until
the dramatic resolutions in its final third. That's part of its
gentle magnetism: This novel is like a finely edited version of
life, inhabited by a bunch of mildly familiar, substantive people
you wish hung around in your part of town. Like Lorrie Moore's
``Birds of America,'' ``The Feast of Love'' takes the ordinary woes
and minute-by-minute exhilarations of modern America and infuses
them with wit, irony, and sensibility. That Charles Baxter has done
so under the sleepy awning of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' simply
makes his work a sweeter testament to the powers at work in the
forest, whether you can see them or not.

THE LOST ART OF WOODY ALLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When was it that a new Woody Allen movie became optional? How
long ago did palaver about Zabar's get old?
</P>
<P>
   The dates differ for everyone, but most of us broke our Woody
Allen habit ages ago. We moved on while he stayed in some Upper
West Side fugue state. Over the arc of his long out-patient career,
we first adored, then admired, then tolerated, and finally ignored
him.
</P>
<P>
   We knew his later work paled against his earlier films but we
excused him because of the warm spot in our hearts he earned back
before we all started therapy. He was, after all, our very own Boo
Radley. Forget that his acting was already old while Reagan was
still in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us even overlooked his gamy extracurricular life on the
theory that, like Pete Rose, the man should be judged by what he
does on the field. Reasonable people can differ here.
</P>
<P>
   But with his latest offering, ``Small Time Crooks,'' Allen's
decline as a filmmaker is so obvious that our denial about his
slide no longer works.
</P>
<P>
   That the movie has drawn good reviews and generous word of mouth
only proves that we have lowered the bar for Woody Allen to the
embarrassment of all concerned. He should take a break. Do stand-up
in Vegas. Write for radio. Grow orchids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks,'' which was sold out on a Saturday night at
the Chestnut Hill Mall theater three weeks after it opened, is a
very modest affair. There are laughs, but they come into view like
ocean liners. It's not horrible. It's worse than that. It's
forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's shtick is now as tired as his face, which is lined in
early Sharpei-like furrows. The mannerisms, the timing, the sad
looks, all remind us of someone we've seen on late night television
but can't quite place _ him.
</P>
<P>
   Others have noted that Allen needs to not be in his own movies.
``Small Time Crooks'' only reinforces the point. The film shines
early, when actors like Michael Rapaport populate the screen.
(Rapaport delivers malapropisms with drop-dead aplomb and utters
keepers like, ``We're all smart but he wears glasses.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the movie sags when Allen goes mano a mano with Tracy
Ullman, who plays his tacky wife with brio. He fares worse against
the great Elaine May, who surfaces here as another Gracie Allen. We
can approximate what he will say before he says it. We are never
unaware that he is acting. There are no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Also unfortunate is the pairing of two of the screen's major
mannerists _ Allen and Hugh Grant _ in the same small film. At
least Allen's affectations were captivating for years. Grant's, on
the other hand, seduced us only once, in ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.'' By now, his relentless stuttering and fractured pauses
combine with Allen's Yiddish syncopation to make us yearn for the
cleanly delivered declarative sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons are cruel but inevitable. It is impossible to watch
``Small Time Crooks'' or last year's ``Sweet Lowdown'' without
dreaming of ``Annie Hall'' or ``Broadway Danny Rose.'' The pathos
and the emotional beauty of those two earlier films are nowhere to
be found today. The juice is gone.
</P>
<P>
   I rented ``Annie Hall'' two years ago to see if it would hold up
after two decades and, more interesting, if it would appeal to my
daughter, then 15. What would a teenager of the late-1990s make of
Annie Hall-speak? Talk about mannerisms, after all, Diane Keaton in
the title role created a look and an argot so powerful that it
moved at warp speed from instant classic to cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Hall,'' it turns out, really is timeless. Its humor is
seditious. Allen's whining works. Keaton is classic all over again.
Best of all, he breaks our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   An artist as good as Allen is entitled to make anything he wants
as long as he can dun the money from producers. He shows no signs
of slowing down. Good actors still appear for peanuts in his
movies. So we can expect a lot more more B matter like ``Small Time
Crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he puts those of us who once adored him in a tough
position. His new stuff is painful to watch. Most of it is labored
and thin. We want to remember him when he was good. We're still
immensely proud of his fierce independence from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   We love the idea of Woody Allen, in short, but we have our
standards and this really isn't working anymore.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ While world leaders and pharmaceutical behemoths
wrangle over whether and how people in developing countries get
access to the expensive cocktail of drugs that keeps the AIDS virus
in check, a handful of activists here are collecting surplus
medicines and shipping them to countries where most of the world's
AIDS victims are dying.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a leftover supply of Crixivan, some Sustiva that a
patient stopped taking because of the side effects, or bottles of
protease inhibitors that are reminders of a previous, failed course
of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Unused, the drugs, which can cost $600 to $800 per month, are
usually left to expire and then tossed in a wastebasket. But now at
least some are being collected and shipped off to people like the
Rev. Gideon Byamugisha in the East African nation of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   An AIDS activist who already lost his wife to AIDS, Byamugisha
had lost 40 pounds last year and was battling pneumonia and malaria
when he began taking Crixivan and Combivir supplied by Lisa Carver
of Oakland, Calif. Since then, he reports, his immune cells have
doubled no longer traceable in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is most
often spread through sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles
and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Byamugisha said he and his family are planning to build a chapel
named in honor of Carver.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to my doctors, I would be dead by now if I had not
started on ARVs (anti-retrovirals),'' Byamugisha wrote in an e-mail
response to a reporter. ``Long live Lisa Carver. . . . Imagine if
we had 1,000 Carvers in each continent!''
</P>
<P>
   Such effusive praise makes the activists involved in the
shipments awkward and uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing. They're ready to give you the shirt off
their backs,'' said Homer Hobi, who runs the AIDS Medicine
Recycling Project in San Francisco, which also collects medicines.
``Part of it makes me feel good. But on the other hand, it makes me
feel like I'm not doing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The need, as Carver and Hobi know, is endless. What they send
reaches only a minuscule fraction of the 34 million people infected
worldwide. Ninety-five percent of them are in Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tiny, tiny thing and it's not the solution,'' Carver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hobi and most AIDS activists believe the answer lies in better
overall health conditions, prevention strategies and a vaccine that
could keep HIV from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   But while governments dither, people like Carver and Hobi have
stepped in _ just as so many ordinary people rallied at the
beginning of the AIDS epidemic here, filling needs as they came up
with whatever they had at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the idea grew into a formal organization, like the
Aid for AIDS group in New York City that helps 230 people, mostly
in Latin America, with donated medications.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, these activists are breaking the law, since they
have no authority to possess prescription medications for others or
to dispense drugs. But no law enforcement agencies appear eager to
crack down. And they steer clear of drugs that would have street
value in the United States, such as morphine or narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco area, Carver, Hobi and Vincent Meis, an
English teacher at City College in San Francisco, are each leading
informal efforts, quietly collecting medicines from doctors'
offices, patients and the survivors of people with AIDS who have
died.
</P>
<P>
   Hobi focuses largely on Latin America, Meis sends medicine to
Cuba and Carver works exclusively with people in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Having met and befriended people with HIV overseas, they feel
compelled to do what they can to help keep at least some people
alive. They believe they are collecting only a fraction of the
surplus HIV medicines out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get all the medications just in San Francisco we
could probably supply 500 people, just with what people aren't
using,'' Hobi said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Meade, an American doctor who moved to Russia to care for
people with AIDS, has just begun receiving medications from Hobi,
which he said are helping one of his patients, a penniless
35-year-old painter in St. Petersburg who was unable to work
because of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a small example of success in a very big picture
which is usually characterized by a lonely death for someone
completely isolated by this disease in a country that is unable to
provide for their health care,'' Meade wrote in an e-mail. ``I know
Homer's organization cannot provide medicine for every one of the
people that I encounter who are living with HIV, but what a great
success for his organization with this man, and the many others
that I believe his organization provides for!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even those receiving medications remain at great risk. People
with HIV in the developing world are treated much like those who
were infected in the early days of the epidemic in the United
States: with suspicion, disdain and fear, Hobi said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Nigeria who gets medicine from Hobi was first
diagnosed while visiting her sister in California. It later turned
out that one of her children also is infected. Hobi said she must
be extremely guarded about her condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's public, she might be killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, an executive for a British company was fired after a
mandatory HIV test turned up positive. He had to sell his house and
personal possessions to raise money for medications on the
underground market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chile, nobody is going to give any AIDS organizations a
dime,'' Hobi said. ``Their view is: It's a bunch of queers and
drugs addicts, so let them die.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobi sends medication only to people who are under a doctor's
care for their HIV infection. And he has one other requirement:
that the people who get medications help in the fight against AIDS
in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meis' efforts began shortly after a trip to Cuba in 1995. There
he met AIDS activists, including a doctor who was infected with HIV
himself. When he got back, he began rounding up medicine for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that a lot of people with HIV were changing medications
and, of course, unfortunately, some people don't survive and they
leave behind medications,'' said Meis, who teaches English as a
second language at City College. ``I saw people I knew throwing
them away or letting them sit on the shelf until they expired and
then throwing them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meis now supplies medicine for about 10 Cubans, and sends
additional odd lots of medication that can be used by others. He
makes two or three trips a year to Cuba to drop off medicines and
has regular contacts with others who travel there and can take
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hobi and Carver, getting the drugs to the people who
need them is often the most challenging part. Many countries impose
costly tariffs on drugs, so Hobi must disguise packages as
``vitamins,'' or otherwise mask their true contents.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were to chart the history of race relations through
popular culture, you would have to conclude that the tensions of
the past are beginning to ease, particularly as measured by
attitudes toward interracial romance. From one of the summer's
hottest blockbusters, ``Mission Impossible: 2,'' to Tony-winning
musicals, prime-time TV hits, and novels, the races are mixing in
ways that would cause racists and ethnic purists _ but hardly
anyone else _ to lose sleep. Mixed-race couples are nothing new, of
course, but what might be new, along with audiences' easy
acceptance of them, is a turn away from ethnocentricity and toward
assimilation. That would portend a seismic shift in the culture
wars, given the primacy that everyone from Spike Lee to David Mamet
has given to keeping it all in one's ethnic family.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at culture filtered through the movie lens, there is a
huge attitudinal shift from ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' to
``Jungle Fever'' and now to ``Mission Impossible: 2'' and more or
less the same thing is happening onstage. As always in America,
economics rule and one of the reasons for more mixed-race couples
is that the three hottest stars in musical theater are black _
Brian Stokes Mitchell, who won the Tony for ``Kiss Me, Kate'';
Heather Headley, who won for ``Aida''; and Audra McDonald, who lost
to Headley but was up for her fourth Tony for ``Marie Christine.''
Beyond that, however, consider some of the messages in these and
other musicals:
</P>
<P>
   --``Marie Christine'' is the throwback of the group as Michael
John LaChiusa unsuccessfully tried to turn ``Medea'' into a story
of a black woman scorned by racist America.
</P>
<P>
   --In the best new musical of the year, ``Contact,'' Boyd
Gaines's life is saved when he turns from his shallow bourgeois
life and enters the funky multicultural stew of a dance club.
</P>
<P>
   --Headley plays the Egyptian slave in Disney's silly concoction
of Verdi's ``Aida,'' and the racial/class divide is too much for
her and Radames to overcome until they're reincarnated in
present-day America.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is the star of Cole Porter's 1948 musical, ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' which isn't about race at all. This is one of the
highest-profile cases of colorblind casting, in which the producers
say race doesn't matter to the essence of a character so let's just
find the best actor/singer we can _ regardless of the race of the
other half of the love interest (Marin Mazzie in this case). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reflecting the culture &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to shrug off the significance of Broadway
audiences' attitudes as not reflective of the society at large. But
movie audiences are, and the biggest hit of the summer pairs Tom
Cruise and Zimbabwean-born actress Thandie Newton. (She is married
to a white man.) As in ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' race is never mentioned
in ``MI:2'' and although one presumes audiences aren't colorblind
about the duo, no one seems to mind. (Incidentally, Newton also
played the slave Sally Hemings, in ``Jefferson in Paris,'' and she
played the role in a seductive way that didn't sit so well with
many.)
</P>
<P>
   It would be insane to say that because race doesn't matter in
``Kiss Me, Kate'' and ``Mission Impossible: 2'' that race doesn't
matter in reality. But it would be equally wrong to reduce all of
these fictional relationships to past political models of
colonialism or even to Lee's concept of exotic attraction in
``Jungle Fever.'' For one thing, it's getting harder to define what
race is. This is what the golfer Tiger Woods, said at the US Open
five years ago. ``It is the final and only comment I will make
regarding the issue. My parents have taught me to always be proud
of my ethnic background. The various media have portrayed me as
African-American and Asian. I am both. I am the product of two
great cultures: One is African-American and the other Asian. I am
African-American on my father's side, and on my mother's side, I am
Thai. Truthfully, I feel very fortunate and equally proud to be
both African-American and Asian. The bottom line is I am an
American and proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of today's television programs _ ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Once
and Again,'' and ``Will and Grace'' _ the characters take for
granted that they are attracted to people of different races and
leave it to others to define their relationships or not. And is
America ready for the daughter of a president to keep dating, or
even marry, a black man? Such fears might doom the relationship in
``West Wing,'' but perhaps the audience is further ahead of the
curve than the producers are, particularly when the debate is
expanded beyond black and white. George W. Bush is expected to make
ample use in commercials of his nephew George P. Bush, the son of
his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and his Mexican-born wife,
Columba, to lure Hispanic voters into the Republican fold. Again,
this could be construed as exploitation but considering the party's
history in playing the race card, it is noteworthy that this is a
source of pride for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When one looks across the ocean to England, matters of race play
out quite differently. There the model is closer to the old melting
pot ideal of America in the first half of the century, when
immigrants would be assimilated and one's ethnicity wouldn't
matter. There were problems then, and even more obviously now, with
such a scenario. The melting pot was always more of an ideal than a
reflection of how ethnic groups were treated, but there are
interesting similarities between past and present.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the progressives in America of the first half of the
20th century and in England these days are more
assimilation-minded. One gets the same sense of ethnic
claustrophobia in Clifford Odets's ``Awake and Sing!'' as in Ayub
Khan-Din's current movie, ``East Is East.'' In this film of his
play, it's the Pakistani father who has resettled in Manchester,
England (somewhat incongruously with a white wife), who is
demanding his children toe the ethnic line while most of his
children are far more interested in playing around, in more ways
than one, with the whole smorgasbord of neighborhood children. One
even tells his father, who's trying to arrange a marriage with
another Pakistani family: ``Dad, I'm not Pakistani. I was born
here.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hope for the future &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the play opened in England, it was staged in a theater off
the beaten tourist path, the working-class East End district. The
audience was young and multiethnic, reacting to the play as if it
were a rock concert. One came away not only with a hope for the
future of theater but, more important, a hope for the future of the
play's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Asians in America tend to follow the same pattern. Witness the
recently released ``Chutney Popcorn,'' in which two Indian-American
sisters and their white lovers _ one straight, the other lesbian _
unite (albeit with some difficulty) to conceive a child that
neither couple could have on their own. A far cry from the World
War II days of ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' when love between a
white boy and Asian girl could not sustain itself.
</P>
<P>
   Not that things are now a piece of cake in the States. The young
Pulitzer Prize-winner Jhumpa Lahiri and the more established Gish
Jen, whose roots go back to different parts of Asia, both have
collections of stories just released in paperback that write about
the mixed romances of children of immigrants with a striking
balance of humor and pathos. In Lahiri's ``Sexy,'' from
``Interpreter of Maladies,'' an Indian woman complains to her white
friend, Miranda, about her cousin's husband leaving her for a white
woman. Miranda, it turns out, is now having a passionate affair
with a married Indian man herself. In the title story from ``Who's
Irish?,'' Jen puts herself in the position of a Chinese immigrant
looking disapprovingly at her daughter's marriage to an
Irish-American.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how she describes the Sheas' reaction to the child of
that mixed marriage: ``Everything just right, only her skin is a
brown surprise to John's family. So brown, they say. . . . They
say, Nothing the matter with brown. They are just surprised. So
brown . . . Seems funny, a girl named Sophie Shea be brown . . .
The Shea family talk is like this sometimes, going around and
around like a Christmas-tree train. Maybe John is not her father, I
say one day, to stop the train. And sure enough, train wreck. None
of the brothers ever say the word `brown' again.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks in America, of course, are for the most part not the
descendants of immigrants, but of slaves, and the difference can't
be denied in the collective consciousness of white and black
Americans. But a growing number of social critics are saying that
it's a legacy that need not define contemporary thinking.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most readable books in years, particularly for a
first novelist, is the young British writer Zadie Smith's ``White
Teeth,'' a story about two families and the multiracial society
they inhabit. As Salman Rushdie said, ``Zadie Smith's fizzing first
novel is about how we all got here _ from the Caribbean, from the
Indian subcontinent . . . and about what `here' turned out to be.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's interracial couples recognize the whole messy history of
the races _ the grandmother of one was ``taken'' by a British
colonialist. On the other hand, the contemporary relationship
between Clara, a Caribbean-born woman, and Archie, a working-class
white Englishman, is full of tenderness and a wacky kind of hope.
Also in the book, a Bengali sends his son back to East Asia to be
indoctrinated in the ways of the past and the result is someone who
comes back acting like David Niven. The other son flirts with a
separatist movement, but when he's told to take his essential
belongings during a power outage, he grabs Bruce Springsteen's
``Born to Run''; the Robert De Niro ``You talkin' to me?'' poster
from ``Taxi Driver''; a Betamax copy of ``Purple Rain''; Levi's 501
jeans; Converse sneakers; and Anthony Burgess's ``A Clockwork
Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, like Rushdie, is fully aware and writes eloquently of the
racism that her black and East Asian British characters have had to
deal with. The title refers to how an old colonialist soldier tells
how he used to spot people of color in the night in order to shoot
them. But as with other British writers, such as Rushdie, there is
the sense of the melting pot being more of a positive than a
negative. Smith's thoughts seem to be summarized by those of Irie,
the daughter of a white man and black woman who is now pregnant by
one of the men whose parents were Bengali:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a vision, Irie has seen a time, a time not far from now,
when roots won't matter anymore because they can't because they
mustn't because they're too long and they're too tortuous and
they're just buried too damn deep. She looks forward to it.''

   ROSWELL, N.M. _ The Beetle lives!
</P>
<P>
   OK, so this new one isn't really all that much like the old one,
when you consider that the engine is up front rather than tucked in
the rear, there is room for a couple of adults to sit comfortably
in the back seat, there is luggage space, the heater works, and you
can get one with air-conditioning that also works.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the New Beetle is a different animal, the first
national New Beetle car show June 17-18 in Roswell, N.M., proved a
point: Beetle people like the New Beetle as much as they did the
old one. And there are a lot of young people who never were around
the original Beetle, but who have become as enamored with the new
one as we baby boomers were with the old.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of this new crop of Beetle fans at Roswell,
most of them having trekked here in one of four caravans that came
from the four corners of the nation to meet each other and show off
their Doodlebugs.
</P>
<P>
   They had met on a Web site (www.newbeetle.org) that caters to
New Beetle owners and had developed an Internet camaraderie that
carried over to the weekend's events in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the event was ``all the little pods coming to
Roswell to reunite with the Mothership,'' from a New Beetle TV
commercial that suggested these cars were reverse-engineered from
an alien spacecraft that had landed in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   (Roswell was the site of a famous 1947 UFO sighting and recovery
that the U.S. military at first acknowledged; the next day it
changed its position and attributed the event to a wayward weather
balloon.)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the New Beetle gathering also reiterated a point
that perhaps had been forgotten in the wake of the untimely demise
of the original Beetle in the mid-70s: that Beetle people are a
different breed. They come from all age groups, occupations and
income brackets, but they have that one thing in common, that they
are not like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   And that made for a great weekend of New Beetle camaraderie, led
by people such as Lisa Linn of Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She organized the event and was on hand with her New Beetle,
named Spacepod, from which she uplinked photos of the event every
few minutes to the special event Web site,
www.allpodsgotoroswell.net.
</P>
<P>
   The love and care that these people showed for their cars was
proof enough that Beetlemania is far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   The New Beetle owned by Debbie Duderstadt of New Braunfels,
Texas, had about the snazziest paint job, but there were lots of
other customizations evident among the more than 350 cars on
display at the Roswell Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides showing off their cars, though, these people sat and
talked and laughed and generally acted as though they were lifelong
friends, even though most had never met each other in person _ only
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think we're a little bit strange,'' Duderstadt
said. ``But the fact is that Beetle people are different. And it's
not just one age group or socioeconomic level. It's a diverse group
of people, young and old and everything in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones who traveled the farthest for the event were Brenda
Sheets and her two sons, Zachary, 13, and William, 10, of Chugiuk,
Alaska. Just like the rest, Brenda met all of the other New Beetle
owners on the Web site and made lots of friends via computer from
the far reaches of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting to tour the lower 48 states, so this seemed
like a good excuse to do it,'' she said. She drove 4,525 miles in
10 days to get to Roswell in time for the events.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these New Beetle fans refer to themselves as ``old
hippies,'' and they talk about all the old Beetles they used to own
way back when.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that theme, there was the traditional tie-dyed
clothing booth set up in the convention center to cater to Beetle
fans who are into the garb that old Beetle fans used to wear. It
seems that as long as Beetles survive, so will tie-dye.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that I'm an unabashed Beetle lover, having owned
at least a half-dozen over the years, as well as a bunch of VW
buses, a Vanagon, a Squareback and a Fastback.
</P>
<P>
   Just like most longtime Beetle owners, I had to learn the basics
of working on these cars early on, so I could keep them running. It
was common to have to spend a couple or three hours every Saturday
morning working on my Beetle or Bus so it would run OK the next
week, to get me to work and back every day.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a problem; the old ones were fairly simple to work
on, and there really wasn't much I couldn't do myself _ up to and
including replacing a fender or an engine.
</P>
<P>
   One common problem with Beetles and Buses was the ignition
points closing up while you were driving along, which of course
would cause the engine to quit.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I carried a feeler gauge and the screwdriver I needed
to reset the points on a rear-engine VW, just so I could stop
whenever I saw a broken-down bug and reset the points so the
hapless occupants could be on their way again.
</P>
<P>
   It was amazing how often I did that for people during the heyday
of the rear-engine VWs; but it was such a quick and simple fix, and
the people were always grateful.
</P>
<P>
   And that underscores another difference with the New Beetle.
It's really high-tech, and I'm not sure I'm ready to try to learn
all about its engine and other systems to become as proficient with
repairs as I was with the old Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, I probably won't have to. VW has come a long
way, and these New Beetles are truly works of art _ not just on the
outside, but under the hood, too.
</P>
<P>
   They won't need me to stop and reset their points, or to do much
of anything else, either. Besides, they don't even have points.

 &HT;    Orlando's chills and thrills better all the time

<P>
   ORLANDO _ Bigger bangs. Zappier zaps. Loopier loops. Really real
virtual reality. At Central Florida's major theme parks, they all
mean the same thing: the never-ending search for a new wow.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they're only as good as their latest thrill ride, the
parks have recently introduced a spate of new or revamped
attractions. With Kraken, a high-speed loop coaster that opened
earlier this month, Sea World hopes to borrow some of the good buzz
from the wildly popular Incredible Hulk ride at Universal's Islands
of Adventure. Eyeing the long lines for Buzz Lightyear's Space
Ranger Spin at Disney's Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios has fired
back with an interactive alien hunt of its own, Men in Black Alien
Attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Disney is offering a new gloss on some old
favorites: A 3D, virtual reality version of the classic Pirates of
the Caribbean opened this month at DisneyQuest; and a
reconstructed, sonically improved version of the stunning Indiana
Jones stunt show has debuted at Disney-MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   We recently visited the parks and gave the new rides the wow
test, grading each on a scale from 1 (ho-hum) to 10 (awesome).
Here's how they stacked up:
</P>
<P>
   Kraken _ Sea World Orlando
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 7
</P>
<P>
   This extra-twisty ``floorless'' coaster is the aging marine
park's latest attempt _ joining the Journey to Atlantis water flume
and the Wild Arctic flight simulator _ to appeal to a younger, more
thrill-thirsty crowd. With its 144-foot initial drop and seven
loops, including two vertical revolutions and a zero-gravity roll,
it's certainly gasp-inducing. But some riders felt that it paled
next to other rides, especially the Incredible Hulk coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, it's in the middle of Orlando, so it's got so
much competition,'' said Wendie Pate, 27, who had traveled from
London with her husband, Steve, 29, to visit several Central
Florida theme parks. Even though the couple had just disembarked
from their third straight spin on Kraken, they pronounced it ``not
as good'' as Universal's rival coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first drop is really something, but you know it's
coming,'' said Wendie. Whereas, she noted, the Hulk's
out-of-nowhere speed surge ``really takes you by surprise. On a
scale of 1 to 10, I'd give Kraken an 8 and the Hulk an 11.'' We
agree, and dock Kraken an extra point for its bland aquamarine
color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Men in Black Alien Attack
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 5
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1997 hit movie starring Will Smith, this flashy
interactive ride opened in April and instantly became one of
Universal Studios' most popular attractions. But the interminable
lines _ some guests have waited two hours or longer _ seem out of
proportion to the modest charms of what is essentially a glorified
video game.
</P>
<P>
   After strolling past cute animatronic dioramas depicting scenes
from the movie, riders board a two-tiered car equipped with laser
zappers. The car winds through a garishly lit chamber packed with
alien targets that spin, swoop and hop. Riders earn points by
shooting them with the lasers _ enough points and you're deemed
ready to join Smith as a full-time Men in Black agent.
</P>
<P>
   Though far from disappointing, the ride is too similar to others
to be a top-notch wow. It's very reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear's
Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom, and one rider dismissed it
as ``Mr. Toad's Wild Ride with guns.'' The long lines further lower
its grade, though that will likely change when Universal unveils a
ride reservation system similar to Disney's FastPass next month.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle
</P>
<P>
   for Buccaneer Gold _ DisneyQuest
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 8
</P>
<P>
   There are glorified video games and then there are glorified
video games: This clever offering, which opened Wednesday at the
five-story interactive attraction in the Downtown Disney
entertainment, dining and shopping mall, puts participants inside a
virtual reality battle with pirate ships. Donning 3-D viewing
helmets, players stand on the bow of a ship, which literally rocks
in the ``waves.'' One player steers the ship while up to four
others man cannons and plug away at video vessels on a giant curved
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sink one with a virtual reality cannon blast and you're awarded
a chest full of doubloons, but be careful of the toothy sea
monsters, which may take a bite out of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   While the novelty of virtual reality rides wore off years ago,
this multisensory experience puts a fresh spin on the genre. Even
so, it still can't top its animatronic inspiration, the original
Pirates of the Caribbean, still yo-ho-ho-ing along at the Magic
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular _ Disney-MGM Studios
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 10
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the coolest show at any Central Florida theme park,
this decade-old attraction recently reopened after a six-month
hiatus. During the down time, the elaborate stage, which simulates
scenes from the 1981 Harrison Ford smash ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark,'' was restructured and given a fresh coat of paint. The sound
and lighting systems were also updated.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show's death-defying stunt effects needn't worry:
Every fight, fire and flipping truck is still here _ only the
choreography has been slightly altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a hit, we didn't want to change much,'' said
producer Joe Kivett, on hand for the first return show, along with
500 invited guests named Jones. But Kivett dubbed the sonic effects
``greatly improved. Pay attention to the way the wind whips across
the speakers during the first scene.''
</P>
<P>
   We did, and we could swear we felt a hot gust as the audio track
introduced the show's Indiana Jones double, Ed Knauf. And when
Knauf was later chased by that famous rolling boulder, we knew we
were in the hands of the best Disney dream-makers.
</P>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The quest for more wows continues in the upcoming months.
Islands of Adventure will unveil two kiddie rides in early July:
Storm Force Acceleration, based on characters from the X-Men
comics, simulates a thunderstorm with light and sound; Flying
Unicorn is a gentle roller coaster that travels through faux cloud
banks. The park will also debut two new shows on July 2 _ the
sports extravaganza ``Xtreme Xventure'' and the interactive comedy
``Bullwinkle for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is keeping things hopping with the return of last
summer's hit, ``The Best of Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance''
at Epcot. The 30-minute Celtic stepping performance runs through
Aug. 26. And SongMaker, another new interactive attraction now open
at DisneyQuest, invites guests to step into a sound booth and
create a tune with supplied lyrics and beats, which they then have
the option of purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the next theme park thrill? Stay tuned, and fasten
your seat belts ...

&HT;     MERCEDES SEDAN TOPS INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S THEFT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan, a large luxury sedan with
equally large prices ($70,000 and up, plus gas-guzzler tax of
$1,000) leads the list of passenger cars that have the highest
insurance losses for theft, according to new figures from the
Highway Loss Data Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which is supported by the auto insurance
industry, says the S-class' losses from theft are 10 times higher
than the average for all passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   The S-class has been on list for the past five years, but this
is the first time it has been at the top of the list, the institute
says.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first time in five years that the annual list of
worst theft losses isn't led by a sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mercedes S-class has appeared on the 10-worst list for
five years, and it's obviously an attractive target for
professional thieves because of its value,'' said Kim Hazelbaker,
the Institute's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Second on this year's list is the two-door Acura Integra, which
has a much lower price tag: It begins at about $20,000. The
four-door Integra is third on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Losses for the Integra are about 10 times worse than the average
among 1997-99 passenger vehicles, the latest report shows.
</P>
<P>
   More Integras are stolen than are Mercedes S-class models, but
the overall losses are higher for the S-class purely because of the
much higher prices, Hazelbaker said.
</P>
<P>
   To help cut Integra thefts, Acura has equipped all 2000 models
with passive anti-theft devices, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mercedes, two-door Integra and four-door Integra, the
rest of the top 10, in order, are: the Mitsubishi Montero Sport
four-wheel-drive, Mercedes-Benz SL convertible, Nissan Maxima,
Lexus GS 300/400, BMW 3-series, BMW 7-series long wheelbase, and
Lincoln Navigator four-wheel-drive.
</P>
<P>
   Average loss payments per claim have risen from just over $3,000
in 1980 to about $5,500 in 1999, the institute said. But the 1999
figure is lower than the $5,900 average loss posted for 1998.

   HONDA, GM MODELS ARE `GREEN' MACHINES
</P>
<P>
   The natural-gas powered Honda Civic GX and General Motors' EV1
electric vehicle have been named the year's ``greenest'' vehicles
in updated listings by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy, which posts the environmental attributes of most cars and
trucks on its GreenerCars.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 new listings have been included in an update to the
site, which now also includes such popular new vehicles as the
Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Volkswagen Passat 4motion sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these, like the Passat 4motion, are new configurations
of cars we're already ranking,'' said Jim Kliesch, the council's
research assistant and co-author of the group's annual Green Book,
which is available for purchase through the Web site. ``Others,
like the BMW Z8, are new listings.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are updated periodically throughout the year to help
consumers keep up with the continually changing auto market, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automotive market is becoming more fluid, with vehicles
being released throughout the year,'' said John DeCicco, lead
author of the Green Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to provide consumers with accurate, up-to-date
environmental information about the cars, trucks and SUVs hitting
the streets today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The natural-gas powered Civic GX ties the EV1 with the top
model-year 2000 ``green score'' of 52, he said. Since the current
book went to press, the Civic GX was certified to meet California's
super low emission standard, Kliesch said.
</P>
<P>
   The council's ``green scores'' account for both tailpipe
pollution and global warming impacts, including emissions from auto
factories, petroleum refineries and, for electric vehicles, power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our posted green scores are based on national average emission
factors,'' Kliesch said. ``In states with cleaner-than-average
electricity generation, such as California, the EV1 would see an
even higher green score.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to updates of 2000 model-year vehicles, preliminary
analyses of some early 2001 vehicles were performed and posted on
the Web site, the group said. Besides the Passat and the PT
Cruiser, others added during the update include the Acura CL, Ford
Explorer Sport Trac and Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green scores of these vehicles will be finalized by early
2001, once the majority of 2001 vehicles are analyzed, but results
are not expected to change significantly,'' DeCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is available by paid subscription only, however. If
you want to use it, have your credit card ready.
</P>
<P>
   The print edition of the ``Green Book: The Environmental Guide
to Cars &AMP; Trucks Model Year 2000'' may be ordered through major
on-line booksellers or directly from GreenerCars.com for $8.95 plus
$5 shipping and handling.

   ON-LINE AUTO CONSULTATION
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to shop for a new Lincoln or Mercury vehicle
and you have a personal computer at your disposal, Ford's Lincoln
Mercury division wants to hook you up with a ``personal
consultant'' to help explain everything you might want to know
about the vehicle you are considering.
</P>
<P>
   In a first for the auto industry, the Lincoln Mercury on-line
personal consultant service began in June on both the
Lincolnvehicles.com and Mercuryvehicles.com Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   There, a consultant is available to communicate directly with
potential buyers, to allow consumers to get product information,
arrange a test drive, obtain a price quote and even arrange for
delivery of the vehicle from the consumer's dealer of choice,
Lincoln Mercury officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping for a new vehicle online can be difficult and
stressful,'' said Harlan Lassen, Lincoln Mercury's Internet
manager. ``We believe our personal consultants, by adding the human
touch, can make buying a car online a more enjoyable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is staffed by Lincoln Mercury product specialists,
who communicate via e-mail, including real-time chat, or by
telephone, in English or Spanish. They promise to respond to all
requests within 24 hours, and there is no charge for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The product specialists do not earn commissions from any sales,
Ford says.

GORE TO PUSH PLAN TO CUT RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to capitalize on voter anger over the high
price of gasoline, Vice President Al Gore will announce a
multibillion-dollar plan this week to reduce the nation's
dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, according to campaign officials, is made up of a
series of financial incentives to induce industry to produce more
fuel-efficient cars and to persuade consumers to drive them. There
are also tax credits and grants to encourage power plants to
convert to newer technologies, as well as for consumers to convert
their homes to solar power.
</P>
<P>
   Cities would be eligible for bonds and grants to develop
light-rail transportation systems and to buy less-polluting buses.
Entrepreneurs would get incentives to develop cleaner-burning, more
fuel-efficient technology. Gore is also hoping to see people buy
and drive hybrid cars that run on gasoline, electricity, and diesel
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials declined to say how much his plan would cost
to implement, but described the amount as ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely need a short-term solution on gas prices,'' said
Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary. ``But we have to put
ourselves on a path to a long-term solution in a way that will keep
the environment clean and produce reliable energy sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign dismissed Gore's initiative, which will be
rolled out Tuesday in Philadelphia, as warmed-over ideas from past
budgets that have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years of weak leadership, Al Gore is proposing
nothing new,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Texas Governor
George W. Bush. Bartlett also accused Gore of supporting higher gas
prices, citing a tie-breaking vote in 1993 for a 4.3 cents-a-gallon
increase for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, however, noted that Houston is the smoggiest city in the
United States and that Bush, a former oil executive, supports tax
breaks for the oil industry and has taken in $1.5 million from the
oil industry for his campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has fought the oil companies and the polluters,'' said
Lehane. ``I think it's pretty clear who's on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore and Bush have been angling for position
when it comes to oil. Each candidate has called for an
investigation of the oil companies by the Federal Trade Commission
to look for evidence of collusion. Also, each one has tried to pin
blame on the other for the high cost of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is particularly sensitive in the campaign because
oil prices have rocketed in key battleground states such as
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In some places, gas prices are
more than $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican,
proposed that Congress suspend the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal
gasoline tax for the summer.

 &HT;    Orlando's chills and thrills better all the time
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Bigger bangs. Zappier zaps. Loopier loops. Really real
virtual reality. At Central Florida's major theme parks, they all
mean the same thing: the never-ending search for a new wow.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they're only as good as their latest thrill ride, the
parks have recently introduced a spate of new or revamped
attractions. With Kraken, a high-speed loop coaster that opened
earlier this month, Sea World hopes to borrow some of the good buzz
from the wildly popular Incredible Hulk ride at Universal's Islands
of Adventure. Eyeing the long lines for Buzz Lightyear's Space
Ranger Spin at Disney's Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios has fired
back with an interactive alien hunt of its own, Men in Black Alien
Attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Disney is offering a new gloss on some old
favorites: A 3D, virtual reality version of the classic Pirates of
the Caribbean opened this month at DisneyQuest; and a
reconstructed, sonically improved version of the stunning Indiana
Jones stunt show has debuted at Disney-MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   We recently visited the parks and gave the new rides the wow
test, grading each on a scale from 1 (ho-hum) to 10 (awesome).
Here's how they stacked up:
</P>
<P>
   Kraken _ Sea World Orlando
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 7
</P>
<P>
   This extra-twisty ``floorless'' coaster is the aging marine
park's latest attempt _ joining the Journey to Atlantis water flume
and the Wild Arctic flight simulator _ to appeal to a younger, more
thrill-thirsty crowd. With its 144-foot initial drop and seven
loops, including two vertical revolutions and a zero-gravity roll,
it's certainly gasp-inducing. But some riders felt that it paled
next to other rides, especially the Incredible Hulk coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, it's in the middle of Orlando, so it's got so
much competition,'' said Wendie Pate, 27, who had traveled from
London with her husband, Steve, 29, to visit several Central
Florida theme parks. Even though the couple had just disembarked
from their third straight spin on Kraken, they pronounced it ``not
as good'' as Universal's rival coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first drop is really something, but you know it's
coming,'' said Wendie. Whereas, she noted, the Hulk's
out-of-nowhere speed surge ``really takes you by surprise. On a
scale of 1 to 10, I'd give Kraken an 8 and the Hulk an 11.'' We
agree, and dock Kraken an extra point for its bland aquamarine
color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Men in Black Alien Attack
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 5
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1997 hit movie starring Will Smith, this flashy
interactive ride opened in April and instantly became one of
Universal Studios' most popular attractions. But the interminable
lines _ some guests have waited two hours or longer _ seem out of
proportion to the modest charms of what is essentially a glorified
video game.
</P>
<P>
   After strolling past cute animatronic dioramas depicting scenes
from the movie, riders board a two-tiered car equipped with laser
zappers. The car winds through a garishly lit chamber packed with
alien targets that spin, swoop and hop. Riders earn points by
shooting them with the lasers _ enough points and you're deemed
ready to join Smith as a full-time Men in Black agent.
</P>
<P>
   Though far from disappointing, the ride is too similar to others
to be a top-notch wow. It's very reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear's
Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom, and one rider dismissed it
as ``Mr. Toad's Wild Ride with guns.'' The long lines further lower
its grade, though that will likely change when Universal unveils a
ride reservation system similar to Disney's FastPass next month.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle
</P>
<P>
   for Buccaneer Gold _ DisneyQuest
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 8
</P>
<P>
   There are glorified video games and then there are glorified
video games: This clever offering, which opened Wednesday at the
five-story interactive attraction in the Downtown Disney
entertainment, dining and shopping mall, puts participants inside a
virtual reality battle with pirate ships. Donning 3-D viewing
helmets, players stand on the bow of a ship, which literally rocks
in the ``waves.'' One player steers the ship while up to four
others man cannons and plug away at video vessels on a giant curved
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sink one with a virtual reality cannon blast and you're awarded
a chest full of doubloons, but be careful of the toothy sea
monsters, which may take a bite out of the boat.

<P>
   While the novelty of virtual reality rides wore off years ago,
this multisensory experience puts a fresh spin on the genre. Even
so, it still can't top its animatronic inspiration, the original
Pirates of the Caribbean, still yo-ho-ho-ing along at the Magic
Kingdom.

   Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular _ Disney-MGM Studios
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 10
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the coolest show at any Central Florida theme park,
this decade-old attraction recently reopened after a six-month
hiatus. During the down time, the elaborate stage, which simulates
scenes from the 1981 Harrison Ford smash ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark,'' was restructured and given a fresh coat of paint. The sound
and lighting systems were also updated.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show's death-defying stunt effects needn't worry:
Every fight, fire and flipping truck is still here _ only the
choreography has been slightly altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a hit, we didn't want to change much,'' said
producer Joe Kivett, on hand for the first return show, along with
500 invited guests named Jones. But Kivett dubbed the sonic effects
``greatly improved. Pay attention to the way the wind whips across
the speakers during the first scene.''
</P>
<P>
   We did, and we could swear we felt a hot gust as the audio track
introduced the show's Indiana Jones double, Ed Knauf. And when
Knauf was later chased by that famous rolling boulder, we knew we
were in the hands of the best Disney dream-makers.
</P>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The quest for more wows continues in the upcoming months.
Islands of Adventure will unveil two kiddie rides in early July:
Storm Force Acceleration, based on characters from the X-Men
comics, simulates a thunderstorm with light and sound; Flying
Unicorn is a gentle roller coaster that travels through faux cloud
banks. The park will also debut two new shows on July 2 _ the
sports extravaganza ``Xtreme Xventure'' and the interactive comedy
``Bullwinkle for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is keeping things hopping with the return of last
summer's hit, ``The Best of Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance''
at Epcot. The 30-minute Celtic stepping performance runs through
Aug. 26. And SongMaker, another new interactive attraction now open
at DisneyQuest, invites guests to step into a sound booth and
create a tune with supplied lyrics and beats, which they then have
the option of purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the next theme park thrill? Stay tuned, and fasten
your seat belts ...

&HT;     WINDOWS ME? WE CAN WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates must be a little short on pocket change, because a
new issue of the consumer version of Windows is on its way, and you
have to decide whether to pony up the bucks for an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Millennium Edition _ cloyingly nicknamed Windows Me _ is
actually the third version of the Windows 98 operating system. It
also supposedly is the last Windows release that uses the so-called
9x architecture that began with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next year, if all goes well, Microsoft will offer a
consumer operating system built around Windows 2000, currently
code-named Whistler. That means the software that will render
Windows Me obsolete is already in development.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes Windows Me the least compelling upgrade for many
Windows 98 users. I've been playing with test versions of the
operating system for months, and with a couple of exceptions, I
don't think there's much here that most folks will find crucial. I
have yet to get my hands on the finished code, but I'll follow up
once I do.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows Me may be attractive to users who have found
Windows 95 or 98 to be trouble-prone. It has some interesting
features for fixing and, even more importantly, preventing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Work was completed on Windows Me last week, and it is due in
stores in mid-September. It may find its way onto new PCs before
that. And that's probably the best circumstance in which to get
Windows Me. The operating system's biggest strength is that it has
support for many of the latest hardware components that computer
manufacturers will be offering soon.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has had two main goals for its Windows Me upgrade.
First, it wanted to make it easier to use, and there have been
interface and design changes in that direction. But frankly, some
of the changes make Windows Me harder to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Dial-up Networking folder icon is now gone by
default from the My Computer window. Instead, there's a Web-like
text link to it in small type in the folder. (There's also a text
link in My Network Places, which is the new name for Network
Neighborhood.) But that link is visible only if you have your
folders set to be viewed as Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   So where is Dial-up Networking actually stored? In the Control
Panel _ a bizarre change, since most folks are used to finding it
in My Computer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, when you first open the Control Panel, most of the
modules there are hidden from you. Again, there's a text link that
reveals all.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also sought to make Windows Me more reliable than
Windows 98 Second Edition. Of course, Windows 98 SE was supposed to
be more crash-proof than Windows 98, which was supposed to be more
stable than Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Users who've religiously followed the upgrade path know that
this has not always been the case. While each successive version
does contain bug fixes and feature improvements, Microsoft also has
added features and thus increased complexity. A clean, simple
installation of Windows 98 is pretty reliable. But once you start
adding things _ like, uh, new software _ this house of cards can
come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows Me may have an edge here. While the versions
I've been using have been pre-release ones with their share of
bugs, Microsoft argues that Windows Me is going to be more stable
because the company has removed some of the things that could cause
problems in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   There is less support for older MS-DOS programs in Windows Me,
which should raise a warning flag to anyone who still relies on
that type of software. While many DOS programs may still work,
there is less of an emphasis on DOS compatibility in Windows Me.
Whether that translates into increased reliability is something
that will be determined over time.
</P>
<P>
   There are other Windows Me features, though, aimed at helping
users. The built-in help files have been expanded dramatically,
with more automated troubleshooters and links to Microsoft's
support Web site. If the documents on your PC can't help you, you
can easily go online for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has a little-documented but lifesaving feature that
lets you recover from catastrophic problems. If you do something
that hoses your operating system, but you can still get to a DOS
prompt, you can type scanreg /restore, then choose from several
days' worth of backed-up Windows Registry files. This takes your
Registry back to a point before the damage was done - almost like
traveling back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me takes this one step further with a feature called
System Restore. It notes changes made to your system over time and
creates so-called Restore Points. You can choose one of the Restore
Points from a calendar. You can go back for days, weeks or even
months.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system also brings over a useful feature from
Microsoft's Office productivity suite. Windows Me has the ability
to replace crucial files that have been either accidentally deleted
or overwritten with older versions. This ``self-healing''
capability seeks to fix one of the biggest causes of program
crashes _ incompatible versions of system files. How well this
works is something that only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   As with all versions of Windows, there are new features built
in.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, after all, has to do something to keep the Justice
Department busy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you'll find a built-in desktop video editor that
makes it easy to bring in movies from a videocamera and manipulate
them. I spoke with several companies that make and sell software
programs that do this, and they didn't seem worried about Microsoft
adding this new capability to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just calls attention to the category,'' said one company's
spokesman, who apparently wasn't feeling like his firm might be the
next Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Windows Me wouldn't be a new version of Windows
without at least one feature suffering a solid case of hyperbloat.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Media Player, once a simple and speedy way to play
media files, has ballooned into a lumbering application that takes
twice as long to load and bristles with unnecessary bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it now has a Media Guide that helps you ``find
entertaining and informative content on the Internet.'' The last
time we saw a description like that, it was on the Channel Bar on
Internet Explorer 4, which was partially to blame for that
program's bloat. And it went largely unused.
</P>
<P>
   Since an upgrade will cost around $100 _ and since the consumer
version of the more robust Windows 2000 is just around the corner _
chances are many users will take a pass on Windows Me. Gates may
end up a little poorer, but you may be better off waiting.

&HT;     FIESTAWARE: ART DECO STAPLE RETAINS ITS STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiestaware, the art deco pottery from the mid-1930s, became a
mainstay in the dish cupboard because of its soft pastel or bright
and bold colors.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to mix and match this solid-color dishware to create
table settings to go with any decor. Collectors often change colors
with the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fiestaware options include tableware, pitchers and sets of
mixing bowls.
</P>
<P>
   When Fiestaware was first designed in 1936 by Frederick H. Rhead
for the Homer Laughlin China Co., in Newell, W.Va., color choices
were ivory, light green, cobalt blue, yellow and red. Turquoise was
added a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, red was discontinued because the U.S. government needed
the uranium that was used to produce the color. Red made a comeback
by the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, production of Fiestaware ceased to make way for new
designs. The company went back to making the original style in 1986
to mark its 50th anniversary, using the original molds with updated
colors.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the age of a piece, look at the color and shade.
Colors came in and out of fashion, and were slightly different when
they were reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are higher for collectible limited-edition colors (like
lilac and sapphire) and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Although early Fiestaware contained lead, modern pieces are safe
to use, according to Andy Geller, co-owner of New Scotland Antiques
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Early pieces may be safe as long as they are not cracked or
chipped. However, acidic foods could cause the uranium from old red
pieces to leach out through the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, a tea cup and saucer or a dinner plate sold for 35
cents and a coffee pot cost $1.25. Depending on collectibility,
older pieces can cost thousands of dollars. Today, new Fiestaware
prices begin at $9 for a dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   Fiestaware can be found in antiques shops, department stores,
catalogs and on the Internet.

PARTIES IN BATTLE FOR CONVENTION AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dot-com skyboxes, a three-day ``rolling'' roll
call, and sandwiching retired General Colin Powell's speech between
the first and second half of a New England Patriots preseason game
on ABC-TV are the shiniest weapons in the Republican Party's war
against a shrinking audience for its national convention next month
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle: Both parties are desperate to showcase their
presidential and vice presidential nominees, set the themes for
what is shaping up as a tight race this fall, and avoid floor
debates that could produce real drama. Yet because the four-day
political conventions don't generate news or high ratings, the Big
Three networks have vowed to pare down coverage to a few prime-time
hours.
</P>
<P>
   So innovation is on the way for one of the most time-honored
rituals in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, officials of both parties say, will be the
big-time presence of the Internet as both an information source and
interactive tool when the GOP meets July 31 to Aug. 3, and the
Democrats hold their convention in Los Angeles Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   Look to the rafters of the big arenas and next to the usual
network skyboxes there will be ``AOL.com'' and
``Pseudopolitics.com.'' Users can go to those Web sites and click
on to cameras scanning the convention floors 24 hours a day, chat
with a delegate, listen to a speech at the podium, or participate
in a poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of Dan or Peter or Tom telling you what's happening,
you will feel like you're experiencing the convention yourself,''
said David Bohrman, Pseudopolitics' chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the halls, in the press's workspace, some 55 Internet
news outlets will occupy ``Internet Alley'' in Philadelphia and 150
will set up shop on ``Internet Avenue'' in Los Angeles. Their
presence will represent the parties' first major accommodation to
convention coverage by the new medium, and according to GOP
spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick, it is fitting that this is happening
first in Philadelphia, where convention television debuted in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we were here was the first time a convention was
shown to a television audience,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``This time we
are back with the Internet in our quiver, and it's going to have as
revolutionary an impact as TV did 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will have their own convention Web sites, too,
(www.gopconvention.com and www.dems2000.com) but it is still
unclear whether the opportunity to remotely participate as a
``dot-com delegate'' will lure Americans on summer vacation to
events they generally find boring. But to the degree an exploding
number of cable television networks and Internet news sites provide
gavel-to-gavel convention coverage and fill hour after hour with
political gab, the parties and their nominees at least have a
fighting chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast expansion of media outlets is a bonanza for them,''
said Zachary Karabell, author of ``The Last Campaign: How Harry
Truman Won the 1948 Election.'' ``It's a great deal that the
parties can take their message to the voter with impunity. Whether
it's a great deal for the public is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study for Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on
the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, Karabell found that
over-the-air networks broadcasted about 60 hours of each party
convention in 1952, and 80 percent of US households, or about 65
million viewers, tuned in for 10 to 13 hours. By 1996, live network
coverage averaged eight hours, and only 10 percent of households
watched any of it.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between television and the political parties isn't
new. For two decades over-the-air networks have complained that
presidential primaries have sucked suspense out of the nominating
conventions, and by trying to make them dissent-free, the parties
have turned them into dull, scripted affairs. Irked by what they
think is the networks' obsession with ratings and profits, the
parties are scrambling this summer to add pizazz to their shows and
build audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, for example, are considering a ``rolling roll
call'' that would extend over three nights the traditional but
often tedious one-night call of the states (``The great state of
Massachusetts . . . casts its 37 votes for . . .''). It would add
pace to the program, GOP planners hope, plus guarantee that Texas
Governor George W. Bush triumphantly goes over the top as the
party's presidential nominee in prime time on Wednesday, Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also counting on star power to get the networks'
attention. Arizona Senator John McCain, Bush's chief opponent in
the primaries, is penciled in for a prime-time speech on Tuesday,
Aug. 1. That's the same night Presidents Bush and Ford and former
first lady Nancy Reagan are to appear. The vice presidential
nominee, expected to be named well before the convention, would
speak Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, wife of the presumptive nominee, is expected to
address the convention Monday night, as is Colin Powell. Since
convention managers learned ABC was planning to broadcast a
pre-season game between the Patriots and San Francisco 49ers
instead, they have been seriously studying how to schedule the
general's speech for halftime and get ABC to cut away from sports
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, there is a kind of internal struggle in the party
between turning the convention into an appealing television program
and dealing with the substance of what the convention is all
about,'' said Lester M. Crystal, executive producer of PBS's
``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' which will broadcast at least three
hours of convention coverage on each of eight nights. ``They are
trying to dress it up as much as possible, and there is a distinct
entertainment quotient to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Card, a former member of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives and former transportation secretary under President
Bush, who is running the GOP convention, insists that television is
``not going to drive our programming.'' Still, he acknowledges, the
party is looking for ``creative'' ways to focus the nation's
attention on the GOP nominee for four days before, during, and
after the convention, including nightly appearances by Bush in the
convention hall, either by video or in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans are smart, they will give up large gobs of
time to the networks for exclusive interviews with Bush and his
family,'' said Richard Bond, a former GOP chairman, who calls Bush
``a very seductive personality.'' ``It gets you around . . . TV
correspondents going out on the floor to find the angry delegate
with the funny hat and fetus in a jar _ a convention planner's
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has already put out the word that he wants a
positive, upbeat convention, including no criticism of President
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention will stress the positive, too, but so
far its planners have been less forthcoming about their strategies
for attracting attention to a candidate most Americans already know
well and a party that has held the White House for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the convention will focus on Vice President Gore's
biography and on his agenda for continuing the country's prosperity
and progress,'' said Peter Ragone, a Democratic convention
spokesman, adding that most of the program decisions have not yet
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' convention manager, recently
disclosed that both former enator Bill Bradley, who opposed Gore in
the primaries, and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is a
Senate candidate in New York, will give prime-time speeches.
President Clinton's full role is still undecided;typically,
presidents pass the torch and step out of the spotlight but
McAuliffe said the president is set to address the convention
Monday, Aug. 14.

   HOUSTON _ Ileana Trevino was surprised last month when she got a
report from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
(OFCCP) that showed that the University of Houston treated women
employees differently than men employees.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which issued the report after several months of
investigation, found that the university did not take appropriate
action to ensure that women were treated without regard to their
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Female faculty members who were interviewed had complained that
male colleagues had referred to them as ``girls'' and that while
men were called ``Dr.,'' women were called ``Ms.'' Female staff
members complained that although they are professionals, male
managers had asked them to ``fetch'' coffee.
</P>
<P>
   These were isolated examples reported by one or two women, which
hardly constituted the serious accusation of discriminatory
treatment, said Trevino, executive director of affirmative action
at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So she called the agency to express her dismay about what she
saw as overreaching by the body that investigates federal
government contractors for their affirmative action compliance. The
university is subject to the agency's audits because it receives
$20.3 million in federal research grants.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs agreed with Trevino and immediately changed the violation
to read that some women who were interviewed believed they were not
treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino said the change is a much better reflection of what she
calls the isolated comments that were made. The investigation _ the
university's first _ was comprehensive. It included an examination
of compensation, affirmative action programs and employment
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the federal agency that investigates equal employment
back off its original report? After spending close to a year doing
an investigation, shouldn't the agency have its analysis nailed
down?
</P>
<P>
   Lois Jimmerson, district director of the OFCCP in Houston, said
she can't comment on open cases. But she said the agency's main
focus is obtaining a remedy to correct a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Meyer, an employment lawyer at Seyfarth Shaw in Houston who
represents management interests, said he has found that the agency
will, on occasion, withdraw violations or change its tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an employer can persuade the agency to change the
violation to a lesser one. That usually happens if the facts don't
back up what the agency said was the original violation or if the
employer comes in with additional evidence, Meyer said. Either way,
it takes time and resources.
</P>
<P>
   The OFCCP isn't known as a barracuda in the employment
discrimination arena. It's willing to negotiate with employers if
it issues an assessment of violations that employers dispute, said
a source familiar with the inner workings of the OFCCP.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not known for an aggressive legal stance. Unlike other
agencies, the OFCCP, which is part of the Labor Department, doesn't
have its own flock of lawyers. It has to share lawyers with other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its agreement with OFCCP, the University of Houston
must send its managers and supervisors to sexual harassment
training and distribute to all employees a policy that prohibits
adverse treatment based on sex, that prohibits sexual harassment
and that prohibits intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   That type of requirement is common in discrimination cases. And
many companies and organizations routinely provide employee
training on discrimination and distribute anti-discrimination
policies to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The OFCCP also criticized the university for not having an
applicant tracking system in place when the on-site audit occurred
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, who said she was aware of that shortcoming when she
took the job, put a system in place in September that will track
applications and hires based on race, sex and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, the university will be able to
analyze trends on which applicants have been hired and promoted,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trevino said, she is satisfied with the report. ``It's
about as close as you can get to a clean bill of health,'' she
said.

<P>
   MACHIAS, Maine _ After the last shopping mall is long past, the
last bus station, the last stoplight, the road to Machias still
stretches out through the woods for an hour. On their way to their
new jobs, the three freshly minted psychiatrists had plenty of time
to think.
</P>
<P>
   Each knew that it had taken nearly six years to replace the last
psychiatrist practicing full time in this hardscrabble region, and
eventually _ through wry comments or dark warnings or small-town
murmurs _ they all found out that their predecessor had committed
suicide. Ebrahim Haroon, who arrived first, was thinking, ``It is
an ocean of quietness.'' Mary Beth Lardizabal was thinking, ``It is
the most beautiful place I have ever seen.'' Sue Bailey was
thinking, ``Let me test myself in Washington County.''
</P>
<P>
   With its combined remoteness and poverty, this county has a
reputation for driving mental health professionals out of the
specialty, or out of the region, or both.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly two years into their mission, the three are still
bewildered by the reservoir of need they found here, in a part of
the United States where mental illness is often handled within the
four walls of a household. From time to time, patients ventured
into their offices like visitors from another century: the
16-year-old autistic boy whose parents just considered him a
``loner;'' the patient who confided that her mother hadn't set foot
outside the house in 15 years; patients who had visited an
emergency room, certain they were dying, for a decade's worth of
anxiety attacks; the eccentric; the dotty; the different; the
touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does feel sometimes as if we are on the frontier,
both in terms of bringing psychiatric care to people who have never
had it, but also in terms of introducing the community at large to
the idea of psychiatry,'' Bailey said. ``I do feel that I am on an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, in one of the last vestiges of the great Maine woods,
doctors of all kinds take on a culture that discourages asking for
help, and mental health workers, like dentists, find themselves
forced to sell the very idea of their specialty. In ``A Maine
Hamlet,'' her memoir of growing up outside Machias at the turn of
the century, Lura Beam recalled the townspeople's pragmatic
approach to acts of despair _ a butcher who shot himself was
presumed to have ``become melancholy from seeing too much blood'' _
and their dismissal of most medical treatment as weak-minded
``dosing.'' Looking back on her childhood home, Beam admiringly
described the region's ethic of stoicism: ``Health in the hamlet
may have been superior, or people may not have talked about how
they felt. The tradition was in favor of endurance and the tight
lip.''
</P>
<P>
   That tradition was only one of the obstacles thrown in front of
the new doctors who arrived from the city: Haroon, 43, the son of a
Madras, India, pediatrician; Lardizabal, 38, who was raised in a
tiny Maryland town where her father treated black-lung disease; and
Bailey, 46, a former college writing instructor whose fascination
with schizophrenia started with her own brother and sister. It
didn't take long for the county's three full-time psychiatrists to
meet over a cathartic breakfast, comparing notes about the strange
landscape onto which they had stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking one surgeon _ who will remain nameless _
what he did when someone needs psychiatric referral,'' Lardizabal
said. ``He said, `I send them out into the woods.' It was kind of
weird and frightening. I didn't know if he was joking or not.''
</P>
<P>
   With little access to psychiatric care, people such as Lillian
and Ray Hanscom, who moved into the county with a schizophrenic son
in his early 20s, were left to deal with his illness almost two
hours from the nearest mental ward. As they grew frailer and he
grew stronger, the anxiety forced the difficult decision to send
him to Bangor, where he lives in a roominghouse closer to the
services he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, say mental health professionals, there was another set of
people whose illnesses simply disappeared into country life _
wanderers who drifted into the North Woods, where their behavior
wouldn't bother anyone, or who were absorbed into a comfortable
role as the town drunk or the local eccentric. For those doctors
who stepped in to fill the gap, the pressure could be unbearable.
John A. Edwards, who has spent years recruiting personnel for
Washington County Psychotherapy Associates, has seen it too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring one person into this community would be sealing their
fate,'' he said. ``I can guarantee that that would be the case. I
mean, they would be so bombarded.''
</P>
<P>
   No less important was the comfort of having colleagues to talk
to. Like mental health professionals in all of the nation's rural
and frontier country, Haroon, Lardizabal, and Bailey ran into a set
of conditions that challenged their urban training. The first was a
two-way lack of anonymity. Doctors find themselves breaking a
baseline principle of urban practice by treating multiple members
of the same family, carving out a position ``much more akin to the
old family doc,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are exquisitely conscious that every notation taken in
therapy might be transcribed, then filed by someone who lived in
their town. Therapists struggle with a desperate, bone-deep
resistance to telling their secrets. Christine White, who has
practiced psychiatry part time in Calais for three years, says that
several times a patient has ``opened up to (her) and then never
come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of safety is very different in a rural community,''
White said. ``If they actually, truly tell me their secrets, then
their experience 99 percent of the time'' was loss of control over
the information.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, mental health workers lose the professional
neutrality that typically accompanies the wing chair and the
waiting room. In small towns, mental health workers can't avoid
socializing with patients, opening up a world of unsolicited
information, not only about their patients' personal lives, but
about their own. Dana Bartone, who practices psychiatry in
Aroostook County, said he once had the unsettling experience of
looking over his shoulder on his way home and realizing that his
last patient was following him down the street, just to see where
he lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I walk around realizing that most people I pass know
who I am, but I don't know who they are,'' Lardizabal said.
</P>
<P>
   And while many of the doctors' complaints are the challenges of
treating poor people anywhere _ chiefly that managed care has made
mental health services less available and accessible _ the
residents of Maine's back country offered a different array of
problems from city dwellers. Here, in a county whose unemployment
rate is consistently one of the state's highest, major depression
is common among men. Bailey said she had been shocked at the number
of panic disorders she comes across, and, like White, encounters a
huge number of cases caused by abuse and trauma within families. A
particular marker of the cases White has found in small towns is
that abuse was common knowledge, said White, who has begun to think
that ``isolation breeds some brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   What they are less likely to see is the ``worried well.'' White,
a specialist in borderline personality disorders, said her practice
in Washington County has been notably devoid of ``attention-seeking
behavior'' like self-mutilation _ probably, she offers, because
there's no one around to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   Lardizabal, a child psychiatrist, has seen almost no eating
disorders. And there are some illnesses, schizophrenia, for example
that actually seem to improve in rural areas because there is so
little stimulus, White said.
</P>
<P>
   And small-town communities, they all agree, take on far greater
responsibility for taking care of their mentally ill _ to the
extent, Edwards said, that if a resident ``doesn't show up to talk
to the lamppost, neighbors will call the police to check up on him
or her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, rural families such as the Hanscoms might have
gotten more, not less, attention. Rural areas have scraped by with
minimal mental health services ever since the early 1970s, when
progressives pushed to replace state mental hospitals with more
humane community-based services, said Gerald Grob, a professor at
Rutgers University and author of ``The Mad Among Us: A History of
the Care of America's Mentally Ill.'' Those services never
materialized in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, central cities boast 17.2 psychiatrists per 100,000
people; rural communities with a population of less than 2,500 have
fewer than one psychiatrist per 100,000 people. Of the 711 counties
federally designated ``health provider shortage areas'' for
psychiatry, 70 percent are in nonmetropolitan areas. Rural patients
are so inaccessible that some mental health policy makers say the
best hope for reaching them lies in online counseling, despite
worries about confidentiality and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New England, home to more psychiatrists than any other
region in the United States, availability of treatment is skewed
toward city dwellers. Massachusetts has 26 psychiatrists per
100,000 people, the most of any state in the union; Maine has only
11 per 100,000, roughly the national average. Of those, more than
half practice in Cumberland County, the county that includes
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Washington County's sixth psychiatrist is due to open his
practice shortly. Still, demand for services remains strong, and
Lardizabal ventures the opinion that what they have seen is only
``the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so surprising, because for years you never heard
anything, and all of a sudden all these mentally ill people are
coming out of the woodwork,'' said Lillian Hanscom, 69, who as a
member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill lobbied the
state for years to fund a psychiatrist for the county. ``It's
almost like Jane Eyre, keeping them up there in the attic. They
just sort of kept them at home.''
</P>
<P>
   And the next question, for the doctors who took the chance of
coming here, is whether they will stay after their three- and
four-year assignments end. Lardizabal says yes. Haroon, whose wife
is also a doctor, says he is ``keeping an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who calls her work ``amazingly absorbing,'' isn't sure
she has it in her: She has begun to believe in the
character-shaping power of weather and to think that she, who spent
her girlhood in New Orleans, will never grow the right kind of
armor. There was one day last winter when she looked out at her
driveway, sheathed in ice, and thought: ``I can't do this. I can't
take Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled herself together, turned around, and trudged inside
to shovel out the ashes from her wood stove and scatter them. In
the end, it's the weather that she thinks could get to her. That,
or the isolation. Lura Beam recalled these woods a hundred years
ago, when the front door of every house faced south, toward ``the
town, a solid fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person going to the north,'' she wrote, ``was soon
absolutely alone.''

<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Butterfly'' Filmmaker Jose Luis Cuerda evokes the
poignantly brief days of Spain's Republic, before it was snuffed
out by Franco. Its liberal expansiveness is personified by the
great Fernando Fernan Gomez, who plays an enlightenment figure, a
village teacher, in this handsomely crafted film that curiously and
stubbornly never takes wing. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Chicken Run'' It's amazing how much life Britain's
Aardman animation gang can breathe into a load of clay, sculpted
into a flock of chickens, led by a plucky pullet and a randy Yank
rooster, looking for a great escape from a podgy, retro British
farm about to be turned into a concentration camp for chickens.
(G) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Chutney Popcorn'' Nisha Ganatra wrote, directed, and stars as
a lesbian who volunteers to serve as surrogate mother for her
married sister who can't have children. Before she knows it, her
own relationship is threatened and the family dynamic is even more
warped than ever. It's messy, tender, funny, and unpredictable. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Groove'' Greg Harrison's loving and lovable celebration
of the San Francisco underground rave scene. It's never too dazed
and confused to generate a sweet communal vibe as its ravers juggle
a search for love and a need to appear cool, even while drugged,
under the big glitter dome that stands as a metaphor for the movie
itself. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
!!! ``Me, Myself and Irene'' Jim Carrey's farce about a Rhode
Island state trooper with a split personality will please fans
awaiting his return to the contortionist slapstick that made him a
star. Still, this Farrelly brothers film is frankly in and out. It
has laughs. It also has a lot of dead air and barely a plot. It
needs help, and gets a lot of it from the black triplet genius
rappers. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Sunshine'' There's much to admire in Istvan Szabo's
gorgeous, heartfelt generational epic about the high cost of
assimilation paid by three generations of a family of Hungarian
Jews over a century, dominated by Ralph Fiennes in three roles and
Jennifer Ehle as a spirited woman who shakes up the family's
self-defeating need for acceptance and respectability. But it's
broader than it is deep, and the male characters' blindness
depletes our sympathy for them. (R)

THE FORMER MARKY MARK REMAKES HIMSELF IN HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-ART-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ ``Come HERE!'' A gaggle of girls calls from
the green across Harbor Loop, their voices blending with the call
of hovering gulls, who also seem to be ogling the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg steps out of the back door of a shiny black car,
in town to flog his new movie, ``The Perfect Storm,'' and he turns
around to face them. ``Not now,'' he yells in his familiar
Dorchester accent, smirking, his hand shading his squinty eyes from
the bright sky. ``Not now!'' Resigned, and maybe relieved, the
girls reply in unison: ``We love you!''
</P>
<P>
   But the question of the moment regarding Mark Wahlberg is this:
Which Mark do they love? Because in his decade of fame and fortune,
Wahlberg has been a couple of very different men. The 29-year-old
who's being led by publicists onto a dock weighted with
international press is an actor whom some claim has already been
cheated out of an Oscar nomination for ``Boogie Nights.'' He is a
protege and friend of George Clooney, he has made 12 movies (two of
them, ``Three Kings'' and ``Boogie Nights,'' were critical
darlings), and he is doing meetings with Hollywood heavies like Tim
Burton about future projects. His role in ``The Perfect Storm,''
which will probably rock the box office after its June 30 opening,
moves him up a peg from the kid-with-promise category to
he-could-be-a-star status. As proof, ads for ``The Perfect Storm''
feature his name alongside Clooney's, above the title. Today, Mark
Wahlberg is Marquee Mark.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, he is also a man who claims to attend church
and pray regularly, who rescues friends from the same Dorchester
streets that almost led him to a life behind bars, and who says,
without betraying a hint of irony, ``If I can inspire one person to
do something, that's a huge accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But . . . as anyone with a magazine subscription or a remote
control knows all too well, not many years ago Wahlberg's image
appeared on the other side of the coin. First, he was a
flash-in-the-pan rapper named Marky Mark, an accused homophobe, and
an unrepentant Dorchester punk who'd spent 45 days in jail at age
16 for a racially tinged assault. Then, thanks to Calvin Klein, he
was an underwear model and a ripped gay icon with a famously
airbrushed third nipple. And all along, he was a shock artist who
liked to drop his pants onstage, who dedicated the official Marky
Mark book to his penis, and who staged a tiff at an LA party with
fellow underwear aficionado Madonna and her entourage.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he was the Perfect Worm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, overlooking the harbor where he spent a few weeks filming
outdoor shots for ``The Perfect Storm'' last fall, Wahlberg talks
about his stormy history both with quiet regret and with the shrewd
understanding that it's the dishiest part of his media profile,
that it's his sales pitch. Publicists often warn interviewers off
unattractive topics _ and racism, violence, drug abuse, and a
vacation at Deer Island certainly qualify as unattractive _ but no
one has tried to control Wahlberg's spin during the ``Storm''
promotion. Truth is, many young actors in Hollywood _ the ones who,
like Wahlberg, wear scruffy goatees, stringy hair, and loose jeans
_ would love to add juvenile delinquency and House of Detention to
their resumes. Wahlberg's authentic ``street'' aura, the sense that
he actually stole cars and sold drugs, is precisely what Hollywood
casting agents and directors are sniffing around for.
</P>
<P>
   And so the tales of Wahlberg's illegalities and immoralities
trail him. ``They keep writing the same article over and over,'' he
says without much annoyance. ``I actually had a talk with the
president of one of the studios about it. They were trying to get
me to do this interview, this magazine cover, and I said, `Look, I
did something for that magazine before and they just wrote the same
story. This is their angle.' And he said, `That's why you should do
it! They (expletive) love it! It's great.' ''

   What would a more updated Mark Wahlberg story sound like? ``It
would talk about the obsession with my past,'' he says, ``and my
understanding it, and being OK with it to a certain extent. But not
getting off the path of what I'm trying to do as a person, which is
to really develop myself, which is to grow and continue to educate
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I wake up and try to make myself a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   In talking about his psychological changes since he put Marky
Mark behind him, Wahlberg pulls out stock phrases like ``Comes a
time when you have to look in the mirror'' and ``You get to a
certain age where you're supposed to know what right and wrong
is.'' But, leaning over the tape recorder, his hazel eyes admit no
possibility that he's putting on a performance, or that he's on the
automatic pilot that performers succumb to after doing years of
press. He bears a heightened sincerity, and indeed, when the
interview is over he says he'll call later to elaborate on his
changes. Unlike most Hollywood players, he follows through on his
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate to get out of Dorchester for a little
while to see that that's not how the rest of the world thinks,'' he
says. Despite skepticism from friends and colleagues, he goes to
church on a regular basis. ``I'm trying to make up for all the
(expletive) I did. Being raised Catholic is tough, man. I don't
look at my girlfriend in a sexual way too long without feeling
guilty and blessing myself'' _ he crosses himself to illustrate.
``It helps me, and I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set of the movie he just filmed, ``Metal God,'' which is
being executive produced by Clooney, Wahlberg's fellow cast members
were surprised by his reverence. ``I'm playing a guy who's thrust
into the rock 'n' roll spotlight in the '80s. Lots of sex, drugs,
and rock 'n' roll. But once we got off the set, I'm talking about,
`God I gotta go to church. Lord forgive me.' They sit there with
this look on their faces, they can't figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me. Nothing makes me feel better about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind his career, he says, there are larger motives:
self-expression and the chance to serve as a role model. ``I'm
doing all these things to get me where I'm supposed to be. I don't
think it's on a movie set. I don't think that's where I belong. But
I think I need to have a big enough voice to get my message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come from where I come from and accomplish the things I
have, to set goals like really going out and educating kids and
religion _ and God knows all the (expletive) that goes on on the
streets today _ is not something people expect. I'm not doing it to
shock them, either. I just feel like, anything to make me feel
better. To do something for somebody makes me feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making another couple of million dollars, I don't want to jump
for joy. It puts a smile on my face for a couple of minutes and
it's nice to know that if I want something I can have it, as far as
material things. But what I want spiritually, I gotta work for.
Every day. I enjoy that work, more than I enjoy my acting.''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 GLOUCESTER, Mass.: ... my acting.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, these sober, compassionate, generous, religious
thoughts pour out of an actor who mastered his craft not at
Juilliard but, as he says, ``running around the streets of
Dorchester, man, and then sitting in front of the judge telling him
it wasn't me.'' He spent his early life pulling fast ones without
the benefit of a bulky Hollywood income. He's good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg is a natural actor, and while it may be a challenge to
buy his spiritual reformation, audiences have had no trouble
accepting his career re-formation. Indeed, he has accomplished a
feat that has eluded many a musician longing for acting legitimacy,
even Madonna, she of the steely 1980s-style willpower. The reason:
Since his first big role in Penny Marshall's ``Renaissance Man,''
in 1994, he has delivered very few false moments on screen. Like
Courtney Love and Ice Cube, he has managed to deliver the goods.
Sure, Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson and Madonna may think they
can act because they've posed dramatically in countless MTV videos,
but walking and talking without music for more than four minutes _
well, that's quite a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it was going to be pretty close to impossible,''
Wahlberg says about the switch to acting. The fact that he was
considered a model after his Calvin campaigns didn't help: The only
thing funnier than a singer in Hollywood is a model with a script.
``Everybody just laughed out loud. They laughed in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   He says working with Marshall and Danny DeVito on ``Renaissance
Man'' helped him plot the tricky course. ``They were very different
from the guy who was trying to get me to play a white rapper in
`Sister Act 2.' . . . If I went down that road, I would probabaly
have a shorter movie career than Vanilla Ice, who did one film.''
Wahlberg has had a number of mentors over the years, and he
mentions Marshall and her advice a number of times during the day.
``First and foremost, I didn't care about commercial sucess. I
wanted people to say, `That kid's good.' That's my whole thing. I
don't like to be laughed at. I don't take myself all that
seriously, but I take my work very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boogie Nights'' in 1997 was the turning point in his acting
career. In the company of respected names like Julianne Moore and
William H. Macy, he gave a fine central performance as a porn stud
with a phenomenally large penis. (He keeps the prosthetic member at
home, he jokes: ``It's my prized possession.'') Filmmakers took
notice, and soon he was being courted by honchos with action
blockbusters in their eyes and $10 million paydays in their
wallets. ``I love watching action movies,'' he says. ``But I don't
want to be an action star. I don't want to be Jean-Claude Van
Damme, that's for sure. He's a likable guy, but as an actor, that's
not what I want. I have more to offer. . . . I am talking about a
kind of big movie right now, but it's with a very artistic director
_ Tim Burton.'' Burton is remaking ``Planet of the Apes.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mark and George Show &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg says he's proud of ``The Perfect Storm,'' and that that
makes it easy to talk to the media right now. During the filming,
he felt a pressing responsibility to the men who died when the
Andrea Gail sank in 1991, as well as to their families and the
people of Gloucester, and he says that responsibility was as
intense as the role's great physically demands.
</P>
<P>
   While Clooney was his usual wry, jokey self on the set, he was
slightly less buoyant: ``When we're on that boat and we don't know
if we're going to make it out of that storm, that's how I felt.
George has that ability to snap in and out of it. But I like to
stay there and stick it out. . . . I feel better if I'm there all
day and when the day is done and the scene is done, I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he and Clooney, who suggested him for the
``Perfect Storm'' role, have cultivated a playful rapport that
requires them to give each other a hard time. They have become The
Mark and George Show, and they decided not to do joint interviews
for the movie since they find it impossible to be serious together.
Working with Clooney this time around was easier than ``Three
Kings,'' he says. ``I could just tell him to shut up! I didn't have
to deal with his (expletive), listening to him explain the scene to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was like we never missed a beat. It was like being on
the basketball court with someone you've played with so long, you
know where they are and where they're gonna be. The guy is
great.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rap redux? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The music industry hasn't entirely forgotten about Wahlberg,
even if he has been trying to forget about it. The Innerscope label
recently approached him with a lucrative offer. ``They figure
they'll sell 5 or 10 million records,'' he says, ``and they'll get
me out there like Will Smith looking like a jackass _ not to say
that Will Smith is a jackass, but I wouldn't look good running
around in my underwear at this stage of the game. They know that.
They're smart. It doesn't hurt them to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's involved in a heavy metal soundtrack for ``Metal
God,'' he says he'll leave rapping to other guys, like Eminem and
Dr. Dre. And what does he think of Eminem, the white rapper who
recently released a new album? ``It's a little much at times, but
you can't take away that the kid's talented. . . . Me, personally,
it's not going to make me go out and do anything, but I know how
movies and music have an effect on people and especially kids. So.
You know. But everybody's entitled to do and say what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after all, who knows what the future will bring? In 10
years, Wahlberg may find himself competing for roles with a
mellowed musician named Marshall Mathers, who has turned to the art
of acting. He used to go by Eminem.

<P>
   Some people's time is more valuable than other people's time.
</P>
<P>
   Their time is prime time. My time is off-peak, way off-peak.
</P>
<P>
   I answer the telephone, and I know I'm talking to someone whose
time is more valuable than mine because she doesn't ask, ``Are you
busy?'' or ``Am I interrupting?''
</P>
<P>
   She just launches into whatever she has to say because she can't
afford to waste any of her valuable time. And she keeps on talking,
and talking, and talking because she knows that what she wants to
tell me is more important than anything I might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes she puts me on hold so she can take a call
from somebody whose time is also more important than mine, even
though he may be calling in the form of a recorded message asking
if she'd like to take advantage of some fabulous,
once-in-a-lifetime deal on magazine subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Some people's time is so valuable they have someone else who
calls to make sure I'm there before they start talking. These
people can't afford to waste even a second. They want me to do
something for them right away, this minute. Their time must be
really precious because when I call them, they're always too busy
to talk. ``I'll have my people call your people,'' one of them may
say. If his people do call, they soon find out that I don't have
any people, which means my time can't be very valuable, so I can't
be worth talking to, until the next time one of them wants
something.
</P>
<P>
   My time seems to be especially worthless when I'm driving. That
guy talking on the phone and speeding past on the right in the
break-down lane? His time is really valuable. And that woman who
cut in front of me to get into the express lane? Normally that lane
is reserved for cars carrying two or more people, but she must have
a special sticker from the Precious Time Division of the DMV that
allows her to drive alone in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell by just looking at certain cars that the drivers'
time is a lot more valuable than mine. BMWs. Saabs. SUVs. And
convertibles, in summertime. I get out of their way. I don't want
to hold them up, not that I could because they can see by my
10-year-old Geo Prizm that my time is of no importance, so they can
cut me off whenever they like. I have all the time in the world,
which is lucky for me because I need to spend so much of it
bringing my car to the shop for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the supermarket my time is of no value whatsoever compared to
that of the woman in front of me in the ``8 Items or Fewer'' line.
I can tell that her time is extremely precious because she didn't
want to wait in one of the regular lines, even though she has about
30 items. She has important things to do, no time to waste. It's
obvious. The cashier ringing her up can see how valuable this
woman's time is because she didn't say a word to her about the size
of her order.
</P>
<P>
   Salespeople seem to know instinctively who has time to kill and
who doesn't. I'm in a store, about to buy a sweater when the phone
rings. The saleswoman leaves me in mid-transaction and rushes to
answer. Is she expecting an important call? Could it be Regis
Philbin? Is she somebody's lifeline?
</P>
<P>
   No. It's a customer whose time is too valuable to squander on
shopping in person. The saleswoman spends several long minutes on
the phone with her, while I wait because my time is of no account.
They both know, shopper and saleswoman, that I won't mind waiting,
that I have nothing important to do. My time is their time,
literally. Why get upset? Time is on my side, in the long run, but
only in the long run.

CONTROLLING `THE PERFECT STORM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ This is a town where the names on a wall in
a church memorialize men lost not in conventional wars, but at sea,
in fishing boats. On Friday, one such loss that took place in 1991
when three weather systems collided, will become one of those big
pop myths known as a Hollywood movie. ``The Perfect Storm,'' based
on Sebastian Junger's riveting best-seller, will focus even more
attention on Gloucester than the book has. Starring George Clooney
as the ship's captain, Billy Tyne, and Mark Wahlberg as fisherman
Bobby Shatford, the film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen. At 59,
Petersen still speaks with a pronounced German accent, although he
has been working in Hollywood, helming such films as ``Air Force
One,'' ``In the Line of Fire'' and ``Outbreak'' since ``Das Boot,''
about a German U-boat crew, made him an international name in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the working deck of the sister ship of the Andrea
Gail (used in the film), Petersen's voyage, with this film at
least, is over. Relaxed, wearing a baseball cap, blue work shirt
and jeans, letting deck slosh wash over his bare feet, Petersen
contemplates the rusting steelwork on the ship. It is another
reminder, in a microcosm where nobody needs one, of just how
unsparing the sea and salt air can be. Nine months ago, Petersen,
Clooney, Wahlberg and the others were in Gloucester before the lens
caps came off the cameras, immersing themselves in the world of the
film. The actors readily connected with the locals. Although
Clooney hates being cold and wet, and was drenched repeatedly, the
only injury he sustained came when he twisted his neck playing
basketball with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg, who is more sensitive than his screen roles have
shown, was respectful enough of the Shatford family's feelings to
secure their blessings before living in Bobby Shatford's tiny room
above the bar and fishermen's hangout known as The Crow's Nest.
Wahlberg stayed in the room with Bobby Shatford's brother, Rick
(seen as a fisherman in the film). Clooney, too, felt enough of a
connection to the families to promise them the film wouldn't betray
them, and then worried about keeping the promise. While Clooney and
Wahlberg were embarked upon their high-profile bonding, Petersen
was the one who sat quietly and almost anonymously in The Crow's
Nest night after night, soaking up details. The actors said they
were welcomed warmly by friends and family members, including Ethel
Shatford, Bobby's and Rick's mother, who tended bar at The Crow's
Nest, and died shortly after filming was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, 59, grew up around boats in the German port city of
Hamburg. ``Most of my concern was to get the feel of it right,'' he
says. ``The reality of the characters, the world of the fishermen.
Maybe being German might be an advantage, to see it at a little bit
of a distance. One night I was sitting around and this captain,
this skipper, had a little too many beers and he was dancing with
his girlfriend on the dance floor and he came over to me and he put
his arm around me and looked very deep into my eyes and said, `Make
it real.' He had, I would not say a threat in his voice, but he was
very clear about it. Again he said, `Make it real.' It gave me a
little bit the shivers. I said to myself, `Omigod, this guy is damn
right! I mean I have some kind of responsibility here. If I really
tell the story of the Andrea Gail as a big Hollywood movie, I
better get it real and right.' The most important screening, the
biggest test, will be when we show the movie here. On the set, they
said I was a stickler for detail. They were absolutely right. We
had fishermen advising us all the way. If we had some rigging
wrong, we wanted to know about it. If George was steering the boat
wrong, we wanted to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone got a bit more rightness than anyone had anticipated.
``It surprised us that when we were here in September of last year,
all of a sudden this Hurricane Floyd developed over Bermuda and
came pretty fast over here, pointed toward Gloucester. I mean, we
were a little bit panicked with our boats and a huge crew here.
Then all of a sudden, it went away, back out to sea. We took
advantage of it. We raced to our boats and went out to sea and
caught the tail end of Hurricane Floyd, five miles out. We caught a
big swell, not huge huge, but one you could manage, about 12 feet
or so, and we shot right there. About half the crew got seasick,
especially Mark. That was the downside. What we did with him and
George, it was really close to jumping over the railing into the
water. But somehow the professionalism kept things together. It
wasn't easy, but we got footage that had a real authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The rigging of the boat was easy compared to the rigging of the
script. Junger's book, the starting point for Petersen's
determination to make the film, is superior journalism. As such, it
doesn't describe what happened once the Andrea Gail lost radio
contact. Petersen and screenwriters William Wittliff and Bo Goldman
had to guess at what might have happened, and put it onscreen, but
within the limits of sober plausibility if it was to fit with the
parts of the film that came straight from Junger's book. ``From the
moment when the Andrea Gail goes out to sea, with the exception of
a few radio calls, nobody knows what actually really happened
there,'' Petersen says. ``We had to fictionalize it. Sebastian had
some ideas, based on what happened on other boats. The antenna
sequence, when Bobby goes up to fix the antenna, is based on
Sebastian's idea that because communication was lost, they might
have lost their antenna. It was a plausible scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark sequence that happens to Murph (one of the other
fishermen) actually happened, but on a different boat. You know
what our big action sequences are? It's not like crash-landing on a
planet. It's not car chases with buildings exploding. It's a guy
going up to fix an antenna, another guy crawling out on the arm of
the boat with a torch to cut off a chain that's swinging around and
doing damage, and the other guys trying to put plywood on a broken
window. It seems like it's so little, but it's everything for them.
If you cannot get the plywood up on the windows, it is indeed the
end of them because with those broken windows there is no way they
can make it through the storm. So it seems just like an antenna or
plywood, but it's their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Gloucester filming _ three weeks of a three-month
shoot _ involved exteriors. Most of the storm sequences were shot
in an immense water tank in a soundstage on the Warner lot in
Burbank, previously used for ``PT 109'' and ``The Old Man and the
Sea.'' Day after day, water was shot from cannons and poured from
drums over Wahlberg, Clooney and the others, against the biggest
blue screen ever, over which huge state-of-the-art waves now wash,
supplied by the keyboards at Industrial Light &AMP; Magic. Drenchings,
sinus infections, ear infections, actors hosed under high pressure
from one side of the deck to the other as the boat rocked on a huge
ball and socket known as a gimbal, even a few near-drownings became
commonplace. Petersen likens the physical challenge confronted by
the actors to the partly macho stimulation of the dangerous fishing
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen believes that the prospect of escape from land-based
cares and the kicking in of the male tribal hunting reflex play no
small part in the year-in, year-out pursuit of fish. Still, the
most successful captain in ``The Perfect Storm'' is not Clooney's
grizzled pro, but Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's real-life seagoing
colleague, Linda Greenlaw. In the film, Greenlaw's success is used
to flog Tyne into going out one more time to end the season on a
high. ``Telling him, as the boat owner does, to follow Linda to the
fish, that's not nice. Follow a woman? That's the toughest thing
you can tell a fisherman.''
</P>
<P>
   An almost parallel challenge cropped up in the casting process.
After things didn't work out with Mel Gibson and Nicolas Cage,
Petersen approached Clooney, who saw himself in the role of the
younger Bobby Shatford. ``I talked him into it,'' Petersen says. I
said, `George, Bobby is a 27-year-old man and Billy Tyne is like
your age, 38. You should step up to soemthing darker and and edgier
and fill those big shoes because you can do it.' At first he was a
little leery, but we talked and talked, and finally, he was, like,
`I'll do it, I'll do it.' It was George who suggested Mark. He
liked working with him in `Three Kings' and has since teamed up
with him on two more films (`Metal God' and the remake of `Ocean's
11'). I met Mark and it was done in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Having plucked his stars from Hollywood's A-list, Petersen then
set about de-Hollywoodizing the film as much as possible. ``Most of
my concentration was to get the structure and characters and feel
of it right and not let Hollywood moments creep in. There was never
any discussion about changing any of the book's elements,
especially the ending. All the characters come from the book with
one exception, Irene. You'll judge for yourself how she fits in.
After two months of prep work and after seeing the test results, I
knew we could create an absolutely believable storm. I was
convinced the spectacular effects would work out fine. It was the
other that concerned me. I'm a part of Hollywood. I'm a director
who works there. But if we did this film right, we don't want
applause at the end. You just want people kind of sitting there. If
people say `This is the world of Gloucester and this is the world
of fishermen and the film got it right,' that would make me really
proud. Much more proud than if somebody would say, `Hey, that was a
really cool storm.' ''

   More and more states are requiring students to pass a
standardized test as a condition of getting a high school diploma,
and the complaints are flying fast and thick. These tests are
unfair, the grumblers grumble. They ask irrelevant questions, the
fumers fume. They subvert regular lessons. They force educators to
teach to the test. They aren't good yardsticks of what students
really know. They're racist.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the statewide MCAS test won't become a
graduation requirement until 2003. 12th-graders will be able to
meet that requirement by scoring just one point above failing on
the (itals)10th(unitals)-grade test. (Only math and English
questions will count; failure in science and history will not
prevent graduation.) But even that low hurdle is under fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MCAS doesn't take into account artistic talent or
vocational skills,'' a Cambridge girl writes in The Boston Globe.
``The fact that a child's future should be determined by knowing or
not knowing certain dates or formulas is ridiculous.'' An older
Cambridge resident finds it appalling that ``the difference between
a diploma and doomsday'' should ``come down to a byzantine trivial
pursuit.'' Who really imagines, they and others ask, that any
prospective employer will care if these students learned about the
1950s policy of containment, or if they know that Voltaire and
Rousseau are associated with the Enlightenment and not the
Industrial Revolution?
</P>
<P>
   A little perspective. Pupils, parents, and pundits who think
today's standardized tests are intolerable might find it
instructive to look at the kinds of tests high schools used to
administer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, what students in California's Central
Valley were once expected to know. Here are some questions from the
history portion of the 1914 Kern County High School test. These
were not multiple choice; students had to write short essays, not
fill in a circle with a No. 2 pencil. (Some questions in this
column have been condensed or edited for clarity.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Give an account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   --Connect these names with US history: Captain Perry, Robert
Fulton, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Lafayette, General Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   --Give an account of the causes of the Civil War. Name four
battles and the opposing generals in each.
</P>
<P>
   --Tell all you can of the events of the McKinley Administration.
</P>
<P>
   --Give a brief account of the construction of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   --Explain the effects of World War I on the commerce of the US.
On the revenue of the US. What remedies have been applied?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As kids are the same in every era, no doubt there were plenty in
1914 who resented having to master such ``ridiculous'' and
``byzantine'' details. What employer, some must have muttered, is
ever going to ask me about the Panama Canal?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some adult, overhearing this dissent, paused to explain
that there (itals)was(unitals) value in learning about the Panama
Canal and the Civil War generals _ value both in the knowledge
itself and in honing the intellectual tools needed to learn about
anything. Or perhaps this adult simply invited the disgruntled
students to consider the sorts of test questions their parents had
once grappled with.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, for example, the graduation test in Saline County,
Kan., included 10 questions on orthography. A few of them:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What are elementary sounds? How are they classified?
</P>
<P>
   --What are the following? Give examples: trigraph, subvocals,
diphthong, cognate letters, linguals.
</P>
<P>
   --Use the following in sentences: cite, site, sight, fane, fain,
feign, vane, vain, vein, raze, raise, rays.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And some of the arithmetic questions:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --A wagon box is 2 feet deep, 10 feet long, and 3 feet wide. How
many bushels of wheat will it hold?
</P>
<P>
   --Find the interest on $512.60 for 8 months and 18 days at 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   --District 33 has a valuation of $35,000. What is the necessary
levy to carry on a school seven months at $50 per month, and have
$104 for incidentals?
</P>
<P>
   --What is the cost of 40 boards, 12 inches wide and 16 feet
long, at $.20 per inch?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too tough? Tell that to the New Jersey kids who had sat down to
be tested a decade earlier. In 1885, the Jersey City High School
exam covered algebra, arithmetic, geography, grammar, and US
history. From the geography portion:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What is the axis of the earth? What is the equator? What is
the distance from the equator to either pole in degrees and in
miles?
</P>
<P>
   --Name four principal mountain ranges in Asia, three in Europe,
and three in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   --Name the states on the west bank of the Mississippi, and the
capital of each.
</P>
<P>
   --What are the principal exports of France? Of the West Indies?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hold students to high standards of learning, and odds are they
will meet them. Worry more about their self-esteem or the
``diversity'' of their textbooks, and they'll probably learn much
less. Are you amazed that high school graduates a century ago could
handle questions like the ones in this column? Actually, they could
handle far more. You see, the questions you've just read were all
from tests to get (itals)into(unitals) high school. They were
tests, in other words, of what the educated eighth-grader was
presumed to have mastered.

BIG OIL'S HAND CAUGHT IN JAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Why? Why now? Why so much? For that matter, why at
all?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. The oil business is still as much a racket as it is
economic enterprise, and politics remains as important a component
in the price of its products as oil, refining, and transportation
costs. And where politics intrudes, antitrust collusion and
price-gouging flow right along with the crude.
</P>
<P>
   At first last winter price increases bore a straightforward
connection to the attempt by the international cartel to reassert
world market power by limiting production. The major US-owned
corporations have always been tacitly complicit in the shenanigans
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but at least
the routine was a familiar one to energy watchers and the worst of
it was pretty much over by this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as a century of technological miracles and commercial
outrages demonstrates it always does, Big Oil overreached and is
now in the process of getting caught. The Federal Trade
Commission's subpoenas went out at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the political reaction focused on prices, producing
fears of inflation, recession, and shortage. They were mostly
unfounded; this is not 1973.But the worm is turning, and the focus
is shifting to Big Oil, where diligent investigators have an
excellent opportunity to produce a gusher in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and Milwaukee are slowly turning into the smoking guns
after having begun the month as the designated victims.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Wholesale prices in these cities peaked at least two
weeks ago. They not only peaked, they then started to plummet.But
retail prices never budged until something hit the fan a few days
ago called public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   It started in Chicago on June 15 when the wholesale price was
$1.60 a gallon, which proceeded to dive below $1.30 at the end of
last week. But the retail price, $2.11 earlier in the month, was
still $2.13 last Wednesday on average.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly to the north, the wholesale price in Milwaukee
nosedived to $1.33 from $1.58 gallon earlier in June, but the
retail price ($2.02 in mid-June) was still $2.01 last week.
</P>
<P>
   And both of those retail prices were an eyebrow-raising 40 cents
above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident. The price figures were collected by OPIS
Energy Group, one of the firms that tracks the wacky world of
prices in a market that is designed not to make sense so producers
can make more money.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the consumers of the information was Carol Browner,
head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who proceeded to slice
through Big Oil's pose. In office since 1993, Browner has proved
that common-sense regulation can make productive allies of business
and government in modern pollution-fighting, and that the process
is growing a major new industry in this country.
</P>
<P>
   She is one smart cop who has placed protecting public health at
the center of policy making and policing. The big electric
utilities have already found that out in the war over strengthening
controls on smog and soot. Last week, Big Oil got a taste.
</P>
<P>
   On the scene in the Midwest, she destroyed the complaint that
regulations effective this year requiring cleaner fuels in parts of
the country with bad summer air pollution have anything to do with
the price spikes. How could they, the wholesale price has been
falling like a rock. And on the way up, the new regulations (in the
works for a decade) have been found to have increased costs by the
minute figure, at most, of roughly three cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   These regulations were part of the major changes in the basic
Clean Air Act enacted in 1990. The second phase of the process,
which is what took effect this year, had been set in stone for a
good six years. For the scores of areas affected directly (and many
others that chose on their own to go for the cleaner fuels), the
new rules require additives, and in Chicago and Milwaukee the
additive is ethanol, which Big Oil hates, and which makes the
Midwest prices look more political than market.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner said to me last week, ``With six years to get ready,
the companies can hardly complain that their tanks were all drained
and that all this hit like some big surprise. We're either talking
some really poor management or some very unfair treatment of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worse. The only outside event coinciding with the wholesale
price declines of the last few weeks is the chorus of calls for an
FTC probe of the industry. And the other coincidence that doesn't
make much sense except to a conspiracy theorist is the remarkable
connection between areas mandated to get the cleaner-burning
gasoline and the worst of the price increases.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Oh My God'' political reaction to higher prices is an
incumbent-endangering phenomenon, Al Gore included. But the
shifting focus on to Big Oil could also shift the political focus
to those public figures who make a bad habit ofng for this racket,
George W. Bush included.
</P>
<P>
   What we know so far is that the market is not working. We know
that Big Oil's profits this year have soared. And we know that
consumers have been savagely gouged. With the FTC's help, we need
to know a lot more.

IF RENO SAYS NO TO A COUNSEL, REAL ISSUES CAN BE TACKLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There are many similarities between what happened to President
Clinton many months ago and what is now happening to Vice President
Al Gore and, on a lesser scale, to Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one big difference: Last week's call for an
independent counsel to probe Gore's fund-raising activities, and
the independent counsel's decision on Hillary Clinton's role in the
firing of the travel office, come in the midst of their election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that Robert Conrad, head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force, is urging Attorney
General Janet Reno to name a special prosecutor to investigate
Gore's 1996 fund-raising efforts is casting a large cloud over the
Gore campaign. Conrad's recommendation, which hinges on a campaign
event at a Buddhist temple four years ago, also puts Reno in a
no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   If she turns down Conrad's request, which she has done with two
other such requests from other Justice Department officials, she
will be accused by the GOP of trying to protect the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno determines there should be an investigation, she would
have to appoint an independent counsel, since the Justice
Department would be seen as having a conflict of interest. Of
course, deciding to appoint an independent counsel could be
devastating to Gore's White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   As history has proved, an independent counsel's investigation
could go on, not for months, but for years _ through election day
and beyond. And the independent counsel could make allegations or
remarks that could influence voters and persuade them not to take a
chance on a candidate with an investigation hanging over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could once again resist the call for an independent counsel
into Gore's fund-raising. Gore has said repeatedly that the
activity at the Buddhist temple was not a fund-raiser. But if she
decides against an independent counsel, she may end up taking more
heat from the Republicans on Capitol Hill than Gore is facing in
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, she is much better off than Gore at this point.
Despite Independent Counsel Robert Ray's strong views that there
was ``substantial evidence'' that she played a role in the firings
of the travel office employees, the fact that he decided not to go
forward with the investigation is a victory for her.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, of course, is not out to do the Clintons any favors; he
appeared from day one to want to do more damage to them than even
former Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Ray, unlike Starr,
said he may try to indict the president after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   If Ray felt he had enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton, he would
have done so. But even though he decided not to go forward, he
still damaged her by suggesting she had done something illegal _ it
was just that there was not enough evidence to convict her.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Clinton's Republican opponent for the US Senate seat in
New York, congressman Rick Lazio, will use Ray's mention of
``substantial evidence'' against her, just as Gore's rival, George
W. Bush, will capitalize on the issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the prospect of an investigation is gone for
Hillary Clinton _ which is more than Gore can say.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the alleged Buddhist Temple fund-raiser
has already resulted in the conviction of a longtime Gore friend,
Maria Hsia. Her conviction, currently on appeal, involved charges
she channeled more than $100,000 in contributions, including money
raised from the temple, to Democratic candidates in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Reno may decide to reject Conrad's call for an independent
counsel. She has rejected such calls in the past _ from FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh; from Charles LaBella, former head of the
campaign task force; from Robert Litt, a former official in the
Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   She had taken the heat on those rejections and is capable of
doing so again _ even though this time the official calling for the
probe, Conrad, is not part of the conservative right, and thus is a
bit more credible than some of Clinton's detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is by now both familiar with, and tired of, the
Buddhist temple controversy. Rather than a call for another
independent counsel, this issue should result in a call for
campaign finance reform that would virtually eliminate the need for
fund-raising and the controversies that attach to it.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno maintains her courage on this issue and rejects Conrad's
call for an independent counsel, Gore will at least have a chance
against the expected GOP onslaught on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And the nation's voters will be able to focus on more important
issues that will help them decide which candidate they want to run
this country for the next four years.

MORRIS CRAFTS COMPLEX TALE OF LOVE WITH `FIONA RANGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MONICA L. WILLIAMS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FIONA RANGE 
By Mary McGarry Morris 
Viking, 432 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary McGarry Morris has already won the literary lottery:
nominations for the National Book Award and PEN/Faulkner fiction
award, a novel made into a motion picture, an Oprah Book Club
selection, and a nod from Time magazine for one of the five best
novels of 1991. With her fourth novel, ``Fiona Range,'' Morris
reaffirms her place as one of the foremost contemporary novelists
of her genre.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Andover author will find themselves in familiar
territory. There are many thematic and schematic similarities in
her works: Set in small New England towns, the novels feature
pariahs as protagonists, people on the fringes of society. These
are suspenseful stories of losers and loners, family secrets and
lies. Fiona Range, like the haunted women in Morris's previous
novels, has a present complicated by her past.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, Fiona awakens, hungover, with a man she
can't remember bringing home. To make matters worse, her bedmate
turns out to be the husband of one of her friends, Krissy Glidden.
Krissy and newborn baby are due home from the hospital that very
morning. Fiona has a habit of winding up in bed with the wrong man,
but this latest night of carelessness may be her biggest faux pas.
Weary of constant disapproval by the provincial townsfolk of
Dearborn, Mass., Fiona has vowed to change her reputation, but
change is difficult and often painful.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, Fiona is the small-town bad girl who can never make good.
A community-college dropout and waitress at the local greasy spoon,
the promiscuous protagonist is gorgeous, fiery, and tough, with a
huge chip on her shoulder. Abandoned by her mother as an infant,
Fiona has been raised by her aunt and uncle, pillars of the
community. But now she has been evicted from her apartment and
banished by her family for her association with her drug-dealing
former boyfriend. Desperate for a familial connection, she reaches
out to the man who is rumored to be her father, Patrick Grady, the
town eccentric who ignores her existence. Grady, a scarred Vietnam
vet with a dangerous nature, lives in a shack on the outskirts of
town. Much to her family's chagrin, the headstrong Fiona is
determined to find out _ through Grady _ just who she is.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss Morris's latest work as a
lightweight romance novel. But Morris has created a dimensioned
heroine with intricate problems. And every character, from Fiona's
querulous co-workers to her sardonic relatives, is fully developed.
Fiona is self-destructive, but always within sympathetic reach.
With depth and assuredness, Morris has crafted a grim and complex
tale of love: What is it? What do you do without out? What would
you do in the name of it?
</P>
<P>
   Full of mystery and suspense, ``Fiona Range'' is Morris's
lightest novel to date, but also her most focused. Readers will
fight the urge to fast-forward to the end as Fiona finds her way _
and as Morris keeps her literary footing.

<P>
   &UR; HUMAN GENOME &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times is devoting 42 columns, almost its entire
Science Times section, to stories, graphics and photos on the human
genome announcement.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ Ledeall: President Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair joined scientists from around the world
Monday in announcing the completion of a working draft of the
instructions to make a human being. Clinton described the mapping
of the human genome as ``the most important, most wondrous map ever
produced by humankind,'' at a White House press conference linked
by satellite to Blair in London. They were responding to the
announcement by scientists that they had unravelled 97 percent of
the human genetic code, and 85 percent of the data had been
assembled in the right sequence. Hailing what it called a landmark
in knowledge, the international public consortium spearheaing the
research, the Human Genome Project said it had ``assembled a
working draft of the human genome _ the genetic blueprint for a
human being.'' (Summary from wires) By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-GENOME-ASSESS (Undated) _ A news analysis: The genome is
long; it is pithy. It is a pigsty, bulging with nongenes and viral
detritus; it is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. In short, the human genome exults in contradictions.

Miranda, 7-2; the decision was written by Chief Justice Rehnquist.
By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-PRIMARY (Washington) _ The Supreme Court declares the
blanket primary unconstitutional. This system, in use in
California, puts all primary candidates on same ballot and allows
any voter to vote for any candidate. The system, put in place by
voter initiative, was used in 1998 and this year. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-HATE-CRIME (Washington) _ The Supreme Court holds 5-4
that New Jersey's hate crime law is unconstitutional because it
gives the power to the judge in each case to determine if a crime
had been motivated by illegal bias. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS (Washington) _ Other court action: The Supreme Court
agrees to hear a case that raises the issue of whether it is legal
to make use of illegally intercepted phone conversations. In this
example, a radio show in Pennsylvania broadcast a conversation some
anonymous person had illegally taped. The court also agrees to hear
again cases involving the mapping of a Carolina congressional
district, student prayer at commencement, traffic arrests.

ANDREW PYPER TAKES MURDER INTO VERY DEEP WATERS, INDEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
LOST GIRLS 
By Andrew Pyper. Delacorte Press. 388 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know what's more seductive about ``Lost Girls,'' author
Andrew Pyper's scabrously witty, darkly musical language or the
psychological pull of his plot. Then again, perhaps the chief
attraction is Pyper's imploding protagonist and narrator,
Bartholomew Crane, a spectacularly and mercilessly misanthropic
defense lawyer. Law school, Crane explains early in the book, ``was
the discovery of religion, albeit a godless one, with its Latin
prayers and shifting, manufactured convictions. Belief the weight
of the air in your lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes so well that his dazzling word work _ reminiscent of
Martin Amis's _ occasionally draws attention to itself and briefly
away from the story. But this is less complaint than compliment:
The solution is to blink away the flashbulb effect and move on,
invariably with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this is a mystery story about the murder of two
high school girls in Murdoch, Ontario, allegedly by a peculiar
English teacher named Thom Tripp. Crane is dispatched from his
Toronto law office for his first effort at a solo defense. In the
far-northern, rain-sodden town, he holes up in a hideous hotel
room, scarfing up cocaine and papering the walls with case notes
and photos of Ashley and Krystal, the dead girls. Crane is
determined to free the freaky teacher, guilty or not, despite the
circumstantial evidence that he lured the girls to nearby Lake St.
Christopher and drowned them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a novel of depth, a fully literary piece of fiction
that, while tremendously entertaining, is not merely an
entertainment. Remarkably, it is Pyper's maiden novel, first
published last spring in his native Canada, where it was, no
surprise at all, a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Pyper makes Crane's hatefulness intoxicating, exploiting it for
a number of overlapping purposes. Among them is wickedly funny
social criticism. A self-styled city slicker, Crane has an urbanely
Canadian distaste for wilderness. Driving up to Murdoch, he
observes that it is a ``place where the ratio of altered to
unaltered space gets shifted dramatically in the latter's favor and
there is little more ahead than an interminable expanse of
humanless.'' He loathes the Murdoch provincials, and his loathing
captures some of Western culture's cheesy TV-induced decline.
``People,'' he notes, ``know the psychologies of serial killers
better than their own these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane's ranting misanthropy yields insights into the larger
world but rarely into himself. But that will change. The case of
the lost girls, and a photo of them he pinched from a grieving
parent, ``their eyes staring back at me,'' begin to haunt Crane. So
does the murky decades-old legend of the Lady of the Lake. The
mother of two beautiful girls, she seems to have lived in the
surrounding woods, often surrendering herself to local townsmen
before a mob drove her onto the thin lake ice to watch her drop
through and die. Her spirit is said to lure young girls to a watery
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Crane is a kind of captive of the lake and the murders. The lake
pulls at him like a magnet, drawing him to its tangled shores,
where we discover that his long-dead parents had a cottage, now a
rotting ruin. He befriends the local librarian, a shrewd, sociable
dwarf with the Dickensian name of Pittle, who supplies him with
detailed local lore. The more he hungrily learns, the more fevered
become his drug-induced nightmares. Thus, Pyper engages the deeper
and more engrossing mystery in ``Lost Girls,'' the unraveling state
of Bartholomew Crane, the erosion of the defense lawyer's fortress
of self-defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Why would this cold, clever legal mechanic lose the thrill of
the courtroom kill? Why begin to turn on his diffident, wacko
client Tripp while seeing in him a twisted reflection of himself?
Why break out into the kind of moral sweat he hasn't experienced
since boyhood?
</P>
<P>
   Pyper brilliantly draws Crane toward a confrontation with his
past, a reckoning with long-repressed events that forged a young
man determined ``to wipe his hands clean of himself forever.''
There is nothing melodramatic about the halting, healing
transformation that begins as the novel ends. In the process, aptly
but still somewhat disappointingly, Pyper's prose loses its
ferocious edge. But one of many compensations is a scene of
piercing humanity that faintly, peculiarly echoes the surpassing
tenderness at the end of ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' Crane ministers
to an injured deer he sees on a roadside, cradling the creature's
head in his lap and, while gawkers speed by, comforting it while it
dies. ``Then something lifts from its skin and passes through me
before dispersing into the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a book abounding with spirits _ mostly demonic but a few
redemptive, angelic ones, too _ and more than incidental insight
into human frailty and resourcefulness. It's also compulsively
readable and, more often than not and for all its seriousness of
purpose, downright funny. First novelist Pyper isn't a writer who's
going somewhere _ he's already arrived.

`SWEET AND LOWDOWN' A LOVABLE ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Sweet and Lowdown'' (DVD) _ Sean Penn is
perfectly cast as a jazz guitarist in Woody Allen's finely wrought
comedy. Set in the 1930s, this lovable romance also features fine
performances by Gretchen Mol and Samantha Morton. Criticized as
``light'' Woody Allen, this pleasant movie actually expands the
writer-director's range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' _ ``The King and I'' without the music.
Beautifully directed with rich colors and pageantry, but the story
is outdated and silly. No Rodgers. No Hammerstein. No movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' (DVD) _ Director Mike Leigh does a remarkable
job with the story of librettist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur
Sullivan. It's an amusing behind-the-scenes story of the making of
``The Mikado,'' with the omnipresent British class system making
for a most suitable backstory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' _ Director Barry Levinson continues his
affectionate memoir of growing up in Baltimore during the 1950s,
with mixed results. It's an even-tempered, nostalgic trip _ but the
problem is that Levinson led off the series with his best film,
``Diner.'' The ones that followed just don't match up.

Video Business magazine that the bill is ``unquestionably
unconstitutional and unnecessary.'' Andersen also pointed out
various groups, including Pledge to Parents, already review and

   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ Ledeall: President Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair joined scientists from around the world
Monday in announcing the completion of a working draft of the
instructions to make a human being. Clinton described the mapping
of the human genome as ``the most important, most wondrous map ever
produced by humankind,'' at a White House press conference linked
by satellite to Blair in London. They were responding to the
announcement by scientists that they had unravelled 97 percent of
the human genetic code, and 85 percent of the data had been
assembled in the right sequence. Hailing what it called a landmark
in knowledge, the international public consortium spearheaing the
research, the Human Genome Project said it had ``assembled a
working draft of the human genome _ the genetic blueprint for a
human being.'' (Summary from wires) By Nicholas Wade.

RUSSIAN ROCK BANDS FIND THEIR OWN VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It is midnight and air is at a premium at the popular
Moscow nightspot known as the Chinese Pilot Zhao-Da. Something
resembling trench warfare has broken out between security and the
patrons in the front row, who are being pushed inexorably toward
the tiny stage by the constant flow of more fans into the cramped
cellar venue. Cigarettes and body heat have overwhelmed the lone
air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seems to mind. As they slowly swelter in the stifling
pall, several hundred young Muscovites groove to the band's
ominous, thumping beat. Everyone knows all the words.
</P>
<P>
   The act this night is B-2, probably the world's only rock group
with roots in Moscow, Melbourne, and Minsk. More important, this
band is a prime example of everything that is right about Russian
rock 'n' roll at the moment. They play intelligent, well-crafted
music. They sing in Russian. They perform well live. And they play
out a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven hours before the midnight set at the Chinese Pilot,
B-2 had waited out a severe downpour in a tent on an airfield to
perform in front of 30,000 freezing, soaked Muscovites as part of
Wings, a 12-hour rock marathon featuring 15 groups from around the
former Soviet Union. Out of the hailstorm, into the Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez, it's hot in here,'' Lyova B-2 remarks as he gulps down
bottled water in between songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyova, ty klyovy!'' someone rhymes back. Lyova, you are cool!
</P>
<P>
   Rock lives in Russia. Huge rock festivals, radio stations that
promote local groups, rock performers with the chops and popularity
to overcome the vagaries of the elements, and bands that come from
Kiev, Moldova, and Melbourne for the chance to play here: These are
all part of Russia's new rock revolution. None of it would have
been possible just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   B-2 breaks into ``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' one of its
signature radio hits, a moody techno-grunge anthem to alienation
based on the novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The crowd sings along
with Lyova B-2's fluttering, angst-ridden vocals, then everyone
goes wild as guitarist Shura B-2's slow, booming solo rocks the
club like a small nuclear strike. By rights, we should all be
collapsing from asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seems to mind. Everything is klyovy. Rock 'n' roll. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Uniting and taking over &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just like London in 1964,'' says Max Lyubimov,
drive-time disc jockey on Nashe Radio, a station owned by Russian
uberoligarch Boris Berezovsky that plays only rock bands from
Russia and the other former Soviet republics. ``Suddenly, there are
groups that are taking over the charts, taking over the world. The
Russian-speaking world, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyubimov has a point. The headliners at last month's Maxidrom
festival, Mumy Troll from Russia's Pacific port city of
Vladivostok, and Zemfira, from the Volga region of Bashkortostan,
have the tunes and musical ability to play anywhere. But like the
other 13 bands at the Maxidrom, including two from Ukraine and one
from Moldova, they choose to sing in their native tongue. While
that approach just about rules out the possibility of a Russian
rock invasion of the West, it has filled a void in post-Soviet
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``First there was no place for bands to play out, but then as
clubs begin to appear, people slowly realized they didn't want
covers sung in foreign languages, they wanted original music,''
Lyubimov says. ``This is a natural process. Radio stations like
ours promote new bands. They become popular. It's like a
snowball.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Wings or Maxidrom festivals are any indication, it is an
eclectic snowball. How to explain the connection between Chaif, a
distinctly Russian rock quartet that is the Siberian answer to
Springsteen or Mellencamp, and Zdob si Zdub, a Moldovan quintet
whose members dress like a Bessarabian wedding orchestra and whose
music incorporates elements of Henry Rollins-style rock rap and
Gypsy romance?
</P>
<P>
   Roman Yagupov, Zdob si Zdub's hyperkinetic lead singer, has an
answer to that. The idea is live music, energy, and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Gypsy sings, his throat bleeds,'' Yagupov says during a
rambling conversation during a quieter moment at the Chinese Pilot.
``We just try to play what comes naturally. . . . If I want to sing
about my new sandals, I sing about my new sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Zdob's lyrics are in Moldovan, and therefore are
incomprehensible to many Russians. But the beat is irresistible.
When the band plays at the Pilot, the crowd spills out into the
street. It's hard to believe that this kind of thing nearly died
from lack of interest in the mid-1990s. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rocking in the freer world &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Live rock music peaked in Russia in the late 1980s, as the dying
Soviet police state slowly relinquished its grip on popular
culture. Legendary Soviet-era groups such as Chaif, DDT, Aquarium,
and Voskresenye, once the voice of a generation that equated rock
'n' roll with freedom from the strictures of communism, found
themselves playing to diehard followers in half-full clubs.
</P>
<P>
   They were, in a way, victims of Russian capitalism. Newly
deregulated television and radio stations created a venue for local
music that was quickly filled by simple computer-generated pop,
whose purveyors lip-synched their way through carefully
choreographed ``concerts.'' All a recording artist needed to become
popular was a producer willing to bribe television stations into
playing the new video.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone liked it that way. Mikhail Kozyrev, a rock fanatic
who spent the early 1990s studying the radio business in
California, was shocked when he returned to Russia in 1994. Just
about the only quality music on the air was imported from the West.
Homegrown rock was nowhere to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I felt the horror of what was going on here,'' Kozyrev
said, ``I decided to try to re-create what we had in the 1980s. . .
. My mission is to even the balance between plastic culture and
real culture.''
</P>
<P>
   As program director for Radio Maximum, a Russian-American joint
venture, Kozyrev started giving air time to new local groups. Three
years later, as program director of Nashe Radio he made development
of new music the priority.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nashe Radio that broke B-2's first single, ``Barbara,''
last year, when the group was still in Melbourne, recording its
eponymous album. When B-2 arrived in Russia to tour, they were
amazed to find that ``Barbara'' and ``No One Writes to the
Colonel'' were hits.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyova B-2 and Shura B-2, who formed their band in Minsk,
Belarus, in the late 1980s before immigrating to Australia (and
changing their last names to the group name), are not surprised
that rock has come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``People demand live music,'' Lyova B-2 said in an interview at
Shura B-2's modest Moscow apartment. ``Concert tickets have become
expensive, and people are tired of those pop sounds . . . and rock
music has become commercially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   The band has been helped by promotions _ such as a contest run
by Russian MTV in which a high school won a B-2 concert on the last
day before summer vacation _ and the fact that ``No One Writes to
the Colonel'' is the featured song on the soundtrack to Russia's
big summer gangster hit, ``Brother-2''. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Say you don't want a revolution? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What has changed about Russian rock is that socially conscious
texts are no longer a prerequisite for popularity. The words to
B-2's moody, atmospheric music, which some listeners might find
similar to the Cure, deal with alienation and unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   The theme is even simpler in ``Tu-lu-la,'' the punky power pop
hit sung by 21-year-old Yulya Chicherina, which, translated, goes:
``You left me for that lame redhead / My mama wouldn't let me come
back home / My heart aches and my head is locked up / All I have
left is to sing what the wind blew in: Tu-la-lu-la.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russian rock is no longer about rebellion; it's
just that the scope has changed. Chicherina _ Yulya's surname is
the group's name _ is the definitive garage band. Yulya was
rejected by her neighborhood's youth choir because she couldn't
sing. ``So I just sang and yelled until I could,'' she says. With
no place to play, the group had to open their own club in an
abandoned building in her native city, Yekaterinburg. The scene was
very klyovy, but the group feuded with tax police and sanitary
officials until the makeshift club was closed down.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the band, known simply as Chicherina, learned
how to play live, if a tight, recent acoustic set in Moscow's
Respublika Beefeater club was any indication.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Tu-lu-la'' is best experienced as a video, for anyone who
believes that seeing the singer screaming from the hood of a
speeding car in winter, clad in only a wedding dress and slathered
in bear fat to protect against the subzero chill, is a good thing
for a nation's psychological well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Romanov, the singer-guitarist of Voskresenye, does. He
has seen it go the other way, from 1983 to 1990, when his band was
blacklisted by Soviet censors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is great by comparison,'' he said.

STING IS DELIGHTED TO BE ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they grow older, many pop acts hate to tour. They may still
enjoy making albums, but often treat touring with the same shudder
as a trip to the tax man. British superstar Sting, however, is an
exception. He has been on the road since the fall and still has
another year of shows to promote his latest CD, the Grammy-winning
``Brand New Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's just getting warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the road. I'm surrounded by guys I've worked with for
20 years who are all good at their jobs and give me a lot of
support,'' Sting says in a recent phone interview from Vienne,
France, where he's playing an ``antique Roman theater where I feel
a bit like a gladiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we're like English pirates _ latter-day English
pirates,'' adds Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Sting loves the road because it also provides a break from
fretting about his next musical direction, he admits. After a
career that has moved from his '80s rock years with the Police, to
seven solo albums that have spanned everything from stylish jazz to
leftist protest music to story songs and country honky-tonk, Sting
understandably has a lot of options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm touring for another year largely so I can avoid asking the
question of what is my next move,'' he says with a laugh. ``That's
the hardest question in my life, so touring postpones looking at a
blank page, wondering what to write.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many counterparts, especially U2, Sting does not write on
the road, nor does he have a portable studio with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like being a sportsman,'' he says of his own
approach. ``You play the strokes every day. You don't think too
much, which is another one of its attractions. When I'm making a
record, I have to actually use my brain, which hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Sting listen to much music on the road. Whereas, say,
Adam Clayton of U2 brings out a huge stereo system and a
mountainous stack of CDs to listen to, Sting takes the opposite
tack. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Always analyzing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the road, I spend so many hours of the day playing
music that the last thing I want to do in my downtime is listen to
music. I tend to just want to be quiet and get myself together,''
he says. ``And whatever I hear, I have to analyze it. If I hear
music in the elevator, I'm cursed to have to analyze it, so there's
really no such thing as background music for me. I rarely sit down
and relax to music.''
</P>
<P>
   As for not writing on the road, he says, ``I avoid it unless
some idea occurs to me or some metaphor I think can be worked on.
But I tend to avoid even that, and then hope at the end of the tour
on my downtime that I'll be able to remember what has occurred to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady days for Sting, whose ``Brand New Day'' album
started slowly in the charts, but has since risen to, and stayed,
at Top 20 or Top 30 status virtually worldwide. His Grammy success
was a big help, but so is word-of-mouth among consumers looking for
an adult alternative to the ubiquitous boy bands, angry
hard-rockers, and chest-beating rappers who dominate the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my albums sort of reveal themselves slowly,'' says
Sting. ``And I think that's good for longevity. . . . Long may it
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   While sometimes viewed as the quintessential English worrywart,
Sting surprised many fans with the optimism that runs through
``Brand New Day,'' starting with the title track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very aware of the millennium coming up,'' he says. ``I
was very keen that this record would be optimistic and would be a
positive look at the future, and I think that's largely true. The
record isn't all happy songs _ there are sad songs _ but generally
the trend of the album is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Brand New Day'' image, Sting says, ``It's not the
most original title in the world, I'll give you that. But it does
have a very direct, simple optimism. When I began this record, I
had no intention of dealing with the millennium in any way, but it
just kind of seeped into the work. And then to perform (`Brand New
Day') on top of the Rockefeller Center as the ball dropped on New
Year's Eve, was an amazing scenario. I couldn't have planned a
better scenario for the song.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Concert repertoire &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sting is performing ``about 80 percent'' of the latest album in
concert, along with various solo hits and highlights of his Police
career, including ``Every Breath You Take'' and ``Every Little
Thing She Does Is Magic.'' He remains, however, opposed to a Police
reunion, despite public demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very flattered that people are interested, and obviously
there's a great deal of affection for the band,'' he says. ``I'm
glad the legend is intact and that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the public also wonders when Sting might issue a
boxed set, either from his solo career or combined with Police
material. But don't hold your breath for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a boxed set sounds like I haven't got any new ideas. If
I haven't got any ideas, I don't want to put anything out,'' he
says. ``I'll be quiet. Trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not like Sting has an endless vault of previously
unreleased songs to put on a boxed set. He usually just writes
enough tunes for an album, then hits the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if I write 10 songs, that's it, I'm finished,'' he
says. ``I mean, some writers just keep writing and have 60 to 70
songs on the back burner. Not me. Get me on the road quick.''

   GENE-THERAPY _ The completion of the Human Genome Project should
usher in a whole new revolution in medicine, but it may take a
while for the results to move from the lab to the doctor's office.
CDC genetics experts, and other specialists, say the completion of
the HGP places medical researchers at the starting line, not the
finish line, in the creation of new gene therapies. Said another
way: researchers have created a software program that allows PC
users to tell that they have emails messages in their systems; but
they haven't figured out how to open those emails to see what they
say and mean. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   SALT-SENSITIVITY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Federal health bureaucrats
have long talked about high blood pressure as though salting food
is barely more safe than sprinkling it with chips of lead paint.
Their single-minded harping on sodium is troubling to people who
research high blood pressure without a political agenda. They worry
that people will figure they can eat as many hot fudge sundaes as
they want as long as the peanuts are unsalted. (Lamb, Dayton Daily

   MEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ Apparently mired in third place,
leftist opposition presidential candidate Cuautehmoc Cardenas has
little or no hope of winning the July 2 contest. But some say that
handwriting has been on the wall for some time. Yet, Cardenas has
refused to call oFf his run for the presidency in favor of
combining with the leading opposition candidate Vicente Fox to

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ ``Got any rhubarb?'' Gene
is asking Cal as I pick up my morning cup of decaf and take it to
the empty seat between them. ``I'll trade you lettuce for some

   TRUCKERS-HOURS _ A new federal agency wants to change duty hours
to put truckers on a 24-hourcycle rather than a 16-hour cycle and
to require two-day rest periods. Truckers are up in arms, say ing
it will require more trucks on the roads, driver shortages, lower

Stacey Augmon at No. 9. Neither player made a huge impact and got
released or traded. But the biggest problem: 1985. The Hawks took
Jon Koncak at No. 5 and missed out on the following players: Karl

 &HT;    DAVID DRISKELL: AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTIST, SCHOLAR AND COLLECTOR
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYATTSVILLE, Md. _ The bottle tree stands on an acre nearly as
fruitful as the garden in Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby branches bear pecans and persimmons and apples and pears
and peaches and plums and figs. There are vines of muscadines and
leaves of mints and rows of corn, okra, tomatoes, beans, potatoes,
cucumbers and collards.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this bounty stands the bald redbud tree. Its sawed limbs
hold aged green Coke bottles and blue milk of magnesia vials and
clear bottles once full of purple or orange NeHi soda.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves brought this way of revering the spirits of ancestors
from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   David Driskell, African-American artist, historian and
collector, cultivates his roots in this garden.
</P>
<P>
   He grows the sorts of victuals that have sustained him since his
boyhood as the son of a preacher and sharecropper in the North
Carolina mountains. He created the bottle tree to honor his parents
and harken to his African heritage. Over half a century ago, his
father buried these glass containers beneath a hickory tree on
their family farm. The son dug them up and displays them at his own
home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Driskell himself, the down-home shrine sparkles with
artistry and soul and history and a touch of humor.
</P>
<P>
   When people walk by at dusk and ask about the bottle tree, a
smiling Driskell says, he tells them it's a ``spirit catcher'' and
watches them scurry down the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The gently teasing gardener is an imposing figure on the
American art scene.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's High Museum of Art is currently showing 100 works
usually displayed in his three-story yellow Victorian house just
beyond the goldfish pool and rose bushes. ``Narratives of
African-American Art and Identity: The David C. Driskell
Collection'' features the work of 60 artists and will be on exhibit
until Sept. 24. The traveling exhibition contains less than a
fourth of Driskell's collection, among the nation's most extensive
private assemblages of African American art.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is different in that the collector shares deep
personal ties with many of the African-American artists whose works
are displayed. For nearly five decades, he has accumulated artworks
through exchanges as well as purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener is an artist, scholar and curator as well as a
collector. In 1998, Driskell retired as chairman of the arts
department at the University of Maryland, culminating 43 years of
college teaching. His academic writings and catalogues are
landmarks in the study of African-American art.
</P>
<P>
   As an art historian, ``David's work was really important,'' said
Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New
York University. ``He really was pioneering and ground breaking in
this entire field.''
</P>
<P>
   As a curator, he has counseled Bill and Camille Cosby on their
private collection for 23 years. He arranged works by African
American artists in the Huxtables' house on TV's ``The Cosby
Show.'' He advised the White House on purchases of paintings by
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His two-story studio, with African masks on the walls and his
mother's rocking chair near his easel, is located behind his
Victorian house. His paintings are displayed in galleries in New
York and California and hang in a number of museum collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is a Renaissance man,'' Howard University arts professor
Starmanda Bullock told the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself first and foremost as an artist,'' said
Driskell. ``Most people think of the writings I've done and they
say 'art historian.' Well, yes, that's fine. I did that more or
less out of necessity. There wasn't the forum for African-American
artists' work out there when I came along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think the larger element of my contribution has
come through teaching,'' he continued. ``And thirdly, perhaps as an
art historian _ a curator who has been helping to redefine the
field of American art.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   He was born 69 years ago in Eatonton, a rural community on the
Georgia Piedmont. When he was 5, his family moved near Forest City
in western North Carolina, close to his mother's relatives. He
lived much of his childhood in a sharecropper's shack where
newspapers sealed the cracks in the walls. He occupied a pampered
family position, however, as the youngest of four children and the
only boy.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a farmer, a Baptist preacher and a creative
craftsman. His bank was a homemade pine chest, lined inside and out
with tin, that is now displayed with the other African-American
artwork in his son's home. His mother wove baskets from reeds and
pine needles. His own talents were recognized early by teachers who
encouraged his drawing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, his father bought a 13-acre farm, Driskell recalls, and
built a house ``from rocks and boulders that he lugged up from the
creek.'' His son was similarly determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a four-room high school up in the mountains. The
teachers emphasized that the way out of this was to go to
college,'' he said. ``Nobody told me the particulars, so I just got
on a train and went to college.''
</P>
<P>
   With money earned in cotton fields, he headed to Howard
University in Washington, D.C., an educational mecca for ambitious
black students in those segregated times. He came to campus with
his high school report card and promptly learned that the
application process was somewhat more formal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proceeded to sit in on class without their permission and
wrote home and told everybody that 'I'm in college.' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted the following semester. He studied art and
history and began his collection. He met Thelma DeLoach, a
secretarial student, and they were married in 1952. They would have
two daughters, Daviryne and Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he graduated and got a job teaching art at Talladega
College in Alabama. Several years later, he returned to Washington
to teach at Howard and earn a graduate degree at Catholic
University. From 1966 to 1977, he was chairman of the art
department at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., where he
authored several influential catalogues on African American art.
</P>
<P>
   From Fisk, he moved to the University of Maryland, where he
headed the art department until his retirement nearly two years
ago. Since then, he has traveled with his exhibit and painted.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Sitting amid his art treasures, Driskell spins colorful stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the joyous parts'' of collecting for the Cosbys, he
said, ``is being able to go to auctions knowing that I didn't
necessarily have a limit on what I could spend and knowing that
other people did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would act like it was my money and just enjoy it. I just
kept my paddle up,'' he chuckled. ``If (the Cosbys) wanted
something, they said 'get it.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But he knows an artistic bargain when he sees one. ``That's a
Matisse,'' he noted, pointing to an original linocut on one wall.
``I paid $2.98 for it at a flea market in Alexandria.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, he reflected on evolutions in American art in
the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen many, many changes in regard to first of all, the
inclusion of African American art in what might be referred to as
mainstream tradition,'' he said. ``Certainly, now it is
inconclusive to talk about American art without including the
contributions of African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes can be seen in museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked through the three floors of the High Museum, I
saw something that I had not seen before,'' he said. ``There were a
large number of works by African American artists, but they were
integrated into the whole of the collection. They were not set
aside in a room like you find in most museums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, to see this at a Southern museum was very
heartwarming,'' he said. ``That's what I've been teaching and
preaching all these 45 years. It's American art.''

&HT;     NEW CHALLENGE LURES SCHOOL CHIEF FROM SEAT OF NATIONAL POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the worst high school in a deeply troubled
district.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a neighborhood where taxi drivers refuse to go,
Ballou Senior High saw eight of its students murdered in one school
year.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the sprawling school, District of Columbia school
chief Arlene Ackerman had an idea that surprised many: Get
President Clinton to visit Ballou. In January, the president did
just that. Ballou students had the polish and politeness of prep
schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who is leaving her post as the District's
superintendent to take over the San Francisco school system on Aug.
1, is motivated by inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In everything I do and see, I ask whether it's equitable for
all children,'' Ackerman said. ``My job is not about making adults
happy. I have little patience for adult issues that get in the way
of children.''
</P>
<P>
   After observing Ackerman in her daily routine last week, and
after interviews with her and with parents, teachers and community
activists who have worked with her since her arrival at the
district in late 1997, this much is clear: The flurry of changes
large and small made by this superintendent suggest change is
coming to San Francisco schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ackerman's toughest critics, who say she did not do enough
to enhance educational opportunities for students, acknowledge she
has done more than any superintendent in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has put many good things in place but it remains to be
seen whether most will work out,'' said Mary Levy, a lawyer with
the advocacy group Parents United. ``Managerially, the system is
only slightly better than when she took over. But that's not her
specialty. What has happened is the steady decline in student test
scores has not only stopped, but scores are up for the third year
in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's programs, aimed at improving student performance,
included establishing large-scale Saturday and summer school
programs that focus on math and reading; creating a
performance-based system to reward, sanction or dismiss teachers
and principals; giving individual schools control over their
budgets; and creating a funding formula to ensure a more equitable
distribution of money based on enrollment and student needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, 53, also examined spending practices with a magnifying
glass, school by school, employee by employee. ``There were
hundreds of people who were employed but weren't working,'' said
Ackerman who, with her staff, pressed the District's 146 school
principals to ferret out unproductive workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained respect because I was so willing to be involved at
very detailed levels,'' Ackerman said. ``I wanted to know, down to
the last penny, how money is being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to do the same analysis of the San Francisco Unified
School District, which has been shaken by reports of fiscal
mismanagement and lack of oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very involved in that in my first six months in San
Francisco,'' Ackerman said. ``I'll bring some of my own people and
I'll solicit help from the business community. I want the community
to see and know where the money is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's deputy superintendent in Washington, Elois Brooks,
said, ``People think Arlene is all nice and that I'm the tough one,
but she's as tough as nails. She has very little patience for
incompetent people. And she doesn't tolerate people who are
disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is considering joining Ackerman in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who will be the first woman and first black to
permanently lead California's fifth largest school district, is at
once compassionate and no-nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   She is disinterested in politics but adept at brokering deals
and making allies. She greets employees by first name and asks
about family members. She has fired more than 600 central office
and other employees in Washington's schools. To relax, she listens
to Motown or jazz, reads murder mysteries or shops at Neiman
Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an insatiable sweet tooth, she has the discipline to
limit herself to one chocolate chip cookie a day.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David Ackerman, an elementary school principal, has
moved with her from Seattle, where she was chief academic officer
in the public schools, to Washington. And he will move again to San
Francisco, although he will look for a job outside the district,
saying of his wife, ``She can only be my boss at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman is a workaholic with a perfectionist streak. Wherever
she goes, business-as-usual ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where the challenge is,'' Ackerman said over dinner at
the Willard Hotel, a Washington institution that is a stone's throw
from the White House. ``When I came here, everything was in a
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of District students read well below
grade level. Chronic maintenance problems and fire safety issues
routinely delayed the first day of classes. Because of bitter
political infighting and convoluted layers of oversight of the
school district, three superintendents were hired, fired or
resigned in the five years prior to Ackerman's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Washington, Ackerman had worked in Seattle as a
top administrator and in St. Louis as a teacher and principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In D.C., politics is everything and everyone wanted a stake in
running the school system,'' said Maudine Cooper, who headed an
emergency board of trustees appointed by a federal control board,
named in part to save the nation's capital from bankruptcy, to
oversee the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, now president of the Greater Washington Urban League,
added, ``Arlene wasn't perfect. She wasn't always right. But, for
Arlene, it wasn't, `Is this in the best interest of the mayor? Of
the teachers? Of the Board of Education?' It was always, `Is this
in the best interest of children?''
</P>
<P>
   Although San Francisco Unified, with 64,000 students and a $550
million annual budget, is dogged by fiscal woes, having a hard time
keeping track of such basics as cash flow, the 70,000-student
District of Columbia school system, with a $650 million annual
budget, is in another league both academically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like this school district to prepare you for
anything,'' Cooper said. ``Arlene is coming out of the toughest
superintendent's job in the nation. San Francisco is going to
benefit from her work here.''

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ackerman's knowledge of reforming a large and troubled
district will serve her well in on the West Coast. She also will
take with her contacts in the Congress, White House and U.S.
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the power or politics that attracted Ackerman to
the nation's capital. In fact, the bitter politics surrounding the
District of Columbia schools is what drove her to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place that's alluring, that's about power and
influence,'' she said of the nation's capital, sitting in the back
seat of a Lincoln Town Car driven by a former bus driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet people that others only see on TV,'' she said. ``Some
people say they will hold onto their job at any cost. They want to
hold onto the influence and the power. When you do that, you lose
your integrity. I've been clear about my mission. No matter what
anyone says, my integrity was never in question. I stayed focused
on children.''

GORE TO PUSH PLAN TO CUT RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to capitalize on voter anger over the high
price of gasoline, Vice President Al Gore will announce a
multibillion-dollar plan this week to reduce the nation's
dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, according to campaign officials, is made up of a
series of financial incentives to induce industry to produce more
fuel-efficient cars and to persuade consumers to drive them. There
are also tax credits and grants to encourage power plants to
convert to newer technologies, as well as for consumers to convert
their homes to solar power.
</P>
<P>
   Cities would be eligible for bonds and grants to develop
light-rail transportation systems and to buy less-polluting buses.
Entrepreneurs would get incentives to develop cleaner-burning, more
fuel-efficient technology. Gore is also hoping to see people buy
and drive hybrid cars that run on gasoline, electricity, and diesel
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials declined to say how much his plan would cost
to implement, but described the amount as ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely need a short-term solution on gas prices,'' said
Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary. ``But we have to put
ourselves on a path to a long-term solution in a way that will keep
the environment clean and produce reliable energy sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign dismissed Gore's initiative, which will be
rolled out Tuesday in Philadelphia, as warmed-over ideas from past
budgets that have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years of weak leadership, Al Gore is proposing
nothing new,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Texas Governor
George W. Bush. Bartlett also accused Gore of supporting higher gas
prices, citing a tie-breaking vote in 1993 for a 4.3 cents-a-gallon
increase for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, however, noted that Houston is the smoggiest city in the
United States and that Bush, a former oil executive, supports tax
breaks for the oil industry and has taken in $1.5 million from the
oil industry for his campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has fought the oil companies and the polluters,'' said
Lehane. ``I think it's pretty clear who's on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore and Bush have been angling for position
when it comes to oil. Each candidate has called for an
investigation of the oil companies by the Federal Trade Commission
to look for evidence of collusion. Also, each one has tried to pin
blame on the other for the high cost of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is particularly sensitive in the campaign because
oil prices have rocketed in key battleground states such as
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In some places, gas prices are
more than $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican,
proposed that Congress suspend the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal
gasoline tax for the summer.

   &UR; HUMAN GENOME &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times is devoting 42 columns, almost its entire
Science Times section, to stories, graphics and photos on the human
genome announcement.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ Ledeall: President Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair joined scientists from around the world
Monday in announcing the completion of a working draft of the
instructions to make a human being. Clinton described the mapping
of the human genome as ``the most important, most wondrous map ever
produced by humankind,'' at a White House press conference linked
by satellite to Blair in London. They were responding to the
announcement by scientists that they had unravelled 97 percent of
the human genetic code, and 85 percent of the data had been
assembled in the right sequence. Hailing what it called a landmark
in knowledge, the international public consortium spearheaing the
research, the Human Genome Project said it had ``assembled a
working draft of the human genome _ the genetic blueprint for a
human being.'' (Summary from wires) By Nicholas Wade.

detritus; it is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. In short, the human genome exults in contradictions.

Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-HATE-CRIME (Washington) _ The Supreme Court holds 5-4

had been motivated by illegal bias. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS (Washington) _ Other court action: The Supreme Court
agrees to hear a case that raises the issue of whether it is legal
to make use of illegally intercepted phone conversations. In this
example, a radio show in Pennsylvania broadcast a conversation some
anonymous person had illegally taped. The court also agrees to hear
again cases involving the mapping of a Carolina congressional

   SEX SELLS
</P>
<P>
   GUINEVERE TURNER (co-screenwriter, actress, ``American
Psycho''): People want to see R movies, adults and children alike,
and an easy way to get an R rating is to have sex scenes or nudity.
We'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think teen-agers wanted to
see sex. And in creating the taboo, we create frenzy around it.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PAPSIDERA (casting director): There were two distinct
moments that I remember when I sat in a crowded movie theater that
was just buzzing with anticipation. One was ``The Full Monty'' and
the other was ``Basic Instinct,'' which Paul Verhoeven did before
``Showgirls.'' And it felt like the audience was there because they
thought, Oooh, isn't this taboo? It was as if somebody suddenly
said it's OK for you to go see nudity in a film.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL CRISTOFER (director, ``Gia,'' screenwriter): In ``Basic
Instinct,'' the nudity helped tell us who that character was _ a
woman who used her sexuality to manipulate. If it had not been that
interesting a character and a story, Sharon Stone could have walked
around naked for an hour and 48 minutes and it would not have made
her a star.
</P>
<P>
   MARC NORMAN (co-screenwriter, ``Shakespeare in Love''): When I
think of ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic Instinct,'' the distinction is
in the excellence of the film. ``Showgirls'' was a turkey, and the
nudity meant nothing to the box office. ``Basic Instinct'' was a
crackling good story, and on top of that, everybody heard you could
see Sharon Stone's ya-ya. In ``Shakespeare in Love,'' there's a
tease when Shakespeare is unwrapping the binding over Gwyneth
Paltrow's chest, and she's about to be naked, then later on you do
see her breasts. We could have optically enlarged the shot so that
her breasts were out of the frame. There was some discussion that
without the nudity it would get a PG, so people could bring younger
children, but it never came to a vote. We didn't feel it was worth
second-guessing the creative decision for the marketing decision.
And the film ended up making $100 million in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: Look at what just happened with Jessica Biel. She was
in ``Ulee's Gold,'' and she was fabulous, but, you know, very few
people saw that film, and ``Seventh Heaven,'' her TV show, is so
sweet and syrupy, she really passed under the radar for a lot of
years. So she did the cover of Gear magazine semi-naked. It was an
attention-getting moment, and it catapulted her career.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN RIGBERG (manager, Rigberg, Roberts &AMP; Rugolo): What's so
interesting is when you wander around the agencies and sets in
Hollywood right now, there's this special magazine insert called
the Maxim 100, which is pictures of scantily clad models and
actresses. And I swear to God, it's being used in Hollywood to help
cast movies.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?
</P>
<P>
   MARK GILL (president, Miramax Los Angeles): If you're writing
``Shakespeare in Love'' or ``Good Will Hunting,'' you are trying to
reach an audience that is judgmental about emotional delivery and
character development. With a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, even though
the girls in the test audience scream when he takes his shirt off,
you try not to have them be too sexy for a PG-13, because you won't
get the 8- to 12-year-olds. By contrast, Miramax has a spoof of the
``Scream'' movies called ``Scary Movie'' coming out this summer.
There's nudity in it that puts it right up against the edge of
NC-17. And we need to be, because the whole point is to make a lot
of fun of all of those ridiculous ``sexy girl in jeopardy''
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: Any studio with any brains knows that movies that
come on strong with nudity, like ``Showgirls,'' are threatening to
the young male audience _ which is their primary target. It places
a huge responsibility on their shoulders to know more about sex
than they do.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN CHEN (director, ``Autumn in New York,'' actress): With
``Autumn in New York,'' there was a scene where Winona Ryder was to
appear naked. It would've been her first time. They must have
thought it would be a draw, otherwise they wouldn't have asked her
to sign this agreement. And she had some concerns, but she trusted
that as I'm a female I wouldn't exploit her and would make sure it
was beautiful. The scene was shot through glass in more of an
abstract than a real way. Still, at test screenings, people
voluntarily wrote that they didn't want to see the nudity.
</P>
<P>
   MEN VS. WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   TURNER: The female body always has been used for
entertainment-slash-abuse. I loved how in ``American Psycho'' Mary
put a lot of gratuitous shots of Christian Bale's body, these long,
lingering shower scenes, completely shot the way women are done in
movies. And there were scenes in which he's looking at himself in
the mirror while having sex that had to be cut in order to avoid an
NC-17 rating. I take personal offense with that, since I'm nude in
a three-way with a hooker later in the movie and I get brutally
murdered and that was just fine with the censors.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: It's part of the sexist nature of our business. We
don't expect Al Pacino or Robert De Niro lying across a beach in a
pair of Speedos with a cocktail in his hand trying to be seductive.
But a great actress we do expect to lie out as naked as possible,
and the only reason she should be in a movie is because we want to
have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   GILL: There was a really fascinating exception to that recently,
the Leelee Sobieski film ``Here on Earth,'' which was all about
Chris Klein running around, bronzed, with his shirt off. It was the
sort of parading that actresses are expected to do routinely.
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: That seems to be an emerging trend in teen films. In
``Varsity Blues,'' Scott Caan was naked except for a cowboy hat and
boots, whereas one of the female stars, Ali Larter, wore a
less-revealing bikini made out of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: That's kind of refreshing, even if it means making
male nudity humorous and humiliating. And then there are actors
like Ewan McGregor where there's hardly a movie where he doesn't
show everything.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GET NAKED (OR NOT)
</P>
<P>
   RIGBERG: In representing actresses, you always have to ask,
``Will you do nudity or are you totally against it?'' and the
answer always seems to be, ``Well, in the right circumstance,'' and
then I'll name a circumstance, and they'll say, ``Well, no, but
maybe for Martin Scorsese.'' You also need to discuss the
difference between sexual conduct and nudity, because some
actresses won't do a sex scene, but they'll be topless. Even so,
when the director who you've been worshiping during the whole
making of the movie says: ``I kind of want to do it like this. Do
you mind?'' it puts that performer, especially an unknown, on the
spot. That's when you get the call _ ``Do I have to? Do I have
to?''
</P>
<P>
   BILL VELORIC (agent, Stone Manners Talent Agency): I've run into
a number of things that were presented as the right situation and
totally became the wrong situation. I just advised someone who
wasn't willing to do anything other than upper-frontal nudity not
to agree to nudity. Consequently, her part got whittled down, and
one of the most valuable scenes in the movie was given to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   RIGBERG: On the other hand, nudity can put an actress back on
the map. I represent Tatum O'Neal, and I recently sent her a script
based on Linda Lovelace. But would the mother of an 14-year-old, a
12-year-old and a 9-year-old play this porn star where she would
have to be nude in it? At first she called me up and said, ``Are
you out of your mind?'' And after, she read it and took it
seriously and she said, ``Well, I could never let my kids see this,
but I'm into it.''
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: There is the desire of actresses of a certain age,
meaning over the age of 30, not to be perceived as the mother
character. They want to be perceived as young and sexy. In the
remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' Rene Russo did a nude scene,
and it was good for her in that regard.

&HT;     PROFESSOR CORNERS THE SCIENCE OF HOOLIGANISM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Lewis should be finished by now. That's
Jerry M. Lewis, professor of sociology at Kent State University,
not to be confused with the comedian, although the professor has
found himself in some nutty situations.
</P>
<P>
   He studies violent behavior by sports fans, and his material
never gets stale. England and Germany meet in a soccer match in
Belgium; hooligans trash a town square. Lakers win the NBA title;
police cars go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis predicted the flare-up outside the Staples Center in Los
Angeles. He has discovered a formula for crowd combustion, and the
Lakers' win in Game 6 met three of the criteria. If a team takes
its first championship in more than 10 years, if the series goes
longer than a few games, and if the score of the final game is
close, there will be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been doing research on this topic for 25 years. His
database records events back in the early 1960s. Celebratory riots
are not a recent phenomenon. They're not even, in Lewis' view, a
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   When a young man jumped on top of a news van in L.A. last Monday
night, stomped all over the roof, ripped off an antenna and waved
to the mob gathered on the ground, I saw a lunatic _ out of
control, probably under the influence of a six-pack. Lewis saw
academic theory come to life.
</P>
<P>
   He believes celebration riots allow fans to pretend they are
accomplishing something, too. ``The young man on top of the van was
looking for approval,'' Lewis said. ``When the crowd cheered, and
he got approval, he threw up his arms in a victory sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly like an athlete after a huge win. If someone with a
microphone could get close enough to ask what's next for the
rioters, they'd probably say: ``I'm going to Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't dunk like Shaq, and they can't shoot 3-pointers
like Reggie Miller,'' Lewis said. ``So they start a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators are overwhelmingly young, white males, he said.
They tend to be aimless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alienated from major social institutions, like work and
education'' is how Lewis describes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losers'' is the term I prefer.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to agree with Lewis on one point. He calls the riots
``a feat of skill,'' at least in the tiny minds of the hoodlums.
And, I have to admit, there does seem to be some order amid the
chaos. During the early sky-cam footage from L.A., I saw a fire
with a band of people gathered around. The scene looked more
ritualistic than chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rioters aren't crazy,'' Lewis said. ``They're anti-social.''
</P>
<P>
   English soccer hooligans, in particular, operate like organized
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to start fights before matches, rather than
celebrating like vandals. There are Web sites for soccer fans,
advising them to travel to international matches under assumed
names. Lewis has heard of hooligans carrying walkie-talkies so they
can inform each other when an opposing group of fans is showing up.
Some of them have calling cards, identifying them as fans of a
certain club, that they leave behind to taunt their victims.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of premeditation, a lot of squandered energy. It
must seem particularly pointless to Lewis, who witnessed the
National Guard shootings at Kent State during a Vietnam War
protest. He stood 20 yards away from one of the young women who was
killed. Lewis wrote two books on the subject, then turned to the
mayhem provoked by sports.
</P>
<P>
   He is 63 now, and he says he always acts like a coward (read:
rationally) when he encounters hooligans. But he does do
front-line, first-hand research. He remembers a time in Dusseldorf,
Germany, when a fight broke out, and he ducked into a doorway,
where he was soon joined by a British marauder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Would you mind doing an interview?' and he looked
stunned,'' Lewis said. ``Here's someone with an American accent
asking him: Can we talk?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these up-close-and-personals, Lewis can debunk some of
the bad theories about rioting. ``Alcohol,'' he said, ``the old
devil rum made me do it. That's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Booze may remove some inhibitions, but most of the rioters
already have intent to commit mayhem. Lewis has interviewed plenty
of hooligans with unadulterated breath and clear heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to talk to them after they've been arrested, and
their first questions are about the process, how much the fine
is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Lewis has no evidence that media attention prods the
perpetrators. In L.A., a big-screen TV set up outside the Staples
Center was blamed for attracting troublemakers to a common spot.
Lewis believes the rioting would have happened anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that wide screen probably won't return for any more
championship events, and that's a shame. There were plenty of
civilized fans outside the Staples Center, unable to buy tickets,
who deserved a chance to be close to their team on title night.
They'll be shut out further in the future, leaving the arena
exclusively to the swells.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis watched what happened in L.A. and concluded it was a very
mild episode. Celebration riots tend to be intense and brief, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police probably did the right thing by keeping
ticket-holders and players inside the Staples Center and letting
the riot outside cool down on its own. Arrests only create more
tension, and Lewis has found that convictions are hard to come by.
The troublemakers show up in court a few weeks later in pressed
shirts and ties, and juries can't envision them as rampaging
vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Lewis for a solution, a vaccine against fan violence, and he
is stumped. All he can do is keep studying. ``I wish,'' he said,
``that I were putting myself out of business.''

FRED CASSIDY'S WONDERMENT REVEALED OUR FOLKSPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The waiter asked, ``Would you like a bibb lettuce salad?''
</P>
<P>
   My lunch guest, Frederic Cassidy of the Dictionary of American
Regional English (DARE), nodded yes. Then the great lexicographer
looked off into the distance and said, ``I wonder who Bibb was.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed the possibilities. Could it be a person named Bibb
who sold a small, dark green lettuce with especially tender leaves?
Or, not eponymous, the noun could be related to the piece of cloth
tied under a child's chin to catch dripping food, which, when
topped by lace and tucked under the chin of ladies, is enshrined in
the phrase  &UR; best bib and tucker &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Was there some connection to the Latin  &UR; bibere &LR; , ``to drink,''
source of  &UR; imbibe &LR; , ``to absorb fluids,'' which would describe the
use of a baby's  &UR; bib &LR;  _ and  &UR; bibulous &LR; , ``tipsy,'' which might
suggest an alcoholic beverage to wash down a salad? That reminded
us to order a glass of wine, and we went on to fresh speculations.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy's mind was like that, delightedly examining the origins
of words and phrases that most users of the language accept without
thinking. He liked archaisms too: ``Let me know if the next volume
of DARE doesn't reach you next week, and I shall snib the
publisher.'' Was  &UR; snib &LR; , I asked, a variant of  &UR; snub &LR; ? ``Sorry _ a
Chaucerian word slipped out,'' he replied. ``Means `to rebuke
sharply,' I suppose related to  &UR; snub &LR;  in the Scandinavian. Don't
you think a word like that deserves revival?''
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican-born Cassidy, who died last month at 92 while still
hard at work on the final volumes of his great dictionary, never
snibbed anybody. Though an intensely purposeful scholar, he was a
gentle soul whose love of the dialects and colorful metaphors of
the American language was contagious.
</P>
<P>
   I have been an unabashed  &UR; shill &LR;  (slang origin in ``gambler's
decoy,'' now meaning ``pitchman'') for the University of
Wisconsin's DARE for nearly two decades because Fred's organized
wonderment made me a believer.
</P>
<P>
   He was the master of the whatdyacallit question, asked by teams
of interviewers in the farthest reaches of urban and rural America.
This led to an understanding of patterns of usage by region. If
you're hungry for a  &UR; hoagie &LR; , you're probably in Pennsylvania or
New Jersey; all along the Atlantic Coast, you ask for a  &UR; sub &LR; ; if
you're in New England, you demand a  &UR; grinder &LR; , in New York a
 &UR; hero &LR; , in Louisiana a  &UR; po' boy &LR; , and a  &UR; torpedo &LR;  all over.

   The ``national'' answers were  &UR; cut across &LR;  and  &UR; go

 &UR; catty-corner &LR;  and variants  &UR; catty-bias &LR; ,  &UR; catty-cue &LR;  and
 &UR; catty-godlin &LR;  are rooted in the French  &UR; quatre &LR; , part of ``four
corners.'' Americans in the South and West added the suffix
- &UR; wampus &LR; , which led, said Fred, ``to  &UR; catawampus &LR;  and its huge

   When I looked  &UR; slaunchwise &LR;  at him, he looked back at me

we're going to be crooked or diagonal, why not make it

   The spoken voice was more valuable to him than the written
citation. Example: In 1991, as President Bush was about to decide
to end pursuit of Saddam Hussein's forces in Iraq, Gen. Colin
Powell was asked to call Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf to see if he
agreed. An eyewitness, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press
secretary, reported that Powell used the hotline to Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, and told the president, ``Norm says he can handle it.''
Question to the dialect lexicographer: What does  &UR; I can handle it &LR; 
mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Print hides the voice,'' said Cassidy. ``One meaning is `I can
control something that needs control.' A quite different meaning,
indicated by inflection, is `This hurts my pride, dignity, sense of
what I deserve, but I can accept it and not let my feelings
show.''' Or, as has been noted from the dawn of dialectology, it
ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it.

   What next for DARE? Cassidy's baton will be picked up by his

MOOSE HUNTER: JASON ALEXANDER GOES BAD IN `ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jason Alexander in a scene from ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd end up in the movie version of `Rocky and
Bullwinkle,''' Jason Alexander says, flashing a cherubic grin
tinged with mischief. ``When I was a kid, my favorite cartoon was
`Magilla Gorilla.' I always wanted a part in that.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the actor who got famous playing a hapless schlep
on ``Seinfeld'' (1990-1998) is about to hit movie screens as Boris
Badenov, half of the inept team of Boris and Natasha in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' opening nationwide on June
30.
 &HT;    ``I watched several episodes of the series and then looked in
the mirror and thought, `Yeah, that's me,''' Alexander says with a
chuckle. ``They did shave off half my eyebrows, though, and I want
everyone to know I was wearing a fat suit _ I did not gain weight
for this film.''
 &HT;    Based on Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon characters, ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' mixes animation and live
action in a tale that pits the flying squirrel and moose against
Boris, Natasha (Rene Russo) and their boss, the evil Fearless
Leader (Robert De Niro).
 &HT;    It's De Niro's goofiest role by a long shot, but Alexander
nonetheless admits that he was intimidated at the thought of
working with the legendary actor.
 &HT;    ``Actually, De Niro was very nice,'' he recalls, ``but a bit of
an introvert. Rene and I would be kidding around, and he'd just be
kind of quiet. You start thinking, `Is he preparing? Is this part
of his process?'
 &HT;    ``And everybody was calling him `Mr. De Niro,''' Alexander adds.
``I was `Jason' and Rene was `Rene,' but he was `Mr. De Niro.'
Finally we had a scene where they had to move the mark where he was
supposed to stand about two inches. They were all going, `Mr. De
Niro, we've moved your mark about two inches, will that be a
problem, sir?'
 &HT;    ``I finally said, `Look, this guy has gained and lost 5,000
pounds for roles, he's been hit in the face by professional boxers,
just make him move like everybody else!'''
 &HT;    Alexander laughs.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately,'' he says, ``everybody, including Mr. De Niro,
broke up, and that was sort of an icebreaker.''
 &HT;    No icebreaker was required with Russo, who Alexander says
reminded him of his first days with ``Seinfeld'' co-star Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
 &HT;    ``Usually there's a learning curve when you work with somebody
for the first time,'' he says. ``But with Julia, she came in the
door and said, `Let's do it.' It was the same with Rene _ when I
met her, she said, `I think you're really funny, so show me how to
be.'
 &HT;    ``We had a lot of fun, which was fortunate, because we're sort
of joined at the hip during the entire film.''
 &HT;    Alexander has 4- and 8-year-old sons, but he says they didn't
influence his decision to accept ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' In fact,
he doubts they'll even see it.
 &HT;    ``My children are so unimpressed with me that it's pathetic,''
he says. ``I can't get them to watch anything I'm in. They never
saw `Seinfeld,' and they won't even watch `The Hunchback of Notre
Dame,' where I did the gargoyle voice.
 &HT;    ``I think my children hate me,'' he concludes. ``I may go into
therapy about it.''
 &HT;    His own childhood, spent in a middle-class New Jersey suburb,
was no picnic, Alexander says.
 &HT;    ``I wished I could have been invisible,'' he says, suddenly
serious. ``I was very heavy, and I got picked on a lot. I spent my
early school years trying to disappear.
 &HT;    ``Then I discovered a pre-emptive strike _ getting kids to laugh
with me instead of at me,'' he recalls. ``I had dozens of comedy
albums, and I just memorized the material from all these comedians
and tried to do it exactly like they did. I would imitate their
voices, their timing, everything.
 &HT;    ``It seemed to work,'' Alexander says. ``Suddenly I wasn't
getting picked on anymore. But I was not the class clown, and I
never thought of being an actor _ I was just trying to survive.''
 &HT;    By the time he was a teen-ager, however, he had begun singing
and dancing lessons, which paid off when he headed for Broadway. In
1989 he earned a Tony Award for his performance in ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway.''
 &HT;    In fact, he says, if it weren't for Nathan Lane he might still
be on Broadway, since Lane often snagged roles Alexander was after,
and vice versa.
 &HT;    ``I'd see him at an audition and say, `Maybe we should just flip
a coin to decide which one of us should leave,''' the actor
recalls. ``I'd be up to replace him and he'd be up to replace me.
The sad part is that Nathan and I never ended up doing anything
together.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, true stardom awaited Alexander on television,
in the form of the bumbling, self-obsessed George Costanza.
 &HT;    ``I'm always kind of stunned by the love people have for
George,'' he says, shrugging. ``I get letters from people going,
`You know, my friends tell me I'm just like George.'
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `You either need therapy or different friends _ that
is not a compliment.'''
 &HT;    Alexander settles back reflectively.
 &HT;    ``I guess what was charming about George, if that's the right
word, is that he was an everyman who went through an everyman's
problems with the world,'' he muses. ``He reacted with anger and
self-aggrandizement but, to his credit, he also was
self-deprecating. It's why people love Howard Stern _ he's vicious
and inappropriate, but he skewers himself more mercilessly than
anybody else.''
 &HT;    Alexander may be a star, but he's avoided most of the Hollywood
lifestyle, and has been married to Daena Title for 18 years.
 &HT;    ``It's dumb luck,'' Alexander says with a smile. ``But when you
get toward middle age, you hit a bump. Daena and I have had some
problems, and a couple of years ago we went into therapy and worked
on them.
 &HT;    ``It's not easy,'' he concedes. ``It's not fun. But if you have
something valuable, you do it. We came out at a better place than
when we started our relationship. I'm very lucky, because I'm
married to an exceptional woman.''
 &HT;    Raising their children has been made much more complicated by
Alexander's success on ``Seinfeld.''
 &HT;    ``Fortunately and unfortunately, you can't escape the fact of
celebrity,'' he says. ``There are perks and there are problems. For
instance, we want our kids to have a normal life _ but I can't take
them to the supermarket, because I'll get too much attention. So we
have an assistant go to the market and, if they want to go, they go
with the assistant. That's not normal, so it's kind of a vicious
cycle.''
 &HT;    ``Seinfeld'' made its cast members rich, with Alexander,
Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Michael Richards pocketing $600,000 per
episode for the final season. Alexander admits to mixed feelings
about the whole thing.
 &HT;    ``Am I worth almost a million dollars?'' he says. ``I remember
something Jerry Seinfeld said, when they asked him if he really
needed 42 Porsches: He said, `Let's get something straight _ I
don't even need one.'
 &HT;    ``So I don't need a million dollars,'' Alexander concedes. ``But
in the TV marketplace we were running circles around everybody
else, so why not?
 &HT;    ``But the world is bent on its ear in that respect _ nothing I
do is worth what a schoolteacher does.''

`SCARY' TACTICS: SHANNON ELIZABETH REACHES FOR STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Shannon Elizabeth with Regina Hall and
Anna Faris in a scene from ``Scary Movie.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Shannon Elizabeth was a teen-ager pretty much
like most others. One night she was sitting at home alone, glued to
the television, watching the creepy horror film ``He Knows You're
Alone'' (1981).
 &HT;    A light in the back yard suddenly blew out.
 &HT;    ``It scared the crap out of me!'' Elizabeth recalls, whooping at
the memory. ``I couldn't move from the chair until my parents came
home.
 &HT;    ``After that I was always a fan of horror movies,'' she says.
``I just like them.''
 &HT;    Fast-forward a few years. Elizabeth is 23 now, and enjoying some
Hollywood buzz for her role as a sexually uninhibited exchange
student in the surprise hit ``American Pie'' (1999). She's
leveraged that buzz into her own stab at the horror genre _ or,
actually, into a jab at the horror genre, since her current film,
``Scary Movie,'' is a spoof of the likes of ``Scream'' (1996),
which was originally titled ``Scary Movie,'' and ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer'' (1997).
 &HT;    Elizabeth plays Buffy, a blissfully stupid high-school student
who wears impossibly short skirts and just might be the next victim
of a vicious masked murderer with a habit of telephoning his
victims before filleting them with a fishing gaff. Director Keenen
Ivory Wayans overlooks no cliche and gleefully indulges in sick
jokes, gruesome violence, foul language and nudity _ even male
nudity.
 &HT;    Still, the idea of mocking the ``Scream'' movies, which were
themselves self-referential parodies of the horror genre, seems a
tad redundant. But Elizabeth, speaking by telephone from the
Manhattan offices of Dimension Films, doesn't see it that way.
 &HT;    ```Scream' and all of those movies took themselves very
seriously,'' she says. ``When the characters were supposed to be
scared, they were very scared. In `Scary Movie,' when the killer
comes around, we're like, `Ooh, we're so scared.'
 &HT;    ``We're very sarcastic and very spoofy in that sense,'' she
says. ``We didn't take anything seriously. We didn't take each
other seriously.''
 &HT;    Three minutes into a conversation with Elizabeth, it's obvious
that, while her character may be stupid, she herself is one smart
cookie. It's also clear that she takes her career very seriously,
which made playing Buffy all the more a kick for the exotic-looking
actress, the daughter of a Syrian/Lebanese father and a mother
whose mixed descent includes Native American blood.
 &HT;    ``It was so not me in high school,'' says Elizabeth, who was
born in Houston and grew up in Waco, Texas. ``I'm just not a ditzy
person, so I was a little worried that I wasn't quite doing it
right.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to do Buffy justice,'' she explains. ``I couldn't be
too big with it, and I didn't have to be myself, I didn't have to
be serious. I could just go overboard and have fun.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth landed her ``Scary Movie'' role after ``American
Pie,'' the surprisingly clever gross-out comedy in which she turned
heads _ and turned on millions of guys _ with her va-va-voom
portrayal of Nadia, the nubile and willing Czechoslovakian exchange
student.
 &HT;    The film pushed the envelope for pastry eroticism and offended
more than a few viewers, but pleased enough to take in more than
$100 million at the box office. In the process, it steered Mena
Suvari, Chris Klein, Jason Biggs and Elizabeth herself into the
fast lane to stardom.
 &HT;    ``When we were doing it, we loved the script and the directors
and everybody involved with it, but I don't think anybody knew what
it would do in general, much less for each one of us,'' says
Elizabeth, a former model and commercial actress whose previous
experience had been limited to television guest spots and
independent features. ``It was released at the right time. We were
in the right place at the right time.
 &HT;    ``Everything just went right.''
 &HT;    Her new fame doesn't seem to faze the young actress, who lives
in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, Joe Reitman, and seven dogs.
It's fun to be recognized, she says, and to sign autographs and
glam it up at premieres and awards shows.
 &HT;    Still, it has its awkward moments. One time, as she was leaving
a premiere, fans and photographers pounced on her car. On another
occasion, a man showed up on Elizabeth's doorstep, magazine in
hand, requesting an autograph.
 &HT;    ``Just the fact that he found us scared my boyfriend to death,''
Elizabeth says. ``He felt like he wasn't going to be able to
protect me.
 &HT;    ``It can get a little strange,'' she admits. ``But my boyfriend
gets more worried than I do, so I just let him do the worrying.''
 &HT;    Besides, Elizabeth is too busy mapping out the next steps in her
career to waste time worrying. She recently committed to
``Tomcats,'' a comedy with Jerry O'Connell and Jake Busey, in which
she'll play a police officer. Come autumn, she'll be a ubiquitous
presence in magazines as the star of Nautica Jeans' latest ad
campaign.
 &HT;    Actually, the biggest obstacle to her future success might be
the very thing that's gotten her this far.
 &HT;    ``I think I used my sexuality and my looks in `American Pie' to
get people to notice me,'' she says, by no means apologizing. ``And
now it's up to me what I do with that. Now it's up to me to pick
roles that display my talent more than my looks. I want to be a
chameleon.''
 &HT;    As role models, Elizabeth cites the protean Gary Oldman or
Cameron Diaz, a bombshell in her own right who nonetheless was able
to disappear into her role as a mousy housewife in ``Being John
Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``I want to pick some roles that you'd just never expect me to
do,'' the actress says. ``My next role is a police officer, and
I've been working with guns and I've been doing ride-alongs and
handcuffings. It's been a great learning experience, but I like
that it is very different from my other roles.
 &HT;    ``I really want to do the best job I can,'' she says, ``and show
people that there's more behind what they see and what they think I
am.
 &HT;    ``Also, a lot of people see you as a character and think that's
you, that that's just who you are,'' Elizabeth concludes. ``I can
change that by how I show myself in interviews, because that's when
you get to be who you are.
 &HT;    ``But I also want to change that perception of me by the
different characters I play.''

 (Includes a color slide of Natasha Lyonne with Clea DuVall in a
scene from ``But I'm a Cheerleader.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``First of all, it was kind of ridiculous for me to play a
cheerleader, because I'm so pale and so untoned,'' Natasha Lyonne
says. ``I don't even have the required big calves!''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Lyonne stars in the quirky comedy ``But I'm a
Cheerleader,'' opening throughout July nationwide. And, to hear her
tell it over breakfast at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, it
wasn't a pretty sight.
 &HT;    ``I did all my own cheers,'' she says, wincing. ``I thought I
could do those stupid cartwheels, but I'm the most uncoordinated
person in America. And everyone saw this on the rushes. The word
went out _ I heard, `We need reshoots. Immediately! She's a
klutz!'''
 &HT;    Shy, petite and engulfed in a mass of long, blonde curls, the
21-year-old actress shakes her head sadly. After all, part of the
point in making the movie was to play the kind of role her fans
wouldn't expect her to tackle.
 &HT;    ``I took this part because everyone asks me, `Why do you only
choose these wisecracking roles?''' says Lyonne, who caught
Hollywood's eye as Woody Allen's sharp-tongued daughter in
``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996), and copped some more attitude
as a sarcastic teen in ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' (1998). ``The new
movie is anything but that sort of girl.''
 &HT;    That's for sure. ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' casts Lyonne as a
naive, Christian cheerleader from a small town in middle America.
 &HT;    ``But she has Melissa Etheridge posters on her wall, and her
hands keep slipping up the other cheerleaders' skirts when she's
doing lifts,'' the actress says. ``And one day she comes home and
RuPaul is there, plus all her friends and family. They're doing an
intervention on her, because they think she's gay.''
 &HT;    Soon she's shipped off to a rehab camp to cure her suspected
lesbian proclivities.
 &HT;    ``These camps do exist,'' Lyonne says. ``I know it sounds kind
of ridiculous and very strange, but it's true. And, frankly, I
wanted to make the film to expose these places _ I think they're
frightening. At the very least, kids should know what's out
there.''
 &HT;    Kids will probably pay attention, as they have since Lyonne
broke out into mainstream movies with the teen hit ``American Pie''
(1999), which has grossed more than $100 million.
 &HT;    ``What happened with `American Pie' was pretty amazing,'' the
actress says. ``It's strange, because all of a sudden my name is on
the map. I'm supposed to be one of the leaders of young
Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ```Young Hollywood?' Like I'm leading this wild lifestyle?
Please!'' she says. ``Hey, I'm just a homebody who watches movies,
listens to music and reads. Seriously, that's all I do. I don't
even get out much. So it makes me laugh when I hear, `There's hot
buzz on you.'''
 &HT;    The plus side is increased respect within the Hollywood
community.
 &HT;    ``I don't feel so desperate when it comes to getting acting
jobs,'' she admits. ``I'm in a much cooler place in my own head.
Now I'm sent the good scripts _ finally I'm seeing the good
material.
 &HT;    ``It's so hard for any of us who really care about acting to
find good material,'' Lyonne says. ``That's the most frustrating
thing, because here I am _ I actually have some heat, and I feel
there is so little I can actually do with it.
 &HT;    ``I refuse to take my heat and go make some schlocky teen
romantic comedy,'' she adds firmly, ``which is the bulk of the
stuff I get offered. Most of those scripts are trash. And that's
not what I want to do.''
 &HT;    Even if it means walking away from some big paychecks.
 &HT;    ``I do feel the pressure to take the money and run,'' she
concedes. ``But I can't approach a career thinking about my bank
account.''
 &HT;    Hence her continued attraction to independent films,
 &HT;    ``Some of them might never see the light of day,'' she says.
``That's a bummer. But it does show that I have a range _ maybe
somebody will see one of these films and say, `Hey, let's really go
against type and cast her in a period movie.'''
 &HT;    Born and raised in New York, where she still lives, Lyonne was
only 7 when she won a role on ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' in 1986,
playing the curious little girl Opal.
 &HT;    ``It's the work I'm most proud of when I look back,'' the
actress says. ``Even at a young age, I really created a character.
In fact, I was really into acting even as a kid _ I was in Opal
mode all the time, and I would watch the show and critique my own
performances.
 &HT;    ``I still think I'm pretty good on that show.''
 &HT;    Even now, she fumes when she recalls how Paul ``Pee-Wee Herman''
Reubens' career was destroyed after his arrest for indecent
exposure in a Florida gay-movie theater.
 &HT;    ``I still think Paul got a raw deal,'' Lyonne says. ``It's such
BS. It's so ridiculous to think that actors shouldn't have a
private life.''
 &HT;    Lyonne went on to make her movie debut in ``Heartburn'' (1986)
as one of Meryl Streep's nieces, but her career didn't really take
off until Allen cast her in his musical, ``Everyone Says I Love
You.''
 &HT;    ``I spent my time sneaking out in the middle of the night to go
sit on the roof and listen to my Walkman. I was hiding out to smoke
cigarettes,'' she says, laughing. ``I would never smoke cigarettes
on the set, because I thought Woody would think I was a gross
bacteria machine.''
 &HT;    But she adds that Allen taught her a few good lessons.
 &HT;    ``Simple stuff he said kind of sticks with me on every movie,''
Lyonne says. ``He told me, `Just be funny and don't put the
audience to sleep.'''
 &HT;    Apparently it's working, because Lyonne is on some kind of a
roll. She even has fans now: As she leaves the Four Seasons, young
girls come over to ask Lyonne about her boyfriend, actor Edward
Furlong. Bashful boys hang around the outskirts, staring but afraid
to approach her.
 &HT;    Lyonne is sweet with the fans, patiently signing autographs and
smiling for snapshots.
 &HT;    ``Fans are cool,'' she says. ``I can't understand actors who
want to be totally left alone. When I'm out, I'll turn around and
one or two people will be following me.
 &HT;    ``Hey, it's not a mob scene,'' Lyonne says with a laugh. ``But
it's a start.''

 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 9, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television superwomen started in the 1970s, with Lynda Carter as
the seminal Amazon in ``Wonder Woman'' (1976-1979) and Lindsay
Wagner as ``The Bionic Woman'' (1976-1978).
</P>
<P>
   But both had played out the string by 1980, and there the matter
stood until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated television has been a godsend to people who love
women who kick serious butt, however, as foreign and domestic
audiences alike have flocked to the exploits of a new generation of
superwomen.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at six top television wonder women for the new
millennium. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; LUCY LAWLESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Xena on ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' (1995-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: A guest shot as Lysia on an early episode of
``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'' led to a return appearance,
this time as the warrior Xena. And the rest is prehistory.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Lawless played an undercover
cop on a 1994 episode of the action series ``High Tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Overview: The leather-clad, sword-wielding Xena is the yardstick
by which all other female action stars are measured. Her ability to
combine athleticism, heroism and hidden tenderness instantly made
her a fan favorite on ``Hercules,'' and her spinoff show has by now
outlasted its parent and made Lawless an international star.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``People assume that I'm a total Amazon, like I have to
duck to get through doors,'' Lawless told Maxim magazine last year.
``I've never been that physically coordinated or good at sports, so
the last thing I figured I'd become is an action hero. I thought
I'd be doing Shakespeare.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; VICTORIA PRATT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 29.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sarge on ``Cleopatra 2525'' (2000-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: Pratt played hard-nosed Mafia boss Jackie Janczyk
on John Woo's Canadian series ``Once a Thief'' (1997-1998).
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Pratt got primitive in 1998
for a two-part ``Xena'' episode, a role directly responsible for
her being cast in ``Cleopatra 2525.''
</P>
<P>
   Overview: Pratt has been the standout on this new sci-fi
half-hour about three women fighting against aliens to win back the
Earth for the human race. She plays ``Sarge,'' the silent,
large-armed soldier who shoots first and falls in love later.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role that Pratt is physically perfect for, impeccably
sculpted and yet softly beautiful. Fitness fans may recognize the
Canadian actress from her numerous cover appearances and columns
for workout magazines such as Oxygen and MuscleMag.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Sarge is a hard-ass,'' Pratt says. ``She's a bit of a
sex machine, too, but not out-and-out. She's very passionate and
yet low-key. Plus, she won't take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so great to play,'' the actress adds, ``and I'm glad
Sarge is not simply a one-note character. She's tough but, you
know, she's got a vulnerable side.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; PAMELA ANDERSON LEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Vallery Irons on ``V.I.P.'' (1998-present)
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: After a much ballyhooed Playboy spread, Anderson
landed a role as Lisa the Tool Time Girl on ``Home Improvement'' in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Anderson played the title role
in ``Barb Wire'' (1996), an unsuccessful feature based on the
leather-clad comic-book heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Overview: Though her character is admittedly bubble-headed,
Anderson weaves a fine line between toughness and naivete. The fact
that she can be downright hilarious while icing evildoers makes her
that much more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I get to do so many things within this character,'' she
says. ``I like the comedy, the lightheartedness and the action.
It's really my fantasy of what I would like to see on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I a role model?'' Anderson adds. ``Everyone in the public
eye is a role model, but people shouldn't base their lives on what
people do in the public eye.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TIA CARRERE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sydney Fox on ``Relic Hunter'' (1999-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: Carrere was discovered in a grocery store in her
native Hawaii, and landed a role on ``General Hospital'' in 1985.
But it wasn't until ``Wayne's World'' (1992) that she found
widespread acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Carrere has battled evil in
several low-budget films such as ``Zombie Nightmare'' (1986) and
``Road Raiders'' (1989). Hey, a girl's got to eat!
</P>
<P>
   Overview: There are dozens of Web sites devoted to Carrere and
``Relic Hunter,'' though it's no surprise that most of the sites
are little more than exhaustive photo galleries of the exotic
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   As Sydney Fox, a female Indiana Jones, Carrere combines book
smarts with kicks to the solar plexus, adding up to a complex
character who's as strong as she is beautiful. And, unlike a lot of
modern femmes fatale, Fox gets by on her wits and fists instead of
relying on guns and gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Carrere had a handle on her character from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' she recalls, ``I said that she should be
intelligent as well as sexy, as well as kick-ass. A modern,
well-rounded woman.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GENA LEE NOLIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sheena in ``Sheena, Queen of the Jungle'' (debuting
in fall 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout Role: Nolin started her on-camera career as a ``Price
is Right'' model, but won fame as Neely Capshaw for three seasons
of ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Nolin is new to the genre, but
she's buffing up for ``Sheena,'' and should be ready to handle
whatever fiends may come her way.
</P>
<P>
   Overview: It's about time Hollywood brought back one of
pop-culture's most exciting action stars. Sheena is based on a
comic book that, in turn, saw screen time as a short-lived series
in 1954 and as a feature film in 1984, starring Tanya Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Nolin has no trouble filling out her character's skimpy
animal-hyde bikini, and while it's true that Sheena bears a
striking thematic resemblance to Tarzan, it's clear that anything
he can do, she can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``You have to keep a certain figure because millions of
people watch you, so you want to look good,'' Nolin told fans
during an Internet chat. ``But it's hard, because I'm from the
Midwest and love mashed potatoes and steak and that sort of
thing.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CAROL ALT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 39.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Karen Oldham in ``Peter Benchley's Amazon''
(1999-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout Role: The supermodel basically played herself in
``Private Parts'' (1997), the film biography of radio shock-jock
Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Alt co-starred with wrestler
Hulk Hogan in the little-seen action flick ``Thunder in Paradise''
(1994).
</P>
<P>
   Overview: As the bold leader of six plane-crash survivors
stranded in the Amazon jungle, Karen braves warring native tribes,
deadly animals and dangerous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a major departure for Alt, who began her career as a
supermodel. Once accustomed to star pampering, she now works 1,000
miles from the nearest salon _ yet somehow remains radiant under
all that dirt and grime.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I tell the writers that, when you write for my
character, write for a man and change it to a woman's name,'' she
says. ``It's like, `Someone's in trouble, grab the crossbow and
let's go.' Because that's how I am in my house. If something's
broken, you go fix it.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: The 100th anniversary of the birth of Antoine de
Saint-Exupery is fast approaching. This ``separate-buy'' article
can be purchased _ the cost is not prohibitive _ by contacting one
of the New York Times Syndicate sales representatives listed at the
end of the text.) 
 By STACY SCHIFF
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound
together as Antoine de Saint-Exupery and his Little Prince. They
make for an odd couple: the hulking, balding aviator who preferred
stapling to buttoning his shirts; the dapper little
extraterrestrial with the mop of golden curls and what seems an
extensive wardrobe for someone who hails from an asteroid the size
of a house. Where the Little Prince religiously tends his planet,
his creator was a champion procrastinator. (If the wreckage found
off the coast of Marseille this spring, weeks before
Saint-Exupery's centennial on June 29, proves to be that of his
lost World War II airplane, it will be one of the first occasions
on which he has turned up on time.) The Little Prince is a
determined walker; Saint-Exupery _ the toast of every cabdriver in
Paris _ was allergic to exercise. He had no use for nature. Yet the
two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Reviewers of 1943 assumed the novel's
narrator _ the downed pilot who befriends the Little Prince and
elicits the story of his travels _ was Saint-Exupery. This was as
much the publisher's doing as anything else; the oddball volume was
advertised everywhere as ``a story of St. Exupery and the desert.''
Inadvertently the author assisted in the conflation; in its April
26, 1943, issue, Time reported that he had ``last fortnight left
the U.S. for active service against the Axis in Africa.'' Weeks
later, after having bent a few rules, and to his immense
satisfaction, he began flying again with his old reconnaissance
squadron. His publisher celebrated with a press release, one that
ended in a postscript: ``Although he is in the general neighborhood
where the Little Prince appeared to him, he has not seen him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's friends saw a good deal of the Little Prince,
however. The author waved the book around proudly, boyishly, as if
handing over a kind of personal manifesto. He demanded reader's
reports from those who asked to borrow a precious copy. (The volume
was not published in occupied France, where all of Saint-Exupery
had fallen out of print, and was banned in North Africa.) His
letters are punctuated with versions of the flying figure, soon
grounded and disconsolate, as Saint-Exupery was himself to be,
having clumsily damaged an $80,000 airplane in the middle of a war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring of 1944 did he manage to talk his way back
into active service, in a plane into which he did not fit, that he
could not comfortably fly, communicating with the control tower in
a language he did not speak. Over the next months he knew every
kind of near disaster. He experienced engine trouble and landing
difficulties, he fainted in flight, he was pursued by enemy
aircraft, he battled a fire on board. Any one of his 1944 missions
could have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, 1944, he disappeared, under circumstances upon which
has swelled a great grassy knoll of literature. In much the same
fashion as the Little Prince, Saint-Exupery vanished into thin air.
This was enough to assure his legend. (Insofar as he died for his
country, his was also a death that extended the French copyrights
in his work for an additional 30 years.) ``The Little Prince'' read
differently in France in 1945, where it was published after the
liberation, than it had in America in 1943; to the French reader it
amounted to an eerie chronicle of a death foretold. The mystery
surrounding the disappearance has only enhanced the myth. From the
Titanic to the Loch Ness monster, we cannot resist the appeal of
the large object that slips suddenly from view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinching the equation of author and character, beckoning to the
mystic interpreters, is the curious matter of the sunsets.
Saint-Exupery met his end weeks after his 44th birthday. The Little
Prince lives on a planet so small that he is able to watch the sun
set 44 times a day. Case closed for the suicide contingent. There
is only one small problem. The Little Prince indeed witnesses 44
sunsets in the Katherine Woods rendering, as it seems he will
continue to do in Richard Howard's sparkling new translation of the
novel, published this month. But in French the sun fades from the
Little Prince's view as it always has: 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   Books have lives _ ``The Little Prince'' has had at least two,
and on the occasion this week of Saint-Exupery's centenary is about
to enjoy another _ and they have legacies. As J.M. Barrie's massive
oeuvre has been eclipsed by the shadow of Peter Pan, so has
Saint-Exupery dissolved largely into the author of a children's
classic. The volume has been as kind to his royalty account as it
has been detrimental to his reputation; the successful children's
book writer is one of those thankless half-breeds, like the
academic celebrity, the child star.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's fall from literary grace begins with ``The
Little Prince'' in his native country, where he is the Norman
Rockwell of letters. His offenses are legion. As one French
apologist has it: ``He manages to eschew Cartesian thinking, to
sidestep the subtlety of our rhetoricians, to rise above our
Talmudic taste for criticism _ in short, to escape all of our
national vices.'' Most maddeningly, Saint-Exupery refuses to
subscribe to schools; he slips through nets. This was, after all, a
writer who won both the Academie Francaise's fiction prize and the
American Booksellers Association's nonfiction prize for ``Wind,
Sand and Stars,'' who got himself condemned as a Vichyite and
banned for singing the praises of a Jew all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is perfect,'' sighs the Little Prince's fox, trading
on his creator's wisdom. Even on a good day the road to immortality
has been as convoluted for Saint-Exupery as was the mortal one. In
1992 the Banque de France resolved to feature an aviator on one of
its new bills. A poll was conducted; France's most celebrated flier
was determined to be Jean Mermoz. Mermoz was a stellar and
unflappable pilot, a better pilot than Saint-Exupery, but he also
happened to have a few unfortunate ideas about fascism. Under a
Socialist administration he hardly qualified as banknote material.
Saint-Exupery profited from his disaster and today graces the
50-franc note by default. Which did not guarantee that his name
would be spelled correctly on the original issue of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each generation embraces its favorite flier, so have we
had several Saint-Exuperys. This is not surprising; for years the
French biography of record was Pierre Chevrier's 1949 ``Antoine de
Saint-Exupery,'' a volume beside which Edmund Morris' ``Dutch''
looks slavishly literal. Pierre Chevrier was none other than Nelly
de Voge, Saint-Exupery's longtime mistress. Dashing into a phone
booth, she emerges as ``un ami'' whenever she needs to enter her
text. Needless to say, Saint-Exupery's wife, Consuelo, is mentioned
only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Posthumously, Mme. de Saint-Exupery is enjoying her revenge.
Reworked by a critic, her memoirs _ bearing the seductive belly
band ``Le Manuscrit Retrouve de la Femme de Saint-Exupery'' _ have
become a best seller in France. (They were not so much recovered as
finally released by her executor, who _ appropriately for the woman
who advertised herself as the model for the Little Prince's
melodramatic rose _ happened also to be her gardener.)
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo's pages ``topple the statue of our hero, supplying
damning evidence for the prosecution,'' trumpeted L'Express,
although the ``memoir'' reveals very little that is new. A portrait
of marital bliss was not to be expected from the party whom
Saint-Exupery crisply informed, ``If you're not here I can't think,
and if you talk I can't write.'' Two additional volumes devoted to
Consuelo join her own in Parisian bookstores this month. Both take
as their basis the idea that ``The Little Prince'' is the story of
a man's struggle with his marriage, which it is, every bit as much
as it is a volume that read backward reveals that the Lindbergh
baby was acting alone in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the other shoes drop slowly. Now we have Consuelo,
but sometime down the road we will have another piece of the story,
the intoxicating love letters Saint-Exupery wrote Nelly de Voge.
(``They will not be published until after you are dead,'' she
informed this biographer, 45 years her junior.) Additional
documents will reframe that publication; the man who expounded so
eloquently on duty was perfectly capable of confessing his love to
two different women on the same afternoon. All the same, a
consistent image emerges. ``Pierre Chevrier'' tells of
Saint-Exupery having forced Benzedrine down her throat so that she
might read his new pages with unflagging attention. What should our
hero do in the course of his first evening with Consuelo but ply
her with sedatives? Small wonder the man has not often been allowed
to venture out with a biographer unchaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Saint-Exupery's heirs have sought to protect him from
the indignity of a barnacle-encrusted P-38 rising from the ocean.
Can the myth survive the solution to the riddle of Saint-Exupery's
death? What happens when his fate and the Little Prince's no longer
coincide? Does the book lose its allure, in all the 95 languages in
which it is published? Once again we are on the verge of answering
those questions.
</P>
<P>
   The identity bracelet fished from an inlet off Marseille in 1998
appears to be authentic; the airplane parts currently under
investigation turned up only a mile away. Saint-Exupery may not
slip through the net this time. All the same, the question of how
he went down may never be solved; it is highly improbable that he
was shot from the sky. It seems that the essential will remain
invisible to the eye, and Saint-Exupery will remain as maddeningly,
irresistibly elusive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For his part the blue-booted Little Prince has never stood so
solidly on this planet. The dolls are in stores already.

PERSONAL HEALTH: TRICKS FOR RIDING OUT THE WAVES OF MOTION
SICKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've known since childhood that I was susceptible to motion
sickness. I never could read in the back seat of a car, and in my
early 20s I got queasy as a passenger riding down a winding
mountain road (though I was fine if I drove). But I hadn't
experienced the full-blown syndrome until I took my sons on a
fishing boat in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   We left at noon and I hadn't had time for lunch. As the boat
rocked over the waves, I tried fishing from the side. As if that
were not enough to flip my insides out, I had to go below deck to
use the facilities. Upon returning to my rod, I fed the fish the
remains of my breakfast. I spent the rest of the expedition lying
flat on the top deck.
</P>
<P>
   It is small compensation to anyone feeling motion sick to know
they are hardly alone. Up to 90 percent of the population is
susceptible, given adequate stimulus. Lawrence of Arabia got sick
bouncing about on his camel, and Charles Darwin's discovery of
natural selection is said to have resulted in part because he was
so seasick he had to get off the boat onto those islands. I've
encountered any number of people who refuse to travel anywhere by
boat because they once became seasick and can't bear the thought
that it may happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Motion sickness is the result of a conflict between messages
delivered to the brain, with one signal coming from the inner ear
that controls balance and a disparate signal coming from the eyes
and pressure receptors of the skin and joints. The conflicting
messages are delivered to the nausea center of the brain. This is
why reading in a moving vehicle is such a common precipitant of
motion sickness; eyes are focused on a page while the body is being
bounced and turned on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Though infants are spared, children between the ages of 2 and 12
are often susceptible, but tend to do better as they get older.
Dogs, too, are often affected, especially as puppies. Even fish can
get seasick. Adults over 50 are least likely to become motion sick.
I love traveling with a 61-year-old friend who can read guide books
and road maps while I drive.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics plays a role in susceptibility. In a study of various
ethnic groups by Dr. Robert Stern and Dr. Kenneth Koch at
Pennsylvania State University's Hershey Medical Center,
Asian-American children topped the charts; 100 percent of them
became nauseated when a rotating drum created the illusion of
motion, and many requested an early end to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics notwithstanding, there are any number of nonmedical
measures you can take to reduce your susceptibility to motion
sickness. First and foremost, take a tip from pregnant women with
morning sickness and eat something before traveling. A light,
starchy meal beforehand with periodic snacks on route of something
like bread or crackers is best for sustaining a normal blood sugar.
Starting the night before travel, avoid eating a heavy meal or one
high in fat and refrain from carbonated beverages, alcohol and
spicy foods. While traveling, avoid tobacco smoke and pungent food
smells.
</P>
<P>
   Locate yourself where there is the least motion. If at all
possible, ride in the front seat of the car and look straight
ahead. Or, better yet, drive yourself. The message entering through
your eyes and pressure receptors will better match the one from the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   On a plane, select a window seat over the wing. On a ship,
select a cabin in the center of the boat but spend as much time as
possible in a well-ventilated area. Sit on the deck facing forward
and watch the horizon. Try to avoid going below deck, where
everything looks static.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, lie down and close your eyes. Whatever you
do, avoid watching the waves or fast-moving scenery.
</P>
<P>
   While some of us can read with comfort in a moving vehicle (for
example, I can usually read without problems while riding in the
front seat on a smooth, straight highway without stop-and-go
traffic), those most prone to motion sickness should refrain from
reading. Listen to music, look straight ahead or sleep when you're
not driving.
</P>
<P>
   Both ancient and modern medicine can offer effective assistance
if the above measures are not enough to forestall motion sickness.
Ginger, long recognized as a gastrointestinal calmative, has been
shown in controlled studies to be very helpful, even for carsick
dogs and children. It has helped my dog, a neighbor's dog and my
sons and I found it helpful on rocky seas in the Galapagos, both on
the boat and while snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger should be taken as a capsule or coated tablet to avoid
esophageal irritation. Various over-the-counter versions of ginger
capsules are sold in health food stores and pharmacies. One tablet
product, Queeze-Eze (the manufacturer is in DeBary, Fla.,
904-774-5277), contains several nutrients and fruit enzymes that
are said to prevent irritation and enhance quick action. The only
reported side effect of ginger is an occasional ginger-flavored
burp.
</P>
<P>
   Another modern version of an ancient remedy takes advantage of
the Nei-kuan acupressure point on the wrist. It lies between the
two tendons on the underside of the wrist two finger widths past
the main crease where the hand meets the arm. Stimulating this
point can prevent morning sickness as well as motion sickness, and
this remedy has absolutely no side effects and is safe for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   I first encountered the acupressure technique on a trip to the
Antarctic. As we crossed the infamous Drake Passage, the whole ship
was flattened except for one woman who sat on the deck reading. She
was wearing Sea-Bands, one on each wrist. They resemble elasticized
bracelets with a plastic button in the inner side that is aligned
to press against the Nei-kuan acupressure point.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Bands and several imitators are sold in pharmacies, health
food stores and travel shops. A pair costs $10 to $15. Another
product, called Acu-Band, has an adjustable wrist strap. It is sold
by Traveler's Checklist in Sharon, Conn., for $12.95 plus $2 for
shipping, (860) 364-0144.
</P>
<P>
   Much more expensive though possibly more effective is an
electronic version called ReliefBand, available from the Woodside
Biomedical order department in South Bend, Ind., (800) 973-0378. By
means of a three-volt lithium battery, it transmits an electrical
signal through the skin to the nerve underlying the Nei-kuan point.
</P>
<P>
   In studies it has been 90 percent effective in preventing nausea
and vomiting from many causes, including chemotherapy. It is safe
for everyone except those with cardiac pacemakers. Three
nonprescription versions are available, a 48-hour disposable
($49.95), a 144-hour disposable ($95.95) and a reusable ($164.50),
plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   In the drug department, there are over-the-counter
antihistamines, including Dramamine, Bonine and Marezine. Among the
choices, Dramamine is most likely to cause drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   The most potent of remedies, Transderm Scop, is available only
by prescription. After a four-year hiatus to enhance effectiveness,
this patch containing scopalamine is back on the market. One patch
placed behind the ear is effective for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effect is dry mouth. Other possible adverse
effects include drowsiness, temporary blurring of vision and,
infrequently, disorientation, memory loss, restlessness, dizziness
and hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   It should not be used by anyone who drinks alcohol, women who
are pregnant or nursing or those with glaucoma. Consult your doctor
if you have a metabolic, liver or kidney disease or trouble
urinating.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    It would be the largest number of Latino votes ever cast in a
U.S. presidential election: 6 million.
 &HT;    And the number could go even higher still.
 &HT;    Led by the efforts of the Southwest Voter Registration Project
and the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, Latino groups and
activists across the country are mounting ``Latino Vote 2000,'' an
aggressive campaign to register hundreds of thousands of Hispanic
voters in the coming weeks and months.
 &HT;    Latino voter-drive efforts are not new. What is new is that
election-day turnout this fall by Latinos might well decide
countless local, state and federal races _ including the
presidency.
 &HT;    Raising the stakes even higher are predictions that an
unprecedented number of Latinos may shift their support from
Democratic to Republican candidates.
 &HT;    Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats still have strong
support among Latinos, but Texas Gov. George W. Bush is making real
headway. If he plays his cards right, I think he could match _ or
even exceed _ the nearly 40 percent support that Reagan received
from Latinos in his 1984 landslide re-election.
 &HT;    With Republicans holding just a six-seat majority in the House,
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle know just how critical a
Latino swing vote could be. And a strong victory by Bush can only
help down-ticket candidates, namely those in voting districts where
Latinos abound.
 &HT;    Consider the results of a recent survey by the Tomas Rivera
Policy Institute, a national think-tank that studies Latino
political trends. The non-partisan group found that in three Los
Angeles-area congressional districts each candidate's margin of
victory in 1998 was smaller than the number of registered Latino
voters who did not cast a ballot.
 &HT;    Put another way, a higher turnout by Latino voters could very
well have meant victory for the losing candidate.
 &HT;    For instance, Republican Congressman James Rogan, a member of
the House team that fought for President Clinton's impeachment, was
re-elected in California's 27th District by 6,800 votes in 1998.
Yet 21,000 registered Latino voters did not cast a ballot,
according to Matt Barreto, a Tomas Rivera researcher.
 &HT;    This tells us that getting Latinos registered to vote is only
half the battle. Along with voter registration drives, Latino
leaders of every political ilk should be mounting get-to-the-polls
drives.
 &HT;    Incidentally, it isn't that Latinos don't care about elections.
It's just that for most of our nation's history, our vote hasn't
really mattered to the cast of mostly non-Latino politicians
running for office.
 &HT;    Things could be different this year. The trends are all tilted
in the right direction. Latinos today are better educated. More
Latinos are starting new businesses, moving into management jobs
and even taking roles in the upper ranks of corporate America. And,
most significantly, there are simply more Latinos _ about 31
million by the latest estimates.
 &HT;    As a result, the growth in the number of Latinos who have
registered to vote has been striking. Juan Andrade, head of the
U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, says the number of registered
Latino voters nationwide jumped by 164 percent from 1976 to 1996,
compared to 31 percent in the general population.
 &HT;    Latino voter-registration efforts received an unexpected boost
in the 1990s in the wake of ``anti-Latino'' initiatives, according
to Russell Jauregui, an attorney in Pasadena, Calif., and a former
volunteer organizer for Southwest Voter.
 &HT;    Most Latino voters angrily rejected the sharp conservative shift
in Congress on the issues of welfare and immigration legislation
during the Gingrich years. And several California ballot
initiatives managed to wound the GOP image in the Latino community.
 &HT;    As a result, hundreds of thousands of Latino voters had little
trouble deciding to pick Democrats over Republicans in 1996 and
1998. Clinton, for instance, won more than 70 percent of the Latino
vote in 1996.
 &HT;    But there isn't a similar ``negative force'' pushing Latinos to
the polls this campaign season, Andrade said. Ironically, that has
some Latino leaders worried. While they appreciate the GOP's
kinder, gentler attitude toward our community, many Latinos may
feel that because the ``threat'' has subsided they can stay home on
election day.
 &HT;    ``We need another Pete Wilson,'' jokes Andrade, referring to the
former California governor who still draws the wrath of many
Latinos for his support of a ballot initiative barring illegal
immigrant children from public schools.
 &HT;    Hopefully, Latinos won't need another Pete Wilson to get us to
the polls in November. Latinos should know that with 6 million-plus
votes to wield in the general election, politicians across the
country and the political spectrum will think twice before
repeating Wilson's mistakes. All we have to do now is cast our
ballots.

 &HT;    Most Latino voters angrily rejected the sharp conservative shift
in Congress on the issues of welfare and immigration legislation
during the Gingrich years. And several California ballot
initiatives managed to wound the GOP image in the Latino community.
 &HT;    As a result, hundreds of thousands of Latino voters had little
trouble deciding to pick Democrats over Republicans in 1996 and
1998. Clinton, for instance, won more than 70 percent of the Latino
vote in 1996.
 &HT;    But there isn't a similar ``negative force'' pushing Latinos to
the polls this campaign season, Andrade said. Ironically, that has
some Latino leaders worried. While they appreciate the GOP's
kinder, gentler attitude toward our community, many Latinos may
feel that because the ``threat'' has subsided they can stay home on
election day.
 &HT;    ``We need another Pete Wilson,'' jokes Andrade, referring to the
former California governor who still draws the wrath of many
Latinos for his support of a ballot initiative barring illegal
immigrant children from public schools.
 &HT;    Hopefully, Latinos won't need another Pete Wilson to get us to
the polls in November. Latinos should know that with 6 million-plus
votes to wield in the general election, politicians across the
country and the political spectrum will think twice before
repeating Wilson's mistakes. All we have to do now is cast our
ballots.

IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THOSE WHO FLEW THEIR FINAL FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, England _ When the United States entered World War II
_ although it had been brought into the war by an attack on Pearl
Harbor by the Japanese _ the United States and its allies quickly
agreed that Germany was the more dangerous of the aggressors they
faced and should be dealt with first.
</P>
<P>
   There were four strategic objectives to prosecuting the war,
says a brief history written by the American Battle Monuments
Commission. All four required the effective use of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Those objectives included keeping sea lanes open between the
United States and Great Britain; supporting other nations warring
against the Axis powers, including the opening of second fronts in
Africa and Italy to relieve pressure on the Soviet Union;
conducting intensive aerial bombardment of Germany; and launching
an invasion of the European continent across the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these objectives, the south of England eventually
became an armed camp, piled high with supplies of war and with men
waiting to enter the ground war against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The flat land in the south was perfect for airstrips from which
British and American bombers would conduct the war in the air _ the
British bombing by night and the Americans bombing by day.
</P>
<P>
   The land also was suitable for a grim byproduct of war.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge University donated 30.5 acres three miles west of the
town in 1943 so that the Americans could establish a temporary
military cemetery for those who lost their lives. It later became
the only permanent American World War II military cemetery in the
British Isles, dedicated in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   It is a peaceful site _ with an elegant chapel, sweeping green
lawns, a reflecting pool and the crosses _ occasionally mixed with
a Star of David _ spreading out row on row from a central flag pole
flying the Stars and Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the headstones represent multiple burials _ one of two
and one of three servicemen whose names are known but whose remains
could not be separately identified. There are 24 unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,812 graves. And on a wall that stretches from the
entrance to the chapel are 5,126 names of Americans who also died
but whose bodies were never recovered or identified.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those buried or named here died in the Battle of the
Atlantic, or in the skies over Europe, or in training accidents in
the nearby countryside while they prepared to go to war.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Americans _ members of the choir at Broadway Baptist
Church on a tour of England _ visited the cemetery week before
last. Our English guide, Philip Baker, saw to it that we did.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel is lovely _ with the seals of the States of the
United States depicted in its windows. Its ceiling is tall, as
befits a memorial that serves primarily Army Air Forces dead.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling is painted blue, with faint clouds and American
aircraft of all types making a final flight accompanied by angels.
</P>
<P>
   On the ceiling is this inscription:
</P>
<P>
   ``In proud and grateful memory of those men of the United States
Army Air Force who from these friendly isles flew their final
flight and met their God. They knew not the hour the day nor the
manner of their passing. When far from home they were called to
join that heroic band of airmen who had gone before. May they rest
in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the visitors' center is a plaque given by a town in
England in gratitude to an American bomber crew that chose to ride
the plane into the ground _ and to death _ rather than let it crash
into the town.
</P>
<P>
   One of our number located the grave of a distant relative. All
of us read names of men we did not know _ and of one whom we did:
band leader Glenn Miller, who was lost over the English Channel on
Dec. 15, 1944, on a flight to a performance in Paris. It's
appropriate that there is no special treatment of his name _ it's
just one among thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chapel, our choir gathered in a circle and sang two
verses of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' Then we sang ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as people wiped the tears from their eyes, someone said
that they were glad that we had come to this place.
</P>
<P>
   It's the least we could do, someone else said.
</P>

MOOSE HUNTER: JASON ALEXANDER GOES BAD IN `ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jason Alexander in a scene from ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd end up in the movie version of `Rocky and
Bullwinkle,''' Jason Alexander says, flashing a cherubic grin
tinged with mischief. ``When I was a kid, my favorite cartoon was
`Magilla Gorilla.' I always wanted a part in that.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the actor who got famous playing a hapless schlep
on ``Seinfeld'' (1990-1998) is about to hit movie screens as Boris
Badenov, half of the inept team of Boris and Natasha in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' opening nationwide on June
30.
 &HT;    ``I watched several episodes of the series and then looked in
the mirror and thought, `Yeah, that's me,''' Alexander says with a
chuckle. ``They did shave off half my eyebrows, though, and I want
everyone to know I was wearing a fat suit _ I did not gain weight
for this film.''
 &HT;    Based on Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon characters, ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' mixes animation and live
action in a tale that pits the flying squirrel and moose against
Boris, Natasha (Rene Russo) and their boss, the evil Fearless
Leader (Robert De Niro).
 &HT;    It's De Niro's goofiest role by a long shot, but Alexander
nonetheless admits that he was intimidated at the thought of
working with the legendary actor.
 &HT;    ``Actually, De Niro was very nice,'' he recalls, ``but a bit of
an introvert. Rene and I would be kidding around, and he'd just be
kind of quiet. You start thinking, `Is he preparing? Is this part
of his process?'
 &HT;    ``And everybody was calling him `Mr. De Niro,''' Alexander adds.
``I was `Jason' and Rene was `Rene,' but he was `Mr. De Niro.'
Finally we had a scene where they had to move the mark where he was
supposed to stand about two inches. They were all going, `Mr. De
Niro, we've moved your mark about two inches, will that be a
problem, sir?'
 &HT;    ``I finally said, `Look, this guy has gained and lost 5,000
pounds for roles, he's been hit in the face by professional boxers,
just make him move like everybody else!'''
 &HT;    Alexander laughs.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately,'' he says, ``everybody, including Mr. De Niro,
broke up, and that was sort of an icebreaker.''
 &HT;    No icebreaker was required with Russo, who Alexander says
reminded him of his first days with ``Seinfeld'' co-star Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
 &HT;    ``Usually there's a learning curve when you work with somebody
for the first time,'' he says. ``But with Julia, she came in the
door and said, `Let's do it.' It was the same with Rene _ when I
met her, she said, `I think you're really funny, so show me how to
be.'
 &HT;    ``We had a lot of fun, which was fortunate, because we're sort
of joined at the hip during the entire film.''
 &HT;    Alexander has 4- and 8-year-old sons, but he says they didn't
influence his decision to accept ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' In fact,
he doubts they'll even see it.
 &HT;    ``My children are so unimpressed with me that it's pathetic,''
he says. ``I can't get them to watch anything I'm in. They never
saw `Seinfeld,' and they won't even watch `The Hunchback of Notre
Dame,' where I did the gargoyle voice.
 &HT;    ``I think my children hate me,'' he concludes. ``I may go into
therapy about it.''
 &HT;    His own childhood, spent in a middle-class New Jersey suburb,
was no picnic, Alexander says.
 &HT;    ``I wished I could have been invisible,'' he says, suddenly
serious. ``I was very heavy, and I got picked on a lot. I spent my
early school years trying to disappear.
 &HT;    ``Then I discovered a pre-emptive strike _ getting kids to laugh
with me instead of at me,'' he recalls. ``I had dozens of comedy
albums, and I just memorized the material from all these comedians
and tried to do it exactly like they did. I would imitate their
voices, their timing, everything.
 &HT;    ``It seemed to work,'' Alexander says. ``Suddenly I wasn't
getting picked on anymore. But I was not the class clown, and I
never thought of being an actor _ I was just trying to survive.''
 &HT;    By the time he was a teen-ager, however, he had begun singing
and dancing lessons, which paid off when he headed for Broadway. In
1989 he earned a Tony Award for his performance in ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway.''
 &HT;    In fact, he says, if it weren't for Nathan Lane he might still
be on Broadway, since Lane often snagged roles Alexander was after,
and vice versa.
 &HT;    ``I'd see him at an audition and say, `Maybe we should just flip
a coin to decide which one of us should leave,''' the actor
recalls. ``I'd be up to replace him and he'd be up to replace me.
The sad part is that Nathan and I never ended up doing anything
together.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, true stardom awaited Alexander on television,
in the form of the bumbling, self-obsessed George Costanza.
 &HT;    ``I'm always kind of stunned by the love people have for
George,'' he says, shrugging. ``I get letters from people going,
`You know, my friends tell me I'm just like George.'
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `You either need therapy or different friends _ that
is not a compliment.'''
 &HT;    Alexander settles back reflectively.
 &HT;    ``I guess what was charming about George, if that's the right
word, is that he was an everyman who went through an everyman's
problems with the world,'' he muses. ``He reacted with anger and
self-aggrandizement but, to his credit, he also was
self-deprecating. It's why people love Howard Stern _ he's vicious
and inappropriate, but he skewers himself more mercilessly than
anybody else.''
 &HT;    Alexander may be a star, but he's avoided most of the Hollywood
lifestyle, and has been married to Daena Title for 18 years.
 &HT;    ``It's dumb luck,'' Alexander says with a smile. ``But when you
get toward middle age, you hit a bump. Daena and I have had some
problems, and a couple of years ago we went into therapy and worked
on them.
 &HT;    ``It's not easy,'' he concedes. ``It's not fun. But if you have
something valuable, you do it. We came out at a better place than
when we started our relationship. I'm very lucky, because I'm
married to an exceptional woman.''
 &HT;    Raising their children has been made much more complicated by
Alexander's success on ``Seinfeld.''
 &HT;    ``Fortunately and unfortunately, you can't escape the fact of
celebrity,'' he says. ``There are perks and there are problems. For
instance, we want our kids to have a normal life _ but I can't take
them to the supermarket, because I'll get too much attention. So we
have an assistant go to the market and, if they want to go, they go
with the assistant. That's not normal, so it's kind of a vicious
cycle.''
 &HT;    ``Seinfeld'' made its cast members rich, with Alexander,
Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Michael Richards pocketing $600,000 per
episode for the final season. Alexander admits to mixed feelings
about the whole thing.
 &HT;    ``Am I worth almost a million dollars?'' he says. ``I remember
something Jerry Seinfeld said, when they asked him if he really
needed 42 Porsches: He said, `Let's get something straight _ I
don't even need one.'
 &HT;    ``So I don't need a million dollars,'' Alexander concedes. ``But
in the TV marketplace we were running circles around everybody
else, so why not?
 &HT;    ``But the world is bent on its ear in that respect _ nothing I
do is worth what a schoolteacher does.''

`SCARY' TACTICS: SHANNON ELIZABETH REACHES FOR STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Shannon Elizabeth with Regina Hall and
Anna Faris in a scene from ``Scary Movie.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Shannon Elizabeth was a teen-ager pretty much
like most others. One night she was sitting at home alone, glued to
the television, watching the creepy horror film ``He Knows You're
Alone'' (1981).
 &HT;    A light in the back yard suddenly blew out.
 &HT;    ``It scared the crap out of me!'' Elizabeth recalls, whooping at
the memory. ``I couldn't move from the chair until my parents came
home.
 &HT;    ``After that I was always a fan of horror movies,'' she says.
``I just like them.''
 &HT;    Fast-forward a few years. Elizabeth is 23 now, and enjoying some
Hollywood buzz for her role as a sexually uninhibited exchange
student in the surprise hit ``American Pie'' (1999). She's
leveraged that buzz into her own stab at the horror genre _ or,
actually, into a jab at the horror genre, since her current film,
``Scary Movie,'' is a spoof of the likes of ``Scream'' (1996),
which was originally titled ``Scary Movie,'' and ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer'' (1997).
 &HT;    Elizabeth plays Buffy, a blissfully stupid high-school student
who wears impossibly short skirts and just might be the next victim
of a vicious masked murderer with a habit of telephoning his
victims before filleting them with a fishing gaff. Director Keenen
Ivory Wayans overlooks no cliche and gleefully indulges in sick
jokes, gruesome violence, foul language and nudity _ even male
nudity.
 &HT;    Still, the idea of mocking the ``Scream'' movies, which were
themselves self-referential parodies of the horror genre, seems a
tad redundant. But Elizabeth, speaking by telephone from the
Manhattan offices of Dimension Films, doesn't see it that way.
 &HT;    ```Scream' and all of those movies took themselves very
seriously,'' she says. ``When the characters were supposed to be
scared, they were very scared. In `Scary Movie,' when the killer
comes around, we're like, `Ooh, we're so scared.'
 &HT;    ``We're very sarcastic and very spoofy in that sense,'' she
says. ``We didn't take anything seriously. We didn't take each
other seriously.''
 &HT;    Three minutes into a conversation with Elizabeth, it's obvious
that, while her character may be stupid, she herself is one smart
cookie. It's also clear that she takes her career very seriously,
which made playing Buffy all the more a kick for the exotic-looking
actress, the daughter of a Syrian/Lebanese father and a mother
whose mixed descent includes Native American blood.
 &HT;    ``It was so not me in high school,'' says Elizabeth, who was
born in Houston and grew up in Waco, Texas. ``I'm just not a ditzy
person, so I was a little worried that I wasn't quite doing it
right.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to do Buffy justice,'' she explains. ``I couldn't be
too big with it, and I didn't have to be myself, I didn't have to
be serious. I could just go overboard and have fun.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth landed her ``Scary Movie'' role after ``American
Pie,'' the surprisingly clever gross-out comedy in which she turned
heads _ and turned on millions of guys _ with her va-va-voom
portrayal of Nadia, the nubile and willing Czechoslovakian exchange
student.
 &HT;    The film pushed the envelope for pastry eroticism and offended
more than a few viewers, but pleased enough to take in more than
$100 million at the box office. In the process, it steered Mena
Suvari, Chris Klein, Jason Biggs and Elizabeth herself into the
fast lane to stardom.
 &HT;    ``When we were doing it, we loved the script and the directors
and everybody involved with it, but I don't think anybody knew what
it would do in general, much less for each one of us,'' says
Elizabeth, a former model and commercial actress whose previous
experience had been limited to television guest spots and
independent features. ``It was released at the right time. We were
in the right place at the right time.
 &HT;    ``Everything just went right.''
 &HT;    Her new fame doesn't seem to faze the young actress, who lives
in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, Joe Reitman, and seven dogs.
It's fun to be recognized, she says, and to sign autographs and
glam it up at premieres and awards shows.
 &HT;    Still, it has its awkward moments. One time, as she was leaving
a premiere, fans and photographers pounced on her car. On another
occasion, a man showed up on Elizabeth's doorstep, magazine in
hand, requesting an autograph.
 &HT;    ``Just the fact that he found us scared my boyfriend to death,''
Elizabeth says. ``He felt like he wasn't going to be able to
protect me.
 &HT;    ``It can get a little strange,'' she admits. ``But my boyfriend
gets more worried than I do, so I just let him do the worrying.''
 &HT;    Besides, Elizabeth is too busy mapping out the next steps in her
career to waste time worrying. She recently committed to
``Tomcats,'' a comedy with Jerry O'Connell and Jake Busey, in which
she'll play a police officer. Come autumn, she'll be a ubiquitous
presence in magazines as the star of Nautica Jeans' latest ad
campaign.
 &HT;    Actually, the biggest obstacle to her future success might be
the very thing that's gotten her this far.
 &HT;    ``I think I used my sexuality and my looks in `American Pie' to
get people to notice me,'' she says, by no means apologizing. ``And
now it's up to me what I do with that. Now it's up to me to pick
roles that display my talent more than my looks. I want to be a
chameleon.''
 &HT;    As role models, Elizabeth cites the protean Gary Oldman or
Cameron Diaz, a bombshell in her own right who nonetheless was able
to disappear into her role as a mousy housewife in ``Being John
Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``I want to pick some roles that you'd just never expect me to
do,'' the actress says. ``My next role is a police officer, and
I've been working with guns and I've been doing ride-alongs and
handcuffings. It's been a great learning experience, but I like
that it is very different from my other roles.
 &HT;    ``I really want to do the best job I can,'' she says, ``and show
people that there's more behind what they see and what they think I
am.
 &HT;    ``Also, a lot of people see you as a character and think that's
you, that that's just who you are,'' Elizabeth concludes. ``I can
change that by how I show myself in interviews, because that's when
you get to be who you are.
 &HT;    ``But I also want to change that perception of me by the
different characters I play.''

 &HT;    ``First of all, it was kind of ridiculous for me to play a
cheerleader, because I'm so pale and so untoned,'' Natasha Lyonne
says. ``I don't even have the required big calves!''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Lyonne stars in the quirky comedy ``But I'm a
Cheerleader,'' opening throughout July nationwide. And, to hear her
tell it over breakfast at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, it
wasn't a pretty sight.
 &HT;    ``I did all my own cheers,'' she says, wincing. ``I thought I
could do those stupid cartwheels, but I'm the most uncoordinated
person in America. And everyone saw this on the rushes. The word
went out _ I heard, `We need reshoots. Immediately! She's a
klutz!'''
 &HT;    Shy, petite and engulfed in a mass of long, blonde curls, the
21-year-old actress shakes her head sadly. After all, part of the
point in making the movie was to play the kind of role her fans
wouldn't expect her to tackle.
 &HT;    ``I took this part because everyone asks me, `Why do you only
choose these wisecracking roles?''' says Lyonne, who caught
Hollywood's eye as Woody Allen's sharp-tongued daughter in
``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996), and copped some more attitude
as a sarcastic teen in ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' (1998). ``The new
movie is anything but that sort of girl.''
 &HT;    That's for sure. ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' casts Lyonne as a
naive, Christian cheerleader from a small town in middle America.
 &HT;    ``But she has Melissa Etheridge posters on her wall, and her
hands keep slipping up the other cheerleaders' skirts when she's
doing lifts,'' the actress says. ``And one day she comes home and
RuPaul is there, plus all her friends and family. They're doing an
intervention on her, because they think she's gay.''
 &HT;    Soon she's shipped off to a rehab camp to cure her suspected
lesbian proclivities.
 &HT;    ``These camps do exist,'' Lyonne says. ``I know it sounds kind
of ridiculous and very strange, but it's true. And, frankly, I
wanted to make the film to expose these places _ I think they're
frightening. At the very least, kids should know what's out
there.''
 &HT;    Kids will probably pay attention, as they have since Lyonne
broke out into mainstream movies with the teen hit ``American Pie''
(1999), which has grossed more than $100 million.
 &HT;    ``What happened with `American Pie' was pretty amazing,'' the
actress says. ``It's strange, because all of a sudden my name is on
the map. I'm supposed to be one of the leaders of young
Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ```Young Hollywood?' Like I'm leading this wild lifestyle?
Please!'' she says. ``Hey, I'm just a homebody who watches movies,
listens to music and reads. Seriously, that's all I do. I don't
even get out much. So it makes me laugh when I hear, `There's hot
buzz on you.'''
 &HT;    The plus side is increased respect within the Hollywood
community.
 &HT;    ``I don't feel so desperate when it comes to getting acting
jobs,'' she admits. ``I'm in a much cooler place in my own head.
Now I'm sent the good scripts _ finally I'm seeing the good
material.
 &HT;    ``It's so hard for any of us who really care about acting to
find good material,'' Lyonne says. ``That's the most frustrating
thing, because here I am _ I actually have some heat, and I feel
there is so little I can actually do with it.
 &HT;    ``I refuse to take my heat and go make some schlocky teen
romantic comedy,'' she adds firmly, ``which is the bulk of the
stuff I get offered. Most of those scripts are trash. And that's
not what I want to do.''
 &HT;    Even if it means walking away from some big paychecks.
 &HT;    ``I do feel the pressure to take the money and run,'' she
concedes. ``But I can't approach a career thinking about my bank
account.''
 &HT;    Hence her continued attraction to independent films,
 &HT;    ``Some of them might never see the light of day,'' she says.
``That's a bummer. But it does show that I have a range _ maybe
somebody will see one of these films and say, `Hey, let's really go
against type and cast her in a period movie.'''
 &HT;    Born and raised in New York, where she still lives, Lyonne was
only 7 when she won a role on ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' in 1986,
playing the curious little girl Opal.
 &HT;    ``It's the work I'm most proud of when I look back,'' the
actress says. ``Even at a young age, I really created a character.
In fact, I was really into acting even as a kid _ I was in Opal
mode all the time, and I would watch the show and critique my own
performances.
 &HT;    ``I still think I'm pretty good on that show.''
 &HT;    Even now, she fumes when she recalls how Paul ``Pee-Wee Herman''
Reubens' career was destroyed after his arrest for indecent
exposure in a Florida gay-movie theater.
 &HT;    ``I still think Paul got a raw deal,'' Lyonne says. ``It's such
BS. It's so ridiculous to think that actors shouldn't have a
private life.''
 &HT;    Lyonne went on to make her movie debut in ``Heartburn'' (1986)
as one of Meryl Streep's nieces, but her career didn't really take
off until Allen cast her in his musical, ``Everyone Says I Love
You.''
 &HT;    ``I spent my time sneaking out in the middle of the night to go
sit on the roof and listen to my Walkman. I was hiding out to smoke
cigarettes,'' she says, laughing. ``I would never smoke cigarettes
on the set, because I thought Woody would think I was a gross
bacteria machine.''
 &HT;    But she adds that Allen taught her a few good lessons.
 &HT;    ``Simple stuff he said kind of sticks with me on every movie,''
Lyonne says. ``He told me, `Just be funny and don't put the
audience to sleep.'''
 &HT;    Apparently it's working, because Lyonne is on some kind of a
roll. She even has fans now: As she leaves the Four Seasons, young
girls come over to ask Lyonne about her boyfriend, actor Edward
Furlong. Bashful boys hang around the outskirts, staring but afraid
to approach her.
 &HT;    Lyonne is sweet with the fans, patiently signing autographs and
smiling for snapshots.
 &HT;    ``Fans are cool,'' she says. ``I can't understand actors who
want to be totally left alone. When I'm out, I'll turn around and
one or two people will be following me.
 &HT;    ``Hey, it's not a mob scene,'' Lyonne says with a laugh. ``But
it's a start.''

<P>
   Television superwomen started in the 1970s, with Lynda Carter as
the seminal Amazon in ``Wonder Woman'' (1976-1979) and Lindsay
Wagner as ``The Bionic Woman'' (1976-1978).
</P>
<P>
   But both had played out the string by 1980, and there the matter
stood until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated television has been a godsend to people who love
women who kick serious butt, however, as foreign and domestic
audiences alike have flocked to the exploits of a new generation of
superwomen.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at six top television wonder women for the new
millennium. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; LUCY LAWLESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Xena on ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' (1995-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: A guest shot as Lysia on an early episode of
``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'' led to a return appearance,
this time as the warrior Xena. And the rest is prehistory.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Lawless played an undercover
cop on a 1994 episode of the action series ``High Tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Overview: The leather-clad, sword-wielding Xena is the yardstick
by which all other female action stars are measured. Her ability to
combine athleticism, heroism and hidden tenderness instantly made
her a fan favorite on ``Hercules,'' and her spinoff show has by now
outlasted its parent and made Lawless an international star.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``People assume that I'm a total Amazon, like I have to
duck to get through doors,'' Lawless told Maxim magazine last year.
``I've never been that physically coordinated or good at sports, so
the last thing I figured I'd become is an action hero. I thought
I'd be doing Shakespeare.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; VICTORIA PRATT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 29.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sarge on ``Cleopatra 2525'' (2000-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: Pratt played hard-nosed Mafia boss Jackie Janczyk
on John Woo's Canadian series ``Once a Thief'' (1997-1998).
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Pratt got primitive in 1998
for a two-part ``Xena'' episode, a role directly responsible for
her being cast in ``Cleopatra 2525.''
</P>
<P>
   Overview: Pratt has been the standout on this new sci-fi
half-hour about three women fighting against aliens to win back the
Earth for the human race. She plays ``Sarge,'' the silent,
large-armed soldier who shoots first and falls in love later.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role that Pratt is physically perfect for, impeccably
sculpted and yet softly beautiful. Fitness fans may recognize the
Canadian actress from her numerous cover appearances and columns
for workout magazines such as Oxygen and MuscleMag.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Sarge is a hard-ass,'' Pratt says. ``She's a bit of a
sex machine, too, but not out-and-out. She's very passionate and
yet low-key. Plus, she won't take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so great to play,'' the actress adds, ``and I'm glad
Sarge is not simply a one-note character. She's tough but, you
know, she's got a vulnerable side.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; PAMELA ANDERSON LEE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Vallery Irons on ``V.I.P.'' (1998-present)
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: After a much ballyhooed Playboy spread, Anderson
landed a role as Lisa the Tool Time Girl on ``Home Improvement'' in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Anderson played the title role
in ``Barb Wire'' (1996), an unsuccessful feature based on the
leather-clad comic-book heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Overview: Though her character is admittedly bubble-headed,
Anderson weaves a fine line between toughness and naivete. The fact
that she can be downright hilarious while icing evildoers makes her
that much more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I get to do so many things within this character,'' she
says. ``I like the comedy, the lightheartedness and the action.
It's really my fantasy of what I would like to see on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I a role model?'' Anderson adds. ``Everyone in the public
eye is a role model, but people shouldn't base their lives on what
people do in the public eye.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TIA CARRERE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sydney Fox on ``Relic Hunter'' (1999-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout role: Carrere was discovered in a grocery store in her
native Hawaii, and landed a role on ``General Hospital'' in 1985.
But it wasn't until ``Wayne's World'' (1992) that she found
widespread acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Carrere has battled evil in
several low-budget films such as ``Zombie Nightmare'' (1986) and
``Road Raiders'' (1989). Hey, a girl's got to eat!
</P>
<P>
   Overview: There are dozens of Web sites devoted to Carrere and
``Relic Hunter,'' though it's no surprise that most of the sites
are little more than exhaustive photo galleries of the exotic
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   As Sydney Fox, a female Indiana Jones, Carrere combines book
smarts with kicks to the solar plexus, adding up to a complex
character who's as strong as she is beautiful. And, unlike a lot of
modern femmes fatale, Fox gets by on her wits and fists instead of
relying on guns and gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Carrere had a handle on her character from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' she recalls, ``I said that she should be
intelligent as well as sexy, as well as kick-ass. A modern,
well-rounded woman.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GENA LEE NOLIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Sheena in ``Sheena, Queen of the Jungle'' (debuting
in fall 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout Role: Nolin started her on-camera career as a ``Price
is Right'' model, but won fame as Neely Capshaw for three seasons
of ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Nolin is new to the genre, but
she's buffing up for ``Sheena,'' and should be ready to handle
whatever fiends may come her way.
</P>
<P>
   Overview: It's about time Hollywood brought back one of
pop-culture's most exciting action stars. Sheena is based on a
comic book that, in turn, saw screen time as a short-lived series
in 1954 and as a feature film in 1984, starring Tanya Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Nolin has no trouble filling out her character's skimpy
animal-hyde bikini, and while it's true that Sheena bears a
striking thematic resemblance to Tarzan, it's clear that anything
he can do, she can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``You have to keep a certain figure because millions of
people watch you, so you want to look good,'' Nolin told fans
during an Internet chat. ``But it's hard, because I'm from the
Midwest and love mashed potatoes and steak and that sort of
thing.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CAROL ALT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 39.
</P>
<P>
   Character: Karen Oldham in ``Peter Benchley's Amazon''
(1999-present).
</P>
<P>
   Breakout Role: The supermodel basically played herself in
``Private Parts'' (1997), the film biography of radio shock-jock
Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Previous butt-kicking experience: Alt co-starred with wrestler
Hulk Hogan in the little-seen action flick ``Thunder in Paradise''
(1994).
</P>
<P>
   Overview: As the bold leader of six plane-crash survivors
stranded in the Amazon jungle, Karen braves warring native tribes,
deadly animals and dangerous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a major departure for Alt, who began her career as a
supermodel. Once accustomed to star pampering, she now works 1,000
miles from the nearest salon _ yet somehow remains radiant under
all that dirt and grime.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``I tell the writers that, when you write for my
character, write for a man and change it to a woman's name,'' she
says. ``It's like, `Someone's in trouble, grab the crossbow and
let's go.' Because that's how I am in my house. If something's
broken, you go fix it.''

GAINING INSIGHTS AND NERVES OF STEEL IN NEW YORK CLASSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judith Hergovich had only the vaguest expectations of
what lay ahead when she left her tiny village of Trausdorf,
Austria, in August 1998 to spend a year teaching math in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be hard,'' said Hergovich, who was 25 at the
time and had been teaching only a year. ``I knew the students are a
little bit tougher than in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   What she did not know was that her new workplace, Adlai E.
Stevenson High School in the southeast Bronx, had 3,500 students _
more than twice the population of Trausdorf _ some of the most
crowded, chaotic classrooms in the city, and one of its highest
dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Hergovich plowed right in, teaching five classes a day and
soaking up life in New York _ which in her case meant an austere
apartment in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx, far from the
skyscrapers she knew from movies and postcards. Despite the
unnerving challenges she faced, she found the experience rewarding
enough to stay for a second school year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tocqueville touring America in the 19th century, Hergovich
and the 45 other Austrians recruited to help ease a shortage of
math and science teachers have observed life here from an
outsider's vantage point, and they are bubbling with insights about
New York City's education culture. Almost all have struggled with
more serious discipline problems than they expected, and with the
quandary of how to teach students whose abysmal grades would
relegate them to trade school in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be more strict and more mean here,'' said Eva
Kailbauer, 28, who is teaching math at Franklin Delano Roosevelt
High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. ``In Austria, if a kid says
they have to go to the nurse, they really have to. Here, kids take
every opportunity to really test you. I trusted them at first.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Austrian teachers have also been moved by the hardships
that many teen-agers here face. ``It's always your worst students
who have the biggest problems at home,'' said Lutz Holzinger, 30, a
biology teacher at Roosevelt who has signed up for a third year
here. ``One bad student who acts up all the time, I learn his
mother has AIDS and there is no father. I would freak out, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Holzinger and several others say they cannot
believe what they see as stubborn indifference among many city
students and the enormous tolerance of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating that many students give up before they
enter the classroom,'' said Hergovich, who was transferred from
Stevenson to Dewitt Clinton High School, also in the Bronx, this
year. ``I never saw something like this in Austria. I don't know
who to blame here; I wouldn't say American culture. Just maybe the
circumstances of how they were raised and where they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Kailbauer and Holzinger said that to their surprise, other
teachers had told them not to blame themselves when many of their
students failed standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I was shocked because 50 percent failed the
tests,'' Holzinger said. ``But then I found out this is normal.
Chemistry, math, all classes. If 50 percent pass, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lepuschitz, 30, a math teacher at Roosevelt, said he did
not understand why New York State required even the poorest
students to take math and science to graduate. In Austria, he said,
students who do not excel academically are sent to trade school,
which he said was a more sensible route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school system divides people who can do certain things and
people who can't,'' Lepuschitz said. ``The people who can't are not
lost; it's just a slower track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education began recruiting in Austria in 1998,
after Alfred Posamentier, a professor of mathematics education at
City College, pointed out that Austria had a surplus of math and
science teachers, many with advanced degrees. The Austrian
government was enthusiastic because the teachers would come back
fluent in English, an increasingly sought-after credential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately wanted to go for it,'' recalled Holzinger, who
heard about the opportunity from a radio advertisement. ``I already
was planning to go to New York, and this was a chance to do
reasonable work instead of being a waiter or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepuschitz applied for a job here in 1998 because he was 40th on
a waiting list for a teaching job in Austria. He had spent eight
months student-teaching in a private school. His first assignment,
at Walton High School in the Bronx, was terrifying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students threatened me,'' said Lepuschitz, looking studious
and very young in jeans and a baggy sweater. ``They didn't
behave.''
</P>
<P>
   He requested and was granted a transfer to Roosevelt High School
last fall, after hearing from other Austrians that students were
better behaved there. But Roosevelt students tried his patience,
too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how to solve an equation after you tell them
three times,'' Lepuschitz said. ``Out of 30 students, maybe 10 will
answer the question, `Three plus seven equals X, what is X?' And
that is a simple problem!''
</P>
<P>
   Holzinger, for one, seems to have mastered the discipline
problem by acting hip and unflappable. One rainy spring morning,
his students _ even the one whose T-shirt read, ``Rule by
Intimidation'' _ listened quietly as he explained the difference
between DNA and RNA. Kailbauer's approach was similarly
no-nonsense. After passing out work sheets to her ninth-grade
algebra class, she sat ramrod straight at her desk, surveying them
with a glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who are not sure what to do,'' she said gruffly,
``just listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the Austrians say their personal lives in New York
City have been far less taxing than their professional ones. Many
share apartments with one or two other Austrians, typically in
far-flung neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx, furnished with
thrift-shop finds. They tend to stick together, venturing into
Manhattan on weekends to see movies and visit museums.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to high schools in every borough but Staten Island, the
Austrian teachers have generally won praise for knowing their
material and speaking solid English. Adele Vocel, the principal at
Roosevelt, said the Austrian teachers fit right in at her school
because the teaching staff and the student body were already so
diverse. The students speak 32 languages, and many of the teachers
have thicker accents than the Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard there was a new wave and I saw we had the ability
to absorb some of them, I begged,'' said Vocel, who hired four
Austrians last year and four this year. ``These teachers are very
well prepared, and they work very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sandra Abrams, the principal of James Madison High School in
Brooklyn, said that although the Austrian teachers know their
subjects thoroughly, she had reservations about their
``chalk-and-talk'' style of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to have a lecture-style approach,'' said Dr. Abrams,
whose school had two Austrian teachers last year but none this
year. ``We like to see students involved in a very hands-on kind of
way rather than being passive and taking notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Harold Levy said in an interview that he was
interested in expanding the program and perhaps starting others
modeled on it. The number of teachers from Austria and other
countries may more than triple next year if 100 new candidates pass
muster. Board officials are interviewing them this week in Vienna
and Innsbruck, Austria. The new round of applicants includes
several teachers from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   New York City needs math and science teachers more than ever;
board officials anticipate needing to hire nearly 700 new math
teachers for the coming school year. Howard Tames, executive
director of the board's personnel division, said that most of the
400 math teachers the board hired this year were not certified in
math. He said the board would also try to recruit qualified
teachers from Canada, the Caribbean and perhaps India and the
Philippines over the next few years.

GENOMIC CHIEF'S PREDICTIONS THROUGH 2040 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within 10 years, tests for genetic predisposition to 25 major
causes of illness and death in this country will be widely
available if predictions of Dr. Francis S. Collins, head of the
Human Genome Project of the National Institutes of Health, prove
correct.
</P>
<P>
   But most people will shun genetic testing unless effective
therapies exist to prevent potential hazards from the particular
disorders, Collins said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The project will map each of the estimated 50,000 human genes
and spell out each letter in the book of the DNA, the thread of
life, in the genes. But as scientists race to write the final
chapter, they have little comprehension of the book's instructions
and the changes they might bring to society.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in a recent lecture after receiving a prestigious
award from the Association of American Physicians, Collins made
predictions about the project's impact on medical practice over the
next 40 years, answering the question he said he was asked most:
where will all the research lead? In doing so, he plunged into
territory where few other scientific leaders tread.
</P>
<P>
   Using genetics to tailor and improve health care will be the
genome project's main legacy if effective laws are passed to
protect privacy, prevent use of genetic information to deprive an
individual of health insurance or a job, and prohibit other forms
of genetic discrimination, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he urged closer scrutiny to determine when genetic tests
are ready for wide use, given that commercial pressures may
persuade patients and doctors to use tests before their medical
value is established.
</P>
<P>
   Even if only a few predictions prove true, major political and
economic problems would follow. For example, the new genetic
information's power to change medical practice could aggravate
international tensions by widening inequalities in access to health
care within countries and between those in the developed and third
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Among Collins' predictions:
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, the genome will help identify people at highest risk of
particular diseases, so monitoring efforts can focus on them.
</P>
<P>
   A disorder of iron metabolism is likely to become the model for
such screening. The condition, hemachromatosis, affects one in 300
people and in the early stages often goes undetected, which is
unfortunate because simple treatments, like periodic blood-letting
to remove excess iron, can prevent complications like cirrhosis. By
2010, studies will have found the most effective combination of
biochemical and genetic tests to detect people who are susceptible.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In cancer, genetic tests will identify those at highest risk for
lung cancer from smoking. Genetic tests for colon cancer will
narrow colonoscopy screening to people who need it most. A genetic
test for prostate cancer could lead to more precise use of the
prostate specific antigen, or PSA, test by identifying those men in
whom the cancer is most likely to progress fastest. Additional
genetic tests would guide treatment of breast and ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four genetic tests will help predict an individual's
risk for developing coronary artery disease, thus helping to
determine when to start drugs and other measures to reduce need for
bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tests predicting a high risk for diabetes should help encourage
susceptible individuals to exercise and control their weight. Those
at higher risk might start taking drugs before they develop
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have a partial insight into the genetics of
osteoporosis. With further research, Collins said, ``you could
imagine combining that kind of a test with a decision to start
calcium and vitamin D therapy early on to try to prevent bone loss
before it is clinically apparent, although we don't yet have
evidence'' that such therapy will benefit individuals at high risk
for osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Tests to detect many potential problems will be performed before
birth, or even as part of in vitro fertilization before an embryo
is implanted in the womb. These tests will raise troubling issues:
The technology is prone to error, and at least initially, the tests
will be hard to get and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   As the accuracy improves and costs drop, many will demand the
tests to reduce the chances of bearing a child who is at risk of
developing conditions that are not actually debilitating, but just
``undesirable.'' If so, there will be debates about the morality.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of information about the new genetics will create
a huge problem in health education. ``Most physicians in practice
have had not a single hour of education in genetics and are going
to be severely challenged to pick up this new technology and run
with it,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 medical and nursing societies representing
virtually every specialty have formed a coalition to develop an
educational program combining the Internet and traditional courses.
``They all recognize this train is coming,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, doctors will rely on individual genetic variations in
prescribing new and old drugs and choosing the dose. Pharmaceutical
companies will take a second look at some drugs that were never
marketed, or were taken off the market, because some people who
took them suffered adverse reactions. It will take many years to
develop such drugs and tests.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer doctors will use drugs that precisely target a tumor's
molecular fingerprint. One such gene-based designer drug,
Herceptin, is already marketed for treating advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project holds promise for the mental health field.
``One of the greatest benefits of genomic medicine will be to
unravel some biological contributions to major mental illnesses
like schizophrenia and manic depressive disease'' and produce new
therapies, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   BY 2030, death will still be inevitable, but clinical trials
relying on information from the genome will be under way to extend
human life spans. Human genes like those involved in the aging of
flies, worms and mice will be identified and fully catalogud.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists working with the genome will develop full computer
models of human cells and analyze all human genes, proteins and
their interactions. As a result, many experiments now done with
laboratory animals or even human subjects will be completed
entirely on computers. Collins said that if he were now a graduate
student, he would join this field.
</P>
<P>
   Groups opposed to technology will be alarmed by these
developments and will act to halt them. ``We have to be prepared
for that,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2040, gene therapy and gene-based drugs will be available for
most diseases. Using information derived from the genes for aging,
the average human life span will reach 90 in the year when Collins
would reach that age.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael J. Egan, a Southwest Airlines captain, calls himself a
``couch potato kind of investor'' who over the years has been able
to build a nest egg worth more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 53-year-old is ready to get off the couch and try his
hand at picking from among thousands of stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds in part of his 401(k). For the first time next week, his
employer-sponsored plan is offering a so-called self-directed
brokerage account, giving him virtually unlimited choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does give me a little bit more flexibility to `play' with
my money, for lack of a better word,'' said Egan, who will still
keep most of his 401(k) money in the dozen or so core mutual funds
his plan currently offers. ``A little more risk wouldn't bother me
for a greater return.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest trend in 401(k)s, a small but growing percentage
of plans are giving participants the chance to invest their
retirement money in almost anything, through their own brokerage
accounts. A natural extension of the ever-expanding options
available to investors, 401(k) brokerage accounts _ and related IRA
brokerage accounts _ tap into the growing public interest in the
stock market and all things relating to investing.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone favors giving employees more responsibility for
their 401(k) investments. With more choice comes some potential
pitfalls: The risk of day-trading away your retirement money or
otherwise making bad investments, and the paralysis of having too
many options.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a big unknown in this expanding area. Who's liable
if plan participants lose money or invest in something that's
inappropriate for their retirement savings? Some pension rights
advocates criticize this latest 401(k) trend as a dangerous option
for most people.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and others see things differently.
``The next logical progression in the empowerment of participants
is to give them broader choice through self-directed brokerage,''
said Walter W. Bettinger II, chief operating officer and senior
vice president for Schwab, which has seen its 401(k) brokerage
option business grow dramatically in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's Personal Choice Retirement Account is the 401(k)
brokerage option that Egan and other participants in the Southwest
Airlines Pilots' Retirement Savings Plan will have access to
beginning next week. PeopleSoft, Pacific Investment Management Co.,
Morningstar Inc., and Excite(at)Home are among some of the other
companies offering Schwab's PCRA to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, the proportion of 401(k) plans
offering a brokerage option has grown from less than 1 percent to
between 5 and 11 percent, according to data from consultants Hewitt
Associates and Spectrem Group, brokerage firms including Fidelity
Investments and Schwab, and the nonprofit Profit Sharing/401(k)
Council of America.
</P>
<P>
   But pension rights advocates see brokerage plans as another
example of the erosion of the traditional company pension, which
features a defined benefit backed by federal guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of studies show people think they know a lot more about
investing than they actually do,'' said Karen Friedman, director of
the Pension Fairness Project at the Pension Rights Center, a
consumer rights group based in Washington. ``If you lose your
retirement money because of a bad investment or the market goes
down, the individual is on the hook. Who are they going to sue?
Where's the protection?''
</P>
<P>
   Because this expansion of what is also known as a brokerage
window is so recent, ``no cases have come down on this yet,'' said
John Hotz, deputy director of the Pension Rights Center. ``The real
issue with a brokerage window is where does fiduciary
responsibility begin and, more importantly, where does it end?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in providing 401(k) participants with as much
information as possible, said Drew Lawton, executive vice president
for investment services for Fidelity, which has seen its 401(k)
brokerage option business grow dramatically over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was more case law in place, then people would have
more of a handle,'' said Lawton. ``It's an open question at this
point. We're all a little bit up in the air as to what could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to do what's in their own best interest for
retirement,'' he added. ``If self-directed brokerage doesn't bring
enhanced return over time, then plan participants themselves will
question if they're doing the right thing. We really have to focus
on education, to make people aware of the opportunities and the
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from providing education, employers and other plan
sponsors may seek to put in such safeguards as a ban on risky
investments such as derivatives, a limit on the portion of a
participant's 401(k) that can be transferred out of core mutual
funds and into a brokerage account, and additional fees for the
brokerage option.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Airlines brokerage option, for instance, will
allow participants to transfer only 25 percent of their 401(k) out
of core mutual funds and into the Schwab account, said Richard
Doherty, director of member benefits for the Southwest Airlines
Pilots' Association, which administers the employer-sponsored plan.
Trades within the 401(k) brokerage account will follow Schwab's
standard fee schedule. While there is no limit on trades, ``If I
see somebody excessively trading, I'll make them aware of what
they're doing,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) brokerage window at Fidelity also follows the
standard fee schedule for trades, but employers may opt to charge
participants $50 to $100 for making use of the option, according to
Fidelity's Lawton.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 1, 2001, Massachusetts will be offering a brokerage
window for the first time in its Section 457 deferred compensation
plan for government employees. But details about which brokerage
firm, fees, and account limits have not yet been worked out,
according to Dwight Robson, spokesman for state treasurer Shannon
P. O'Brien's office.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage Individual Retirement Account works in a similar
fashion, with standard fees for trades usually applying but without
an employer or other sponsoring organization to put safeguards in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The forces driving the increase in 401(k) brokerage accounts _
increased investor sophistication, demand for more choice, and
growing interest in the stock market _ also appear to be affecting
the IRA brokerage business, if Fidelity's experience is an
indication. Robert Corcoran, Fidelity's vice president of
retirement product development, said that for the first time, as of
the first five months of 2000, there's a 50/50 split in where new
IRA money flows _ with half going into individual stocks and half
into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, most new IRA money has gone into mutual funds, not
stocks, Corcoran said. Last year, it was a 60/40 split, with 60
percent into mutual funds and 40 percent into stocks. And in 1998,
it was an 80/20 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen sort of an interesting phenomenon develop, really,
over the last two years,'' Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   But using a brokerage account for retirement money may not be
what everyone wants, or needs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a private nonprofit group based in Washington, said EBRI
has long offered a 401(k) brokerage window to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the current 25 or so employees, and those who have left
over the years, ``It's probably a total of 50 employees who had the
option of using the brokerage window. In all those years, only one
person chose to do it,'' said Salisbury. ``It's just not what
individuals are interested in spending their time doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian FitzSimons, chairman of the retirement plan committee for
the law firm Arter &AMP; Hadden LLP and managing partner of the
Cleveland office, advises against the brokerage option, even though
the firm was one of the first to sign up with Schwab's PCRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really discourage our staff and everybody from doing that.
If you really think you're that good at this game, change jobs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, out of 1,144 total participants in the firm's
401(k) plan as of March 31, 2000, only 37, or 3 percent, have the
brokerage account. And out of the $94 million in total plan assets
as of that date, only $3.9 million, or 4 percent, was in the
brokerage option, according to FitzSimons.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, ``I do have some people who think they are
God's gift to investment.''
</P>
<P>
   While FitzSimons doesn't put himself in that category, he
recently opened up his own 401(k) brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's 53, FitzSimons is using the account to reduce his
exposure, taking some money out of stock mutual funds in the
401(k)'s core menu and putting it into individual bonds to hold to
maturity. He said he didn't want to use the bond mutual fund in the
core selection because of the interest-rate risk that could affect
the fund's value.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, the Southwest Airlines captain who lives west of Boston,
said he's generally a buy-and-hold, moderately aggressive investor
who has been happy with the performance of his 401(k) through the
core mutual funds. Much of his nest egg comes from his Southwest
profit-sharing plan he has been in for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there's ``nothing like having control of your own
money.'' He may use the 401(k) brokerage account to buy some
beat-up stocks he's been interested in, such as Disney, Coca-Cola,
or Boeing. ``They're things that I know about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egan knows his limits, as he jokes: ``How do you make a
pilot a millionaire? Give him a billion dollars.''

MOST MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE AFFECTED BY MORE THAN ONE GENE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Va., Costa Rica, Britain)  (With main bar, SCI-GENOME; see SCIENCE-TIMES-BUDGET for a complete
description of sidebar stories and graphics.) 
 (The Science Times)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   On Feb. 26, 1987, a group of
scientists made a thrilling announcement: They had succeeded in
locating a gene for manic depression in a large Amish family in
Lancaster, Pa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The researchers' finding, published in the journal Nature, made
headlines around the world, hailed as the ``first proof'' of a
specific genetic mutation underlying psychiatric illness. Mental
health experts predicted that the discovery would revolutionize the
diagnosis and treatment of severe mental disorders. Many patients
and their families felt a new sense of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, however, the scientists were forced to concede
that the rejoicing had been premature. They had pinpointed the
gene's probable location near the tip of the short arm of
Chromosome 11, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the
human genetic library. But a re-analysis of the data, including new
evidence from several family members who had since fallen ill, cast
serious doubt on the results, making it highly unlikely that a gene
was on Chromosome 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sort of back to square one,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kidd, a
co-author of the original Nature report, when the re-analysis was
published.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade has now passed since the Amish study. But
scientists still have not succeeded in finding a gene for manic
depression or schizophrenia or, for that matter, any common
psychiatric disorder except Alzheimer's, though no one doubts that
heredity plays a strong role in severe mental illnesses. By and
large, the same hopes and frustrations have accompanied the search
for genetic causes of physical ailments as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is not for lack of trying. Within a year of the Amish study's
publication, for example, two other teams announced equally
promising discoveries: a strong link for schizophrenia on
Chromosome 5, and one for manic depression on the X chromosome. But
neither finding held up.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, scientists studying mental illness in
the United States and other countries have published suggestive _
though not conclusive _ results implicating many different
chromosomes. Most recently, investigators at Rutgers University and
the University of Toronto reported, in the journal Science, a
strong link to schizophrenia on Chromosome 1, while a Scottish
research team also announced a schizophrenia link on Chromosome 1 _
in a different region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet schooled by experience, geneticists no longer expect to
discover a single, powerful gene for schizophrenia, manic
depression or other disorders. Instead, most now agree that such
illnesses are most likely ``oligogenic,'' mediated not by a single
gene, but by multiple genes of smaller effect acting in combination
with one another and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And in hindsight, the Amish study seems less a fluke than an
early object lesson in the barriers to uncovering the genetic
underpinnings of such complex illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are turning out to be very difficult diseases,'' said
Dr. Neil Risch, professor of genetics and statistics at Stanford
University. ``The original approach in psychiatry was to find one
gene that by itself can cause the disease and we will understand
more about it. What we've learned in the last 15 years is that the
likelihood of the existence of such single genes is very small.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the search for a gene for schizophrenia or manic
depression, geneticists say, is no more challenging than efforts to
decipher the genetics of other complex illnesses like diabetes,
hypertension, ulcers or multiple sclerosis, which also involve an
interplay among multiple genes and environmental influence.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers still argue, for example, over how tightly to define
many psychiatric disorders for the purposes of genetic studies,
debating, for instance, whether to include patients with less
severe symptoms. But similar debates can be found among scientists
studying hypertension. And investigators in other areas have had
their share of false starts and unreproducible findings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the challenges offered by psychiatric disorders are in some
ways unique. While the presence of diabetes can be determined with
blood tests, scientists have yet to find reliable biological
markers for schizophrenia or manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   For some mental illnesses, there remains significant
disagreement about how big a role heredity plays. Dr. Steven
Moldin, chief of the genetics research branch at the National
Institute of Mental Health, for example, said that 100 psychiatric
researchers gathered in a room would all probably agree that
schizophrenia has a strong genetic basis: A long line of studies of
inheritance patterns indicates that heredity accounts for about
half of disease risk, with still unknown environmental factors
adding the other half.
</P>
<P>
   The case for genetic influence in manic depression and autism,
Moldin said, is similarly strong.
</P>
<P>
   But move on to other illnesses like obsessive compulsive
disorder, eating disorders, phobias, alcoholism and some forms of
depression, and the same 100 researchers, he said, would be broken
into camps, some arguing that genes play a major part, others that
evidence for genetic susceptibility is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have sufficient data in hand to know the
magnitude of the genetic effects in those diseases,'' Moldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, success in finding a gene linked to any mental
disorder would have a great impact. In the ideal case, for
instance, it might lead to the development of new drugs. That
potential, said Dr. Kenneth Kendler, the Banks distinguished
professor of psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University, ``has
not been lost on all the major pharmaceutical companies,''
especially in an era when psychiatric medications are fixtures on
the drug industry's best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   A gene shown to be associated with many cases of schizophrenia
or manic depression might also reduce stigma, aid in diagnosis, or
be used as a screening tool, an application bound to be
controversial, said Kendler, who with colleagues has reported
linkage findings for schizophrenia on Chromosomes 5, 6, 8 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are less optimistic possibilities, as well. A gene, if
found, could turn out to be associated with only a tiny percentage
of cases of an illness. Or the gene could be involved in a way that
affords no new avenues for treatment. Because heredity only sets
the stage for manic depression and schizophrenia, while environment
opens the curtain, identification of even a central gene will
provide limited answers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for all complex illnesses, whether in psychiatry or
other medical fields, the challenge remains the same: How can
scientists isolate the influence of each of a number of minor genes
acting together?  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Risch, of Stanford, and others argue that the hunt for such
genes may have been limited by the methods scientists have had at
their disposal. The most popular technique for investigating
disease genetics over the last two decades has been an approach
called linkage analysis, which involves looking at the relationship
between inheritance patterns and genetic markers on chromosomes in
families affected by an illness.
</P>
<P>
   Linkage studies have proved enormously proficient in locating
genes for conditions like Huntington's and cystic fibrosis, where
there is a one-to-one relationship between a mutation in a single
gene and the development of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In such illnesses, the gene responsible sends out a strong
signal, the mode of inheritance following the orderly laws of
Gregor Mendel, the Bohemian monk who started modern genetics with
his experiments on garden peas. Typically, each successive linkage
study of a single gene illness offers more conclusive results,
until the gene's location becomes clear. The cloning of the
Huntington's gene, for example, was one in a rapid series of such
discoveries for a variety of Mendelian illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Risch and others argue that linkage is more problematic in
complex diseases, where each of multiple genes exerts a small
effect, sending out a weaker signal that may be much harder to
detect, particularly without huge numbers of research subjects.
Under these circumstances, adding more subjects to an analysis
sometimes wipes out the finding, as happened in the Amish study. As
a result, it is anyone's guess how to interpret the combined
findings of psychiatric linkage studies. Are there, for example,
genes on each of the at least 10 different chromosomes identified
in schizophrenia studies since 1987 Or are many findings false
positives, artifacts of a limited number of subjects, problems in
diagnosis, or other methodological complexities?
</P>
<P>
   The last decade of research, said Dr. T. Conrad Gilliam,
co-director of the Columbia Genome Center at Columbia University,
``has been a great mental exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in terms of what it's actually delivered, we may look back
15 years from now and say, `Not a lot!' or we may look back and
say: `You know those little blips everyone obsessed about? Those
were the signals,''' he said. ``The jury is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can allow themselves to hope that 15 years will make
a difference in large part because of the sequencing of the human
genome and the advances in technology that have accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything where you have a complex reality,'' said
Dr. Nelson Freimar, director of the center for neurobehavioral
genetics at the University of California at Los Angeles, who
studies manic depression in large Costa Rican families. ``The more
windows you can look in, the better your approximation of that
reality will be.''
</P>
<P>
   With the genome in hand, researchers will for the first time be
able to analyze groups of genes working together, looking at how
they might be altered in schizophrenia, manic depression or other
disorders. Scientists conducting genetic studies will also have a
clearer idea of exactly which genes are in the region they are
studying. When sometime in the future, a detailed map of the
variations in human DNA _ individual point mutations, called single
nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, in the chain of nucleotides that
forms a strand of DNA _becomes available, investigators will be
able to directly compare specific chromosomal variations in people
affected by an illness and in healthy subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, knowing where each gene lies, and ultimately what
it does, will offer new possibilities to scientists trying to study
genetic influence by breaking down mental illnesses into their
biological components. Suggestive brain imaging findings _ shifts
in transmission patterns of messenger chemicals, for example _
could be linked to genes, on the one hand, and to the overt
symptoms of patients on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the genome carries no guarantees. Genetic researchers
may dream of finding a gene and boarding the plane for Stockholm to
collect a Nobel Prize. But in their worst nightmares, they discover
that the genes contributing to mental illness are so manifold, so
tiny in their effects and so complex in their interplay that
identifying them is a hopeless task.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, most scientists learn to ignore such nighttime
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ann Pulver, an associate professor of psychiatry at Johns
Hopkins University who has been studying the genetics of
schizophrenia for 20 years, said she entered the field with no
expectation that it offer a quick trip to glory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Pulver reported a linkage for schizophrenia on
Chromosome 13 in a 15-year study of 100 families of Ashkenazic
Jewish extraction. She said she believes there is ``a confluence of
evidence'' for schizophrenia links on Chromosomes 6, 8, 13 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she has watched too many scientists make big claims, only to
have attempts to replicate their findings fail, she said. And her
own approach is to take a longer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in what I'm doing,'' Pulver said. ``But I
also know that I'm probably in my lifetime not going to see the
real impact of my work.''

 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The genesis and history of the genome project has been
intertwined to a remarkable degree with the career of one man, Dr.
James Watson.
</P>
<P>
   With Dr. Francis Crick, Watson discovered the structure of DNA
in 1953, and later helped launch the human genome project which,
just less than 50 years later, is coming to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would only once have the opportunity to let my scientific
career encompass a path from the double helix to the three billion
steps of the human genome,'' Watson wrote in explaining his
decision to become the first director of the human genome project
office at the National Institutes of Health in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome project may be the gateway to the biology and
medicine of the 21st century, but it was at first bitterly opposed
by many academic biologists.
</P>
<P>
   They believed that the interesting genes would come to light one
by one in the course of the research they were already doing, and
that a federal project to decode the whole genome would siphon
money from their own budgets, financed mostly by the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious proposals for decoding the human genome,
according to Robert Cook-Deegan in ``Gene Wars'' (W.W. Norton &AMP;
Co., 1994), a history of the genome project's early days, were made
in 1985 by biologists like Dr. Robert Sinsheimer of the University
of California at Santa Cruz and Dr. Walter Gilbert of Harvard. It
was the Department of Energy that first picked up their ideas in
1987, with the rationale that its nuclear radiation experts needed
to know whether the genome could be protected from mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Academic biologists continued to scorn the project. Biology, in
their view, was a science based on clear-cut experiments, not on
Big Science-style extravaganzas that vacuumed up data just for the
sake it.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's former mentor, Dr. Salvador Luria, wrote in a 1989
letter to Science that the genome program ``has been promoted
without public discussion by a small coterie of power-seeking
enthusiasts.''
</P>
<P>
   With senior biologists lukewarm or hostile to the program,
Watson was one of the few leaders with the stature to quell
opposition and guarantee that the project would be scientifically
rigorous. Then director and now president of the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, he also helped persuade Congress to give
the National Institutes of Health the money to start its own genome
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these efforts, Watson emerged as the obvious
candidate to lead the human genome project, and was appointed as
the first director of the agency's human genome program, a post he
held from 1988 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s the longest piece of DNA that had been decoded
was a few thousand units long. The DNA molecules in human
chromosomes range from 40 million to 250 million units in length,
presenting a different scale of difficulty. The task was daunting
but not insuperable if the chromosomes could be broken down into
smaller pieces for decoding and assembled through some kind of
chromosome map that would show how the pieces fit together.
</P>
<P>
   Watson laid out the elements of what has been the public
consortium's strategy ever since. He decreed that the project would
be conducted at several universities, not by some central
administration, a move that allowed different initial approaches to
be tried. It had the advantage of spreading out the money, winning
political support.
</P>
<P>
   Watson sought out international partners, particularly in
Britain, where the roundworm genome project had already begun, and
vigorously campaigned for Germany and Japan to join the project.
``It wouldn't be good if the Americans owned the genome,'' he said
in an interview last month. As a result of his efforts, the
consortium now includes laboratories in Britain, France, Germany,
China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Another stamp of his stewardship is the program of ethical and
legal studies about the genome, which at first took up 3 percent
and now 5 percent of the NIH's genome project budget. Watson, long
concerned that biology should dissociate itself from the stain of
the eugenic movement, announced the program as one of his first
official acts.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually accurate piece of technological forecasting,
Watson estimated the overall cost would be $3 billion and that the
project could be completed in 15 years from its official starting
date of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The cost estimate assumed that methods of sequencing DNA would
get rapidly cheaper as technology improved. In fact the cost has
fallen from $10 per unit of DNA at the project's start to 4 cents a
unit now.
</P>
<P>
   In laying the basis for the enormous task of sequencing the
human genome, Watson's consortium eventually brought into being a
powerful competitor, the Celera Corp. The concept of Celera grew
from a surprising source, a company then known as Applied
Biosystems, which made the principal brand of DNA sequencing
machine used by the consortium's centers.
</P>
<P>
   In devising a new generation of the machines, the company's
president, Michael Hunkapiller, calculated it should be possible
for a single, industrial-scale center to start from scratch and
decode the human genome before the consortium did so.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller's idea required getting into competition with his
own customers. But it also meant doubling the market for his
sequencing machines and their chemical reagents. To direct the
project, he signed up Dr. J. Craig Venter, whose maverick
sequencing ideas regularly earned the disapproval of the academic
establishment yet often proved to work. The venture was backed by
Tony White, president of the then Perkin Elmer Corp., who quickly
shed the company's old-time instrument-making plants and committed
it, as the PE Corp., to the brave but untested new world of
genomics.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Celera was begun in May 1998, with Venter declaring he would
complete the genome by 2001. This was a bombshell to the public
consortium, where Watson had been replaced by Francis Collins, and
the Wellcome Trust of London, a powerful new medical charity that
had become an important player by financing the Sanger Center in
England to decode one-third of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, several of the consortium's leading experts on DNA
sequencing pronounced that Venter's proposed fast method for
decoding the human genome would not work. But Collins decided that
the Celera challenge could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   He advanced the consortium's target finishing date to 2003 from
2005. He also committed the consortium to producing a rough draft
of the genome by June 2000. The draft would focus on the gene-rich
regions of the genome (only 3 percent of human DNA codes for genes)
and would make the most useful part of the genome available to gene
hunters much earlier than otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the consortium's two leading production
centers, those of Dr. Robert Waterston at Washington University in
St. Louis and Dr. John Sulston at the Sanger Center, reached an
important milestone by completing their pilot project on the
roundworm genome, the first animal genome to be decoded.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later it became clear that the consortium's major
centers had ironed out their problems with the human genome and
were producing large amounts of DNA sequence on schedule, giving
the lie to Venter's mockery of their projections as those of a
``Liars' Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterston and Sulston had predicted in October 1998 that Celera
would decode a lot of DNA fragments but would stumble in its plan
to piece the fragments together. ``Assembly would likely be
woefully inadequate,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, Celera published the results of its first
project, the decoding of the Drosophila fruit fly's genome. The
fruit fly genome showed that Celera probably could assemble the
human genome with its quick method, and sharply raised the level of
tension between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   A neck-and-neck race has ensued to see whether the consortium
could announce completion of its draft genome before Celera could
declare that it had finished its final genome assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Though consortium scientists routinely deplore the attention
given to the race, the competition has benefited the world's
biologists. Without Celera's challenge, the consortium would have
had little reason to alter its academic flight path and produce the
useful part of the genome three years ahead of the 2003 landing
date. Without the consortium's challenge, Celera could be
commanding top dollar for its database, knowing customers had no
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have adopted different strategies for sequencing
the genome and have produced results that are quite complementary,
meaning that there was always a underlying logic to combining their
efforts. But for many months of rivalry, no peacemaker succeeded in
bringing the two sides together.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, whose book ``The Double Helix'' famously described the
passions of a scientific race, remained a committed supporter of
the public program he had shaped.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium had succeeded, he said in an interview last
month, ``because people liked and respected each other, and because
the consortium wasn't out for personal glory.'' He also gave credit
to Dr. Leroy Hood and Dr. Lloyd Smith, both then at the California
Institute of Technology, who in the early 1980s pioneered the first
DNA sequencing machines.
</P>
<P>
   These slow early models reached their zenith in the latest
generation of machines known as capillary sequencers, like PE
Biosystems' Prism 3700, the machine that launched Celera, and
Amersham Pharmacia's excellent though less widely used Megabace. If
the human genome project were allowed a robotic hero, it would be
the Prism 3700.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last month have the two sides moved nearer as Venter
and Collins saw mutual advantage in at least making a joint
announcement of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Through prodigious efforts and expert management, both sides
have achieved remarkable success with their chosen approaches.
Celera's whole genome shotgun approach has proved faster, but both
with its fruit fly and the human genome, Celera has made use of
data obtained by the consortium's clone-by-clone approach. The best
way of sequencing a genome may be to use both methods. If Celera's
version of the human genome proves as good as its fruit fly genome,
scientists may judge it to have chosen the better path.
Nonetheless, both sides can fairly claim credit for the final
result.
</P>
<P>
   That biology has progressed from near total ignorance of the
hereditary material to possession of the entire human genome within
50 years is testament to a hectic pace of discovery. Even more
remarkable is that a single individual, James Watson, should have
played such a signal role in both the opening of the drama and in
its conclusion.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The legendary Honus Wagner tobacco card soon
will be on the auction block again, and this time, there is
speculation it may become the first baseball card to top $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The hype certainly is pointing in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edward Auctions, which is part of the hobby megacompany
MastroNet Inc., and the Internet auction house eBay held a news
conference in New York City to announce the sale of the T206
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, Robert Edward and MastroNet have entered into a
high-stakes partnership on the card, which will be auctioned on
eBay from July 1-15, and on Robert Edward's telephone auction July
15-16.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, known as the ``Flying Dutchman,'' played for the
Louisville Colonels from 1897 through 1899 and for the Pittsburgh
Pirates from 1900 through 1917. He is considered one of the game's
greatest shortstops and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame
in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just any old Wagner card, but the one that has
traveled around the hobby world a good bit, once winding up in the
hands of hockey great Wayne Gretzky and his then-partner, Bruce
McNall, who was owner of the Los Angeles Kings at the time. They
paid $451,000 for it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Wal-Mart bought the Wagner for a reported $500,000-plus
from Gretzky, after McNall wound up in financial and legal trouble.
Wal-Mart made it the top prize in a national contest, but the
winner, a postal worker, soon had to put it up for auction after
she realized what she would have to pay in taxes on the prize.
</P>
<P>
   That brought the card to high-rolling collector Michael Gidwitz,
who dropped $640,5000 _ a still-standing record _ on the card in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gidwitz, a Chicago investment adviser, will say goodbye to
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't own everything forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-told (and perhaps true) story behind the card is that
Wagner objected to his image being used to help sell cigarettes
back in 1910 and demanded that he be removed from the T206 set.
</P>
<P>
   So, few were printed, and there are estimated to be only about
50 of the Wagner cards still in existence, and this one is a
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if it doesn't bring more than $1 million,''
said Rob Lifson of Robert Edward Auctions. ``This is the only
celebrity baseball card, so that seems reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding will start at a cool $500,000, and move up in increments
of $50,000.

   New York autograph dealer Les Wolff has several recommendations
for anyone thinking of starting a vintage autograph collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, collectors should find something they like
and collect it,'' he said. ``But if you love baseball, I would
start out by collecting signed yellow Hall of Fame plaque cards.
They have the potential to go up in value tremendously, and while
you're collecting them, you can learn the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Wolff tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``New collectors should try to get Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig
autographs now. I've never seen their autographs go down in price.
It's like setting up a portfolio in gold. Everything Ruth and
Gehrig is gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A rough estimate is that 75 percent of memorabilia collectors
don't have their collections insured. It's so important to have
insurance. I've heard a lot of horror stories about people who
didn't.''

 WHAT WAS THE GARY GRAHAM CIRCUS ABOUT? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, after all the propaganda and all the protests and all
the posturing by Gary Graham and his partisans, Graham got what he
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Having avoided execution for 19 years with an endless stream of
groundless appeals, Graham managed to delay justice another two
hours and 49 minutes Thursday as his lawyers launched a last,
desperate round of court filings. In the end, though, the cause of
law and order prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that the courts Graham hoped would rescue him from the
death chamber were looking for facts rather than celebrity
testimonials. And so the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court,
ignored his phony pleas of innocence and said sorry, pal, your time
is up.
</P>
<P>
   Graham used his final moments to deliver a farewell address that
on-the-scene observers described as ``rambling,'' among other
things. He depicted himself as a martyr and called the state of
Texas a murderer for carrying out the lawful sentence of death
imposed on him by a jury of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hollywood bleeding hearts such as Danny Glover, jet-set
dilettantes such as Bianca Jagger and
never-miss-a-chance-to-get-on-television charlatans such as Jesse
Jackson, the Gary Graham fan club bemoaned their hero's impending
doom right up until the state's lethal needle worked its magic by
silencing this brutal and vociferous sociopath who enlisted the
elite brigades of the anti-capital-punishment movement in a
relentless campaign to evade his rightful fate.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, but in mindless defiance of fact and
logic, the bleeding hearts chose to believe Graham's baseless claim
that he was railroaded by the legal system _ rather than accepting
the rock-solid eyewitness testimony of Bernadine Skillern, who
watched Graham gun down 53-year-old Bobby Lambert in a Houston
parking lot in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's naive _ or were they cynical? _ supporters parroted the
phrase ``innocent man'' so often that it began to sound like part
of his name. If he hadn't spent half his life on Death Row, perhaps
he could have been a pro wrestler or boxer: Gary ``The Innocent
Man'' Graham.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but wonder what sort of ethical or moral standard
would cause someone to embrace a vicious animal like Graham. The
murder of Lambert, after all, was but the opening act in a weeklong
horror show that saw Graham callously rob, rape and shoot
unfortunate citizens as if they were images in a violent video
game.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you think that even the most passionate opponents of
capital punishment would occasionally stumble upon a criminal so
vile that they would be unwilling to occupy a seat on his
bandwagon?
</P>
<P>
   But then, all this weeping and gnashing over the plight of Gary
Graham didn't have all that much to do with Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Law professor, attorney and world's foremost legal know-it-all
Alan Dershowitz spilled the beans on ``Larry King Live'' shortly
after Graham was executed. Larry asked Dershowitz if he was sad
about Graham's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have no sadness for this man Graham,'' Dershowitz
replied. ``He deserves everything he gets. This is not about
Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz said it's about the Texas justice system:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas justice is the best we can do, that's the strongest
argument for abolishing the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now we're getting somewhere. It's not about Graham, and it's
not really about Texas justice. It's about abolishing the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-capital-punishment agitators may be worried about
executing people for crimes they didn't commit, but they are
equally worried about executing people for crimes they did commit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, judging from the nonsense we heard during the Graham
fiasco, the bleeding hearts don't want to punish anybody for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   We can't convict a defendant on the basis of eyewitness
testimony. We can't convict a defendant who doesn't have Perry
Mason heading up his legal team. We can convict a defendant on the
basis of DNA evidence _ unless, of course, the defendant has a
brilliant lawyer who discredits the DNA testing process.
</P>
<P>
   And every Gary Graham who comes down the pike will have such a
lawyer, if the bleeding hearts get their way.

   When Graham's supporters claim that he had inadequate legal
representation, what they're really saying is that his attorney
wasn't clever enough to conjure up a jury-fooling illusion of
reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz and others want ``indigent'' suspects to have the
best legal representation that money can buy _ which means that
they want the taxpayers to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   They want society to hire cream-of-the-crop lawyers to help
vicious thugs beat the rap for their crimes against society.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Gary Graham hoopla isn't about Graham _ not just about
Graham, anyway. It's about making America safer for the bad guys.

   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ In a watershed in the history of
science, two rival groups of researchers said Monday that they had
deciphered the genome, the set of genetic instructions that defines
the human organism. ``Today we are learning the language in which
God created life,'' President Clinton said at a White House
ceremony attended by members of the two teams. The two leaders of
the teams, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera, and Dr.
Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, praised each other's contributions and signaled a spirit
of cooperation, even though the two efforts will remain firmly
independent. And both sought to capture the wider meaning of their
work, the eye-glazing stream of letters representing the four bases
in the genome's chemical code. ``We have caught the first glimpses
of our instruction book, previously known only to God,'' said
Collins. Venter spoke of his conviction, from seeing people die as
a medical corpsman in Vietnam, that the human spirit transcended
the physiology that is controlled by the genome. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-GENOME-ASSESS (Undated) _ The human genome, the sum of all
genetic material encased in nearly every cell of the human body, is
very, very long _ at least 3 billion chemical letters long, as many
letters as you'd find in 9,000 copies of the entire Sunday New York
Times. The human genome is pithy. The English alphabet has 26
letters, the Russian 33 letters, and Japanese 1,850 symbols. Yet
with just four distinct characters at its disposal, four nucleic
acid bases, the human genome has given rise to the creators of
every language uttered, every ballad sung, every Pokemon card
traded. The human genome is a pigsty, bulging with non-genes,
ex-genes, freeloader genes, viral detritus, pocket lint and chewing
gum. All but a few percent of it appears to be doing nothing at
all. The human genome is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. Millions of times a year, egg genome meets sperm
genome, and the result is a human baby, its parts all in place, its
brain a universe of love and meaning. In short, the human genome
exults in contradictions. By Natalie Angier.

   BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ President Clinton said Monday that
the federal budget surplus over the next decade will be nearly $1.3
trillion higher than previously projected, putting a breathtaking
sum of new money on the table as the two parties and their
presidential candidates battle over tax cuts, spending and how to
prepare for the nation's long-term challenges. By Richard W.

<P>
   SCOTUS-MIRANDA (Washington) _ The Supreme Court reaffirmed the
Miranda decision Monday by a 7-2 vote, ruling that because the 1966
landmark ``announced a constitutional rule,'' a statute by which
Congress sought to overrule the decision was itself
unconstitutional. With a majority opinion by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the decision removed a growing shadow over the Miranda
ruling, cast by a combination of a long-ignored law by which
Congress had tried to overrule it 32 years ago as well as the
current court's perceived hostility to the original decision. The
chief justice said that the 1968 law, which replaced the famous
Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of whether a confession
was voluntary, could be upheld only if the Supreme Court itself
decided to overturn Miranda. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-PRIMARY (Washington) _ The Supreme Court invalidated
California's blanket primary Monday, calling it a ``stark
repudiation of freedom of political association'' that stripped
political parties of the ability to control their own nominating
process and define their identity. Under the California system, an
extreme version of the more common open primary, all voters,
regardless of their own party membership, get a single ballot from
which they can select among candidates of any party affiliation: a
Republican for governor, for example, and a libertarian for the
state assembly. Alaska and Washington are the only other states
with such a system. The 7-2 decision cast serious doubt on the more
common open primary, in use in more than half the states, in which
any registered voter can request a particular party's primary
ballot. In some states, the cross-over privilege is limited to
independent voters and does not extend to members of a different
party. By Linda Greenhouse.

monitors had inspected a number of its secret arms dumps, and the
pair confirmed the news in visits to Prime Minister Tony Blair in
London and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, here. The
announcement fulfilled a promise made by the IRA in May in response
to demands that it make moves toward dismantling its arsenal in
exchange for Britain's restoring the authority of the new
Catholic-Protestant, power-sharing Northern Ireland government. It
had been suspended in February over earlier IRA inaction on arms.
The IRA also confirmed Monday that it had ended its four-month

Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain, and was actively cooperating
with the panel again. By Warren Hoge.

   FED (Washington) _ After a period of rip-roaring growth that
fueled fears of inflation, the economy is showing enough signs of
slowing that the Federal Reserve will most likely leave interest
rate policy unchanged when it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday,
economists and analysts say. But as it looks ahead, the Fed faces
two big question marks that might lead it to go back to raising
interest rates later in the year. It is not at all clear, Fed
officials say, that the slowdown of the last few months will not
give way to another resurgence in growth and inflation pressures.
In each of the last two years, growth slowed in the spring, only to
come roaring back. And even if the economy is cooling off, the Fed
will have to decide just how cool is cool enough. By Richard W.
Stevenson.

   FIRST-UNION (Undated) _ Veering sharply away from its longtime
strategy of buying up banks and consumer-finance companies, the
First Union Corp. said Monday that it would take a $2.8 billion
charge against its earnings to close the Money Store lending
operation and get out of several other businesses. Most of the
charge will come from shutting the Money Store, which First Union
bought two years ago for $2.1 billion. About 2,350 Money Store
employees will lose their jobs, including as many as 300 in New
Jersey, where the unit was founded. By Patrick McGeehan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Sebastian Junger (pronounced ``younger'') was
hanging from a tree on a hot summer day, looking at the bloody tear
he had just ripped down the back of his leg with his chain saw,
when the idea for his book blossomed. Cutting trees, he mused, was
difficult work, like firefighting, logging or commercial fishing.
Why not a book about those jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, three storm systems collided off the coast of
New England, creating a meteorological debacle so disastrous, and
so improbable, that a weatherman dubbed it a ``perfect storm,'' or
a storm that could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the maelstrom of 100-mph winds and 90-foot waves, a
72-foot swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, Mass., called the
Andrea Gail went down with her crew of six. Junger, then living in
Gloucester, clipped a newspaper article about the missing vessel,
which was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Sebastian Junger, 38, a Belmont, Mass., native, became
chronicler of that 1991 fishing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, what started out as a chapter on fishing had
turned into a whole book, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Suddenly, Junger
was the Sexiest Author in America, and the book was a publishing
marvel being aggressively optioned by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As publishing leaders see it, it was Junger's own willingness to
stump for the book, coupled with his publisher's savvy marketing
strategy, that led to the book's singular success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it didn't hurt that he was very good-looking,'' says
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly. ``These days,
when a publisher looks at an author, obviously, they consider the
manuscript, but they're also looking at the kind of publicity the
author can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher W.W. Norton says it wasn't because of Junger's
appearance or manner. It was because of his obsession with his
subject. Norton is a prestigious publishing house known for
literary quality and a traditional interest in nautical topics.
When Junger approached Norton, he was an unknown. He had never
written a book. He had written only a handful of pieces for such
magazines as Men's Journal and American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And his book proposal had been turned down by a dozen publishers
who did not see how a book could be written about a storm. But
Starling Lawrence, Norton's editor-in-chief, sat down with Junger
in his Manhattan office and liked him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obsessional quality to his interest in the
material that I liked,'' says Lawrence, who gave Junger a $35,000
advance. ``Obsession is always an interesting, maybe essential,
quality in a writer. I personally am not interested in books that
don't have to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Junger's obsession was his nature. He tends to fixate.
But part of it was that he had once had a near-drowning experience
himself while surfing on Cape Cod, and the sensation of water
pressing against his lungs had been seared into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is a combination of reportage and deduction: He
tells a compelling and factual human story of the fishermen's lives
leading up to the departure of the boat, as well as that of others
who survived the fateful storm. But he also plunges deep into
imagination to narrate what might have happened in the Andrea
Gail's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is chock-full of information about such
things as how human beings drown, and waves form, and boats are
built, and hurricanes crest. One of the most riveting sections of
the book describes in unflinching detail the fishermen's probable
final moments as their boat sank, after Capt. Billy Tyne's final
radio transmission: ``She's comin' on boys, and she's comin' on
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's best guess as to what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew of the Andrea Gail either have laryngospasms or
completely inundated lungs. They are suspended, open-eyed and
unconscious, in the flooded enclosures of the boat. The darkness is
absolute and the boat may already be on her way to the bottom. At
this point only a massive amount of oxygen could save these men.
They have suffered, at most, a minute or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this book is so good is we know so much more about
the weather _ all this scientific information. The weather is a
principal character in this book,'' says Peter Davison, former
editor at Houghton Mifflin and currently poetry editor for The
Atlantic Monthly. Junger ``is also willing to go the final mile and
tell how people die. Most people end with a cry _ and the mate was
washed off to starboard and never seen again _ and that kind of
crap. Junger really deals with this. It is a brave book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm,'' published in May, 1997, has sold just
over 2.5 million copies. (It has since been made into a movie, of
the same title, that is due out in July, and features heartthrobs
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post ran glowing reviews,
as did many others. National Public Radio alone did five interviews
with him, and People magazine did three stories, the last of which
dubbed him one of the Sexiest Men Alive (author division). He was
on ``Good Morning America'' twice, CNN three times, and made
appearances on Charlie Rose, ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' Tom Snyder,
CSPAN and Fox News. And then Oprah waved him into a chair along
with several other of People's Sexiest Men Alive. One writer dubbed
the show ``Hunk Writers With Less Substance Than Their Books.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger balked. He did not want to do it. He did not have a suit.
His chain saw needed oiling. People would think he was using the
book, he says, ``to catapult myself into some weird, glamorous fame
world.'' But Norton editor Starling Lawrence presented Oprah to
Junger in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence said, `Look. The amount of book sales we're going to
get from this, the amount of money we're going to get from this, is
huge. And you may not feel like you need the money' _ and I did
feel that way _ `but we're a business, and the more money, the
better for us.' He said, `You know, it will allow us to publish a
lot of guys like you, what we thought you were. And that struck
home. I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Junger had done 134 interviews, most with
the national media, four of them online. He had participated in 46
book events and traveled to 40 locations on tour. And reporters
loved him. ``He's affable and enthusiastic, articulate, charming,
frank, modest but not overmodest, romantic but not hopelessly so.
God, isn't there anything wrong with this guy?'' gushed Britain's
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brave. He's built. He's literate,'' exclaimed New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, love letters and marriage proposals poured into
Norton's office by the fistful. And now the former tree-cutter and
would-be journalist who could barely get his stories published, was
transformed into The Perfect Author.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that Junger did not have a girlfriend in
high school. Now, Junger's life could easily be divided into Before
the Book and After the Book. And not having a girlfriend seemed to
symbolize many of the things he felt he could not have before the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, in fact, started out with a healthy portion of the
conventional ``good things.'' Although he has been lionized in the
media as a kind of wrangler writer, Schwarzenegger with a laptop,
Junger was raised in the prosperous suburb of Belmont, the son of
an artist and a physicist. He attended tony area schools before
graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984 with a degree in
cultural anthropology and, at last, a girlfriend. His book is
dedicated to his father, ``who first introduced me to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the very tameness and predictability of his
suburban youth that drove him to build a lean-to in the woods _ ``I
didn't want to kill things, but I wanted to know that I could if I
wanted to'' _ and to scale 100-foot trees with his chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Junger wandered for several years, trying to launch a writing
career without success. Newspapers turned him down. He wrote some
stories for an alternative paper in Washington, D.C., and for The
Boston Phoenix. He waited tables at the old Casablanca restaurant
in Cambridge, Mass., to pay the bills, then wandered down to New
Orleans and tried his hand at fiction. But after six years, ``the
writing thing was going nowhere. And I wanted it so bad. It was
like trying to get a girlfriend in high school. I was like, `What
is wrong? Why won't this connect?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day in 1989, he sat down at a bar next to a guy
who offered him a job cutting down trees. And things began to
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it immediately,'' says Junger. ``I felt, here I have
something which is exhausting, which makes you incredibly dirty,
and you're doing something very scary and that can kill you. And at
the end of the day, you've won. The tree is a stump. A huge dead
oak over this person's house is a stump. Through a mix of machinery
and brute strength and athletic ability and engineering, you have
brought this thing down. It is a tremendous feeling. I fell in love
with it immediately and actually had a hard time giving it up as I
got more into writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't, altogether. There is the chain saw, after all,
right there on the bare wooden floor of his two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan's East Village. (Junger moved to New York from Cape
Cod midway through writing the book, because, he says, he needed a
change.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of him pressing the saw into a 90-foot tree.
It is tacked to the wall, right next to the picture of Ethel
Shatford, bartender at the Crow's Nest, the Gloucester bar that
anchors ``The Perfect Storm,'' and the mother of one of the men who
died on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Junger became close to Ethel Shatford during the countless hours
he spent talking to fishermen in the Nest. In writing the book, he
wrestled with whether to include details of the men's drowning,
thinking largely of its impact on Ethel. In the end, he did
describe their deaths, and Junger later wrote her a letter
explaining why. ``I didn't want her blindsided,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book came out, he started a fund to help the
children of commercial fishermen, called ``The Perfect Storm''
Foundation, and he remains closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Junger sold the paperback rights to his book for $1.2 million
and made another $500,000 on film rights, although he will not say
how much more he has made on the book.
</P>
<P>
   His third-floor apartment, at a $2,500 monthly rent, counts as
one of the handful of things his new wealth has allowed him. He
bought a sailboat for $4,000. And an 1820s farmhouse in Truro,
Mass. He is also planning on opening a bar in Manhattan in June,
with some friends, that will have a ``journalistic'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Junger's first book has also garnered a host of
writing assignments he could not have dreamed of before. He's
written several pieces for Vanity Fair, one about the forensics
being practiced at the mass graves in Kosovo, another about the
mysterious death of a Greek shipping magnate's son, called
``Addicted to Danger.'' He wrote ``The Lure of Danger: Confessions
of an Adrenaline Junkie'' for Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, he will drive from Brussels to Sierra Leone to
deliver a school van and will write about it for The New Yorker. He
is currently working on a piece for Vanity Fair about Albert
DeSalvo, the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler and who,
once upon a time, did some carpentry for Junger's parents. He has
an idea for a new book but says only that ``it will surprise people
that I did it, but they will understand by the time they are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and fortune that have come his way, however,
many who know him say that he has been little changed by his new
status.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, they say, remains a rogue adventurer who far prefers his
worn jeans and tattered black T-shirt to the pressed shirts he
grudgingly dons for public appearances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome is in hand. The set of instructions embodied in
the ancient chemical deoxyribonucleic acid, at least 3.5 billion
years in the making, has been made fully visible for the first
time. The manual with the specifications for the human species
comes in 24 tapes of DNA, one for every chromosome, each carrying
one long, punctuation-free sentence in evolution's four-letter
programming code. On first inspection, these ancient texts are as
incomprehensible as a message from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, as any message from another world, will surely
change this one when its full meaning is understood.
</P>
<P>
   Although exploration of the genome has begun, it will be decades
before every detail is thoroughly known.
</P>
<P>
   The first practical impacts will be in health. The genome is
widely expected to revolutionize the practice of medicine. Its
sequence is already being mined for the levers of the body's own
communications system, including the signals that direct cells to
repair damaged tissue and fight off invaders. The use of these
signals as drugs may develop into a new mode of therapy, one that
Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, has
termed ``regenerative medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another predicted advance, though not so immediate, is that of
personalized medicine _ treatment and preventive programs that are
tailored to the individual based on a genomic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the genome's writ reaches beyond medicine and will in time
redefine knowledge of ourselves, our history, our innate capacities
and our relationship to the rest of creation. The conditions of
human existence, the reach of human abilities, the purpose of life
_ at least in a biological sense _ have boundaries that are
engraved in the genome's gnomic text.
</P>
<P>
   In defining the human species, the genome assumes distinctive
flourishes in the major ethnic groups that developed as humans
spread throughout the world, and specifies the genetic endowment of
individuals. All individuals, save identical twins, are unique
because their genomes are one of a kind. These underlying
differences, for good and for ill, can now be spelled out for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   For the many who are fascinated by their origins and family
history, the human genome will provide answers. Already a company
called Oxford Ancestors (www.oxfordancestors.com) offers to tell
people which of 30 founding human lineages they belong to, based on
analysis of their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Less beneficial may be the power of genetic differences, even
entirely inconsequential ones, to divide or be cited as the
justification for division and discord. ``Most geneticists wax
euphoric that so many of our genes are in common, that the genome
map will show us to be a happy band of brothers and sisters,'' says
Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, an ethicist at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan fears people ``will use this information to bolster
racial and ethnic prejudices and other exclusivity groupings they
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The genome, once interpreted, is knowledge that will provide the
means to change the human genetic inheritance, usurping control of
human biological destiny from the blind forces of natural selection
and random change that have shaped it up till now.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, it may be possible to correct disease-causing
genes, even design a genome optimized for health and longevity.
Whether to try and improve the human genetic allotment, at the risk
of changing human nature as well, will not be a straightforward
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that knowledge about different alleles will
create the temptation to optimize one's offspring in terms of their
genetic endowment,'' said Dr. Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass., referring to the different forms the
same gene may take in different people.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the genes that may underlie intelligence, for
example, would open ``a whole Pandora's box of possibilities, where
someone like myself is no more qualified than someone with a
minimal understanding of genetics to make ethical and moral
choices,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be a societywide debate,'' he said, ``not one
involving just geneticists or bioethicists.''
</P>
<P>
   ANNOTATING THE GENOME
</P>
<P>
   Biologists face years of preparatory work in understanding the
various levels of the genome's operation.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the genome will transform biology from a cottage
industry, where one gene and protein were studied at a time, to a
far different scale of operation in which all of a cell's genes, or
all its proteins, are examined in parallel.
</P>
<P>
   To generate and analyze the genomic information, a slew of new
disciplines is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   There is bioinformatics, or computational genomics, the art of
writing computer programs to ``annotate'' the genome, which
includes finding and analyzing all its genes. There is proteomics,
a set of methods for examining all of cell's many different
proteins en masse, instead of one by one. There is
pharmacogenomics, the matching of drugs to individuals on the basis
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   With the human genome sequence now in hand, the first task is
annotation, a word borrowed from computer programmers' practice of
writing explanations alongside the major routines in a piece of
software. The genome is biological programming, but evolution has
neglected to provide even the punctuation to show where genes stop
and start, let alone any helpful notes as to what each gene is
meant to do.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of punctuation makes the genes very hard to identify.
Each gene is broken into several separate parts, known as exons,
and the exons are strung out along the ribbon of DNA so sparsely
that they account for only 97 percent of the genome's three billion
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Human cells have no trouble spotting the genes and regularly
make copies of active genes. Biologists have learned how to capture
these copies and analyze fragments of them. By comparing the
sequence of DNA letters in each part of the genome with a library
of these fragments, annotators can pick out many of the exons.
</P>
<P>
   Once a gene has been identified, annotators can often guess what
it does by comparing its sequence of DNA letters with that of genes
whose function is already known. The genomes of many bacteria and
two animals (the roundworm and the fruit fly) have already been
sequenced and annotated, and the roles of many of their genes have
been identified. Because of the unity of evolution, the sequence of
every human gene is recognizably similar to the equivalent gene in
other organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Even more useful for interpreting the human genome will be that
of the mouse, whose genome is now being deciphered by a public
consortium of academic centers and the Celera Genomics Group of
Rockville, Md., the two groups that completed the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The best way of finding the human genes may be simply to lay the
human and mouse genomes side by side and look for places where the
sequence of DNA letters is similar. Biologists expect that the DNA
sequence in the genes will have stayed much the same in the 100
million years since the two species shared a common ancestor but
that the rest of the DNA will be different.
</P>
<P>
   In the organisms whose genomes have been decoded so far, about a
third of the genes are novel, with no matches in the databases. The
mouse will help assign roles to novel human genes too because its
counterpart genes can be deleted to create strains of `knock-out'
mice. Knock-out mice often reveal by their defects the natural
functions of the gene they lack.

<P>
   PROTEINS AND CELLS
</P>
<P>
   The role of most genes is to make specific proteins, which are
the working parts of human cells. Depending on the nature of its
string of subunits, which are specified by its gene, a protein can
serve a structural purpose, like a collagen fiber, or catalyze some
chemical reaction important to the cell's metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many proteins of interest have been studied in great
detail, the annotated genome will provide for the first time a
comprehensive parts list of all the proteins the body makes.
</P>
<P>
   Defects in these working proteins, caused by mutations in their
parent genes, are responsible for much of the burden of human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the role of every human protein _ proteomics _
will be one of the goals of the post-genome era. The sequence of a
protein, meaning the composition of its subunits, can be predicted
from the sequence of DNA letters in its parent gene, but many
proteins are further processed by the cell in ways that cannot yet
be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another initiative made possible by the genome is the complete
understanding of the human cell. Thousands of genes may be active
in a cell at any time, and the cast of players changes when the
cell performs different roles, like responding to a hormone or
slipping into cancerous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it has been out of the question to study so many
genes simultaneously. But new instruments known as gene expression
chips allow researchers to track which of a cell's genes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   Gene expression chips are made in different ways but all require
prior knowledge of the genes' DNA sequence, now available from the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   The chips may also help elucidate the difference between the 220
known cell types of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Although every cell possesses its own full copy of the genome,
each type is thought to use only its own special subset of the
genes, the rest being permanently switched off.
</P>
<P>
   The body is a kind of repressive socialist state where every
cell is equal but each must respond precisely to collective
authority or receive orders to self-destruct. The genome is the
authority's archive, containing the plans for each type of cell,
the master program for generating a 10-trillion-celled organism
from a single egg, and the life cycle instructions that guide it
from birth to adolescence and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING HUMAN VARIATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In parallel with finding all the genes in the genome, biologists
will also try to track the major variants in DNA sequence found in
the human population. Any two individuals differ on average in one
nucleotide, or DNA unit, in every thousand.
</P>
<P>
   These one unit changes are known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs, and are a principal source of human genetic
variation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of SNPs, or ``snips,'' should help track down the
variant genes that contribute to disease. Many common diseases,
like diabetes and heart disease, are thought to be caused by
several variant genes acting together. Because each variant makes
only a small contribution to the disease, these genes have hitherto
been particularly hard to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly feel this is going to revolutionize medicine because
we are going to understand not only what causes disease but what
prevents disease,'' said Dr. Stephen T. Warren, a medical
geneticist at Emory University in Atlanta and editor of The
American Journal of Human Genetics. ``We will understand the
mechanism of disease sufficiently to do rational therapy. We will
be able to predict who is at higher risk for particular disease and
provide advice to individuals as to how best to maintain their
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The ability to diagnose vulnerability to disease on a genomewide
basis will multiply the quandaries already raised by the present
level of genetic testing. Probably almost everyone possesses many
gene variants associated with adverse health effects. This
information could be used to the individual's detriment, if not
kept confidential, and could be psychologically devastating if
diagnosis runs ahead of treatment and the physician has no therapy
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric S. Lander of the Whitehead Institute has contemplated a
``snip chip'' that would diagnose all the major SNPs, or gene
variants, found in the population. Such information would hold
considerable potential for forecasting an individual's medical
fate.
</P>
<P>
   These snip chips are unlikely to be developed soon and their
predictive powers should not be feared, said Dr. James Watson,
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are the ones who are afraid to see the
future,'' Watson said. ``Old people see the future and would like
to reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic elements are
useful in a quite different dimension, that of tracking the
movements of the earliest human populations within Africa and as
they spread throughout the rest of the world. By selecting SNP's
that arose in the course of this expansion, population geneticists
can track genetic differences that are specific to particular
continents and major ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these SNPs lie in regions of the genome that do not code
for genes and have no effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists know that all people are extremely
similar to one another in genetic terms and believe that the
similarities overwhelm the very minor differences that they are
studying.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear the differences may not be used so benignly.
Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania ethicist, believes
geneticists underestimate both the appetite for this genetic
information and its potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important that drive is to understand
ourselves,'' he said. ``In most parts of the world we define
ourselves by blood and kin, and those are just surrogates for
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the genetic kits have been developed to determine who
is of American Indian ancestry, say, ``It would not surprise me to
see eligibility for casino gambling profits requiring a genetic
test,'' Caplan said. ``We could find people asking who is the
`real' Jew or black person or Serbian.''
</P>
<P>
   He also foresees SNPs being used in conjunction with brain scans
to uncover genetic markers for personality traits like antisocial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises for the man in the street will be how
much of our behavior is hard-wired,'' Caplan said. ``And the people
involved in the mapping are medical people who don't spend much
time thinking about the historical and social implications. So
there will be lots of bombshells, some of them sadly revisiting
some of the bigotry that has cycled around genetics for many
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW TEMPTATION
</P>
<P>
   Like all powerful knowledge, the genome can be put to good and
bad ends depending on how carefully the knowledge is used. The more
harmful genetic variants are discovered, the more compelling the
logic may seem of fixing the bugs in the genomic programming
directly instead of treating the symptoms in each generation, a
procedure called germ-line gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is hardly pressing: Gene therapy applied to treat
ordinary body cells has so far been a failure. But in time the
technique will doubtless work, and the knowledge may be developed
to reprogram the human genome, perhaps to strip it of many known
disease-causing and life-shortening SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the genome would then fall to some extent under human
direction, bringing vast benefits for health and longevity, but
raising a dire risk of changing human nature in unintended and
unwarranted ways.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, the long-sought manual of evolution's biological
programming, comes with no warning labels as to careful reading and
cautious use. Maybe neither is necessary.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who may
become the spoiler of the 2000 presidential race, was cool Sunday
to renewed calls for an outside counsel to probe what Vice
President Al Gore knew about a Buddhist temple campaign stop four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, dismissing that Republican-promoted idea, observed wryly
that ``enough is already known about Gore's fund-raising
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by now the subject is really boring. Gore raises lots of
money. Texas Gov. George W. Bush raises lots of money. They all do
it _ in both parties. So what is the big deal about the Buddhist
temple event, which was legal? It has been investigated over and
over. Nobody claims Gore did anything criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose seems to have been to catch him in a provable lie
under oath so prosecutors could play ``gotcha'' as they did with
President Clinton on the subject of Monica Lewinsky. Gore, however,
has eluded them. Perhaps, just perhaps, he is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department investigator, Robert Conrad, revived the
issue recently by recommending that Attorney General Janet Reno
toss it to a special counsel just to prove her independence and
integrity, already repeatedly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Conrad admitted that he had no new witnesses or
direct evidence to prove Gore lied when he denied knowing that the
event was a fund-raiser. In any case, it was not illegal and it
would not have been a crime if Gore had known.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Conrad based his recommendation on his own feeling that
it would look better to the public if Justice turned the matter
over to someone else. He was concerned about the process, not the
substance of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad said he wanted to ``lay it to rest.'' That could be done,
however, by giving up the whole useless exercise. Or maybe Conrad's
thinking was influenced by Clinton-basher Jesse Helms, the
Republican senator from North Carolina, to whom Conrad made a $250
re-election campaign contribution in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this pose of judicial purity is that
investigations of vice presidents in the middle of presidential
campaigns do not happen in a neutral political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, conducting yet another hearing
into Democratic fund-raising practices, leaked Conrad's internal
recommendation. The senator added mysteriously that Gore's
statements about the Buddhist temple during an April interview with
Conrad differed in a ``stark'' way from the vice president's
previous statements on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Gore promptly released the transcript of that
interview, in which he said essentially what he has said before.
The excerpts reveal no ``stark'' contradictions that might imply
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, defending his actions in an ABC interview later,
conceded, ``I'm not saying that there's anything prosecutable but
there are a great many unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, what unanswered questions are left? The flavor of
the tea served? The shape of the cookies? The car Gore arrived in?
Gore has answered endless questions. Specter just doesn't like his
replies.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there wasn't something peculiar about publicizing
a probe that came up empty-handed, Specter huffed, ``My record is a
strong one on running objective inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh? He was ``objective'' when he accused Anita Hill in 1991 of
perjury _ not just lying, mind you, but a crime _ because her
account of Republican Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas'
alleged sexual harassment contradicted Thomas' protestations of
innocence? Thomas was confirmed, but to this day no one could prove
which of the two was not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's ``objectivity'' is a joke. He got what he wanted _
headlines repeating that Gore ought to be probed for something by
somebody. You had to read down into the fine print to understand
that there is no legal reason to go through the exercise of
appointing an outside counsel to investigate an a baseless
accusation. This is a political issue, not a legal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not said the vice president has done anything wrong,''
Specter whined. So why does he want to tie up the Gore staff with
all kinds of legal entanglements and costs in the middle of his
presidential campaign? Let us guess. The chaos and confusion could
destroy Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have made a career out of pressuring
Reno for special counsels to probe Clinton administration
officials, and in fact she has appointed seven of them. But she has
repeatedly drawn the line at elevating GOP complaints about
Democratic fund-raising to that level of investigation. Even
Specter concedes that she is unlikely to suddenly capitulate and
name an outside counsel now.
</P>
<P>
   It's all for show, this latest round being an effort to undercut
Gore's credibility. Bush's surrogates do the dirty work while he
stays above the fray. He said only that the fuss indicates it is
time for ``a new tone in Washington, which is going to require a
new administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a new Congress, no longer controlled by subpoena-empowered
Republicans with nothing on their minds but investigating
Democrats.

<P>
   LAGUNA ATASCOSA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Texas _ Early on a
June morning, you can walk for miles here without seeing another
human being.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll likely see whitetail deer, cottontail rabbits,
roadrunners, Texas tortoises and colorful birds ranging from green
jays to roseate spoonbills. You might even spot an American
alligator or make a rare sighting of an ocelot.
</P>
<P>
   For a vacationing visitor from Fort Worth-Dallas _ weary of work
deadlines, road rage, pushy telemarketers and other urban plagues _
the refuge is a soothing slice of heaven. It's a 35-minute drive
from the beaches of South Padre Island at the southern tip of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that most Texans have never heard of the Laguna
Atascosa, one of 18 national wildlife refuges in Texas and 521 in
the United States. But these refuges are becoming an increasingly
precious American treasure as the human population relentlessly
expands and as wildlife habitat is vaporized by bulldozers making
way for the latest addition to urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Refuges range from the tiny, half-acre Mille Lacs refuge in
Minnesota to the Arctic refuge in Alaska, a majestic expanse of
19.2 million acres that is roughly the size of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As the refuge system nears its 100th anniversary in 2003, it's
important that Congress, and the American public, come to better
understand the refuge system's importance and the need to keep it
properly maintained. Compared to America's prized national parks,
our wildlife refuges are underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Many refuges possess scenic beauty. But they were created to
provide a haven for wildlife and crucial rest stops for migratory
birds. The refuges get $260 million in annual funding under the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Refuges lure 35 million visitors annually, a number easily
exceeding 10 percent of the U.S. population. But that number is
misleading because there are many repeat visitors, such as birding
and fishing enthusiasts who regularly frequent favorite refuges,
system spokesman Erik Eckl said.
</P>
<P>
   The Laguna Atascosa, covering 45,187 acres, is a birder's
paradise. The refuge's outdoor recreation planner, biologist Kevin
Stephenson, said 406 species of birds have been identified here _
more than at any other refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge includes grasslands, woods, impenetrable thornbrush
and coastal marshes along the Laguna Madre, the fish-rich waters
between the Texas mainland and Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge is a sanctuary for the ocelot, a small, reclusive
wildcat. Of the estimated 100 ocelot left in the United States,
about one-third are at Laguna Atascosa.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge draws more than 100,000 visitors annually, mainly
from October through April. Attendance is minimal in hot summer
months. But if you arrive at daybreak, you can see lots of wildlife
and have a great time hiking trails before the midday heat sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife watching is the biggest attraction at refuges. Many
allow some hunting, a practice that has enraged animal protection
groups but which refuge officials defend as a recreational pursuit
that helps stabilize populations. Laguna Atascosa has a short deer
hunting season that keeps its whitetail population at about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, many refuge facilities are in disrepair, with
problems ranging from leaky roofs to crumbling boardwalks, Eckl
said. Laguna Atascosa wants money to pave a scenic drive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their funding limitations, the refuges are a priceless
asset to wildlife _ and to the humans who take great joy in
visiting them.
</P>
<P>
   When you quietly walk a refuge trail and see animals in the
wild, ``it's therapeutic,'' Stephenson said. ``It's good for the
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   President Theodore Roosevelt would doubtlessly be happy to see
how huge the refuge system has become since he helped create the
first refuge at Florida's Pelican Island in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, he'd be thrilled,'' Eckl
said. ``It's an amazing gift to our future generations that he
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

<P>
   Whose DNA was sequenced in the human project?
</P>
<P>
   Surely some fitting representative of the human species, some
Homo sapientissimus, someone chosen for special qualities of health
or intellect, some screen or sports star, maybe
technoplutocrat-in-chief Bill Gates. Or why not Dr. James D. Watson
or Dr. Francis Crick, the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and federal officials don't think in such terms. Both
the public consortium and Celera have chosen to do their decoding
at celebrity's opposite pole, with the DNA of anonymous
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is sequencing the DNA of a single male (because men have
both an X and a Y chromosome, women two X's). The company will not
say who he is. Call him Celer.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's object of analysis is not an individual, but a
patchwork composite of DNA sections drawn from a number of men and
women it will not identify. Call him Mosaic Man.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Celer and Mosaic Man are anonymous is the
revealing nature of DNA. In terms of public exposure, being
stripped naked in Times Square would be only mildly revealing
compared with having one's genome accessible on an open database.
</P>
<P>
   Probably everyone carries some gene variants that could
predispose them or their children to disease. By the time all such
genetic flaws are cataloged, it will be apparent that quite a few
are present in the decoded human genome. To preserve the privacy of
the donor _ and his family and descendants _ anonymity is the best
course.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymity is an anomalous kind of mask, because DNA is the
ultimate identifier. It is always possible that Celer and maybe
even the components of Mosaic Man could be recognized if their DNA
were to show up in any forensic database.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has gone even further toward securing anonymity
by working on a genome where each section may come from one of
several different individuals. These include both men and women and
people of different ethnic backgrounds. Mosaic Man is truly a
nobody.
</P>
<P>
   A jury-size complement of 12 men and women have contributed the
DNA used in Mosaic Man. But they are not all making equal
contributions: The sample being most used for the consortium's
draft is from a single man.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are just as happy with an anonymous genome as with a
celebrity's, because with one genome in hand to serve as a
reference sequence, it should be quite easy to catalog all the
common variants found in most human populations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these variants are sites on the DNA where one unit is
changed to another, or a DNA unit is added or deleted. These single
unit changes are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs,
and account for a large proportion of human genetic variation. A
variant SNP may change a gene's coding for its protein product,
leading to a protein with different properties.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, as far as is known, has the same set of genes, but
because of SNPs, many of these genes come in several different
flavors. Because everyone has a different combination of flavors,
no individuals are completely alike, save for identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   A catalog of the most common human SNPs should be valuable in
tracking down genetic dispositions to disease, particularly those
caused by multiple variant genes, each of which makes a small and
elusive contribution. By tracking the patterns of SNPs inherited in
families where a disease is prevalent, biologists hope to identify
the gene variants that contribute to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   With Celer's reference sequence in hand, Celera plans to detect
the DNA variations in six men and women of different ethnic
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the public realm, a second consortium, known as the SNP
Consortium, aims to identify 300,000 human SNPs and publish them
for general use. The SNP Consortium is supported by 11
pharmaceutical companies and the Wellcome Trust of London.

<TEXT>
<P>
   An intense focus on putting genes to practical use has propelled
John Craig Venter from an obscure federal researcher to a principal
decoder of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Oct. 14, 1946, in Salt Lake City, he earned a doctorate
in physiology and pharmacology from the University of California at
San Diego and entered the world of biochemical research at the
National Institutes of Health. Frustrated at having to spend 10
years trying to isolate a single gene, Venter realized there was a
quick way to fish out the genes, which in the case of humans occupy
only 3 percent of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was to capture the normal copies of genes made by
living cells and to decode a few hundred DNA units from part of the
gene. These partial transcripts, known as ESTs (expressed sequence
tags), could be used to identify the gene-coding regions on the DNA
from which they came.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's use of ESTs had two eventful consequences. One was that
Dr. Bernadine Healy, then director of the National Institutes of
Health, decided to apply for patents on the genes he had found, a
move strongly opposed by Dr. James Watson, director of the NIHs
human genome office. The issue was among one of several differences
with Healy that led to Watson's resignation from that office in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The other consequence was that Venter's work caught the eye of a
venture capitalist, Dr. Wallace Steinberg, who wanted to start a
gene-finding company _ with Venter as its head. But Venter insisted
on a nonprofit venture, so Steinberg set him up in the nonprofit
Institute for Genomic Research supported by a new company, Human
Genome Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   At his new institute, Venter generated thousands of ESTs to the
human genome. These became the intellectual property of Human
Genome Sciences which, under Dr. William Haseltine, has developed
far-reaching claims to many medical genes of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Venter then spotted another frontier where the DNA sequencing
machines might break ground, that of sequencing the genomes of
bacteria. The NIHs human genome project was then working on E.
coli, a widely studied bacterium, but progress was slow.
</P>
<P>
   In a prelude to later events with the human genome, Venter
figured he could be first to decode a bacterium with a novel method
called the shotgun technique. He applied for an NIH grant but
started the project with other money. When it was almost complete,
he has said, he received a letter from the NIH rejecting his
application because, in the view of an expert committee, it would
not work.
</P>
<P>
   The committee included scientists involved in the NIHs part of
the public consortium. Their rejection of Venter's idea set the
pattern of an adversarial relationship that has continued until the
last few weeks. Haemophilus influenzae, whose genome Venter
decoded, was the first bacterium and the first living organism, not
counting viruses, to have its full DNA decoded. The result gave
scientists their first glimpse into the set of genes necessary for
life. It set off a revolution in medical microbiology, inspiring
efforts to decode every major pathogen and learn the microbes'
entire playbook for attacking human cells.
</P>
<P>
   In setting up his institute and decoding the Haemophilus genome,
Venter showed he could attract talented people as colleagues. Much
of the essential work on Haemophilus was by Dr. Hamilton O. Smith,
a Nobel Prize winner, whose contribution Venter freely
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's technical judgment and organizational abilities
appealed to Michael W. Hunkapiller, president of the company now
known as PE Biosystems, which made the leading brand of DNA
sequencing machine. When a new, labor-saving generation of his
machines was developed, Hunkapiller figured that a private company
using a large suite of the new machines could decode the human
genome faster than the government could. He persuaded Venter to run
the company, which came to be known as Celera.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving his institute in friendly hands _ its new president is
Dr. Claire Fraser, his wife _ Venter began Celera in May 1998. His
rivals in the public consortium were soon providing him with the
psychological stimulus he seemed to need, by pronouncing his human
genome decoding strategy certain to fail. Within a few months he
had hired a staff, set up a large plant and begun decoding.
</P>
<P>
   Although Celera is in business to make money, principally by
selling subscriptions to its genomic data base, Venter seems eager
for the academic world's approval and has continued to publish
scientific articles, maintaining a presence in both the science and
business worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Venter became wealthy when he left the NIH to set up the
Institute for Genomic Research, and superwealthy when he became
president of Celera. But apart from indulging his passion for
sailing, he has not let sudden riches divert him from his path.
Whether in working on ESTs to pull out the genes, decoding the
first pathogenic bacteria, or racing to complete the human genome,
he has been driven by getting practical results. Celera's corporate
motto, that ``Speed Matters'' for treating disease, is a little
hokey but reflects Venter's consistent focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been Craig's view that what is important is not
some abstract view of the genome but its utility,'' said Dr. David
Lipman, director of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information. ``Craig has always pushed in the right direction, and
the public program needed pushing. When he started Celera it made
the public program open their eyes and take a different approach.''

RUTHLESS EQUALS HILARIOUS ON THESE `INSIDE TV' SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The initial fear ABC had with its critically acclaimed
inside-the-TV-world comedy ``Sports Night'' was that it was too
inside for the average viewer. And when ABC pulled the plug after
two seasons, it was indeed obvious that we media insiders were far
more tickled by it than those with Nielsen boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Such is potentially the problem for Showtime's ``Beggars and
Choosers,'' which premieres Tuesday at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When Rob Malone (Brian Kerwin) opens the morning meeting of the
fictional LGT Network in ``Beggars and Choosers''' premiere
episode, he takes a few jabs at his development head about her
passing on the runaway hit ``The Sopranos,'' which is now killing
them in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing particularly funny about this _ except to those
of us who know and understand that in real life, a development
executive who waved off a series that goes on to become a breakout
hit for someone else would have their body chopped up in little
pieces and dispatched to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As I cracked up over this, my viewing partner, whose TV tastes
fall within the purview of HGTV and the Weather Channel, sat
stone-faced.
</P>
<P>
   In both ``Beggars and Choosers'' and the superior Canadian
series ``The Industry,'' now airing on PBS, viewers are expected at
least to connect with the ruthlessness of the business, where
getting ahead means getting behind someone _ either to be carried
along by their tail wind or to push them out a window. (Hey, it
works for ``Survivor.'') The idea is that it's not as over-the-top
in other businesses, but everyone can relate.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Beggars and Choosers,'' Lori (Charlotte Ross), LGT's vice
president in charge of development, is the master at back-stabbing,
and the writers have cleverly fueled her chronic paranoia this
season by hiring a British development executive as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   When Lori tells her like-minded confidant, a scheming agent
named Brad (William McNamara), that she's worried about the new LGT
consultant, Brad does some background checking only to find that
the Brit is buddies with Prince Edward and is considered the 123rd
person in line for the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that,'' ponders Brad, ``to have to knock off 122
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious and anal, Lori obsesses over her career and those who
can affect it, living and breathing every professional move she
makes (and the moves of others). You'd think she's capable of
murder to get ahead. She's destined to be one of the series' most
popular characters.
</P>
<P>
   A future episode shows the callousness of television production
when LGT puts in development an Asian sitcom, but only as an
apology to an angry Asian community for a star's politically
incorrect faux pas on a talk show. (At least it was original. Most
would have gone with African-Americans and have as its spokesperson
a loudmouth Baptist minister resembling Jesse Jackson.)
</P>
<P>
   But Lori and the doings at LGT actually pale in comparison to
Rick Mercer's portrayal of Richard Strong in ``The Industry,''
which offers the most savagely funny satire on the medium since
``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   To help bring back a popular series in which the star has died,
Richard re-edits the star's sick-in-bed scene to say not only that
he died but that the star wrote the episode himself ``knowing'' he
was dying. It becomes ``event'' television and draws a huge
audience, and no one gives a thought to what they've just done.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Roy (Peter Keleghan), head of the network, is described as
an unsentimental opportunist who made his money building low-income
housing. Now, says Richard, who moves the action along by talking
to the camera, mutters, ``He makes movies and television for people
who live in low-income housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Over two episodes, Richard sabotages a boss to get his job, and
the smartest, sharpest, more principled executives are usually the
first targeted for extinction. ``She's the smartest person here,''
Richard says of a co-worker, looking at her adoringly. ``She's got
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, ``Beggars and Choosers'' and ``The Industry''
mirror the real industry _ not only in its conniving nature, but
also in the lack of respect given the medium by those whose
livelihoods are connected to it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm quite sure that my favorite line from ``The
Industry'' _''It's TV, not rocket science. It's small-engine
repair'' _ was told to me a year ago by an idealistic low-level
executive who burned himself out and is now, if rumor is true,
peddling flowers alongside a busy Los Angeles intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's where he'll bloom,'' was the last punch line I
heard about the guy. And this came from a colleague and ``good
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Television can go right ahead in its effort to parody its own
industry. But for real comedy, nothing can outdo the real thing.

<P>
   Francis Sellers Collins, an articulate medical geneticist,
directs the National Human Genome Research Institute, a part of the
National Institutes of Health, and is the most visible public
spokesman for the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Staunton, Va., on April 14, 1950, Collins was trained as
a physical chemist at the University of Virginia and at Yale. But
later in his career he adopted two important new interests: medical
genetics and Christianity, a faith he discusses with more ease than
many scientists. The genome project has filled him with awe, he has
said, as it revealed something only God knew before.
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining an M.D. at the University of North Carolina, he
and colleagues discovered the genes causing cystic fibrosis,
neurofibromatosis and Huntington's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he succeeded Dr. James Watson as director of the
National Institutes of Health's part of the human genome project.
He has skillfully managed the unwieldy alliance that he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' office finances the academic centers involved in the
Human Genome Project, notably those of Washington University in St.
Louis, the Whitehead Institute in Boston, and the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. But a rival government agency, the Department
of Energy, has a piece of the action, and Collins has also had to
coordinate policy with the Wellcome Trust of London, which finances
one-third of the genome and has not hesitated to lobby for its own
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Celera Corp. appeared on the scene, critics said that
an assortment of academic centers was ill-suited to the
industrial-scale task of decoding the genome. But Collins has
overseen a vigorous response to the Celera challenge. He focused
resources on his three most successful centers and squashed a bid
by the Department of Energy to collaborate with Celera.
</P>
<P>
   He coordinated his far-flung team in two groups: the G5 inner
circle, which included the three leading NIH centers, the
Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute and the Sanger Center
in England; and the G16 group, which included centers from Germany
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale sequencing of DNA is a new art that the consortium
learned by doing it. Collins persuaded the centers to cooperate in
an effort to sequence 90 percent of the human genome by this month.
By achieving that goal on schedule, he has assured that public
consortium deserves a large share of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my role to serve as project manager and identify areas
of difficulty, and mostly that is what I've done for the last
year,'' he said last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   About the only smile-inducing element to be found within any
story about a rapper getting arrested is the publication of the
tough guy's sissy-sounding, parent-selected name.
</P>
<P>
   Flesh Bone is really Stanley Howse.
</P>
<P>
   Jay-Z is Shawn Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Snoop Doggy Dogg is Calvin Broadus.
</P>
<P>
   Mac the Camouflage Assassin is McKinley Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rapper to be booked on charges is one Nathaniel
Dwayne Hale, better known to the kids as Nate Dogg. (He's a protege
of Snoop Doggy Dogg's, hence the double-g deal with the canine
portion of his showbiz name.) Mr. Dogg was arrested by a SWAT team
in Pomona, Calif., after he held his girlfriend against her will,
assaulted her and set her mother's car on fire, according to
police. He has been charged with kidnapping, making terrorist
threats, domestic violence and arson, and is being held in lieu of
$1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of Nate Dogg come yipping at the heels of the
gun-wielding antics of Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, whose new CD
has gone triple-platinum in a heartbeat. In one crazy evening, the
self-proclaimed punk allegedly pulled a gun during a fight with a
member of the Insane Clown Posse's entourage and then took the gun
out later that night when he saw his wife kissing another man.
</P>
<P>
   Guess he should have stayed home and rented a movie.
</P>
<P>
   And if you would have told me that when I started this job I'd
one day be writing a paragraph that included the names Nate Dogg,
Eminem and Insane Clown Posse, I'd ask what time your spaceship was
returning to its home planet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually I've commented on the rap scene from time to time for
more than a decade now _ sometimes ripping it, sometimes giving the
form its due. I've said rap is the most vibrant and vital type of
pop music of the last 20 years, and I've mocked many of the
so-called artists who can't play instruments and just rip off tunes
by infinitely more talented musicians, and I stand by both of those
seemingly dichotomous statements.
</P>
<P>
   Most often though, when I'm talking about rappers in the news,
I'm talking about their crimes and tragedies, not their CDs and
concerts. Go lazy with your thinking and call that racist if you
will (even though many rappers, including the aforementioned
Eminem, are white), but it would be more offensive if I didn't note
the astonishingly, depressingly large numbers of rap artists who
have been in trouble with the law and/or have been seriously
injured or stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   It's practically an epidemic. In the last six months alone,
there have been at least eight incidents of rappers arrested, from
the Sean ``Puffy'' Combs mess at a New York City nightclub in
December 1999 to the multiple charges of felony gun possession
against Flesh Bone of Bones Thugs-N-Harmony to the prison stay
slapped on ODB (aka Big Baby Jesus) after he violated probation for
possessing alcohol _ a relatively benign offense until you consider
that ODB has a history that includes charges of shoplifting,
threatening a girlfriend, menacing security officers, possession of
crack cocaine, firing shots at police officers and illegally
wearing a bulletproof vest (a no-no for cons).
</P>
<P>
   You say it's unfair to condemn a whole genre of music because
some of its practitioners get into trouble? I say the cumulative
lineups of Lilith Fair have been in far less trouble than one
little ODB.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago this month that rappers 2 Live Crew were
arrested in Hollywood, Fla., for performing obscene material
onstage. But so many rappers have been shot, stabbed, arrested and
convicted since then that the 2 Live Crew guys seem almost cuddly
by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk about a rap sheet? This is just a partial list
of rappers who have been arrested or or injured or killed:
</P>
<P>
   Tupac Shakur. DMX. Jay-Z. Sean ``Puffy'' Combs. Two members of
Naughty by Nature. Coolio. Foxy Brown. Nate Dogg. Two members of 2
Live Crew. Black Rob. Mac the Camouflage Assassin. Notorious B.I.G.
Flesh Bone. Steady B. ODB. Eminem. Two members of Digital
Underground. Flavor Flav.
</P>
<P>
   Not that getting into trouble with the law necessarily harms the
careers of these role models, or is of particular concern to the
corporate types who profit from their product; in fact, a police
record usually has the opposite effect, gaining the rapper some
much-desired ``street cred.'' Your songs about waving guns and
busting a cap and all that crap sound so much more authentic if
you're really doing it.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that'll stop a rapper's career cold is a
bullet that leaves him open-eyed in a pool of blood, and even then
the post-mortem releases keep on coming, and the scramble for the
profits only intensifies. It's just a lovely cycle.

&HT;     COURT REJECTS CALIFORNIA'S `BLANKET' PRIMARY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California's free-for-all primary election system,
which allows voters to choose candidates without regard to party
affiliation, violates the rights of state political parties, the
Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 decision, the court called the state's system a
``severe and unnecessary'' burden on the right of a political party
to define its own message and decide its own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The system, known a blanket primary, allows any voter _ whether
registered as a Democrat, Republican, third-party member or
independent _ to vote for the nomination of any candidate from any
party for any race.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said California
violated the First Amendment's right to free association by
``forcing political parties to associate with those who do not
share their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no area is the political association's right to exclude
more important than in its candidate-selection process,'' Scalia
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that California _ along with Washington state
and Alaska, which have similar systems _ will be forced to change
the way they conduct primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said the states could hold a nonpartisan blanket primary,
in which voters can choose any candidate, regardless of
affiliation, and the top two vote-getters move on to the general
election. The system he described would be similar to that adopted
by Louisiana in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a plan, Scalia said, ``primary voters are not
choosing a party's nominee'' and therefore political parties'
rights of free association are not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Writing for the two, Stevens said the court should
``respect the policy choice made by the state's voters'' in
approving the proposition that created the blanket primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But George Waters, who represented the political parties before
the high court, praised the majority decision, saying parties have
the right to define their membership. ``The court agreed that
blanket primaries violate that right by inviting voters with no
loyalty to the party to influence the selection of the party's
nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing, California Secretary of State Bill Jones noted that
the vast majority of voters supported the blanket primary system.
``I don't know who the parties are afraid of. The vast majority of
their members supported this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 198, setting up
the blanket-primary system, which allows voters, regardless of
their political registration, to cast ballots in such elections to
select any candidate for any office.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a voter could choose a candidate in the Democratic
presidential primary and, at the same time, vote for a candidate in
the Republican primary for U.S. Senate and then vote to nominate an
independent candidate for a House seat.
</P>
<P>
   California adopted the single-ballot, blanket form of primary to
give the state's 1.6 million independent voters their first chance
to vote in what had been a ``closed'' primary system limited to
party members.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has used the blanket primary since 1935. Alaska
enacted a similar law in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Blanket-primary supporters argued that the system would
encourage voter turnout and lead to the nomination of more moderate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But California's Democratic, Republican, Libertarian and Peace &AMP;
Freedom parties immediately challenged the system, contending it
violated their First Amendment right of ``freedom of association.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Democratic and Republican parties filed briefs
supporting that contention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, U.S. District Court Judge David Levi ruled that the
blanket primary was constitutional. Levi said that although the
system was an ``intrusion on a party's traditional right to select
its own candidates,'' the burden on the parties was not enough of a
``significant burden'' to justify striking down the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. It
thought so highly of Levi's ruling that it simply adopted his
opinion ``as the opinion of our court.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court reversed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for affording voters greater choice, it is obvious that the
net effect of this scheme ... is to reduce the scope of choice, by
assuring a range of candidates who are all more centrist,'' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision avoided deciding the validity of the more
common open primary system used in another 20 states. In an open
primary, voters are allowed to choose which party's primary they
will vote in. Such voters get to select the nominees of one party
only.
</P>
<P>
   This is the type of system that aided former Republican
presidential candidate John McCain in states such as Michigan,
where Democrats and independents were allowed to vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states have closed primaries, which allow only party
members to vote in each party's primary. Another 13 states have
closed primaries but also let independent voters cast ballots in at
least one party's primary.

SOCIAL SECURITY EMERGES AS DEFINING POLICY ISSUE OF 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL HULSE   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security has often been used as a political
bludgeon, but the 2000 presidential campaign promises to raise
public discourse over the program to a new level and set the future
course of retirement living.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and Republican contender George W.
Bush are articulating clear and contrasting visions of how they
would reshape the indispensable pension program, giving voters an
unmistakable choice in approaches to Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates typically dance around the edges of the politically
volatile issue, but not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a presidential campaign that has given this
kind of emphasis to retirement issues,'' said Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in proposing that workers be allowed to invest a portion
of their own payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts, is
banking that Americans accustomed to 401(k) plans on the job will
see the appeal in having more control over their public pension. He
and his backers argue that individuals can do a better job handling
their money than the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a change yes, but it is a change for the better,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``It is going to give people a chance to
develop wealth and assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, is proposing that people be encouraged
to invest in publicly subsidized retirement accounts as a
supplement to Social Security, earning a government match tied to
their personal contribution and income level. Backers of this
approach say it has the advantage of not tampering with Social
Security while giving workers an attractive new savings option.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is Social Security plus, not Social Security minus,''
said Gore in trying to sell his program, which would cost an
estimated $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two campaigns will spend most of the next five months
trying to show the flaws of the opposition's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, with assistance from a few moderate Democrats, are
attacking Gore's proposal as a pale imitation of Bush's approach
but one that does nothing to fix structural problems in the Social
Security system, which is projected to stop running a surplus in
about 2015 and run out of money in 2037. It would then be able to
pay about 70 percent of benefits using current taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating a new government benefit does not keep Social
Security solvent for the baby boomers and beyond,'' said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, his fellow Democrats and their allies say Bush's plan
is a risky strategy that would lead to cuts in benefits as the
drain of payroll taxes into individual accounts accelerates the
decline in Social Security surpluses. Plus, they say allowing
people to invest their own money makes the Social Security system
subject to the vagaries of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to rely on Social Security's guaranteed
benefit, not be forced to sacrifice their retirement security for
George W. Bush's political gain,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman
for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Graham, the Florida Democrat who supports Gore's
initiative, said Bush is trying to wring too much out of Social
Security when it should remain the basis of retirement rather than
a way to build assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe there needs to be new opportunity for Americans
to be more aggressive and try to increase their retirement income,
and I believe there should be, Social Security is not the place to
do it,'' he said. ``Social Security is the net under the trapeze of
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have traditionally scored politically on the Social
Security issue and expect to do so this time. Polls show that older
Americans in particular are leery of any attempt to ``privatize''
the program.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP believes that Bush can sell his plan to a public
comfortable with individual retirement accounts while burnishing
his credentials as a leader willing to tackle tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be just the presidential race that turns on this issue;
congressional elections will offer similar choices as Republican
and Democratic candidates align themselves with the top of the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security issues typically motivate older voters, but it
is those who have not yet reached retirement age who have the most
at stake. Bush and Gore promise to protect current beneficiaries
with phase-ins of their plans, leaving the potential financial
risks and gains to fall on those years away from retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the candidate who is best able to communicate his
Social Security message to those voters could cash in come
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political world has so far failed to catch-up to the
401(k) world,'' said Richard Thau, president of Third Millennium, a
group that tries to promote civic involvement among younger
Americans. ``But the politician who learns to convey a message
about the system of retirement savings in this country will be
ideally situated.''

   BLUE DENIM NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE
</P>
<P>
   DENIM-LIFEBEAT _ Denim has been produced in the United States
since late in the 18th century, but it was Bavarian-born
businessman Levi Strauss who, in 1873, made it an American icon.
Initially embraced by miners, farmers and other manual laborers,
blue jeans came to symbolize the swaggering American cowboy during
the 1930s. Eventually, Hollywood movie stars turned blue jeans into

   FEAR OF FLYING? FLIGHT PHOBIA CAN BE TREATED WITH VIRTUAL
REALITY
</P>
<P>
   FLIGHT-FEAR-LIFEBEAT_ Some people are so afraid of flying that
it limits their career options, keeps them from visiting family and
friends or causes them to tremble and hyperventilate every time
they have to step on a plane. Many of these ``fearful flyers'' may
be able to find help with an unusual treatment called ``virtual
reality exposure therapy.'' In a therapist's suite, patients watch
a 3-D animated movie on a computer, complete with the sights,
sounds and vibrations of flying. It's the closest thing to being
there. Increasingly available through mental health practitioners
and clinics, this therapy is helping some people overcome their
fear of flying. By Shawn O'Leary.

   VEGETARIANISM-NUTRITION-LIFEBEAT _ Each year roughly one million
people become vegetarians. Many of these newcomers do so in simple
fashion, forking their steak aside to dine on the remaining
garnishes; potato salad, a roll or three and a bowl of lettuce
backstroking in dressing. Happy news if you have stock in starch
and fat, bad news if you are the one eating like this. While there
are good reasons to move toward what experts call a
``plant-centered'' diet, the more restrictive the diet, the more
people need to think about their food choices. Being misinformed
can lead to deficiencies and serious problems. By Ken McAlpine.

   MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY POSY, ROSES CAN HEAL BODY AND SOUL
</P>
<P>
   ROSES-ALTERNATIVE-MEDICINE-LIFEBEAT _ Roses, which have been
cultivated for thousands of years, are associated with love and
purity, but they are practical as well as beautiful and symbolic.
By the beginning of the 18th century, American colonists were using
roses for wines, dyes, medicines, pomanders, potpourris,
confections, perfumes and oils. Rose petals and hips steeped in tea
are said to bring down fevers and clear toxins out of the body,
while some people use rose syrup to relieve sore throats and rose
water to cure headaches and tighten sagging skin. By Maggy Howe.

<P>
   Each year roughly one million people turn to some form of
vegetarian diet. Many of these newcomers do so in simple fashion,
forking their steak aside to dine on the remaining garnishes;
potato salad, a roll or three and a bowl of lettuce backstroking in
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Happy news if you have stock in starch and fat, bad news if you
are the one eating like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good intentions gone awry,'' says Ann Grandjean, director of
the Center for Human Nutrition in Omaha, Nebraska. ``Plenty of
vegetarians eat a healthy, well-planned diet. But plenty of others
don't do their homework. And that can get you into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts lump vegetarians into various categories. There are the
semi-vegetarians who have dumped red meat but still eat chicken,
fish and dairy products. There are the lacto-ovovegetarians who
eschew meat, fish and poultry, but continue to consume milk, dairy
products and eggs. There's the lactovegetarian who goes a step
further and eliminates eggs. At the end of the line, there's the
pure vegetarian or ``Vegan,'' subsisting on an all-vegetable diet
devoid of animal foods, dairy products or eggs.
</P>
<P>
   These definitions really don't matter since you already know
what you are and aren't eating. But there is an important point
buried beneath all the syllables. Moving from the semi-vegetarian
to the Vegan, foods fall away. As they do, you need to be
increasingly vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' says Grandjean, who combines nearly 30 years of
nutrition expertise with a no-nonsense approach. ``Good nutrition
is about variety. And any time you start leaving out whole groups
of foods, you're losing that variety. The more restrictive the
diet, the more you need to think about your food choices.''
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to move toward what experts call a
``plant-centered'' diet. While vegetarians on the fringe cite less
substantive evidence _ The Cow is Our Friend! _ science has found a
simple cause and effect. Reduce the animal fat you eat and you'll
reduce the fat clinging to your arteries and your waistline. Enjoy
a reduced risk of heart disease, and possibly lower your odds of
diabetes, high blood pressure and certain types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most transitions toward a plant-based diet result in a diet
that's lower in fat and higher in fiber and antioxidants,
naturally-occurring vitamins and minerals that may reduce the
incidence of some chronic diseases,'' says Nancy Ling, a registered
dietitian in Beverly Hills, California. ``There's still lots of
debate about the benefits of a vegetarian diet. But we do know that
it's a great way to cut back on cholesterol, calories and saturated
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol, calories and fat, however, aren't all that's being
scraped off the plate. Drop red meat from your diet and you lose a
rich repository of iron, zinc, protein and B vitamins. Drop dairy
products and there goes your most reliable source of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that vegetarian fare lacks these nutrients. There are
comparable vegetarian substitutes. One cup of cooked soybeans
contains the protein equivalent of a quarter-pound hamburger or 18
ounces of milk. It's just that the vegetable world, for many, is
uncharted territory. Hunting for calcium, most Americans can
identify a glass of milk. But they wouldn't know a calcium-rich bok
choy or dandelion green if it bit them on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you eat meat, dairy products and vegetables, getting
nutrients can be a no-brainer,'' says Grandjean. ``But vegetarians
have to be more aware of what they're eating. They have to know
what the sources are.''
</P>
<P>
   Being misinformed can lead to deficiencies and serious problems.
Teen-age girls who subsist on bread and salad have exhibited a rate
of bone fracture that would make the National Hockey League
blanche. Along with common sense, their diet is lacking in the
calcium they need to form strong bones.
</P>
<P>
   There once was a time when neophyte vegetarians were left
bawling and confused in the produce section. Today, all the
aspiring vegetarian needs to do is consult the Vegetarian Diet
Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you're eating foods from all these groups, every
day,'' says Grandjean. ``If you are, then you're fine. If you're
not, then you're at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vegetarian Diet Pyramid includes eggs and dairy products.
But for the pure Vegan, a nutrient-replete diet is still simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure vegetarians need to eat what they can from the vegetarian
food guide, and be aware of good sources of protein, calcium, iron
and zinc, which are a little more difficult to get in a strictly
vegetarian diet,'' says Ling.
</P>
<P>
   Grandjean and Ling also counsel athletes, raising some
interesting questions. Can a vegetarian diet help or hinder
athletic performance? Does the vegetarian athlete have special
needs?
</P>
<P>
   Since athletes are always looking for an edge and questionable
experts are always mining for a best seller, there are plenty of
myths. Fortunately, the truth is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that a vegetarian diet improves athletic
performance,'' says Ling. ``But it is true that a well-planned
vegetarian diet will have plenty of carbohydrates, which is what
athletes need if they are training heavily. On the other hand,
being a vegetarian won't decrease your power and endurance
either.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a recreational runner, swimmer or stair-stepper AND a
vegetarian, do you need to be any more concerned?
</P>
<P>
   Grandjean is blunt. If you go to the gym five days a week for an
hour step class, your nutritional needs are little different from
those of the desk jockey checking your ID at the door. For the
recreational exerciser, following the Vegetarian Pyramid is enough.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a strict vegetarian who is training three hours and
up, six and seven days a week _ a collegiate swimmer, a marathon
runner _ you'll have to eat more, says Grandjean, to replace the
calories you're burning.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't, the body starts cannibalizing itself, using
protein in the muscles for fuel and stealing it away from its
preferred task of growth and rebuilding body tissues. Getting
enough calories from calorically light vegetarian foods can require
a trencherman's focus, and frequent snacking.
</P>
<P>
   One cup of brown rice and lentils, a large baked potato,
one-half cup of carrots, one-half cup of peas, a lettuce and tomato
salad, a banana, an apple, an orange and a half-dozen walnuts weigh
in at 890 calories. A college swimmer can burn 6,000 calories a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Protein can be a concern too. Protein is composed of amino
acids, and the amino acids present in broccoli are different from
those in steak. The proteins your body can best absorb are found in
animal products. Their amino acid combinations most closely
represent the human tissue the athlete is trying to build in the
weight room, or repair after a three-hour run.
</P>
<P>
   Grandjean once studied Japanese Olympians who ate a plant-based
diet. To build muscle, these athletes needed three times the
protein of mildly active sorts, and nearly twice the protein
required by meat-eating Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the amount of protein supplied by animal products
goes down, the total amount of protein required goes up,'' says
Grandjean.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarian athletes training heavily should also think about
iron and zinc. Found in healthy supply in meat, these minerals are
less concentrated in vegetarian fare. Since iron carries oxygen
from the lungs to the cells, and the cells use that oxygen to power
the muscles, a shortage of iron could pare back performance. Zinc
deficiency, says Ling, may register as more runny noses and nasty
flus.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions like this can produce another symptom, namely a
crimp in your brain.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get bogged down in details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're vegetarian or not,'' says
Grandjean. ``Variety provides the nutrients you need. Any time you
don't get that variety, there's the potential for compromising your
health and your athletic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VEGETARIAN DIET PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vegetarian Diet Pyramid is based on the traditional eating
patterns of vegetarian-centered cultures. It includes egg whites
and dairy products. Studies have linked this Ovo-lacto diet with
lower rates of heart disease, obesity and certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VEGAN OPTIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strict vegetarian has a smaller pool of food choices, so
it's important those food choices be nutritionally rich. A
vegetarian diet will provide all the nutrients you need, provided
you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Protein: Soybeans, rice, peanuts, broccoli, lentils, chickpeas,
pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, cashews and walnuts.
Soybeans, a rich source of vegetable protein, can also be found in
a range of pretty tasty meat and dairy substitutes _ soy hot dogs,
burgers, cheese, even bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium: Soybeans, collards, kale, dandelion greens, mustard
greens, turnip greens, broccoli, bok choy (spoon cabbage), okra,
rutabaga, almonds and most dried fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Iron: Beans, lentils, nuts, hummus, raisins, dried prunes and
prune juice, potatoes with skin and processed foods that have been
fortified with iron. Foods rich in vitamin C enhance iron
absorption, so drink orange juice with iron-fortified cereal, or
toss sliced tomatoes and nuts into your salad.
</P>
<P>
   Zinc: Whole grains, wheat germ, tofu, tempeh, miso, nut, seeds
and legumes.
</P>
<P>
   B vitamins: Whole-grain and enriched cereals, bread, avocados,
dark green vegetables, green beans, lima beans, bananas, nuts and
potatoes. Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products. A strict
vegetarian can get this vitamin from fortified nutritional yeast,
B12 fortified soymilk or B12 tablets.

FEAR OF FLYING? FLIGHT PHOBIA CAN BE TREATED WITH VIRTUAL REALITY

<P>
   Imagine you're in plane flying at 33,000 feet and confined to a
middle seat. Encountering routine turbulence, the plane begins to
shake. There's no way out and your life is in the hands of the
pilots up front. You begin to panic, hyperventilating, perspiring
and trembling.
</P>
<P>
   While flying is routine for many, this scenario, and ones like
it keep millions from traveling on airplanes or boarding flights
without several stiff drinks or anti-anxiety pills. The fear tends
to heighten after heavy media coverage of an airline crash.
According to one phobia treatment center, those who fear flying
feel view themselves as ``baggage that breathes.'' However, fear of
flying can now be treated with virtual reality therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Flying phobia is heightened anxiety that's out of control and
unreasonable. ``A phobia is a fear that has gone to a level where
you either avoid a situation or you experience it with intense
anxiety,'' says Dr. Brenda Wiederhold, a phobia psychologist at the
Center for Advanced Multimedia Psychotherapy at the California
School of Professional Psychology in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
   Phobias can seriously limit the experience of family and career.
A lot of people give up promotions, they haven't seen their
grandkids in years, they haven't gone to family reunions. ``It's
something that's causing them not to live life fully,'' says
Weiderhold, who is director of the Center.
</P>
<P>
   Today the one in six Americans who consider themselves fearful
flyers might be able to find help with an unusual treatment for
overcoming their emotional trauma. It's called ``virtual reality
exposure therapy,'' and it's the closest thing to being there.
Increasingly available through mental health practitioners and
clinics, this therapy is helping some people overcome the fear of
flying.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works. In the controlled environment of a
therapist's suite, patients, watching a 3-D graphic animated movie
on a computer, experience a trip on an airliner, complete with the
sights, sounds and vibrations of flying. The animation is similar
to today's interactive video games.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual reality (VR) method accelerates traditional
treatments of exposure therapy and desensitization. By confronting
rather than fleeing the object of fear, a person becomes acclimated
to a situation, gaining a sense of being more in control. The
terror or dread that was once felt dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   Says Wiederhold, ``It's being used to treat a variety of
phobias: social phobia, fear of public speaking, fear of heights,
fear of driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech VR treatment is also being used to treat other
fears, phobias and stress disorders including headache stress,
Attention Deficit Disorder, temporomandibular joint disorders and
Raynaud's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Arachnophobes _ people with an abnormal fear of spiders _ and
child cancer patients who face painful chemotherapy, have also been
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Lawry's fear of flying arose from a nightmarish,
turbulent flight many years ago. Since then, she has avoided
flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane was rocking and rolling and honestly, I thought,
'This plane isn't going to make it,''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When she's been forced by circumstances to board a flight, she
suffers great anxiety about the weather. She's only been able to
fly with several glasses of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   With her, as with many others who fear flying, the feeling of
being trapped and the fear of crashing trigger air anxiety. Loss of
control is at the root of both.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 12 sessions is a standard course of treatment that
yields successful results for many. Says Wiederhold, ``It doesn't
work for everybody, but we have a huge success rate and people can
be helped. They don't have to suffer with this forever.'' Some
patients require follow-up refresher sessions if fears return.
</P>
<P>
   Biofeedback is part of VR therapy. Therapists monitor vital
signs as patients imagine themselves on a plane that may have a few
bumps, but never crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they have rapid heart rate, sometimes they start to
hyperventilate,'' says Wiederhold. ``We try to get them to slow
their breathing (with) diaphragmatic breathing (and) thought
stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment programs in North America, Australia and Europe
include visits onto parked planes and meetings with pilots to
further promote desensitization.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Roberta Lawry will be ready to board a plane without having
to relax with alcohol. ``I don't want to not go somewhere just
because I don t want to get on a plane,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawry can take comfort from statistics that indicate flying is
safer than driving. On average, a passenger would have to fly daily
for 32,000 years before experiencing the worst case scenario _ a
crash.

   ``If I could live with only one fabric for the rest of my life,
I would choose denim,'' says Massachusetts clothing and home
furnishings designer Tasha Polizzi. ``Denim has always been part of
my life, part of my collection, part of what inspires me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugged, comfortable, and always at ease, blue denim is an
American classic that gets even better with time. Authentic blue
denim takes its characteristic color from interweaving indigo and
white threads.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, it's been worn by California miners, cowboys,
movie stars, trendy teens and aging baby boomers. Today it also
brings a relaxed feel to the home, thanks to throw pillows,
bedding, table linens, and other accessories fashioned from the
durable cotton fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Denim has been produced in this country since late in the 18th
century, but it was Bavarian-born businessman Levi Strauss who made
it an American icon. In 1873, the San Francisco dry-goods merchant
joined forces with Nevada tailor Jacob Davis, who came up with the
ingenious idea of strengthening the pocket corners of pants with
rivets. After receiving a patent for the process, the partners
began producing copper-riveted ``waist overalls'' in blue denim.
</P>
<P>
   Initially embraced by miners, farmers, and other manual
laborers, blue jeans came to symbolize the swaggering American
cowboy during the 1930s. In the 1950s they became all the rage for
teens across the country after having been trotted out on the
silver screen by Marlon Brando, James Dean, Annette Funicello and
Frankie Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   Later trends gave birth to bell-bottoms, designer jeans and a
craze for vintage denim that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most collectors are looking for used jeans that they can still
wear,'' says Seth Weisser, owner of What Comes Around Goes Around,
a vintage-clothing store in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of vintage blue jeans can range from $25 to more than
$10,000, depending on age, condition and color. Serious collectors
may pay even more. Weisser sold a pair of jeans to some clothing
executives at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., who paid $25,000 in 1997 for a
rare pair of early Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   One of way of dating Levi's is by the red tab sewn into a pair
of jeans or into a jacket. The tab was first used in 1936. The word
``Levi's'' was stitched in capital letters until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Well-worn jeans often wind up in the ragbag, where they
sometimes inspire enterprising souls to create one-of-a-kind
quilts. These textile pieces, however, are rare in today's market
and can fetch $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These quilts are not ancient,'' points out quilt dealer, Laura
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them include remnants from jeans makers of the past
few decades, but they re enchanting nonetheless.''

<P>
   No flower, with the exception of the lotus, has more symbolic
meaning than the rose,'' says Vivien Hillgrove, the owner of Mom's
Head Gardens, in Santa Rosa, Calif., and the teacher of a popular
class on rose propagation, history and mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rose was born from the blood of Venus or the sweat
of Muhammad, roses have been a traditional symbol of love,
treasured by kings and queens and revered by poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said the first rose was from Persia and that the ornate
hanging gardens of Babylon had 300 varieties of roses,'' Hillgrove
says. She adds that the Romans scattered rose petals on the graves
of their dead to symbolize the short life of both humans and roses.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabethans took their cue from the early Christians and
sat in rose gardens to induce a quiet and calm mood. The Victorians
used the language of roses to communicate secret love _ red meant
undying devotion, white stood for purity and innocence, yellow for
jealousy. By the beginning of the 18th century, the American
Colonists were using roses for wines, dyes, medicines, pomanders,
potpourris, confections, perfumes and oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essential oil of rose was discovered quite by accident,'' says
Hillgrove. Legend states that for the marriage feast of the Persian
Emperor Dhihanguyr to Princess Nour-Djihan, a canal was built to
encircle the wedding party. Courtiers scattered rose petals on top
of the water and when the bride dipped her hand into the canal
during the heat of the midday sun, her fingers became covered with
aromatic rose oil. Soon thereafter, apothecaries pursued this
concept and, using their alembics, began distilling rose perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallica rose _ often referred to as the damask rose _ is the
variety most commonly associated with apothecaries. Today the
attar, or essential oil, produced from roses in Bulgaria's Kazanlik
Valley is considered the best (the most fragrant). One acre of land
yields three tons of damask roses; however, the distillation of
these roses will only yield two liters of attar.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Griffin, herbalist and author of ``Mother Nature's Herbal''
(Llewellyn Publications; 1997; $19.95), uses apothecary roses like
the Gallicas to treat a variety of ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petals and hips steeped in tea bring down fevers and clear
toxins out of the body,'' she says, noting that rose hips contain
more vitamin C than oranges and are also rich in vitamins A and B.
``Rose syrup can be taken to relieve sore throats, and rose water
placed on the temples can help end a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin further recommends a rose-water wash to help tighten
sagging skin and rose cream to keep the skin smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is also the creator of Petite Fleur Essences: rose-oil
remedies made from antique roses that she grows herself. ``Modern
hybrids usually live only 30 to 40 years, she says, ``whereas
antique varieties can live 150 years or more. As a result, the
fragrances from antique roses are more potent and their healing
properties are more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin has found that her antique rose oil blends have a
distinct restorative effect on the nerves, and she notes that
``they can lift depression, calm the heart, relieve insomnia, and
soothe irritability, grief, and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Aguirree-Kelley, an occupational therapist at Baylor
University Medical Center, in Dallas, Tex., uses Griffin's antique
rose oil blends as part of the hospital's Healing Environment
Program. Three years ago, Griffin created three blends for the
hospital's blood and bone-marrow and cardiac transplant patients.
The oils are used in conjunction with visualization techniques and
massage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the blends, Bouquet of Harmony, was created to ease
anxiety caused either by pain or by having to wait for a
transplant. All essences are applied to the upper fold of the right
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patient can feel the effects of the roses in 17 seconds or
less,'' says Aguirree-Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Another blend is called Managing Pain and is primarily
administered after blood and bone-marrow transplants. On a scale of
one to 10, one being low and 10 being high, patients have reported
lowering their pain level to a two.
</P>
<P>
   Aguirree-Kelley observes that most pain medications have side
effects, including lethargy, drowsiness and nausea. ``If a patient
can skip this type of pain medication and use flower essences,
there is more opportunity for rehabilitation, she says. ``As an
occupational therapist, I want to get my patients out of bed and
moving _ getting them stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The last blend used at Baylor is simply called Self-Image. Many
of Aguirree-Kelley's patients experience hair loss from
chemotherapy or weight gain from bone-marrow transplants and the
Self-Image blend helps them to overcome body-image problems.
</P>
<P>
   The results have proved to be so effective that she is now using
the essences with patients suffering from chemical dependency.
``These blends are a wonderful way for dependents to gain control
of their craving,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essences help turn loose painful memories, but when
patients do recall these memories, they react to them with
kindness, rather than anxiety and dread.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROSE WATER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This easy-to-make recipe was adapted from ``Perfumes, Splashes &AMP;
Colognes'' (Storey Books; 1997; $14.95), by Nancy M. Booth.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 cups distilled water
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup rose petals (damasks are best)
</P>
<P>
   _ 4 tablespoons vodka
</P>
<P>
   Combine ingredients in a sterilized glass bottle. Gently stir
and store in a cool dry place. Sift out rose petals using a
strainer lined with muslin or an unbleached coffee filter. Rebottle
and use as a refreshing wash or subtle perfume.

SELLECK SAYS WESTERNS ARE NOT RIDING INTO THE SUNSET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE HUISKING   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ To the e-mail generation, westerns are about as
relevant as the Pony Express. At least that seems to be the
perception in Hollywood. But Tom Selleck doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The popular actor, who is riding tall in the saddle as the star
and executive producer of his new western, ``Crossfire Trail,''
thinks the genre still has plenty of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think audiences are hungry for those classic stories of
characters facing moral dilemmas,'' said Selleck, who introduced
``Crossfire Trail'' Saturday in its world premiere at the Sarasota
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, who didn't grow up with westerns as I did, seem
particularly hungry for stories that are entertaining, but that
also deal with certain standards,'' Selleck said. ``I work a lot
with at-risk kids, and that's the impression I get from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most action-adventure plots follow that classic
western form. I mean, `Star Wars' was really a western. The
Hollywood studios think they have to put some new twist on the
form. And certainly you can shoot westerns in a modern way that
audiences will like better. But the form still works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossfire Trail,'' a TNT Original Film, is based on a Louis
L'Amour novel. Selleck plays a restless drifter who must uphold a
promise to a dying friend. The cast also includes Wilford Brimley,
Mark Harmon and Joanna Miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossfire Trail'' won't air on TNT until 2001. But in August,
TNT will broadcast ``Running Mates,'' a drama that stars Selleck as
a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, who first gained fame as the star of television's
long-running ``Magnum, P.I.,'' appeared last month in the
season-finale of NBC's ``Friends.'' It was his ninth appearance
over the years as a doctor in love with Monica (Courteney Cox).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered that they asked me back,'' he said. ``They
have treated me as a visiting member of the family. Their writers
are so good. They created a real character for me. It wasn't just a
case of stunt-casting for sweeps weeks. The cast members are a
great group of people who deserve all the money they're getting.''

   GENE-THERAPY _ The completion of the Human Genome Project should
usher in a whole new revolution in medicine, but it may take a
while for the results to move from the lab to the doctor's office.
CDC genetics experts, and other specialists, say the completion of
the HGP places medical researchers at the starting line, not the
finish line, in the creation of new gene therapies. Said another
way: researchers have created a software program that allows PC
users to tell that they have emails messages in their systems; but
they haven't figured out how to open those emails to see what they
say and mean. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE SCIENTISTS DECODE HUMAN GENOME
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. With GENOME-CELERA.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 3 billion-word human genome, a molecular ``book
of life'' that contains information for unimaginable new insights
into human biology, has been decoded, scientists announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the government-funded Human Genome Project and
officials from a competing private venture set aside a bitter
scientific race and joined President Clinton in announcing that
nearly all of the genome has been defined and sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   Separate completion of 97 percent of the human genetic map by
the government scientists and a team from the biotech company
Celera Genomics could open the way to a powerful new era of
curative drugs - and violation of human rights in ways never before
possible, both groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Venter, president of Celera, said understanding the genome
could lead to reducing cancer deaths to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are learning the language in which God created
life,'' Clinton said. ``We are gaining ever more awe for the
complexity, the beauty, the wonder of God's most divine and sacred
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a pioneer genetic researcher, formed Celera two years
ago and set out to use supercomputers and laser-driven molecular
analyzing techniques to rapidly decipher the sequence of more than
3 billion ``base pairs'' that form the spiraling double helix of
human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that Celera had sequenced the genome of five
individuals _ two males and three females _ who identified
themselves as Hispanic, Asian, Caucasian and African American.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Clinton and Venter, Dr. Francis Collins, head of
the Human Genome Project, announced that an international network
of scientific collaborators had also produced a ``rough draft'' of
the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have agreed to publish their separate _ and
apparently nearly identical _ genetic maps in a
yet-to-be-determined scientific journal in September.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the race has been the sequence of four molecules
in the human gene.
</P>
<P>
   The molecules of human genetic material, comparable to rungs in
a twisted ladder, are known as ``base pairs'' and are identified as
``A,'' ``T,'' ``C'' and ``G.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of tens of thousands of appearances of the four
rungs may define a single gene. Altogether, the sequences define
30,000 or more human genes. The genes control human biology,
determining who has blue eyes and who has red hair _ but more
significantly, who is susceptible to which disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists called the base pairs words in the ``book of life,''
and said understanding what the book tells them should make it
possible to treat disease at the molecular level.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that personal genetic information could also be misused,
both Collins and Venter hailed Clinton's efforts to get laws passed
protecting Americans from discrimination by insurance companies,
employers and others on the basis of ``predictive'' genetic
information the new maps will make possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever needed a wake-up call to say it's time to do this,
isn't today that day?'' Collins said. ``The train is coming very
close. It is bearing down on us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Venter said his group has defined the genome in terms of the
sequence of 3.14 billion occurrences of the four molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the government-funded project had indications the
genome consists of 3.17 billion base pairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scientists from the United States, researchers in
Germany, France, England and China collaborated in the genome
project. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain joined Clinton by
satellite in hailing the new map.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Celera and the public genome project became
intense in the last year and has led to name-calling on both sides
_ most frequently by unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy that today the only race we are talking about is
the human race,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he went to an intermediary in early May and asked him to
see if Venter would be interested in a joint announcement. This led
to a series of meetings between the two scientific rivals and,
ultimately, to Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the cost of the genome project has been roughly
$300 million so far, or a nickel for each of the Earth's 6 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   His project has posted the results of its sequencing work on the
Internet, with updates every 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's company was founded with a $1 billion investment by the
Perkin-Elmer Corp., now known as PE Corp., maker of telescopes,
microscopes and other scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said the company did not expect to make a profit by
commercializing the gene code, but through selling the expertise it
acquired in the sequencing work.
</P>
<P>
   He announced at an afternoon press conference that during the
morning meeting at the White House, another pharmaceutical company
had contacted Celera about doing business together.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose sharply on the NASDAQ stock exchange
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As he opened the meeting in the White House East Room, Clinton
noted that in the same room, nearly 200 years earlier, explorer
Meriwether Lewis showed President Thomas Jefferson the maps from
the Lewis and Clark Expedition of what would become the U.S.
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a map that defined the contours and forever expanded
the frontiers of our continent and our imagination,'' the president
said. ``Today, the world is joining us here in the East Room to
behold a map of even greater significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among about 100 scientists and their guests who gathered at the
White House was Dr. James D. Watson, who in 1953 co-authored a
scientific paper describing the structure of DNA. Nine years later,
Watson and his fellow scientist, British biochemist Francis Crick,
received the Nobel Prize for their discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Watson compared the mapping work to the invention of the
printing press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, let's print some books,'' he said.

   Story CIDE IF BIAS MOTIVATED HATE CRIMES, HIGH COURT RULES
</P>
<P>
   By ROB O'DELL
</P>
<P>
   c.2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juries, not judges, must decide whether hate crimes
were motivated by racial bias in order to be subject to lengthier
sentences, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 5-4 that any factor, except for a prior
conviction, that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be
charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury and proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overruled a New Jersey law that provides an
``extended term'' of imprisonment if a trial judge finds, by a
preponderance of evidence, that the defendant acted to intimidate
an individual or group because of bias.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the basis for the extended term must be
found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury instead of being decided
by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling overturned a 12-year prison sentence imposed on a
white New Jersey man who fired shots into a black family's home in
1994. The man is entitled to a jury trial on whether he acted out
of racial bias, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said the case
was a question of procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Jersey procedure challenged in this case is an
unacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an
indispensable part of our criminal justice system,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislative scheme removes the jury from the
determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal
defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if
punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict
alone,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, Charles C. Apprendi Jr., was arrested for
firing shots into the home of a black family that had recently
moved into an all-white neighborhood in Vineland, N.J. Apprendi
made a statement _ which he later retracted _ that he shot at the
house because ``they (the residents) were black in color and he did
not want them in the neighborhood,'' the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to two counts of second degree
possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, which carries a
maximum penalty of five to 10 years in prison. None of the counts
referred to a hate crime statute, and none alleged that he acted
with a racially biased purpose.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trial judge concluded that there was enough
evidence to sentence Apprendi under the ``enhanced'' sentence for a
hate crime, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years, and Apprendi
challenged the sentence on the ground that it violated the
Constitution's due process clause.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rejected Apprendi's claim that the clause
requires that a bias finding be proved to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt, a decision that was affirmed by the New Jersey
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned those decisions
Monday, and ruled Apprendi is entitled to a trial by jury to
determine whether he acted out of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Stephen G. Breyer and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the dissenters, O'Connor said, ``Our court has long
recognized that not every fact that bears on a defendant's
punishment need be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury
and proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard P. Berkowitz, national chairman of the Anti-Defamation
League, said
</P>
<P>
   the ADL is disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling on this
particular statute, but applauds the court's continued support of
hate crimes legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court did not back away from its previous ruling that
bias-motivated crimes are among the most destructive to victims and
to society, and that perpetrators of these crimes deserve more
severe sentences,'' Berkowitz said. ``The decision merely clarifies
the appropriate standard of proof for sentencing.''

INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS INSPECT IRA WEAPONS DUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The Irish Republican Army announced Monday
that two international envoys appointed as weapons monitors had
inspected a number of its secret arms dumps, and the pair confirmed
the news in visits to the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors, Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of
Finland, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary general of the
African National Congress, reported to the two prime ministers that
they had seen ``a substantial amount of military material.'' They
said they had satisfied themselves that it was ``safely and
adequately stored'' and had made sure that ``the weapons and
explosives cannot be used without our detection.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they intended to revisit the hidden stockpiles
regularly to ensure that the weapons ``have remained secure'' and
noted that the clandestine guerrilla force had met all their
requests. ``The process that led to the first inspection visit and
the way in which it was carried out makes us believe that this is a
genuine effort by the IRA to advance the peace process,'' they
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The development was hailed by both Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
of Ireland and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain as a
significant advance in the effort to put into effect the terms of
the Northern Ireland peace settlement, which has been plagued by
the dispute over weapons. Blair stressed that the arms inspections
were a valuable ``confidence building measure'' but did not satisfy
the longer range goal of complete disarmament. ``It is not
decommissioning itself,'' he said. ``It is a step on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement fulfilled a promise made by the IRA in May in
response to demands that it move toward dismantling its arsenal in
exchange for Britain's restoring the authority of the new
Catholic-Protestant power-sharing Northern Ireland government. It
had been suspended in February over earlier IRA inaction on arms.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA also confirmed Monday that it had ended its four-month
boycott of the international disarmament commission led by a
Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain, and was cooperating with the
panel again. The commission is charged with determining whether the
disarmament envisioned in the agreement is satisfactorily carried
out and is the body to which Ramaphosa and Ahtisaari will report
their findings. It is formally independent of the British and Irish
governments, which sponsored the talks that led to the April 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA is thought to have an arsenal of automatic rifles,
pistols, machine guns, grenades, rocket launchers and ammunition
stashed in underground spots in woods and fields across Ireland and
in border areas of Northern Ireland. It was not known whether the
two high-profile inspectors were made aware of the exact locations
of the dumps they examined or what portion of the overall arms
cache they had inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari and Ramaphosa gave no details of how they had
satisfied themselves that the weaponry they saw would remain out of
use, but Ahern said the bunkers they had visited would be entombed
and re-examined periodically to make sure the seals had not been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said the
inspectors had given him ``a lot of confidence'' that the IRA did
not intend to remove or use weapons in the inspected dumps. ``There
is a device in place that would indicate whether or not that is the
case,'' Mandelson said. He said it was important not to disclose
more details because there were dissident republican groups who had
not declared cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   The two monitors said they had consulted arms-control
specialists with experience in inspecting and verifying weapons to
come up with ``credible'' means of doing the job themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
IRA, praised the IRA for being ``very, very courageous'' and called
Monday's action a ``huge step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, who is the deputy leader of the new home-rule Northern
Ireland Assembly, said, ``It marks another step in realizing the
full potential of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, and first minister of the legislature, was in the
Middle East and due back in the province on Tuesday. Sir Reg Empey,
an Ulster Unionist minister in the government and a close ally of
Trimble, said the announcement constituted a ``breakthrough'' but
cautioned, ``There is still a lot further to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the peace settlement were predictably harsher. ``I
have made it clear that the inspection of a few arms dumps does not
represent progress in itself,'' said Jeffrey Donaldson, an Ulster
Unionist challenger to Trimble's party leadership. The Rev. Ian
Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionists dismissed the development
as a ``complete and total gimmick, not a complete and total
cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups have observed
cease-fires for more than three years. For much of that time, the
IRA has argued that its success in silencing its guns should be
proof of its commitment to a peaceful resolution of Northern
Ireland's troubles. But more recently it has had to take steps like
the one announced Monday to meet insistent political demands for
taking guns out of the politics of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong feeling within the republican movement that
disarmament constitutes surrender, and it has made the IRA
extremely reluctant to turn over arms. Adams called the move to
permit inspections by independent outsiders an ``imaginative'' way
to meet the IRA's pledge last month to put its weapons ``completely
and verifiably beyond use.''

BANDS MAKING TRACKS FOR VIDEO GAMES IN HOPES OF BROADENING THEIR
FAN BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ During its April show at local punk-rock
pitstop the Galaxy Club, Suicide Machines singer Jason Navarro had
a question for the audience: ``Any of ya heard of Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater?''
</P>
<P>
   One might have expected a few hands to be raised. Rather, the
entire audience let out a collective howl.
</P>
<P>
   When the Detroit-based Machines launched into the track, one of
many that's featured on the popular skateboarding video-game for
the Sony PlayStation, several kids in the crowd sang along.
</P>
<P>
   That night perfectly epitomized the way video games and music
are becoming more entwined.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll through any video-game shop and you'll find dozens of new
PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast and PC games that feature music from
high-profile bands and artists, from well-established acts such as
the Chemical Brothers to new groups like Apartment 26 and the
Suicide Machines, and even veterans such as David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   Several tracks from David Bowie's last disc, hours ... are
featured in Eidos Interactive's action/adventure PC and Dreamcast
game, Omikron: The Nomad Soul.
</P>
<P>
   The PlayStation's destruction derby title Twisted Metal 4 uses
songs from metal pundit Rob Zombie and hip-hop outfit Cypress Hill,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Grind Session, a new skateboarding PlayStation title, contains a
smorgasbord of alternative rock tunes from Sonic Youth, Black Flag,
NOFX and KRS-One.
</P>
<P>
   Hugely popular punk outfits the Offspring and Bad Religion have
songs prominently featured in Sega Dreamcast's Crazy Taxi title.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage of games and music is, bands and game-industry
experts say, broadening the fan base of artists and giving the
games more depth. And the games and bands are reaping the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure's the No. 1 thing,'' says Suicide Machines bass
player Royce Nunley. ``Something like this is great if you're a new
band and you wanna get your music out there. Kids that play video
games may hear a song (on the game) they like, say, `Hey, this
sounds cool,' then go out and buy the record. It just leads to more
kids hearing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Having cool music pump in the background, as opposed to the
clinky music of video games of yore, adds a new dimension to the
gaming experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It benefits the games more than anything,'' says Umi Tangalin,
store manager for video-game shop Funcoland in Fort Worth. ``Used
to be, all you had was cheesy video-game music that looped over and
over. Now you have decent music that loops over and over. It
definitely sets a mood. The music on Tony Hawk gives you the
skateboarder feel. I used to skate and always had punk music on a
jambox playing. Tony Hawk really reminds me of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing cluster of games that tout tunes from name
brand artists, the intertwining of rock music and video-games dates
to the dawn of home gaming. Back in the '80s, lite-metal outfit
Journey, for instance, had its own game for the Atari 2600.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend really took off with the advent of the CD-based
Sony PlayStation home gaming unit and the rising popularity of PC
CD-ROM games. Road Rash, a PC and PlayStation title in which
players manned a maniacally driven motorcycle, was one of the first
games to use music from well-known artists, Pearl Jam among them.
</P>
<P>
   The titles that really opened the door to this trend, though,
were Wipeout and its sequel, Wipeout XL, a pair of futuristic,
Hovercraft-racing games for PlayStation that used hypnotic techno
tunes from the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy. An instrumental
version of the Prodigy's Breathe, spotlighted in Wipeout XL, helped
pave the way for the vocal version, which later became a hit for
the British techno band.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't surprise me,'' says Paul Baldwin, vice president
of marketing for Eidos Interactive, when told Wipeout XL helped
expose the Prodigy. ``If you look at the game consumer, the 18- to
34-year-old male, it's the same demographic for music as it is
games. People who buy games are just as aware of movies and music.
There are 50 million game systems in the U.S., so it's inevitable
they would converge.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do bands get picked for video games?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two ways,'' says Rob Alvarez, product manager for Sega of
America. ``They approach us, we approach them. But how we pick who
we're going to use depends on the game. We look at the content,
then evaluate what type of music fits in the game. It's like the
movie industry. They want to pick songs for a movie that set an
emotional tone. We try to do the same thing. We wanna create a
sense of fear, love, tension. We want to totally immerse the gamer
into a compelling world.''
</P>
<P>
   As Alvarez says, the trend is becoming so popular, several
artists are now approaching game companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jackson approached us about doing some music for the
new Ready to Rumble (wrestling game),'' says Baldwin. ``People like
him are realizing that gaming is a viable form of entertainment.
For a lot of people, it's their top choice of entertainment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many substances leave a bitter taste in the mouth. But how?
That's one of the questions that biologists are answering with data
from the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to decode the biological instruction set of humans
turned into a race between a private company, Celera Corp. of
Rockville, Md., and a public consortium of universities. But
participants on each side are now minimizing the occasionally
acrimonious competition and pointing to the ways that data from the
project is already transforming biology research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets a lot of attention, but it's a colossal distraction,''
said Dr. Eric Lander, director of the Whitehead Center for Genome
Research in Cambridge, Mass., a major participant in the
consortium. Emphasis on the race is diverting attention from the
important contributions genome data are already making, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even incomplete, the databases of DNA sequences are a treasure
trove for researchers, providing answers in a few minutes at a
computer terminal rather than after months of laborious, expensive
laboratory experiments. For pharmaceutical companies, that speeds
the development of new drugs with several promising compounds
already undergoing human clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   For university researchers, that opens up areas of inquiry that
would previously not have been worth the time and effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have democratized gene discovery,'' said Dr. Charles
Zuker, a professor of biology and neurosciences at University of
California in San Diego and an investigator at the university's
Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA sequence put together by the consortium now covers about
90 percent of the 3 billion ``letters'' contained in the genetic
blueprint of a human being, with new sequences added nightly.
Celera says its map is 99 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining gaps are important, Zuker said, only in the
unlikely event that a research target falls in one of the gaps.
That was not the case when Zuker and his collaborators looked for
the bitter-tasting genes.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness is often a warning to not eat a harmful substance,
but the chemical details of how some molecules latch onto taste
buds and dispatch a message of distaste to the brain are not well
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Two facts scientists already knew: Bitterness receptors likely
belonged to a family of molecules known as G protein-coupled
receptors, and the location of the gene that produces one of these
receptors lay along a section of Chromosome 5.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of G protein-coupled receptors is distinctive:
they thread up and down through the cell membrane, crossing seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went to this wonderful resource of databases of human
sequences,'' Zuker said, and searched for genes that produced
proteins with membrane-crossing signature.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the section of Chromosome 5, several hundred
thousand base pairs long, the researchers got lucky. ``Bingo, there
was one,'' Zuker said.
</P>
<P>
   Since many different substances taste bitter, the researchers
reasoned, there should be a family of bitterness receptors. So they
queried the database to see if it could find similar DNA sequences
elsewhere in the genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo,'' Zuker said, ``we found there was a whole set of human
genes that were related to this one member.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer has not completely replaced the laboratory. With
the genes identified, the researchers still needed to confirm that
cells with the genes responded to bitter substances, but the genome
databases reduced to half a year what would once have taken years.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic research consists of two phases: finding the gene, then
understanding how the gene works. Before the advent of the genome
databases, ``The hard labor was involved in the first phase,''
Zuker said, ``while really, ideally where you want to put your
effort is into understanding the function of the gene. This will
allow you to concentrate your effort into what is going to have the
greatest impact in biomedical research.''
</P>
<P>
   When researchers at SmithKline Beecham PLC, a pharmaceutical
manufacturer, went looking for an enzyme that sliced up a protein
into toxic fragments within the brains of Alzheimer's patients,
they too turned to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists knew of the enzyme's existence from the
protein-slicing damage it left behind, but had not identified the
culprit, which they named beta-secretase. The search for
beta-secretase has been littered with claims of discovery that were
disputed, then discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The SmithKline Beecham researchers suspected that beta-secretase
belonged to a family of proteins known as aspartic proteases. They
also knew that the enzyme acted near the membranes of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   So they plumbed computer databases of human DNA sequences,
looking for the encoding instructions of aspartic proteases that
also had a telltale structure that weaved the protein through cell
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The search turned up two candidate genes. One was on Chromosome
21, the chromosome duplicated in people with Down's syndrome and
who suffer similar tangles of protein in their brains.
</P>
<P>
   The other gene, on Chromosome 19, produced an enzyme that
matched the profile of beta-secretase, producing the expected
protein fragments.
</P>
<P>
   The identification of beta-secretase could lead to drugs to
thwart its activities that would be similar to the protease
inhibitors that block HIV from reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   The SmithKline Beecham researchers, one of four teams that
independently reported the discovery last fall, found the gene and
enzyme ``pretty quickly,'' said Dr. Colin Dingwall, assistant
director of molecular neurobiology at the company's laboratory in
Harlow, England. ``We were just searching databases, and it turned
up.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, before data from the genome database became
available, researchers at Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company in
Thousand Oaks, Calif., needed two years of tedious experiments to
find the same beta-secretase gene, first locating a string of about
100 genes containing the one they wanted, then homing in on the
gene through elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of change is absolutely incredible,'' said Dr.
Gillian Woollett, associate vice president for biologics and
biotechnology of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, a trade organization. ``It's actually changing the way
drug development is even conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences Inc. of Rockville, Md., takes an unusual
approach, looking for proteins, like insulin and human growth
hormone, that can be used as drugs. ``I call it the most natural
form of medicine,'' said Dr. William Haseltine, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has four drug candidates that have reached the
clinical trial stage, all derived from the company's proprietary
gene database.

   WHERE I-BUSINESS IS CONCERNED, HONEYWELL IS JUST GETTING STARTED
</P>
<P>
   BC-ECOM-HONEYWELL _ The Internet has become a miraculous
storehouse of information, a vast electronic mall, a link to Wall
Street. But for all the excitement over the prospect of an Internet
connection in every home, this is not where the big money is. What
companies spend buying and selling goods and services to one
another dwarfs consumer spending. The score last year was $14
trillion to $3 trillion. Here, a report on how large companies,
such as the industrial manufacturer Honeywell Inc., are beginning
to shift intercompany sales to the Internet. By Louis Uchitelle.

 UNDATED: gene database.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company announced on Friday that the Food and Drug
Administration had approved human tests of B-lymphocyte stimulator,
or BLyS, a protein that spurs the production of antibodies. BLyS
may prove helpful to patients with immune system disorders that
leave them vulnerable to infections.
</P>
<P>
   Genomes of other creatures can provide clues as well. At the
Whitehead Institute, Dr. Richard Young, professor of biology, can
track how the genes of the tuberculosis bacterium turn on and off
as it infects human cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In war, which is what this is, if you could monitor the
progress of both sides by monitoring all communications that are
going on on both sides _ from the smallest military unit up to the
supreme commander _ you'd have a very good picture of the different
tactics that are being employed,'' Young said. ``The results
suggest a potential clinical therapy for tuberculosis.''
</P>
<P>
   PathoGenesis Corp., a pharmaceutical company in Seattle, along
with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the University of
Washington Genome Center, sequenced the genome of the bacterium
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, hoping to find weaknesses that could lead
to new antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, the human genome proved useful, offering clues about
whether a potential antibiotic might also be toxic to people. ``Do
humans also have that gene?'' said Dr. Bruce Montgomery,
PathoGenesis' executive vice president of research and development.
``If so, that's not a good drug target. We're looking for something
the bacteria has and we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of genome information has also led drug researchers
to a new, seemingly backwards, approach: Instead of choosing a
disease, finding a gene defect associated with the disease and then
trying to devise a drug to counteract the defect, some researchers
now look for genes that appear amenable to drug treatment and then
try to figure out what diseases those drugs might cure.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in the traditional strategy is that finding the
gene is often a dead end, with no easy way to mend or bypass the
defect.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, one of the companies that have adopted this
new strategy, surveyed the 100 top-selling drugs and found that
most were aimed at a handful of types of proteins. The company's
scientists reasoned that other members of these protein families
might also prove to be highly profitable targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right pedigree,'' said Dr. Michael Jackson,
senior director for drug discovery of Johnson &AMP; Johnson. ``Certain
families have a tremendous track record. You'd be crazy not to take
note of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's researchers culled about 5,000 promising genes by
delving into the gene database put together by Incyte
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., even though Incyte's
database, unlike the work of Celera and the public consortium of
universities, includes only the 3 percent to 4 percent of the
genome that encodes proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson &AMP; Johnson scientists knew they could probably build
drugs aimed at the proteins made by the genes they selected, but
for the most part, they had no idea what these proteins did, or
even where in the body they were found.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about the genes' where and why, they created a
``DNA chip'' with samples of the 5,000 genes. The chip tests which
genes are turned on within a tissue sample. By compiling a vast
library of information about the genes, the scientists hope to
deduce their functions.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have already yielded one major find: a third
receptor for histamine, a chemical released in the body in response
to stress, inflammation and allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The two known histamine receptors had already inspired hugely
successful drugs. H-1 is the target of the anti-allergy medicines
Benadryl and Claritin. The H-2 receptor, which regulates the
release of stomach acid, is the target of Tagamet.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in 1983 suggested the existence of third,
undiscovered histamine receptor. ``Since then, there's been quite a
bit of work trying to explore what exactly is the H-3 receptor,
what are its functions, whether it is a potential drug target,''
said Dr. Tim Lovenberg of the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research
Institute in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Lovenberg was skimming through the
results of a search through the Incyte database when one piece
caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happened to spot a little tiny snip,'' Lovenberg said.
``It kind of clued us in it might be a novel receptor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experimental work showed that the gene fragment was
switched on in the brain. Then, looking in a database of genes
active in the thalamus part of the brain, Lovenberg's team found
the rest of the DNA sequence. ``When we looked at the rest of the
sequence, you could tell it was a receptor,'' he said. ``It was, at
that point, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   They then tested what chemicals cells with the gene responded
to. ``It only responded to histamine,'' Lovenberg said. ``That was
the end of the story there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson has already developed a compound to block the
H-3 receptor, causing the thalamus to increase its production of
histamines. That is believed to heighten wakefulness _ the reverse
of the drowsiness side effect of some antihistamines _ but the
researchers are not yet focusing on any specific medical
conditions. ``The plan is to do some experimental clinical work
based on what we think the role of an H-3 antagonist would do,''
Lovenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is still far from becoming a drug on the market,
but the 18 months between the spotting of the gene snippet and the
creation of a candidate H-3 blocker is far shorter than the usual
development time of several years.
</P>
<P>
   With the nearly complete DNA sequence, scientists can also begin
to consider the interplay between genes. Dr. Lawrence Salkoff, a
professor of neurobiology and genetics at Washington University in
St. Louis, is mapping out the genes that create channels that let
potassium atoms into and out of cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are like the transistors of the brain,'' Salkoff said.
``These are little switches that open and close and allow a current
to flow into or out of a cell,'' producing the electrical activity
that drives the brain and muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Salkoff is now looking at small worms known as nematodes, but
the findings appear to apply to higher animals, too. The 80
potassium channel genes in the nematode fall into the same eight
types as in mammals. ``What we conclude by this is that these genes
evolved into their present form in a common ancestor between worms
and man,'' Salkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the genome sequences, those comparisons would not have
been possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists always look where the light is good,'' said Lander
of the Whitehead Institute. ``The genome project has turned on the
lights on most of the genome. It's worth looking now.''

   BC-ECOM-HONEYWELL _ The Internet has become a miraculous
storehouse of information, a vast electronic mall, a link to Wall
Street. But for all the excitement over the prospect of an Internet
connection in every home, this is not where the big money is. What
companies spend buying and selling goods and services to one
another dwarfs consumer spending. The score last year was $14
trillion to $3 trillion. Here, a report on how large companies,
such as the industrial manufacturer Honeywell Inc., are beginning
to shift intercompany sales to the Internet. By Louis Uchitelle.

   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ In a watershed in the history of
science, two rival groups of researchers said Monday that they had
deciphered the genome, the set of genetic instructions that defines
the human organism. ``Today we are learning the language in which
God created life,'' President Clinton said at a White House
ceremony attended by members of the two teams. The two leaders of
the teams, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera, and Dr.
Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, praised each other's contributions and signaled a spirit
of cooperation, even though the two efforts will remain firmly
independent. And both sought to capture the wider meaning of their
work, the eye-glazing stream of letters representing the four bases
in the genome's chemical code. ``We have caught the first glimpses
of our instruction book, previously known only to God,'' said
Collins. Venter spoke of his conviction, from seeing people die as
a medical corpsman in Vietnam, that the human spirit transcended
the physiology that is controlled by the genome. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-GENOME-ASSESS (Undated) _ The human genome, the sum of all
genetic material encased in nearly every cell of the human body, is
very, very long _ at least 3 billion chemical letters long, as many
letters as you'd find in 9,000 copies of the entire Sunday New York
Times. The human genome is pithy. The English alphabet has 26
letters, the Russian 33 letters, and Japanese 1,850 symbols. Yet
with just four distinct characters at its disposal, four nucleic
acid bases, the human genome has given rise to the creators of
every language uttered, every ballad sung, every Pokemon card
traded. The human genome is a pigsty, bulging with non-genes,
ex-genes, freeloader genes, viral detritus, pocket lint and chewing
gum. All but a few percent of it appears to be doing nothing at
all. The human genome is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. Millions of times a year, egg genome meets sperm
genome, and the result is a human baby, its parts all in place, its
brain a universe of love and meaning. In short, the human genome
exults in contradictions. By Natalie Angier.

   SCOTUS-MIRANDA (Washington) _ The Supreme Court reaffirmed the
Miranda decision Monday by a 7-2 vote, ruling that because the 1966
landmark ``announced a constitutional rule,'' a statute by which
Congress sought to overrule the decision was itself
unconstitutional. With a majority opinion by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the decision removed a growing shadow over the Miranda
ruling, cast by a combination of a long-ignored law by which
Congress had tried to overrule it 32 years ago as well as the
current court's perceived hostility to the original decision. The
chief justice said that the 1968 law, which replaced the famous
Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of whether a confession
was voluntary, could be upheld only if the Supreme Court itself
decided to overturn Miranda. By Linda Greenhouse.

   BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ President Clinton said Monday that
the federal budget surplus over the next decade will be nearly $1.3

presidential candidates battle over tax cuts, spending and how to
prepare for the nation's long-term challenges. By Richard W.

   NIRELAND-IRA (Dublin, Ireland) _ The Irish Republican Army
announced Monday that two international envoys appointed as weapons
monitors had inspected a number of its secret arms dumps, and the
pair confirmed the news in visits to Prime Minister Tony Blair in
London and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, here. The
announcement fulfilled a promise made by the IRA in May in response
to demands that it make moves toward dismantling its arsenal in
exchange for Britain's restoring the authority of the new
Catholic-Protestant, power-sharing Northern Ireland government. It
had been suspended in February over earlier IRA inaction on arms.
The IRA also confirmed Monday that it had ended its four-month
boycott of the international disarmament commission led by a
Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain, and was actively cooperating
with the panel again. By Warren Hoge.

   ISRAEL-SHARANSKY (Jerusalem) _ It has been 14 years since
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky began making the transition from
icon to man when he emigrated to Israel. It has been four since he
morphed further from man to politician. But his experience as a
prisoner of conscience in the former Soviet Union not only stamped
him forever, it also shaped others' expectations of him in
unyielding ways. To Israelis and to many Jews worldwide, Sharansky
is somewhat frozen in time behind the bars where he sat for nine
years while they invested in him as a hero and fought for his
freedom. And everything that he does is judged as a return on that
investment, which means some amount of disappointment for everyone,
left and right, secular and religious. By Deborah Sontag.

   NY-BRONX-DEVELOP (New York) _ A Special Report: The Banana Kelly
Community Improvement Association, a nonprofit group once praised
as a national model for local residents who want to reclaim lost
neighborhoods, is in trouble. Its properties are deteriorating,
projects go unrealized, staff turnover is high, it is not doing a
good job of collecting rents, it has missed tax advantages and owes
nearly $1 million for water and sewer services, $500,000 in real
estate taxes and an oil company is looking to collect $127,000 for
heating oil. Yet while employees were scrounging to collect money
to make the payroll, Yolanda Rivera, the chief executive of Banana
Kelly, and a few of her associates were traveling, as part of an
international venture the group established several years ago. By
Amy Waldman. (2800 words)

   DANBURY, Conn. _ Think of the Internet. The imagery that comes
to mind is romantic and exciting: dot-com billionaires barely out
of school and colorful Web sites offering all sorts of wares and
intriguing ways to shop. What definitely does not come to mind are
Sherrell Coppedge and Kara Sylvia, seated recently at two ordinary
desktop computers in a plain, windowless room at Honeywell Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For eight weeks, four hours a day, Coppedge and Sylvia have been
trying to trip up the new Internet ordering system that Honeywell's
consumer products group, based here, is installing. Soon 2,000
customers _ auto dealers, parts distributors, lube centers, retail
chains _ will be logging on to Web sites to place orders for
Autolite spark plugs, Fram oil filters and Prestone antifreeze. No
more orders by telephone or by fax, and much less paperwork. But
first, the speedy new system has to function.
</P>
<P>
   Working from thick loose-leaf notebooks, Coppedge, 34, and
Sylvia, 26, carefully type in complicated, quirky orders, each a
probe for shortcomings in the system's software. When a flaw
appears, Jon Nehlsen, a 25-year-old Internet specialist, takes
charge of the fix. All three are salaried employees earning less
than six figures, the two women much less. None of the windfalls
from wildly lucrative dot-com stock offerings come their way. And
yet they and thousands like them are laboriously making the
Internet a backbone of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, with its endless Web sites, is already a
miraculous storehouse of information, an instant communicator, a
new medium, a vast electronic shopping mall, a link to Wall Street.
But for all the excitement over the prospect of an Internet
connection in every home, this is not where the big money is. What
companies spend buying and selling goods and services to one
another dwarfs consumer spending. The score last year was $14
trillion to $3 trillion. Like Honeywell, brick-and-mortar companies
are just beginning to shift these intercompany sales to the
Internet. Until they make the full transition, the Internet age
will not truly have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   And it is slow in coming. A lot more is involved than just
logging on. Honeywell's consumer products group, for example, has
three disparate, aging computer systems that track 17 factories and
more than $1 billion in annual sales. Getting those computers to
talk to other companies through the Internet is not easy. When
Coppedge and Sylvia _ simulating outsiders _ hit a trouble spot, it
is often because one of their orders placed through a Web site
failed to enter the company's internal computers. Some version of
Honeywell's painful progress is popping up everywhere in corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lion's share of American companies are in the throes of
this conversion,'' said Clyde R. Moore, chief executive of the
Thomas &AMP; Betts Corp. in Memphis, which makes electrical switches
and connectors. A multi-million computer investment is just being
completed. The more sophisticated system updates the company's
inventories more quickly than before, for example, thus reducing
the risk of selling a connector over the Internet that is not in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites for consumers are easier to create, and many companies
now have them. They put these sites on computers dedicated to the
Internet. A car buff, for example, can pull up a Honeywell site and
find the filter he needs to change the oil in his car himself.
Punch in a ZIP code and the site lists the nearest retail outlets
selling the filter _ along with maps and directions on how to get
there. The entire database is maintained separately from
Honeywell's internal computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer is clearly the hare in this race. Still, the
tortoise, even in this difficult early stage, has already moved out
front. Intercompany transactions over the Internet totaled $90
billion last year, a drop in the bucket given the potential but
nevertheless more than five times the $16.7 billion that consumers
spent over the Internet, according to the Gartner Group, a
consulting firm that tracks such data. The $16.7 billion included
brokerage fees to trade stocks online.
</P>
<P>
   But what route the tortoise will take to the finish line is
still unclear. Business-to-business commerce over the Internet
means that companies will have access to the data in one another's
computers, like access to a stranger's bedroom. ``What the Internet
does is make the boundaries between companies much more fuzzy,''
said Paul Osterman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management. With boundaries fading,
mergers, and challenges to antitrust law, may multiply.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also giving fresh impetus to trends already well
under way. American companies, for example, find that the Internet
gives them easier access to suppliers overseas. Competitive
Internet auctions are forcing suppliers, here and abroad, to cut
prices more than in the past. And stockpiles of unsold goods _ a
burden in hard times _ are likely to shrink; the Internet helps
companies place smaller orders more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   There is one unambiguous benefit: labor productivity. The
Internet should make possible more output, or at least the same
output, from fewer hours of work. The 28 employees in Honeywell's
consumer products group who now take orders by fax and phone will
eventually be reassigned, their tasks automated as corporate
customers shift to ordering online _ 2,000 this year and the
remaining 2,000 thereafter. Some of the 28 might be reassigned as
traveling sales reps to sign up more customers. Business would then
grow without having to hire more workers, another gain in labor
output.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential exists for the nation to achieve real
productivity gains,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University
economist. The gains are just beginning to kick in, Blinder noted,
as business-to-business commerce over the Internet _ almost
nonexistent in 1997 _ finally takes hold and spreads.
</P>
<P>
   More noticeably, the incipient Internet age is breeding a new
type of electronic marketplace. Beyond one company selling goods or
services to another, companies in the same industry are offering
their products jointly on a common Web site, inviting buyers to
choose from among their joint offerings. A new marketplace, to sell
plywood or chemicals or steel or accounting services, is announced
almost weekly. Honeywell's avionics division is participating in
one, to sell aircraft parts and repair services. The main customers
are airlines and the owners of corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are also setting up joint marketplaces, the best known
being one announced earlier this year by General Motors, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler. Most of the $240 billion a year in parts and
materials that the Big Three purchase to make vehicles are to be
listed on common Web sites, and thousands of suppliers will bid
online for the business, almost certainly pushing down their
prices.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch, however. Lacking expertise, the
brick-and-mortar companies are relying on outside contractors to
design and maintain their electronic marketplaces. Often the
contractors are young, profitless dot-coms scrambling for a
permanent foothold. Whether they will share in the control of these
marketplaces, and the revenue they generate, or simply collect fees
as technical agents is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, for example, took the lead in setting up the
marketplace for aircraft parts and repair services but offered
shares to the United Technologies Corp., another big maker of
aircraft parts. ``To attract the likes of United Technologies, we
had to be willing to share ownership,'' said Michael R. Bonsignore,
Honeywell's chief executive. The necessary expertise in Internet
technology _ to set up and run the marketplace _ comes from a
start-up, i2 Technology, which also has an ownership stake but not
much leverage. It lacks any merchandise to sell on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few dot-coms are trying to mimic the New York Stock
Exchange, which owns and runs the principal trading house for
corporate stocks. FreeMarkets Inc. in Pittsburgh is in hot pursuit
of this goal. Big manufacturers like Emerson Electric, Honeywell
and United Technologies now turn regularly to FreeMarkets to round
up suppliers, who then bid against one another on auction-style Web
sites set up by FreeMarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our FreeMarkets is going to be a major node, and we are now a
major business-to-business marketplace,'' said Glen Meakem, the
35-year-old founder and chief executive, whose four-year-old
company, for all its success, is losing money. ``We are too far
along for that to be taken away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   From the early days of the Industrial Revolution, business has
struggled with the problem of unwanted inventories, which are the
stockpiling of goods that later cannot be sold. Computers have
helped to keep inventories in check, and now business-to-business
commerce over the Internet offers corporate America, particularly
manufacturers, a new and perhaps powerful tool in this struggle.
That is because the Internet is turning out to be the least
expensive system developed, so far, in which companies can talk to
one another through their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But to hold down inventories, the hookup has to go in two
directions: to customers at one end, as Honeywell's consumer
products group is doing with its new order system, and to suppliers
at the other end. Then when one of Honeywell's customers _ the
Jiffy Lube chain, for example _ orders a thousand oil filters, the
suppliers at the other end will instantly know this and begin to
make the metal casings, filter elements and tops, shipping them to
Honeywell factories for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The broad goal is to manufacture only what is needed, when it is
needed. In good economic times, companies everywhere have tended to
overproduce and stockpile, fearful _ for lack of timely information
_ that they could not meet a flood of orders. These are good times,
and Honeywell still has ``$3.5 billion in working capital tied up
in inventory,'' Bonsignore said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockpiles, although smaller than in the past, are still a
shadow over the economy. When slowdowns inevitably arrive,
production is cut back abruptly, exacerbating the hard times until
inventories are reduced. The great hope is that production swings
in the Internet age will be less abrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet hookups that link customers to their suppliers
are still in their infancy. Only a few companies have completed the
process: I.B.M., for example, and Wal-Mart. A decade ago, before
the Internet, Wal-Mart connected the cash registers in its stores
to its thousands of suppliers so that a shirt sold in Omaha
registered with the company that made it in South Carolina. That
pioneering system, however, required a huge investment in special
computers and dedicated phone lines. Few other companies matched
Wal-Mart's achievement, and in 1998 Wal-Mart itself switched its
network entirely to the less expensive, more flexible Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Most American companies are more like Honeywell than Wal-Mart.
Honeywell's consumer products group is only now about to go online
with its order system for business customers, and its avionics
group in Olathe, Kan., only recently hooked into the computers at
Cessna, a big customer for the cockpit controls and navigational
devices that Honeywell makes.
</P>
<P>
   Far more quickly than in the past, Honeywell is now privy to
Cessna's shifting production schedule _ not only how many planes
Cessna will make in the months ahead, but also how many of each
model and their delivery dates. ``Honeywell takes this data, runs
it through its computers and explodes it down to parts numbers for
its suppliers,'' said David Oppenheim, Cessna's supply chain
manager and chief of its e-business.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. The explosion down to Honeywell's suppliers has not
happened yet. But it will soon, the company promises. Links through
the Internet to 12 of its 800 suppliers are about to go live. In a
conference room at the avionics group's headquarters in Olathe,
Jeffrey C. Small, manager of supply chain infrastructure, recently
demonstrated the new system, flashing Web sites from his laptop on
to a big white screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day when a supplier logs on, he will see his situation
with us,'' Small said, displaying a dummy supplier Web site filled
with hyphenated parts numbers, new and old orders, parts needed
quickly, others needed not so quickly. ``It has taken 18 months to
develop this system and it seems like it has taken forever.''
</P>
<P>
   More visible is the Internet auction house operated by
FreeMarkets. The auctions are a novelty even for a technology full
of novelties. Suppliers worldwide bid over Web sites on their
laptop computers. Giant mother versions of these Web sites, several
feet high, cover most of a wall at FreeMarkets' headquarters in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   As the bidding proceeds from the laptops, the numbers change on
the mother Web sites, which have bluish backgrounds that glow in a
slightly darkened room the size and shape of a small college
lecture hall. As the auction proceeds, sometimes for three hours,
young people (average age 31) counsel the bidders by telephone.
They have designed the Web sites to call attention to the big
justification for Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent column of numbers tells the big corporate buyer
how much money the company is saving from the last time it bought
this particular item. More often than not, that last purchase was
pre-Internet style, through sealed bids. Opening these envelopes,
the buyer then chose the lowest one. In the Internet auction, the
competing suppliers see one another's bids. And if the falling
numbers are not prod enough to keep shaving bids, separate graphs
on the glowing Web sites plot the action downward.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell's avionics group, in this new world, saved $400,000,
or 19.5 percent, in the May purchase of various parts for $1.7
million. Owens Corning bought $24 million worth of corrugated
packaging through an online auction, saving 7 percent. And the
Carrier Corp. saved 16 percent on the purchase of air-conditioner
motors, mostly from Asian suppliers for the company's Asian
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier's parent, United Technologies, has bought a stake in
FreeMarkets, which has frequently issued new stock to raise much
needed capital. That may help to explain the enthusiasm of Edward
Williams, Carrier's vice president for purchasing. ``We spend $3
billion a year on suppliers, and we are running $100 million of
this through FreeMarkets,'' he said. ``I would like to keep that
number growing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is less talked about are two changes in American business
practices that the Internet auctions encourage. One is the tendency
to ignore long-term relationships with suppliers and award the
business to the qualified bidder offering the lowest price, or to
the long-term supplier if it cuts its bid. Japanese companies had
favored long-term relationships with suppliers, without forcing
them to discount, and in the 1980's, when corporate Japan seemed so
successful, American companies went that way, too. Now the pendulum
is swinging back, thanks in part to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese companies tried to partner a lot,'' Meakem of
FreeMarkets said, ``and the Asian crisis proved that noneconomic
cozy relationships don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The other change is the new encouragement to seek less expensive
suppliers overseas, a trend well under way before the Internet. The
Internet makes worldwide bidding feasible and dramatic, although
the recruiting of overseas suppliers remains a rather old-fashioned
task. Half of FreeMarkets' 497 employees spend their time not
running electronic auctions but searching for suppliers in
trade-association directories and trips abroad, painstakingly
building up a huge database of potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the May auction, Honeywell's avionics group
received from FreeMarkets a list of 600 possible bidders from this
database. By auction day, the list had been trimmed to 22 that met
Honeywell's standards, some from as far away as Israel and China.
That was still far more than the three or four suppliers that
traditionally mailed in sealed bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason why we could not have recruited many more
suppliers in the past if we had made the effort,'' said Doug
McCambridge, e-business project manager at Honeywell's avionics
group. ``The Internet is now pushing us to make the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: SMALL CHANGES START TO ADD UP
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, with its easy accessibility, is generating various
small corporate efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb Corp., the big insurer, for example, provides workers'
compensation insurance to multinational corporations at their sites
worldwide. Before the Internet, the executives in charge of
workers' compensation at Chubb's client corporations gathered
information about accidents by telephone, fax, e-mail, even floppy
disks mailed to the home office.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Chubb's claims adjusters arrived by similar routes.
With the data finally entered in a central computer, the executives
could pinpoint the most frequent types of accidents, where they
occurred most often and other trends that, if reversed, might
reduce accidents and thus the company's insurance premiums. Now Web
sites set up by Chubb provide all this information more quickly, in
greater detail and with new analytical tools for spotting trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is leveraging a public infrastructure just
as truckers leverage public highways,'' said Doug Nordstrom,
Chubb's manager of business technology planning. ``And our
customers are demanding that we use the Internet to give them
information in real time. If you don't give it, you are at a
disadvantage. Someone else will and take away the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Controls Inc. in Milwaukee, which makes temperature
controls and other products, uses Web sites to help its field
representatives repair controls installed in commercial buildings
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The field representative logs on to a company Web site and
``accesses our huge database until he finds a similar problem and
solution,'' said James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls.
There is much less need for costly experts at the other end of a
phone line to answer a representative's questions, Keyes added,
``and the repair job is faster.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 8 a.m. Thursday, May 4. Nervous, bleary-eyed,
already highly caffeinated, 21 finalists in the Texas Venture
Capitalist Conference wait for the lineup at the Four Seasons
Hotel. Today they will pitch their business plans, each in a span
of 10 minutes, each hoping to secure the start-up money to become
an overnight Internet success, complete with initial public
offering and a listing on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The partners in WebTaggers.com _ Rudy Rouhana, 24, Sean
McCullough, 25, and his twin brother, Craig _ have been working
nonstop toward this moment since last July, when Rouhana and Sean
McCullough, graduates of New Mexico Tech University, ran into each
other in Austin, had a beer and tossed around ideas for a new
company.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea had to do with posting messages on Web pages,
but that has evolved. Now the company's business plan describes
WebTaggers as ``an application service provider that delivers
highly targeted content for e-merchants,'' enabling retailers from
Barnes &AMP; Noble way down to Bob's Books to learn the preferences of
potential customers who surf their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   WebTaggers had to clear high hurdles to get here. Two-hundred
twenty companies across the nation applied for a place at this
morning's conference, according to David Gerhardt, the president of
Capital Network, the nonprofit economic development firm in Austin
that organized it. Capital Network's team of early-stage investors
winnowed that number to 21.
</P>
<P>
   On this warm and humid May morning, WebTaggers' three
principals, along with David Chevalier, their 45-year-old chief
executive, are putting the finishing touches on Chevalier's
10-minute pitch. For the last 18 hours they have allowed me to
observe their last-minute preparations, and between cups of
lukewarm coffee and frantic phone calls, they have been filling me
in on their short, eventful history.
</P>
<P>
   The three young partners made their first official move last
August, hiring a law firm _ Gray Cary Ware &AMP; Freidenrich of San
Diego _ and working on patent issues. By fall, they had raised
their first million dollars in venture capital, from an Austin
company called AVLabs.
</P>
<P>
   From that experience, Rouhana said, he and his partners learned
an interesting business principle: ``Once you have a venture
capitalist, everyone wants to start dating you.''
</P>
<P>
   AVLabs took the partners through a ``think and drink''
conference, at which potential investors and chief executives meet
entrepreneurs over a cocktail to see whether they are a good match.
(As Sean McCullough later noted, ``We were asked if we were old
enough to drink.'')
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, they met Chevalier. They needed a leader, said
Rob Adams, the founder of AVLabs, adding, ``They were
optimistically naive _ they didn't know what they didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier, a tall, dapper former vice president at Dell
Computers who has led six other start-ups to success, stepped on
board Dec. 1. His job was to develop the company's structure, hire
people and, most important, get financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain stages,'' he said, ``CEOs of dot-coms spend 90
percent of their time raising money.'' And that is his job today,
at what he calls the ``beauty pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In that 10-minute pitch I've got to give the whole story,''
Chevalier said. ``And ask for $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4 P.M. WEDNESDAY, MAY 3 &LR;  Seventeen hours to go. Craig
McCullough, tired, head in hands, sits in WebTaggers' office in
north Austin in front of a computer, barely keeping his eyes open.
Computers are everywhere; desks are strewn with papers.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McCullough, slim, quiet, with a goatee and a nose stud, is
reviewing resumes for the six positions they must fill. Rouhana,
tall, confident, eager and sharp-witted, is on the phone talking to
potential investors who are not part of the venture capital
conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8 P.M. &LR;  Craig McCullough takes the business plan to a printing
shop downtown to make copies. Chevalier is rehearsing his pitch on
his trip back to Austin from San Francisco, where he has just met
with another start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McCullough and Joe Gorman, the company's marketing
director, are writing final code and planning screen shots for the
company demos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9:30 P.M. &LR;  Tomorrow's audience, the venture capitalists, are in
the lounge of the Four Seasons. They are well groomed and
prosperous looking: casually dressed but exuding confidence. They
are here to have a good time, drinking in the lounge, but are
restless, as though ready and eager for the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Rouhana is here, working the venture capitalists. He talks shop
with Bryan Steffen, of the Berthel Fisher Co. A round of drinks
arrives. Nobody seems daunted by Rouhana's clothing, which is pure
grunge: T-shirt and baggy, faded olive-drab military pants. (At the
pitch the next morning, he will be wearing the same outfit.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11 P.M. &LR;  Throughout the night, phone calls have been flying
back and forth. At 11, Rouhana learns there is a problem with the
printing job for the business plan: the shop, backlogged, does not
have the right binders.
</P>
<P>
   Craig McCullough and WebTaggers' network administrator, Vance
Shtraikh, roll up their sleeves and head over to help with the
print job. Back at the hotel suite, Sean McCullough is trying to
open a port on WebTaggers' server: They must be able to connect
from the hotel to show the demos. Sometime after midnight, Sean
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2 A.M. THURSDAY &LR;  The partners have connected with Chevalier,
whose flight from Dallas was delayed and who has just made the
four-hour drive to Austin in a rental car. He had been told by the
event's sponsors that on the night before the pitch, there would be
a dress rehearsal of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `No problem, you guys come in any time _ we'll be
there,''' Chevalier said. ``Well, with all my flight delays and
having to drive from Dallas, I ended up at the Four Seasons at
midnight or 1 in the morning, and nobody was there in the hotel
ballroom. Basically it was just me and all the hotel employees,
setting up the chairs and tables. And so I said the hell with it. I
just got up and rehearsed my pitch on my own to the hotel
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3, after debating whether to try to get some sleep, the
partners and Chevalier decide to get breakfast at an all-night
diner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7 A.M. &LR;  The conference kicks off with a buffet breakfast. A
Nasdaq representative, Chris Santiago, tells the audience how the
exchange has added 228 companies just since January.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, but is anyone paying attention? People look up,
acknowledge that he is talking, turn back to their tablemates and
sip their coffee. Eyes skirt the room; the venture capitalists seem
to be wondering, ``Who should I be talking to here?''
</P>
<P>
   The room is awash in business cards floating from hand to hand.
In the lobby during the presentations, there is a friendly
competition among the service providers, and perhaps a biting envy
lurking beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and accountants have booths with slick slogans
(``Winning Matters''). They smell money and are dying to land these
new companies as clients. At one law firm booth, representatives,
friendly at first, offer me a book on Silicon Valley; when they
realize I am not a presenter, they dismiss me with a curt ``Enjoy
your book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8:01 A.M. &LR;  One hour until showtime. Craig McCullough calls
Rouhana from the print shop. The business-plan copies are done at
last. Chevalier is suited up and ready for the pitch, so ready that
he sits in on the four other company pitches before his.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9:18 A.M. &LR;  Chevalier speaks before an audience of more than 600
investors, developers, service providers, lawyers, accountants and
others. He opens with a joke about an incident involving his
family, but it is his delivery that is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the presenters, who cling to the lectern, he uses
the front of the room as a stage, walking confidently around as he
speaks. He seems to know intuitively what the venture capitalists
want to hear. ``Very smooth,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a success? The WebTaggers guys say they will not know
until the wire transfer date, Aug. 15, when WebTaggers anticipates
that funds from investors will have traded hands.
</P>
<P>
   After that? Jan. 1, 2001, the ``fume date,'' which no one really
wants to think about _ the point at which, if no venture capital is
coming in, the partners must admit defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not going to happen,'' Chevalier said, and there
was reason to hope that he was right. Though the recent skid in
technology stocks has made venture capitalists want to ``look for
deals only with bulletproof economic models,'' as he put it in an
interview in late May, the company is showing a profit. And any day
now, it is expecting to receive its first formal proposals from a
short list of potential investors.

COUNTERMANDING MILITARY, MOSCOW RENEWS ATTACKS ON CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One day after a top military commander announced a halt
to artillery and air strikes in Chechnya, the Kremlin said Monday
that the attacks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal raised questions about the military's
pronouncements and was a setback for the government effort to win
Western understanding for its military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col.
Gen. Gennadi Troshev, said his troops were suspending major combat
operations, including air and artillery strikes. Troshev commented
after meeting Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen official whom President
Vladimir Putin chose this month to administer Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the common conclusion that the war, as such, is
over on the territory of Chechnya,'' Troshev said. ``An agreement
was reached that the Unified Army Group is not conducting offensive
operations and not carrying out aviation or artillery strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were consistent with the Kremlin's basic line that
the war would soon be won and that the republic would soon return
to peaceful life. But the promise of a moratorium on artillery and
air strikes was new and appeared calculated to boost Kadyrov's
standing with the Chechen public.
</P>
<P>
   Although he opposed the Russians in the first Chechen war, from
1994 to 1996, Kadyrov cooperated with Moscow after the second
Russian military intervention, in September.
</P>
<P>
   Aslan Maskhadov, president of the breakaway Chechen republic
before the intervention, has condemned him as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov has been trying to present himself as a unifying figure
in Chechnya and to mobilize opposition to Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev's comments also appeared calculated to ease Western
concerns, particularly on the part of the Council of Europe. At the
council, representatives have criticized the Russian military for
carrying out indiscriminate attacks in Chechnya and they have
discussed whether to expel Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy recently led a
delegation from the council to Russia. Russian officials assured
him that the military was scaling back its operations in Chechnya.
Apparently persuaded, Dini said over the weekend that Moscow had
declared a ``de facto cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday it turned out there was no cease-fire, de facto or
otherwise. The bombing continued as usual, as SU-25 planes and
helicopters hit rebel positions in the mountains. Russian news
agencies reported that dozens of air attacks had been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian government, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
scrambled to explain and qualify Troshev's comments. In an
interview, Yastrzhembsky said the government was not presenting a
new initiative. Rather, he suggested, Troshev had merely been
trying to describe the fact that the military is relying less on
artillery and air strikes as the rebels have increasingly turned to
guerrilla tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no particular initiative, only a confirmation of the
current state of affairs,'' Yastrzhembsky said, adding that he
spoke to Troshev Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said the military would continue to use artillery,
but that it ``would be conducted on rare occasions and outside of
populated areas.'' Russian forces would also continue air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only natural that if militants are seen in the forest,
we will use aviation and artillery,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of troops had been withdrawn from Chechnya,
he said, but did not provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's field generals have become accustomed to appearing on
television, giving news conferences and making pronouncements,
often eclipsing the civilians in Moscow. Their comments have not
always been consistent with those of military or civilian spokesmen
in Moscow, adding confusion to the already jumbled situation in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, military commanders have said there had been
information that the rebel commander, Shamil Basayev, was dead and
that Maskhadov was wounded, assertions that have yet to be
confirmed, and the commanders have sometimes clashed with other
pronouncements in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev's comments on Sunday were taken seriously because he was
so explicit and because he was talking about forces under his
direct command. Troshev, a generally garrulous officer, was quiet
Monday, allowing the Kremlin to do all the talking.

   It was that long ago that the 150-foot, steam-powered paddle
wheel Mittie Stephens, loaded with hay, cotton and gunpowder,
burned and sank in Caddo Lake about midnight Feb. 11, 1867. Sixty
of the 100 passengers and crew drowned.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, Palmore, 52, a licensed riverboat pilot,
moved from her home in Tyler to Uncertain in far East Texas, with a
certain goal. She wanted to hunt for pieces of the wreck. She
immersed herself in the lake, searching in the murk for artifacts.
Caddo is a 26,700-acre maze of channels, and the lake twists and
turns around fingers of bayou. Palmore searched just one portion of
the lake. Its depth fluctuates, and always has. These days it is
mostly about 6 feet deep. She'd break the lily pad-laden surface as
she came up for air, then dive again. She never found a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mittie Stephens remains in an uncertain place.
</P>
<P>
   And Palmore is not certain where _ or if _ she'll ever find any
remnants of the wreck. Meanwhile, she's found something else
instead in the small town bearing the Uncertain name.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain, Texas, lies at 32 degrees latitude and 94 degrees
longitude on the shores of Caddo Lake, near the Louisiana and
Arkansas borders. Nowadays TV broadcasters insist on calling the
border area by the ungainly name of ``Arklatex.'' Locals don't. Not
in Uncertain or along Big Cypress Bayou or near any of the
wonderfully named regions of Caddo Lake _ Whangdoodle Pass,
Whistleberry Slough, Devil's Elbow or Death Hole.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the semitropical environs of Uncertain are ``Texas.''
It just looks a lot like postcards of Louisiana bayous.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain has its roots as a place where definitions _
certainties _ shift like the shadows of the swaying Spanish moss.
Governments couldn't agree on who owned the region. Steamboats
couldn't always navigate the fluctuating lake levels or find
landings.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1800s, the flag of Spain flew over Texas. To the
east, the United States had staked out the Louisiana Territory. The
border between the Spanish and U.S. territories was disputed. The
area that is now Shelby, Panola and Harrison counties of Texas was
then a lawless place known as the neutral ground, where no one knew
their legal nationality. When Texas became a state in 1845, the
border between Louisiana and Texas was drawn and split the lake
between the two states.
</P>
<P>
   Steamboats making their way from New Orleans and Shreveport to
Jefferson, north of Caddo Lake on Big Cypress Bayou, passed by the
region in the mid- to late-1800s. Then, before lake levels dropped
enough to hinder navigation, Jefferson became the second largest
port in Texas, after Galveston. But more than one steamboat sank in
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Duck hunters and bass fisherman started setting up camps along
Caddo Lake in an area known as Uncertain Landing, believed to have
been named because the fluctuating water levels made docking an
iffy prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changed in Uncertain for about a half-century. A cluster
of buildings along the shore made up a rustic resort. Then W.L.
``Beer'' Smith came to the area in the 1950s with ideas on how to
enlarge Uncertain. He built an air strip to attract visitors,
although the prospect of an ``Uncertain Airport'' must have made
some pilots balk. He wanted to build a better water system, because
existing wells were uncertain to yield clean water. He wanted to
run a liquor store, but liquor sales were illegal in Harrison
County. Anyone who wanted a drink rowed out to ``beer boats'' that
moored mid-lake. So Smith led the effort to incorporate Uncertain
in the early 1960s, his daughter, Dottie Carter, 61, says.

&HT;     BUSH URGES RULE CHANGE TO HELP IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ENTER U.S.  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a leading Hispanic
American organization Monday that he wants to change immigration
rules to make it easier for foreign nationals to join their
families already in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also told several hundred delegates at the annual
convention of the League of United Latin American Citizens that, if
elected president, he would press Congress to breakup the
Immigration and Naturalization Service into two separate agencies.
One agency would include the U.S. Border Patrol and would combat
illegal immigration and the other agency would expedite the
applications of legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, sprinkling his remarks with phrases in Spanish, said U.S.
immigration regulations should be changed to reflect ``family
values'' by permitting immediate family members of legal permanent
residents in the United States to obtain visitor visas while
waiting permanent entry to join their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department about 1.1 million spouses and children
under 18 have won approval to reside in the United States with
relatives who are either U.S. citizens or are legal permanent
residents. But the approved immigrants often wait for years to
permanently enter the United States under the annual worldwide
quota of 425,000 for all family members seeking entry in the United
States to take up permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, echoed
traditional Republican calls for ``tough'' enforcement measures
against illegal immigration along America's borders, calling
enforcement the ``responsibility'' of government.
</P>
<P>
   But he said enforcement needs to be carried out in ``a humane
way'' and emphasized that the INS has equal responsibility to
expedite the processing of legal immigrants entering the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as people are coming to feed their families, our
country must be mindful that they are human beings as well,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials should be asking would-be legal immigrants ``how
can I help you'' rather than emphasizing ``how long the line will
be'' to process an application for admission, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be saying loud and clear to people that the INS is
to help families and to understand the maze of rules and
regulations,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar breakup of the INS is the goal of bipartisan
legislation sponsored by Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, Silvestre
Reyes, D-Texas, and Harold Rogers, R-Ky. The bill is pending in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the presume Democratic
presidential nominee, are locked in a tight race, according to the
latest nationwide poll, completed for Newsweek magazine and
released Saturday. Each has 45 percent of the vote, according to
the survey with a margin of error of 4 percentage points. In a
survey that pits Bush and Gore against the two third party
candidates who are running in the fall, Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader and expected Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan, Bush leads
Gore 42 percent to 40 percent, with Nader drawing 3 percent and
Buchanan 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters potentially make up a swing constituency in 10
states with 213 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads Democrat Al Gore in five of the 10 states, including
Texas, Florida, Illinois, Colorado and Arizona, according to the
latest statewide polls. The five states account for 94 of the
electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Gore leads Bush in
four states with large Hispanic populations, including California,
New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The four states account for
114 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are tied in New Mexico, a state offering the
winner 5 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who won re-election to a second term as governor of Texas
with almost half the Hispanic vote in Texas, is hoping to expand
that appeal to Hispanics elsewhere around the country.

</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly emphasizes his open-arms approach to Hispanic
Americans in an effort to draw a sharp contrast with the
anti-immigrant rhetoric used by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson in
the early 1990s. Unlike Wilson, Bush has opposed restrictions on
the educational or social welfare benefits extended by the state of
Texas to the children of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is shadowing Bush's overtures to Hispanics.
Dag Vega, a Gore campaign worker and former White House press
official, worked his way from reporter to reporter during Bush's
remarks at a Washington hotel to hand out a five-page Gore campaign
analysis of Bush's record of assistance to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's ties to anti-immigrant Pete Wilson, his refusal to
support minority appointments and his opposition to Hispanic issues
such as the census, higher education and health care show that
Hispanics would be left behind under a Bush administration,'' the
Gore campaign release said.
</P>
<P>
   Vega criticized Bush for failing to intervene with GOP leaders
in Congress to clear the way for Senate confirmation of Enrique
Moreno, a lawyer from El Paso, Texas, who is awaiting Senate action
on his nomination to serve on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans,
have opposed Senate action on President Clinton's nomination of
Moreno, saying the lawyer who has practiced since 1981 does not
have the judicial experience to join an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and Hutchison have urged Senate Judiciary Committee Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, not to approve Moreno's nomination because Moreno
has ``not achieved the level of experience necessary to be fully
engaged and effective on a court one notch below the United States
Supreme Court.''

   ROBERT H. WATERSTON
</P>
<P>
   A physician interested in muscle disease, Robert H. Waterston,
56, was persuaded to study muscle disorders in the C. elegans worm,
then being established as a laboratory animal by biologists in
Cambridge, England. Waterston then became drawn into the project of
decoding the worm's genome. As director of the genome sequencing
center at Washington University in St. Louis, he and his English
colleague Dr. John E. Sulston decoded the worm's genome in December
1998; it was the first animal genome to be sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   Building on these methods, Waterston's center became the
spearhead of the National Institutes of Health's attack on the
human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, he wondered if with an earlier start the
consortium might not have done even more. ``John and I,'' he said
last week, referring to Sulston, ``were on record in 1994 as trying
to push things and saying the time was at hand. The people close to
the field saw it could be done and were impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN E. SULSTON
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John E. Sulston, 58, is a biologist who directs the Sanger
Center, near Cambridge, England, which is the National Institutes
of Health's major partner in the Human Genome Project. Financed by
the Wellcome Trust of London, the center has decoded one-third of
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston is well known for having traced every cell in the C.
elegans roundworm, now a standard laboratory organism, from the
single cell of the egg to the 959 cells of the adult worm, a
10-year tour de force of assiduous microscope work.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his interest in the worm, Sulston began to decode its
DNA. The task, undertaken with Dr. Robert H. Waterston of
Washington University in St. Louis, became a pilot project for the
human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Within the community of worm biologists, Sulston championed the
view that knowledge and research tools should be free to all, an
ethos he carried over to the Human Genome Project. He and
Waterston, as well as the rest of the consortium scientists,
decided to release their genome data nightly as a gift to the
world's researchers.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD A. GIBBS
</P>
<P>
   Born in Australia, Dr. Richard A. Gibbs, 42, is director of the
sequencing center at the Baylor College of Medicine, the smallest
of the big three centers.
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn into DNA sequencing through an interest in
technology. ``It was apparent to me that technical advances could
increase our understanding and help answer very profound and simple
questions, like why are we different to chimps?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But DNA sequencing is a demanding process. ``To be a scientist
you have got to love it, because at a certain level you would be
disappointed so much of the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to love the unpeeling of knowledge; otherwise it
is very difficult to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ELBERT BRANSCOMB
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elbert Branscomb, 65, directs the Joint Genome Center at the
Department of Energy, under the supervision of Dr. Ari Patrinos,
the associate director for biology. The department's human genome
project began as an outgrowth of its interest in radiation biology.
</P>
<P>
   ERIC S. LANDER
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a mathematician, Dr. Eric S. Lander, 43, became
interested in biology, and with the help of a MacArthur award
switched to the study of human disease genes. This interest led to
involvement in genome sequencing. Lander is now director of the
genome sequencing center at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   An early mathematical interest in the number 17 seems to have
come full circle as Chromosome 17 was among those Lander's center
was assigned.
</P>
<P>
   From his interest in human biological variation, Lander has
worked with Affymetrix, a maker of DNA chips, to develop a device
that would scan a patient's genes, pinpointing those that differed
from the consensus human sequence and that might make their owner
prone to certain diseases.

   MICHAEL W. HUNKAPILLER
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Hunkapiller, 51, is a co-inventor of the first DNA
sequencing machine, and is now president of PE Biosystems, a
subsidiary of the PE Corp. He estimated that a company using a
dedicated suite of his most recent model, the Prism 3700, could
obtain the human genome sequence faster than the public consortium
of academic centers, and persuaded Dr. J. Craig Venter to head the
project. At a stroke, Hunkapiller thus doubled the market for his
$300,000 machines.
</P>
<P>
   HAMILTON O. SMITH
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hamilton Smith, 68, shared the Nobel Prize in 1978 for the
discovery of restriction enzymes, a kind of molecular scissors used
by bacteria to cut up threatening viruses and by biologists as an
essential tool for manipulating DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a major scientific player in Venter's operations. He
has the critical task of preparing the libraries of cloned DNA
fragments for the DNA sequencing machines to work on. Venter has
made no secret of his reliance on Smith's work.
</P>
<P>
   EUGENE W. MYERS
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene Myers is a computer scientist and a leader in the new
field of bioinformatics, or computational genomics, the designing
of computer programs to analyze the genome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he and a colleague proposed the whole genome shotgun
method of sequencing the human genome, an idea rejected by the
public consortium. Venter, who had used the shotgun method before,
embraced the idea and hired Myers, who has written the programs for
assembling and analyzing Celera's human genome.
</P>
<P>
   MARK D. ADAMS
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Adams, 37, is another key member of Celera's scientific
team. His major role is to see that the whole operation _ DNA
libraries and clone-handling robots and DNA sequencing machines _
produces the range and quality of data required by Myers for his
genome assembly program.
</P>
<P>
   TONY LEE WHITE
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of the PE Corp., Tony White, 54, is the
architect of Celera. He was the one who bought Hunkapiller's human
genome idea and made the bold decision to convert Perkin Elmer, a
traditional scientific instrument maker, into a genomics company.
</P>
<P>
   Selling off the instruments and even the Perkin Elmer name,
White has organized the PE Corp. into two main divisions, Celera
and PE Biosystems. Celera's aim is to become a genomic database; PE
Biosystems sells DNA sequencing machines, to the public consortium
as well as to Celera.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is campaigning to
become majority whip if Democrats win control of the House, said
Monday she had raised more than $1 million to help Democratic
candidates win seats this November.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Pelosi well ahead of her closest rival for the No. 3
leadership post in the House of Representatives, Rep. Steny H.
Hoyer of Maryland, who has raised $460,000 for Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good news, I've raised more than a million,''
Pelosi said in an interview. ``The better news is that there is
more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal who represents San Francisco, Pelosi said it was
``becoming clear that I have an excellent chance to become the
Democratic whip.'' To do that, the Democrats must win at least six
seats to regain a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party believes the Republicans, who took control
of Congress in the 1994 election, are vulnerable because of voter
dissatisfaction with their handing of the impeachment of President
Clinton and their strident positions on issues such as gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Were Democrats to take control of the House, Rep. Dick Gephardt
of Missouri is likely to become speaker. Rep. David E. Bonior of
Michigan, the party whip, would become majority leader, leaving
open the post of majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi is maneuvering to win that No. 3 job by investing in
campaigns in hope of gaining support in the Democratic leadership
vote that would follow the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am demonstrating very clearly that I have a large
base of donors,'' she said. ``I'm in a good spot because I've been
working on this for years and it's all sort of coming together
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The whip is the party's top vote-counter, one charged with
keeping lawmakers in line on critical votes. ``Whipping'' requires
organizing coalitions, listening to members and sometimes twisting
their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the money she had raised ``all springs from the
strength that I have within my caucus and that people believe I
have a reasonable chance to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoyer spokeswoman Deborah DeShonge discounted Pelosi's
fund-raising prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is a small part of running for whip,'' DeShong said.
``The big part is getting the House back.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Hoyer has been traveling the country recruiting
candidates since 1995. ``He's been doing this for several years,
not just when there is a whip race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the contest is ``about wining the House and getting
the money out to the candidates.'' She said she has made ``a
special effort'' to donate to the campaigns of women.
</P>
<P>
   Leo McCarthy, a former lieutenant governor of California and now
Pelosi's treasurer, said the bulk of the money she has raised has
come from Northern California, with donors including ``mostly
business and professional people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said Pelosi has donated to candidates even if they are
supporting Hoyer or Rep. John Lewis of Georgia in the whip's race.
Pelosi's average contribution to House candidates is $12,000,
McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi created a political action committee, called PAC to the
Future, which she uses to raise money and contribute to selected
candidates. Federal law limits her PAC to $5,000 contributions to a
candidate in the primary election and $5,000 for a candidate in the
general election. She may also donate $2,000 in an election cycle
from her own campaign treasury.

   Spinal Fluid
</P>
<P>
   Q. What organ produces spinal fluid? Should people eat certain
foods to make sure there is enough?
</P>
<P>
   A. Spinal fluid, or more properly cerebrospinal fluid, is
chiefly formed by a network of veins, called the choroid plexus,
that projects in tufted, fringelike folds into the pia mater, the
innermost of the three membranes, or meninges, that cover the brain
and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The fluid is clear and colorless and contains small amounts of
glucose and protein. Beyond eating a healthy diet and drinking
enough water to maintain a proper fluid balance, there are no
specific nutritional recommendations for making sure there is
enough spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fairly complex circulation pattern for spinal fluid,
which flows through the central canal of the spinal cord, in the
cavities of the brain and into the space under the meninges, called
the subarachnoid space. The fluid is eventually absorbed into the
venous system.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, spinal fluid leaks or is drawn out in a spinal
tap. Usually, the chief danger is not the loss of the fluid, but
the possibility of infection by contamination from outside the
body. A constant, sustained leak could cause low fluid pressure,
which can lead to chronic headaches; it would probably require
surgical correction.

   In hailing the completion of the rough draft of sequencing the
human genome, scientists and political leaders reached far Monday
in their choice of comparisons. They likened it to the first
accurate mapping of the solar system, to the landing on the moon,
to the discovery of antibiotics, or to the deciphering of the
periodic table of the elements. One landmark in mankind's
understanding of the natural world that got little if any mention
was the mastery of the atom, which has led to both nuclear weapons
and the troubled technology of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many respects it is that quantum leap in human knowledge
that bears the strongest similarity to the progress scientists have
made by decoding the book of life. Understanding nuclear physics
has given humans the godlike power to destroy the Earth _ or at
least make it uninhabitable. Making sense out of the bewildering
jumble of nucleotides that twist upon each other on human
chromosomes gives us the godlike power to change the genetic makeup
of generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's momentous achievement now must be followed up by an
international conversation on where we go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure of war, the United States in 1945 used atomic
bombs before there could be any public discussion of the wisdom of
doing so. Because the completed sequencing of the genome is such a
preliminary step in both gene therapy and the manipulation of genes
in reproductive cells, there should be more time now to take on the
ethical issues that Monday's announcement brings to the fore. The
most immediate is how to protect individuals from being
discriminated against by employers or insurers on the basis of
their genes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that is the deeper question of tinkering with our genetic
legacy to create ``designer babies.'' It is tempting, for instance,
to eliminate the gene that causes sickle cell anemia, and then we
are reminded that the same gene protects against malaria. Nature
took 4 billion years to write the book of life; should we decode
and change it in a decade?
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations to the scientists for reaching this stage faster
than anyone thought possible. Now it up to us _ and our political
and spiritual leaders _ to decide how best to use this new gift of
knowledge.
</P>

<P>
   There was a sharp warning from Japanese voters to the entrenched
Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's parliamentary election. Losing
its outright majority and being forced to rely on two coalition
partners to remain in government, the LDP was chastized for failing
to cope with Japan's entrapment in a cycle of deflation and debt.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the voters was not only that the LDP has not
been able to solve Japan's problems but that it is a prime cause of
those problems.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a prime minister's advisory council submitted a
report entitled ``Japan's Vision for the 21st Century.'' The
council expressed ``an anxiety that Japan might go into decline if
things stay unchanged.'' The report recommended innovations that
would be radical for Japan. Among the proposed changes were a
serious acceleration of deregulation, a reduction in the lavish and
unneeded public works spending that has mired the country in debt,
and direct election of the prime minister _ a reform that would
endow the head of government with a popular mandate, enabling him
to escape the coils of the bureaucracy and special interests.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret to Japanese voters that the LDP has followed a
stop-and-go policy on deregulation and has conferred construction
contracts on its cronies. The party also remains unaccountable, a
perennial governing party enmeshed with Japan's permanent,
policy-making bureaucracy and beholden to parochial corporate and
rural interests.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a decade of stagnation and $6 trillion in
debts rung up by local and national government. That debt amounts
to 1.3 times Japan's gross domestic product, or $48,000 per capita.
This deflation and debt endangers not only Japanese workers and
pensioners, but other Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Any warning that Japan's unresponsive political elites must
change their ways is for the good. They and their favored friends
have to end their state-directed allocation of capital and their
protection of the ``keiretsu,'' or interlinked enterprise groups.
The electoral decline of the LDP will be healthy if it foreshadows
a Japanese economic recovery rooted in a flowering of truly free
markets.

GORE'S SHADOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is suffering a drip torture largely _ but
not completely _ of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, it is clear, Gore on several occasions played
fast and loose with the campaign finance laws. He made fund-raising
calls from the White House, helped plan strategy for expenditures
that were supposed to be independent of the Clinton-Gore campaign,
and participated in the notorious Buddhist temple fund-raiser he
described as ``community outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this amounted to a serious violation of the law
is an open question _ one that should not be decided by the
Clinton-Gore administration's own appointed attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Reno should accede to the renewed request for an
independent counsel in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is now exceptionally awkward, with the presidential
election just over four months away. It is unlikely that a new
counsel could be appointed, mount an investigation, and reach
conclusions within that period. But the questions demand answers
that can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has herself to blame for the timing. Had she appointed an
independent counsel when it was first recommended by FBI Director
Louis Freeh in late 1997 or even when Charles LaBella, another
Justice official, renewed the advice in July 1998, the entire
matter might be a closed book by now. It is ironic that the
independent counsel finishing a long probe into Hillary Clinton's
role in the firing of White House travel office employees announced
there would be no indictment in that case just when the new call to
Reno in Gore's case was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Political impact was instantaneous. Texas Governor George W.
Bush jumped on the story, saying, ``People are sick and tired of
all this stuff, and the best way to start anew is with a new
administration.'' But Bush would be wise to proceed carefully. The
unprecedented scope and manner of his own fund-raising and his weak
position on campaign finance reform make him a poor poster boy on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton-Gore's frenzied fund-raising helped buy a landslide in
1996. But it is mucking up Gore's effort to muddle through 2000.

&HT;     DISABLED OUTDOORSMAN STILL RESPONDS TO THE CALL OF THE
MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a beautiful, sunny day when the life
fortunes of Michael Bannister turned in a single moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister, 29, was climbing limestone cliffs in Thailand last
year, and after having made the top of one precarious ledge _ and
celebrating with a shout _ he stopped on his way down at a belay
ledge to help another climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That climber was about 80 feet directly above me,'' Bannister
said. ``I was looking up right at him. Then I watched one of his
hand-holds tear loose from the wall and it was immediately followed
by a truckload of rock. I knew I was in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rocks came hurtling down at him, boulders the size of
grapefruits and television sets. Bannister reacted instinctively,
trying to press his body against the wall to avoid them. He almost
succeeded. But one large boulder struck his left leg with such
force that it nearly severed it just above the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt at first,'' Bannister said. ``It was a dull
crushing feeling and I kept holding on to the climber's rope,
keeping him safe up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister was packed out in a make-shift stretcher by other
mountaineering experts. In the following days, before he could
return to the United States, the injury became infected. Weeks
became months. Back in California, surgeons attempted to repair the
damage, but never seemed able to. Finally, after 10 operations and
continued pain and immobility, Bannister agreed to have the leg
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, just six months later, Bannister is guiding rafting
trips on rivers, climbing the slopes of Mount Shasta, and was hired
this month as a wilderness guide and outfitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the decision on my own to have my leg amputated,''
Bannister said. ``I was looking at spending the rest of my life in
a ridged leg brace, and after doing a lot of research, it was clear
to me that I would have more freedom and mobility with a
prosthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister, who turned 30 last month, had the operation in
January. But it didn't heal and the limb became infected yet again.
That required two more operations, and finally, in March, doctors
got it right, and then in April, his prosthesis arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty shaky at first, because I had been on crutches
for a year,'' Bannister said. ``My leg muscles had atrophied. It
was almost as if I had to learn how to walk again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a month, though, he was getting around in his hometown of
Mount Shasta, ``feeling better every day,'' and the yearnings for
adventure began surfacing again.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Bannister made his first rafting trip, a trial run
with other guides, running a paddle boat down the Upper Sacramento
River for 12 miles, featuring 27 Class III rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was a little bit apprehensive,'' Bannister said.
``When I hit the first rapid, I had an adrenaline rush, like I
didn't know what was going to happen. But after the first rapid,
the dance of the river came back to me like a long, lost friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a raft is pointed downstream, you do not have a lot of
choice in the matter, he noted. And by the end of the day, he had
triumphed for the first time since his catastrophic climbing
accident. In the month since, he was hired by Turtle River Rafting
and has guided seven days on the Klamath River.
</P>
<P>
   This turned out to be perfect therapy, he said. When facing a
rapid such as Dragon's Tooth on the Klamath, Bannister said he did
not have time to think about the past, about those rocks falling
out of the sky, right at him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when facing severe white water, he reacted with his
natural, athletic instincts and years of training.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in the back of his mind, the call of the
mountain never would go away. In April, he ventured off on his own,
headed up to the 7,000-foot level on Mount Shasta and snowboarded
down for the first time since the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt, but it also felt great to ride down the mountain,''
Bannister said. ``Euphoric.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Bannister has been taking his passions to
another dimension. He completed a guide training seminar with
Shasta Mountain Guides, a former employer, and after getting
approval from owner Michael Zanger, was re-hired to teach
mountaineering skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope soon to be guiding summit trips again,'' Bannister
said, envisioning one day again standing atop 14,162-foot Mount
Shasta.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he is experiencing much pain, Bannister shook his
head and added: ``It's more like phantom pain, but it's real. I
have pain in my foot, but I look down and it isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only now are the other guides realizing the ordeal he has
experienced, and how he is driven by a zest for life, an
exhilaration for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The way Bannister looks at things, every day is a page, every
year is a chapter. He plans on filling the rest of his life book
with his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most arduous task of my life,'' Bannister said,
``but it has made me find more inner strength and clarity than I
ever thought was possible.''

`NO GREAT MYSTERY': VATICAN RELEASES COMMENTARY ON FATIMA SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to end the mystery surrounding the so-called
third secret of Fatima, the Vatican Monday released a photocopy of
the handwritten manuscript with a commentary explaining how the
Vatican concluded that the prophecy referred to the 1981
assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican news conference, broadcast live on Italian television
and on a worldwide satellite feed, was supposed to be the final
word on a long undisclosed prophecy that has fascinated Fatima
conspiracy theorists for decades and that was not fully put to rest
when the Vatican first revealed its interpretation last month.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some people may remain ``disappointed or amazed
after all the speculation it has stirred,'' Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of
the Faith, said: ``No great mystery is revealed. The future is not
unveiled.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did try to explain one of the more intriguing enigmas
woven into the Fatima legend, namely why the Vatican kept the third
secret under wraps for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a matter of dogma, but of prudence,'' Ratzinger
said in reply to a question. ``We didn't want to present an
undecipherable vision that would unleash speculation and insults.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, in books, doomsday cults and most recently, on Web
sites, Fatima enthusiasts speculated that the third secret,
revealed by an apparition of the Virgin Mary to three Portuguese
shepherd children in the village of Fatima in 1917, predicted the
end of the world, or an ideological rift in the Roman Catholic
church. Three popes saw the secret, according to the Vatican, and
decided not to release it. Finally, on May 13 at Fatima, the
Vatican secretary of state told an audience of 600,000 believers
that the secret actually referred to the attempted assassination of
John Paul II, a ``bishop clothed in white.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatima fanatics had held hunger strikes _ one even hijacked a
plane _ to try to force the Vatican to disclose the secret. Some
devotees were not fully convinced by Monday's revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for not releasing it sooner if this is all
there is,'' complained the Rev. Nicholas Gruner, director of the
Fatima center in Fort Erie, Ontario, who has lobbied for full
disclosure since 1978. He said he suspected that the manuscript
released by the Vatican was an authentic first draft, ``but not the
full statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican described the photocopy released Monday as the full
text, saying it was written on Jan. 3, 1944, by Sister Lucia, now
93, a Carmelite nun who is the only surviving witness to the
apparitions that believers say began on May 13, 1917. In her
recollection, the Virgin showed the three children an ``angel with
a flaming sword,'' and ``a bishop dressed in white _ `we had the
impression that it was the holy father.''' The letter goes on to
describe how the pope, ``half trembling with halting step,
afflicted with pain and sorrow,'' reaches the foot of a cross and
is ``killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger's commentary said the images were not to be taken
literally, but rather ``synthesize and compress against a single
background facts which extend through time.'' The vision reflected
the martyrdom of the church in the 20th century, and its warning
became clear, he said, in 1981. ``When, after the attempted
assassination of 13 May 1981, the holy father had the text of the
third of the secret brought to him, was it not inevitable that he
should see in it his own fate?''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has always credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving
his life. Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, secretary of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said Monday that the
pope did not see the third secret, kept in the archives of the
congregation, until after the 1981 attack, when he asked that it be
brought to him in the hospital. He added that Sister Lucia
confirmed the Vatican's interpretation in an interview he had with
her on April 27 in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger, who explained that belief in the visions at Fatima
was up to individual Catholics and not an obligatory part of church
teaching, also spoke rather gingerly about Fatima's significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the intention of the church to impose a single
interpretation,'' he warned. ``But in light of history, we can
decipher the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the underlying message of free will, saying, ``The
future is not in fact unchangeably set, and the image which the
children saw is in no way a film preview of a future in which
nothing can be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican also stressed that the pope's would-be assassin,
Mehmet Ali Agca, who was pardoned and extradited to Turkey this
month by the Italian government with Vatican approval, had acted of
his own free will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must totally discount fatalistic explanations of the
`secret,' such as for example, the claim that the would-be assassin
of 13 May 1981 was merely an instrument of the divine plan,''
Ratzinger wrote in his commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``secret'' of Fatima was a vision of hell; the second
predicted World War II and warned that the collapse of Communism
would require that Russia be consecrated to the Virgin. Those
visions lent the shrine an anti-Communist mystique throughout the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to a question, Ratzinger suggested Monday that in
hindsight, the focus on Russia was perhaps too limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism was classical atheism, but other systems, including
Nazism, were also radically atheist,'' he said. ``There is no
exclusivity.''

GOODFELLAS GOIN' BAD OR WHAT, CAPEESH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like I was tellin' my shrink, I been thinkin' the best is over.
When I got into this business, the glory days _ you know, the
golden age _ was already history. Nowadays, everybody _ includin'
me, I gotta admit _ is confessin' and complainin' and spillin'
their guts, if not to one of the feds than to Sally Jessy Raphael
or their psychiatrist. Any way you look at it, things are trendin'
downward _ no one's got the stomach for the old standards anymore.
Omerta? The code of silence? Fuhgeddaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you're thinking this is Tony Soprano's own negativity
speaking, but now a personage no less than the late great Mario
Puzo _ the guy who created ``The Godfather,'' may he rest in peace
_ confirms my worst suspicions. He's written this new book, Puzo
has _ this book, ``Omerta'' _ and in it he comes out and lays it on
the line. ``The old Mafia was dead,'' he writes. ``The great dons
had accomplished their goals and blended gracefully into society,
as the best criminals always do. The few pretenders who remained
were a disappointing assortment of dim, second-class felons and
impotent thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Impotent thugs?
</P>
<P>
   Now I tell myself you can't take this personal, but you gotta
wonder where a book like this leaves guys like me and my crew. Can
we help it that we're living in a world of degenerate scum? That
the RICO laws and the press make it hard for a guy to make a
living? That we don't got the fancy international connections
Puzo's characters do?
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the more I think about it, the more this book gives me
agita. God forbid that I should criticize the author of the great
``GF,'' but I gotta be honest with you: The man has lost his touch.
Most of his wiseguys in this book aren't even wiseguys _ they're
rich banker types, who wonder why anyone would ``want to bother
with the rackets when it was much easier to steal millions by
starting your own company and selling shares to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the hero of the book _ who's supposed to be this stand-up,
old school mafioso _ rides around Westchester on a horse, all got
up like some English lord in a red hunting jacket and black suede
hat.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's something fishy about the details. Puzo's got
Zabar's sitting on the East Side of Manhattan, and he's got these
two soldiers whacking a guy _ putting a moonroof in the head of
this former New York don _ in front of St. Patrick's and then
speedin' away in a getaway car. You think you can speed anywhere in
midtown Manhattan with all that traffic? If you believe that, you
believe me and Pussy can run a four-minute mile.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what's this ``Omerta'' about? I been gettin' to that.
It's about this don Aprile _ no relation to Richie, please God _
who's decided to retire. This don's been a man among men, ``a
throwback,'' Puzo calls him, ``to the old Sicilians of the 19th
century who ruled towns and villages with their personal charisma,
their sense of honor and their deadly and final judgment of any
suspected enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this don finally decides to retire: he's gonna go legit.
He divvies up his empire to grease things with his enemies and pay
tribute to his old friends and he makes a bunch of donations to
good causes. He's happy that his kids are civilians, that he's
protected them from the business aspect of his life. One son's some
sort of big shot in the U.S. Army, the other son's a bigwig at a TV
network and his daughter's this hotshot lawyer. Just the kind of
kids I'd be happy for A.J. and my Meadow to turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the old don is settlin' in to enjoy the good life,
bam, he gets popped at his grandkid's confirmation service. It's
not his civilian kids who are gonna avenge him, but his adopted
son, Astorre, this Sicilian boy he took in the same way Don
Corleone took in Tom Hagen. Except, Astorre's no Tom Hagen. It
turns out that the kid _ him with the red hunting jacket _ was
actually trained in Sicily to be a traditional mafioso. It's too
complicated to get into. Let's just say Astorre is so dedicated to
Don Aprile's family that he's willin' to donate his own kneecaps to
protect `em.
</P>
<P>
   So Astorre starts lookin' into who ordered the hit on the don,
and he finds this conspiracy like you wouldn't believe. It involves
a rival don who's a stone cold whack-a-doo; this FBI agent who acts
like he's the Michelangelo of G-men; these two crooked cops who've
been on the take; and this fat pig of a drug dealer, who _ get this
_ is trying to get his mitts on the A-bomb to protect his business
in South America. Jeez, it's like something outta Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it for me to be knockin' the great Mario Puzo, but I
gotta say, I'm not particularly partial to this book. What's he
know about nuclear weapons and how this international banking stuff
goes down? Why don't he stick more to stuff he knows?
</P>
<P>
   Irregardless of the respect I got for Puzo, I gotta wonder why
he don't get the kumquats outta his mouth and just get to the
point. What was his people thinkin' bringing out a book like this
after he died? Not good for the legend of the great creator of the
great ``GF'' _ may he rest in peace. There, I said what I hadda
say. End of story.

   The incorporation papers were returned to him because he had
written ``Uncertain'' on the line of the form asking for the name
of the city. Smith sent the papers back with an explanation, and
the new city of Uncertain was born as a place with better tap water
and a more certain chance of finding a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Uncertain is home to about 200 people, mostly artists
specializing in lake scenes, fishing guides, and bed and breakfast
owners. The city limits encompass a narrow stretch of lakeshore.
Uncertain is not more than a few blocks wide and about a mile long.
Residents, including the founder's daughter, Dottie Carter, worry
that someday the chain fast-food places and motels will arrive, but
that hasn't happened yet. The city does not feel like a city. Its
Main Street is really the lake, where all of life is focused. Set
back from the lakeshore, where the pines meet the cypress trees, is
Uncertain City Hall and the Uncertain Volunteer Fire Department.
There is no Uncertain Search and Rescue, although tourists become
confused when out on the maze of channels that make up the lake.
Sometimes, uncertain about how to return to Uncertain, they don't
come back until very late at night.

<P>
   In the early 1970s, Palmore got a job as a maid aboard the Delta
Queen riverboat that takes tourists out on the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers. She spent so much time in the pilot house trying to learn
the river that she cleaned rooms only seven months before the
company paid for her to attend a school where riverboat pilots are
trained.
</P>
<P>
   She steered the Delta Queen about five years, then left the
river but brought along her love of steamboats.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her Tyler home, but eventually headed to
Uncertain to look for Mittie Stephens artifacts. If she found
pieces of the boat, she'd be able to use more accurate historical
detail in her oil paintings of steamboats. She loves the boats, the
way the paddle wheels splash through the bayous without the sound
of a motor to ruin the mood.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fall under the spell of Uncertain. Whether it's
miasma or charm, something about the quiet lake with shadowy
channels and deep shade makes a person want to stay.
</P>
<P>
   So, even after no sign of the Mittie Stephens, Palmore stayed
on, absorbing the slow-placed life on the lake.
</P>
<P>
   She'd paint signs for businesses, and while she did, she also
commissioned the building of a historically accurate reproduction
of a riverboat, as near as she could tell. She calls the
50-foot-long paddle-wheel boat the Graceful Ghost, after an old
piece of music she says is beautiful. She intended the boat to be
her home, but eventually she began using it as a moneymaker, taking
Uncertain tourists out for rides.
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings she and her husband, Jim McMillen, 57, offer
the tours. It's quiet, except for the chorus of frogs somewhere
beyond the long shadows that come before sunset. Palmore watches
the shifting light on the water.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls the fish that looked so surprised after it had
jumped out of the water and landed on a lily pad. She sees the
iridescent blue dragonflies light on a pale yellow American lotus
flower floating in the lake. She remembers the way waves from the
paddlewheel cause shimmery droplets of lake to roll across the lily
pads, and the way the cypress turns rust-colored in the fall. She
looks for the red-eared sliders, which she hears are being caught
by poachers who send females to Asia for a turtle-egg market.
She'll paint a red-eared slider some day.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, maybe she'll get back to looking for the Mittie
Stephens. She isn't sure. For now, like many of the other artistic
residents of this town who are drawn to the lake, she is mesmerized
by its primordial beauty and is drawn to paint it.
</P>
<P>
   Although she came to the lake with a certain goal, the aura of
the lake has seemed to capture her, anchoring her here, as it does,
in an Uncertain spot.

FRANCE CAUTIONS ALBRIGHT CONFERENCE ON IMPOSING DEMOCRACY ON
NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ France offered an antidote Monday to some of
the celebratory tone of the conference on democracy here that was
spearheaded by the United States, saying that imposing democracy on
a country could have the opposite result.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France cited Fidel Castro and
Saddam Hussein as examples of authoritarian leaders who had only
been reinforced either by military force or economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he contended, while President Carter clearly did not
intend to bring about the Islamic revolution in Iran, his policies
had essentially helped bring about that result.
</P>
<P>
   Morton H. Halperin, chief of policy planning at the State
Department, parried Vedrine's statements, saying the conference was
not about the ``export'' of democracy but about enabling countries
that had ``chosen'' democracy to help one another.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine spoke to the gathering in the chamber of the Polish
Parliament after opening remarks by the host, Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek. Vedrine then went out of his way to brief
American reporters on his thoughts about democracy and how his
philosophy on democracy differed from what he saw as the themes for
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was careful not to attack the particulars of the conference,
saying he had nothing to do with its organization and had come at
the express request of Geremek, his friend. He did not mention
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, whose conference this
essentially is and who is seeking to make the theme of democracy
the lodestar of her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lending itself to easy converts, perhaps like
religion, he said, democracy is ``always a process of evolution.''
And, he said, it overwhelmingly involves long maturing internal
processes within nations such as in economics, the collective state
of mind and _ in the end _ politics.
</P>
<P>
   Definitions aside, the French foreign minister appeared vexed
about the appearance that developed democracies are lecturing
others. Nobody, he suggested, has a magic formula for
``transforming Russia into a huge Finland, or China into a huge
South Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not be self-congratulatory,'' Vedrine added. ``Our
democracies still have room for improvement.'' He singled out the
role of money in influencing policy in developed democracies as
``terrifying'' and bemoaned the apathy of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from more than 100 countries, including foreign
ministers from many of them, are meeting here under the rubric
``Toward a Community of Democracies.'' The notion is to encourage
deeper democracy in the world by having countries commit themselves
to a set of principles laid out in what is being called the Warsaw
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have argued over the last few days that while
the number of countries with democratic attributes has vastly
increased _ by their count from 30 to 120 since 1974 _ much needs
to be done to consolidate democratic gains in the weakest nations
and stop backsliding in others.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that were judged by a seven-nation vetting committee
to be at least aspiring to democratic standards were invited.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, whose formal sessions began Monday and will
close Tuesday, is split into two entities: speeches and panels at
the Parliament for government leaders and a parallel gathering of
nongovernmental organizations in a building across town.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent groups, the Washington-based Freedom House, and
the Stefan Batory Foundation, which was founded in Poland by the
financier George Soros, were asked by the State Department to
organize the parallel meeting, featuring speeches by human rights
figures from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials called the parallel meeting the World
Forum on Democracy, seeming to echo the title of the annual
conference at Davos, Switzerland, the World Economic Forum. And
they said they hoped the forum would take on a life of its own and
become the equivalent of a ``Davos of Democracy.'' Leaders of some
groups grumbled Monday that they found the comparison demeaning
since they had been working on building democracy at the
grass-roots level for many years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the emerging themes of the discussions Monday was the
issue of national sovereignty, raised most frontally by Vedrine but
also by others, who took a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   In a moving appeal on video, smuggled out of Burma and shown to
the foreign ministers this morning, the Burmese dissident, Daw Aung
San Suu Kyi, urged ``the peoples of the free world to work harder
toward bringing true democratic progress everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She was not specific about what kind of action she wanted from
the outside world, but she hinted that some kind of intervention
was necessary. ``Words need to be backed up by action by action
that is united and that is focused on essentials,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his speeches, Geremek said that in ``normal
situations'' there should be no collision between sovereignty on
the one hand and human rights and democracy on the other. Nor, he
said, did he anticipate that globalization would abolish the idea
of the nation state.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``exceptional situations,'' which are ``not in fact so
very exceptional,'' he said, human rights and democracy take
precedence. One such example is when the state, instead of
protecting its citizens, becomes a threat to them. In this and some
other cases, the international community cannot stand by and watch,
he said, and must say, ``It's human rights, stupid.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will erupt in the warm, humid air mass
along the East Coast as a cold front moves to the region later in
the day. Local flooding is possible in New England as storms move
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between sultry air over the South and more pleasant
air across the Middle West will stall from the southern
Appalachians across the Tennessee Valley and into the southern
Plains. Clusters of thunderstorms will be common from northern
Mississippi to northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Damp, cool conditions will dominate the western Plains and
eastern Rockies. Numerous showers and storms will dampen Colorado
and New Mexico with fewer thundershowers over Utah and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will stay dry and hot with a warming trend in
California. Fog will be nestled along the Southwest Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: OUT OF AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, satellite pictures have shown a vast plume
of dust spreading gradually across the eastern tropical Atlantic.
The dust was initially lofted into the atmosphere by currents of
hot air rising from the floor of the Sahara. At this time of year,
it is common for weather disturbances moving east from the Africa
carry dust from the Sahara toward the Caribbean and the Americas.
Recent research suggests that dust from Africa makes up at least
half the particles that residents of the Southeast inhale on a
typical summer day.

IN ONLINE CONSOLIDATION, WEBVAN ACQUIRES HOMEGROCER FOR $1.2
BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The much-anticipated consolidation of the online
grocery market got under way Monday with the announcement that the
Webvan Group Inc. would acquire HomeGrocer.com Inc. in a stock swap
valued at approximately $1.2 billion, based on Friday's closing
price of $8.72 per share of Webvan stock.
</P>
<P>
   But as analysts praised the deal as one that would help cement
Webvan's market leadership, investors focused on the uncertainties
of melding two disparate business models and technology bases,
sending shares in both companies down. Shares of Webvan were down
$1.40, to $7.3125, and HomeGrocer fell $1.21, to $6.875.
</P>
<P>
   Web grocers have been among the hardest hit since investors
began to flee e-commerce stocks late last year, raising questions
about their ability to raise the capital needed for expansion.
Shares in Webvan, which went public in November 1999, have traded
as high as $34 but are below the original public offering price of
$15. HomeGrocer went public in June at $12 but trades for below
that price. Amazon.com owns 22 percent of HomeGrocer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal lets these two companies come together and be the
leader,'' said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens.
``Instead of competing with each other, they can focus their
attention on the real challenger in the space, which is the
traditional grocery business,'' she said. ``But it will take some
time to see if the executional complexity of this is paying off.
Just because it's strategically appropriate, doesn't mean it will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Webvan, which is based in Foster
City, Calif., will exchange 1.07605 shares of Webvan common stock
for each HomeGrocer.com share. Approximately 138 million shares of
Webvan stock will be exchanged for all outstanding shares of
HomeGrocer.com, which is based in Kirkland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan and HomeGrocer both offer home delivery of groceries and
other consumer items in key metropolitan markets across the United
States. But both have repeatedly stressed that they are not in the
low-profit-margin grocery business, but are instead last-mile
internet retailers, competing as much with United Parcel Service
for rapid package delivery as they do with Safeway for food sales.
Last-mile retailers operate their fleets of trucks, unlike
Amazon.com, which relies on the U.S. Postal Service and other
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Webvan's combination with HomeGrocer harnesses the energy and
resources of both organizations and creates an even more attractive
shopping proposition for consumers _ one that will draw them out of
traditional stores and into our Internet marketplace,'' George T.
Shaheen, Webvan's president and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``With this merger, we are moving early and aggressively
to consolidate two successful companies to build a strong last-mile
Internet retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   The company faces several major competitors in the online
grocery field, like Peapod Inc., Netgrocer and Streamline.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated in its attempts to raise equity financing in the
public markets, Peapod, the first online grocery, in April sold a
51 percent stake to Royal Ahold, the Dutch food provider, for $73
million, or $3.75 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan said it expects the combined companies market reach from
nine major metropolitan areas currently to a total of 13
metropolitan areas by the end of 2000. By the end of the year, as a
result of the merger, Webvan said it expects to serve metropolitan
area markets in Atlanta; Baltimore; Bergen County, N.J.; Chicago;
Dallas; Los Angeles;, Orange County, Calif.; Portland, Ore.;
Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle and
Washington. Peapod operates in nine U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan said the acquisition should help Webvan continue its
expansion without tapping the capital markets so frequently. ``This
is a very capital intensive business, there's no getting around
that,'' she said. ``That said, combining these two companies should
reduce that, because they won't be raising capital just to compete
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the acquisition, Webvan's founder Louis H.
Borders, also a co-founder of Borders Books, will remain as
chairman of Webvan and Shaheen will continue as president and chief
executive of the combined company.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: How do you deal with an employee who is
late almost all the time, but does very good work when she is here?
I've tried coaching and discipline, but she just does not improve.
A.A.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: When you have an employee who is literally your latest
problem, there are a number of ways to approach the situation. It
sounds like you may have tried coaching and discipline, but this is
more than just a trying situation.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, if this employee is consistently late and is
disrupting the flow of work, and there is no way to reasonably
accommodate her tardiness, you need to advise her of the problem,
document the situation and take the necessary disciplinary action.
When a company has a tardiness policy that is basically ignored, it
sends a message that it is acceptable, along with a related message
that policies in general do not need to be followed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it may be useful to step back and see if there
may be a larger need to implement a flex-time arrangement in the
company. Depending upon job content and interdependency, some
flexibility on arrival and departure times can be quite
motivational.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of companies today are designing jobs
around their employees, particularly in terms of building jobs
around their skills, interests, abilities and even their
availability. Many companies are finding that it makes more sense
to flex their time than flex their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager considers herself to be an artist, and she hung
two of her paintings in her office. She asked me what I thought of
them, and I sort of overstated my feelings, and now she wants me to
buy one. I don't want one, but I don't want to upset her. How do I
get out of this? P.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: In your desire to be politically correct by giving rave
reviews to your manager's paintings, you have painted yourself into
a corner. This does not mean that you should have asked her if she
had any trouble painting over the numbers, but tempered praise
would have been adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, your next step is not to buy a painting. You can tell
her that you appreciate the offer and enjoy seeing the paintings on
her walls, but at this point you are not in the market for this
artwork. You can thank her again, but be sure that she understands
that you are not a buyer. If she goes for the hard sell, or if you
see repercussions down the road, you will need to have a more
candid discussion with her and with senior management if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is that your manager has absolutely no business
turning her office into an arts and crafts bazaar. She is probably
in violation of company policy on this one, as her actions waste
time, generate stress and interfere with the ability of staff to
meet departmental objectives. Senior management will not view this
as an effective display of the art of management. In fact, managers
who hustle the employees are often hustled out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a manager in a company that has around 200 employees. A
new human resources director was hired two months ago, and I have
yet to meet him. He has sent out some memos, but he has never held
a meeting with the employees, nor has he set foot in our department
which has 10 employees. Should I contact him? R.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like your company has a human resources director
whose skills in the area of humans and resources may be a little
thin. Even if he walked into an absolutely overwhelming personnel
disaster, he has overlooked a key opportunity to build credibility,
trust and communication with the rest of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more enduring criticisms of traditional personnel
managers is that they tend to generate too much paperwork and too
many memos. The fact that your new human resources director played
the memo card is not the most promising start.
</P>
<P>
   Although you do not want to sound like you are telling him how
to do his job, you can call him, introduce yourself, and invite him
to one of your meetings so that he can meet your staff. The actions
that he takes in response to this call will tell you a great deal
about his style as a human resources professional. Hopefully, he
will come to the meeting prepared not only to discuss the key human
resources programs, issues and objectives, but also prepared to
listen. At the same time, if his response to your overture is
another memo or two, stand back because masses of paperwork are
just around the corner.

SLEEPLESS AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ Jiri Vanek hasn't been able to sleep for three nights.
When he does doze off, it is the fitful snooze of the condemned. He
feels like an early Christian, penciled in for a date with lions at
Rome's Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Vanek had joked about it, sort of gallows humor, even
though he didn't believe it actually would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he told friends, ``I've never played Wimbledon so
I'll probably draw Sampras in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his coach, Wojtech Flegl, got the word from London, and
relayed it: ``You play Sampras in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way!'' screeched Vanek. Sounding like a convicted man
hearing the judge pronounce the direst of sentences, he shook his
head so hard that his shoulder-length flaxen locks flapped.
</P>
<P>
   But every year somebody has to be the sacrifice. They throw a
body into the arena called Centre Court for the reigning champion
to devour, and another Wimbledon is under way. Only twice in the
two previous centuries, 1967 and 1994, has this rite of swing
backfired. Charlie Pasarell disdained the role of lamb while
dismembering the 1966 champ, Manolo Santana. Lori McNeil did
likewise to the 1993 champ, Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Vanek does not emulate Pasarell or McNeil, but he isn't chopped
liver, either. More like a moderately tough cut-rate steak. He was
beaten, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, by the champion but his family and neighbors
watching via TV in the village of Holysov, Czech Republic, can be
nothing but proud. Their Jiri is the lone tennis player produced in
a two-court town better known for its truck factory, and he has
been a necessary spare part in opening the Millennial Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon changes subtly, a new staircase there, a new press
center here, but seems unaltered beneath its coats of dusky green
paint. The usual queues of eager, early-arriving communicants
stretched in lines of almost a mile, patiently moving ahead until
they could purchase grounds tickets. At the gates, campers already
were pitching tents in order to get a head start in today's queues.
</P>
<P>
   The usual shower knocked out play for a couple of hours but was
welcomed by the usual array of roses and hydrangeas. They show off
beautifully, but no advertising blooms anywhere. It's a commercial
venture all right, yet done so tastefully that nobody notices.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne gurgled. Strawberries-and-cream and other edibles,
even hot dogs, tempted the throng of 35,941. A Dixieland band near
the refreshment court brassily offered, ``The Blues My Naughty
Sweetie Gave to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody's sweetie, Anna Kournikova, whose 10,000 Web sites
are hit more often than all the blackjack players in Las Vegas,
boogied perilously to a Centre Court victory over Sandrine Testud
after butchering three match points, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards of Kournikova peddling a sports bra flood London,
along with her advice (``Only the balls should bounce!'') but will
not be on view at the Big W.
</P>
<P>
   There is bounce yet in the tournament elder, 35-year-old
Gianluca Pozzi, even though he looks like a weary, straphanging
commuter with sore feet. Unlike the undistinguished wine from his
Puglia region, this Italian ages with distinction. He showed it
with delicate touch, in a slick, slice-and-dice 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1,
victory over Czech Jiri Novak, who defeated Pete Sampras two months
ago in Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm improving; I'll be better in three years,'' said Pozzi, a
lefty who ranks No. 59. Italian novelist Gianni Clerici said,
``Pozzi plays the kind of tennis we used to love. But Gianluca's a
bit self-delusional: He thinks he's still playing with a wooden
racket.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was no delusion for the 22-year-old Vanek as the genuine
Sampras appeared by his side shortly before 2 on a bleak, cool
afternoon. Vanek, who has been courting insomnia thinking and
fretting about this moment, nevertheless realized a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play the greatest player on the Centre Court at
Wimbledon,'' Vanek said. ``What more could a player want? Yes, I
was very nervous, but not after two games. I did not want to be
embarrassed, and I don't think I was.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:59 the ballboys and girls march onto the court in their
lilac shirts and green shorts (the All England Club colors). Then
the umpire and line judges follow in teal blazers. Finally, at 2,
come the combatants in pristine white.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the big-shouldered, dark-haired champion,
but the man next to him, just about as tall at 6 feet 1 inch and
sprouting a goatee, was recognized as a total stranger: Vanek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard of him,'' said Sampras of No. 84 Vanek,
considered the best of the young Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking on,'' said Vanek, ``it was like a movie in slow
motion. I looked around. Wonderful. So green. The grass was like a
fine carpet, so soft on the feet. So many people around me. Many
more than in my town. I never bowed before, but they told me to
follow what Sampras did. We stopped, turned and bowed to the Royal
Box. I guess it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had't been on a grass court for five years, only once then.
Lost here in the juniors, first round. Oh, they let me practice an
hour yesterday. My game is clay. But to play against Sampras . . .
he looks too big. He's everywhere. At the net there's no space to
put it past him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be with him, it was a great school. A learning. Why should
I be nervous to play anybody now? I've been on Centre Court with
Sampras. Something to tell people about, maybe grandchildren some
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right there on the campus of Sampras Tech, where
everybody flunks.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Vanek was no different. But, he said with smile after his
masters class of 84 minutes, ``Tonight I will sleep.''

RULING GOVERNMENT JOLTED IN JAPAN BALLOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sunday's elections may have returned Japan's ruling
government to power, but the nation is still trying to figure out
who won and who lost.
</P>
<P>
   A better gauge than the election tally might be the pictures of
politicians in newspapers and on television. The somber faces
belong to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and members of his
three-party coalition, stunned at how many seats they lost.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, smiling face belongs to Yukio Hatoyama, leader of
the four-year-old Minshuto party, Japan's largest opposition party.
It gained substantial ground, increasing its share of seats in
parliament to 127 from 95 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition remains in power. Publicly at least, all
three members still support Mori, who announced he will form his
Cabinet on July 4. But many within Mori's Liberal Democratic Party
hold the prime minister, who has made several politically incorrect
gaffes since taking office in April, responsible for causing the
party to lose its majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the LDP leaders will start to undermine him from
behind, and a replacement might come in the future,'' said
political analyst Takashi Inoguchi.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts regard the Mori government's unconvincing
victory as further evidence of the Japanese public's preference for
the status quo, others see a faint sign that voters want change,
and that they have found a party to guide them there.
</P>
<P>
   The Minshuto party's slogan during the campaign was ``If you
move, Japan will change.'' Whether the party, which advocated
raising taxes to reduce the deficit, captured the voters'
imagination or was just well-positioned to absorb an LDP protest
vote, is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hatoyama, meanwhile, is relishing his party's gains, calling the
vote ``an important step toward realigning the political world into
two major parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past half-century, Japan's opposition parties have had
little success in mounting a challenge to the ruling LDP. For
decades, dozens of parties have morphed in and out of existence,
with politicians hopscotching between them. In the early 1990s, a
coalition of several opposition parties managed briefly to break
the LDP's hold. Another group, the New Frontier party, managed to
garner a large number of parliamentary seats in the mid-1990s, but
wound up imploding after four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hatoyama, 53, is typical of a Japanese opposition figure. Like
many, he started as an LDP member. He departed in 1993 to join
another party and left that to start Minshuto.
</P>
<P>
   A former university professor with a doctorate from Stanford
University, Hatoyama comes from a long line of politicians,
including his grandfather, a prime minister in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Minshuto's gains came at the expense of smaller
opposition groups, such as the Japan Communist Party, which had
been expected to garner a great number of protest votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, says political analyst Steve Reed of Chuo University
in Tokyo, it looks like voters wanted to support a larger party
like Minshuto ``because that's more than a protest. That's the way
you eventually kick the rascals out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if it is going to build on parliamentary wins, Minshuto
is going to have to work hard to convince the Japanese public,
including its supporters, that the party is worthy of someday
leading the country.
</P>
<P>
   Akiko Oki may have cast her ballot for Minshuto, but in reality
her vote was simply ``not LDP,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want change, even though I don't think the policies of the
other parties like Minshuto are strong enough yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue in Japan remains the lackluster economy, upon
which the government and the opposition sharply disagree. The Mori
government plans to keep its free-spending ways as an economic
stimulus. The opposition, in addition to calling for higher taxes,
had campaigned heavily to cut spending and bring down Japan's
skyrocketing debt.
</P>
<P>
   Hatoyama says the party will continue to push unpopular ideas.
As he said during the campaign, ``To win, you have to believe in
the conscience and good sense of the voters.''

 &HT;    Triglyceride levels may be deadly
 &HT;    By Charles Anthony
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A blood chemical that doctors check during physical
exams raises the risks for a fatal heart attack, but patients can
take steps to combat it before it becomes deadly.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, researchers have proved that a blood-fat
chemical known as triglycerides can raise risks of dying from a
heart attack. The chemical sharply increases a person's risk of
dying, even if blood cholesterol levels are normal.
</P>
<P>
   Triglyceride levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood
are considered to be a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know too many triglycerides can be harmful, our
next step is to do more research to see if lowering them with
medication works,'' said Dr. Melissa Austin professor of
epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead researcher of
a study published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart
Association. Researchers are testing some drugs in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, ``the best thing for people to do is exercise and
maintain a proper diet,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association recommends these steps for people to
reduce hypertriglyceridemia _ the condition caused by having too
much triglyceride in blood:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you're overweight, cut down on calories to reach your ideal
body weight. This includes all sources of calories from fat,
proteins, carbohydrates and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reduce the fat and cholesterol content of your diet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start and stick to a regular exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  People with high triglycerides may need to substitute
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of carbohydrates
for saturated fats. Carbohydrates raise triglyceride levels and
decrease HDL, the ``good'' cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reduce intake of alcohol considerably to no more than one or
two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women. The
incidence of heart disease in those who consume these moderate
amounts of alcohol is lower than in nondrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   However, excessive use of alcohol can raise the levels of some
fats in the blood and lead to hypertriglyceridemia. Heavy drinking
has been linked to stroke, high blood pressure and heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The findings on triglycerides are the result of a 20-year study
conducted by the heart association. Researchers monitored 100
families to find a possible genetic link between primary relatives
_ siblings and offspring _ and heart disease. The study found that
people had a 70 percent greater risk of getting heart disease if
their relatives had elevated triglyceride levels.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of triglycerides may also be a consequence of other
diseases, such as untreated diabetes mellitus.

WEAPONS INSPECTION BOOSTS IRISH PEACE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ The peace process in Northern Ireland got a huge boost
Monday when the two men responsible for making sure the IRA's
weapons remain locked up said they had inspected several arms dumps
and that all their requests had been met satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time that the Irish Republican Army, one of
the world's most resilient, defiant revolutionary groups, had
allowed outsiders to inspect its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing St.,
Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of Finland, and Cyril
Ramaphosa, the former chief negotiator of the African National
Congress, announced that they had inspected several IRA arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ensured that the weapons and explosives cannot be used
without our detection,'' the inspectors said in a statement,
without elaborating on their verification methods. ``We plan to
reinspect the arms dumps on a regular basis to ensure that the
weapons have remained secure. The process that led to the first
inspection visit and the way in which it was carried out makes us
believe that this is a genuine effort by the IRA to advance the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   While the announcement caught some off guard, the British and
Irish governments were anxious that the first inspections took
place before the height of the annually contentious marching season
the second week of July, when Protestant groups try to march
through Catholic neighborhoods where they are not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   According to senior Irish and British diplomats, there was even
more pressure to hold the inspections because Ahtisaari is
scheduled to undergo knee surgery soon. Ahtisaari, who helped
broker the end of NATO's war with Yugoslavia last year, was limping
noticeably as he left Downing Street, shaking hands with Blair and
Peter Mandelson, the British secretary of state for Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, welcomed the
news. Ahern met with the inspectors in Dublin after they met here
with Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's May 6 offer to allow inspections of its arms dumps in
the Irish Republic breathed life back into a dormant peace process.
It convinced a majority of the Ulster Unionist Party to go back
into a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process had stagnated noticeably in the past few weeks
as extremists on both sides tried to create havoc. Monday's
announcement was widely welcomed as momentum for those who want to
transform one of Europe's longest-running violent conflicts into
one that can be resolved politically and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   After the arms inspectors' announcement, the IRA issued a
statement saying it had reestablished contact with the
international commission overseeing the disarming of paramilitary
groups in Northern Ireland. The IRA had broken off contact with the
commission in February after the power-sharing government was
suspended because it would not commit itself to disarming or say
its war was over.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming that an unspecified number of its arms dumps had been
inspected, the IRA said, ``These dumps contained a substantial
amount of material including weapons, explosives and other
equipment. The leadership of the IRA have consistently sought to
enhance the peace process. This initiative demonstrates once more
our commitment to securing a just and lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Belfast, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
called the IRA gesture courageous and imaginative, and said it was
unprecedented in some 200 years of ``armed struggle'' by various
incarnations of Irish republican rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble called the inspections an
encouraging first step.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which calls for
power-sharing and equality between Protesant unionists who want to
remain British subjects and Catholic nationalists who aspire to
unity with the Irish Republic, were not assuaged. Some dismissed
the inspections as a public relations exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' said Peter Robinson, deputy leader of
the Democratic Unionists, who oppose power-sharing with Sinn Fein.
``The IRA is still engaged in an active terrorist campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari and Ramaphosa were deliberately vague about when,
where, and how many dumps they inspected, saying only they had
viewed several. Many observers have been openly skeptical over how
a limping, very large elderly Finn and a black man in a country
where there are few black people can secretly inspect hidden arms
dumps.
</P>
<P>
   But an Irish diplomat scoffed at that skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ireland,'' he said, ``and anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspections were widely seen as vindication for Trimble, who
had convinced a majority of his skeptical party to go back into
government with Sinn Fein on the promise that the IRA would allow
international inspectors to verify that its arms dumps are secure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even moderate unionists like Reg Empey, a Trimble
confidante, said the IRA has to eventually get rid of its weapons
so that democratic politics can take root and bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first step,'' said Empey. ``It is a breakthrough,
but it does not resolve the arms issue. There is a lot further to
go.''

BUSH WOOS HISPANIC VOTERS WITH PLAN TO REFORM INS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing his courtship of Hispanic voters, George
W. Bush Monday called for splitting the Immigration and
Naturalization Service into two agencies and allowing immigrants
awaiting visas to visit their families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here to the 71st annual convention of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, the nation's oldest and largest
Hispanic civil rights organization, Bush lashed out at the INS,
saying the agency was unfriendly, excessively bureaucratic and
badly in need of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS needs reform and that's exactly what I'm going to do
should I become the president,'' Bush told a luncheon crowd of more
than 600 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee said he supports legislation that would divide the INS into
two separate agencies _ one focused on protecting the nation's
borders ``in a humane way'' and the other aimed at providing more
customer-friendly service. The legislation is sponsored by US
Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the INS, Bush said, ``It's too paperwork oriented. It is an
agency that sends mixed signals to people we are trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We ought to be saying loud and clear to people that
the INS is to help families, to help people understand the major
rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was ``not right'' that a legal resident's immediate
family member who applies to emigrate is ineligible for even a
tourist visa while the application is being processed.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation that embraces family values, he said, ``we need to
help husbands and wives and children of permanent residents be
allowed to visit while the INS is handling their paperwork,'' he
said. ``As I've said, family values should not stop at the Rio
Grande River.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-minute speech, which an aide said he wrote himself on the
plane to Washington, won Bush warm, if not wildly enthusiastic,
applause. And just as Vice President Al Gore does when appearing
before Latino audiences, Bush sprinkled Spanish words and phrases
into his remarks. Gore is scheduled to address the league on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The appearances by both men are part of a broader outreach
effort to Hispanics, the nation's fastest growing ethnic group and
a sizeable chunk of the voters in four states _ Texas, California,
Florida and New York _ that control a majority of the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are scheduled to address the annual conference of
another influential Latino group, the National Council of La Raza,
in San Diego next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Barron, a 48-year-old prison warden from Lompoc, Calif.,
who is attending the league's weeklong convention, which opened
Sunday and is expected to draw 7,000 delegates and visitors, said
he would vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right in line with what the country needs,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's speech and INS proposal weren't enough to win over
Teri Martinez, a teacher from Tucson, Ariz., and a Democrat. ``It's
like he's talking off the top of his head. All I hear is rhetoric.
Everything he says is extremely ambiguous. I think he should have
been briefed better because everything was too general.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's first run for governor of Texas in 1994, he garnered
28 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to exit polls. Four
years later, when he ran for reelection, exit polls suggeset he got
almost half of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush has his work cut out in seeking to topple Gore for
the affection of Hispanic voters. A recent Voter.com-Battleground
poll found Gore favored by 53 of Hispanic voters nationally
compared to 41 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his speech by saluting federal workers who had just
been honored by the league during a recognition ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to the federal workers here, thank you for your
service,'' Bush said. ``I appreciate what you do for the United
States. I'm trying to find federal work myself.''

 &HT;    FBI agents should have been rescuers, not demolition team
 &HT;    Editorial from Waco Herald-Tribune

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ While the nation hoped against hope that children
would be rescued safely from the Branch Davidian compound and that
lawbreakers would be arrested peaceably, FBI agents in armored
vehicles showed more interest in ramming techniques.
</P>
<P>
   That's what former assistant deputy FBI director Danny Coulson
implied in the federal civil trial continuing this week over the
April 19, 1993, events at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy authorized for ousting David Koresh and his
followers, Coulson said, was a slow and deliberate introduction of
tear gas through the windows. Instead, to the horror of most,
including FBI superiors, the vehicles began ramming holes in the
buildings. This was a demolition crew.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever way they commenced, flames finished off the
destruction. Government officials assert that the Davidians set the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Piecing these events together yields the image of a
then-brand-new attorney general, Janet Reno, giving orders and
watching them be overridden. It shows a cowboy mentality behind the
wheel of those armored vehicles, one manifested in several ways.
The vehicles also were used to destroy crime-scene evidence after
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Armored vehicles certainly were justified. The Branch Davidians
repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to fire upon government
agents. But the vehicles were misused. With innocents behind those
walls, government shouldn't have been poking holes in them. That's
what doors and windows are for.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to excuse Koresh and his gunmen, who could have
saved every life by surrendering peaceably on Day 1. Ultimately,
they are the most culpable parties for their end-of-the-world
armaments and hair-trigger recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the hideous sins that should have resulted in
Koresh's arrest in the first place _ sexual abuse of little girls.
The man should have been locked up long before he became a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   But wrapped around these atrocities are repeated instances in
which federal authorities acted recklessly, deceitfully and
capriciously with the alarming likelihood that innocent people
would be harmed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Who put the children in harm's way? David Koresh and their
parents. Who failed to assure that the impasse would be resolved
without the loss of life? The United States government.
</P>
<P>
   The agents in the tanks got a commendation for bravery. Instead
they should have been cited for reckless driving. Some will call it
vehicular homicide.

   PROTEINS AND CELLS
</P>
<P>
   The role of most genes is to make specific proteins, which are
the working parts of human cells. Depending on the nature of its
string of subunits, which are specified by its gene, a protein can
serve a structural purpose, like a collagen fiber, or catalyze some
chemical reaction important to the cell's metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many proteins of interest have been studied in great
detail, the annotated genome will provide for the first time a
comprehensive parts list of all the proteins the body makes.
</P>
<P>
   Defects in these working proteins, caused by mutations in their
parent genes, are responsible for much of the burden of human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the role of every human protein _ proteomics _
will be one of the goals of the post-genome era. The sequence of a
protein, meaning the composition of its subunits, can be predicted
from the sequence of DNA letters in its parent gene, but many
proteins are further processed by the cell in ways that cannot yet
be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another initiative made possible by the genome is the complete
understanding of the human cell. Thousands of genes may be active
in a cell at any time, and the cast of players changes when the
cell performs different roles, like responding to a hormone or
slipping into cancerous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it has been out of the question to study so many
genes simultaneously. But new instruments known as gene expression
chips allow researchers to track which of a cell's genes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   Gene expression chips are made in different ways but all require
prior knowledge of the genes' DNA sequence, now available from the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   The chips may also help elucidate the difference between the 220
known cell types of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Although every cell possesses its own full copy of the genome,
each type is thought to use only its own special subset of the
genes, the rest being permanently switched off.
</P>
<P>
   The body is a kind of repressive socialist state where every
cell is equal but each must respond precisely to collective
authority or receive orders to self-destruct. The genome is the
authority's archive, containing the plans for each type of cell,
the master program for generating a 10-trillion-celled organism
from a single egg, and the life cycle instructions that guide it
from birth to adolescence and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING HUMAN VARIATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In parallel with finding all the genes in the genome, biologists
will also try to track the major variants in DNA sequence found in
the human population. Any two individuals differ on average in one
nucleotide, or DNA unit, in every thousand.
</P>
<P>
   These one unit changes are known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs, and are a principal source of human genetic
variation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of SNPs, or ``snips,'' should help track down the
variant genes that contribute to disease. Many common diseases,
like diabetes and heart disease, are thought to be caused by
several variant genes acting together. Because each variant makes
only a small contribution to the disease, these genes have hitherto
been particularly hard to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly feel this is going to revolutionize medicine because
we are going to understand not only what causes disease but what
prevents disease,'' said Dr. Stephen T. Warren, a medical
geneticist at Emory University in Atlanta and editor of The
American Journal of Human Genetics. ``We will understand the
mechanism of disease sufficiently to do rational therapy. We will
be able to predict who is at higher risk for particular disease and
provide advice to individuals as to how best to maintain their
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The ability to diagnose vulnerability to disease on a genomewide
basis will multiply the quandaries already raised by the present
level of genetic testing. Probably almost everyone possesses many
gene variants associated with adverse health effects. This
information could be used to the individual's detriment, if not
kept confidential, and could be psychologically devastating if
diagnosis runs ahead of treatment and the physician has no therapy
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric S. Lander of the Whitehead Institute has contemplated a
``snip chip'' that would diagnose all the major SNPs, or gene
variants, found in the population. Such information would hold
considerable potential for forecasting an individual's medical
fate.
</P>
<P>
   These snip chips are unlikely to be developed soon and their
predictive powers should not be feared, said Dr. James Watson,
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are the ones who are afraid to see the
future,'' Watson said. ``Old people see the future and would like
to reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic elements are
useful in a quite different dimension, that of tracking the
movements of the earliest human populations within Africa and as
they spread throughout the rest of the world. By selecting SNP's
that arose in the course of this expansion, population geneticists
can track genetic differences that are specific to particular
continents and major ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these SNPs lie in regions of the genome that do not code
for genes and have no effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists know that all people are extremely
similar to one another in genetic terms and believe that the
similarities overwhelm the very minor differences that they are
studying.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear the differences may not be used so benignly.
Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania ethicist, believes
geneticists underestimate both the appetite for this genetic
information and its potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important that drive is to understand
ourselves,'' he said. ``In most parts of the world we define
ourselves by blood and kin, and those are just surrogates for
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the genetic kits have been developed to determine who
is of American Indian ancestry, say, ``It would not surprise me to
see eligibility for casino gambling profits requiring a genetic
test,'' Caplan said. ``We could find people asking who is the
`real' Jew or black person or Serbian.''
</P>
<P>
   He also foresees SNPs being used in conjunction with brain scans
to uncover genetic markers for personality traits like antisocial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises for the man in the street will be how
much of our behavior is hard-wired,'' Caplan said. ``And the people
involved in the mapping are medical people who don't spend much
time thinking about the historical and social implications. So
there will be lots of bombshells, some of them sadly revisiting
some of the bigotry that has cycled around genetics for many
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW TEMPTATION
</P>
<P>
   Like all powerful knowledge, the genome can be put to good and
bad ends depending on how carefully the knowledge is used. The more
harmful genetic variants are discovered, the more compelling the
logic may seem of fixing the bugs in the genomic programming
directly instead of treating the symptoms in each generation, a
procedure called germ-line gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is hardly pressing: Gene therapy applied to treat
ordinary body cells has so far been a failure. But in time the
technique will doubtless work, and the knowledge may be developed
to reprogram the human genome, perhaps to strip it of many known
disease-causing and life-shortening SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the genome would then fall to some extent under human
direction, bringing vast benefits for health and longevity, but
raising a dire risk of changing human nature in unintended and
unwarranted ways.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, the long-sought manual of evolution's biological
programming, comes with no warning labels as to careful reading and
cautious use. Maybe neither is necessary.

CANCER SURVIVOR FOLLOWING IN HIS DOCTOR'S FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Time was running out for Kurt Weiss. Osteosarcoma, a
rare bone cancer afflicting adolescents, was spreading quickly, and
tumors had developed in his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons operated to remove the tumors, and the 15-year-old
Weiss underwent chemotherapy. But the tumors returned, and he
underwent surgery and chemotherapy treatment again. And again. In
13 months, Weiss had three surgeries, followed by the debilitating
chemotherapy. Finally, his doctors told him they had done all they
could. They urged him to enjoy whatever time he might have left.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of miles from Weiss' home in Pittsburgh, Dr.
Eugenie S. Kleinerman, a professor of cancer biology and clinical
pediatrics at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston, was making news by developing a technique to treat bone
cancers that spread to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson is renowned as one of the world's foremost
teaching hospitals and as a leader in cancer research. Thus, when
Weiss' sister read a newspaper article about Kleinerman's work, she
clipped it and sent it to her brother and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt's father, Frank, called Kleinerman, and on June 1, 1990,
Kurt, accompanied by his mother, Joanne, boarded a flight to
Houston, where they had an appointment at M.D. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Weiss says he was scared when he entered Kleinerman's
office. ``I was in very, very bad shape,'' Weiss says. ``Things
didn't look good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says the doctor put him at ease; she was able to discuss
his treatment in layman's terms. He and his parents were certain
that if anything could be done to save his life, Kleinerman could
do it.
</P>
<P>
   There was something else, though, that Weiss says he found
reassuring. Participating in the trial not only might save his
life, but it might ultimately save others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very important to me,'' Weiss says. ``I knew for me
to be going for experimental therapy, if I was going to die,
somebody was going to learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kurt Weiss, 26, has been cancer-free for 10 years. A
recurring infection from the surgeries did claim his right leg in
1996, but for Weiss, having his leg amputated is a small price to
pay after a bleak prognosis. Sometimes he has to pinch himself, he
says, to make sure he isn't dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very blessed because without this therapy I would've
died,'' Weiss says. ``As you're going through these things, you
don't have the luxury to think about how bad everything is. Now I
look back and wonder how in God's name I ever got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   His battle with cancer also inspired Weiss to choose a new
career path. He had planned to follow in his father's footsteps and
become an engineer, but now Weiss attends Jefferson Medical College
in Philadelphia, where he is studying to become a surgical
oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Weiss _ newly married _ was reunited with Kleinerman
when he returned to M.D. Anderson, not as a patient, but to
participate in a summer research program as part of his studies.
</P>
<P>
   For two months Weiss worked alongside the doctor who saved his
life as she and her team continued their cancer research, trying to
develop new therapies for treating osteosarcoma. His presence
inspired the research team; he was proof of what their work could
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very rewarding for the people who worked so hard
to see the fruit of their labor,'' Kleinerman says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in Pittsburgh were treating Kurt Weiss' osteosarcoma
in the prescribed manner _ a combination of surgery to remove
tumors, followed by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Kleinerman says, ``is in 90 percent of cases,
the tumor has already spread to the lungs. What makes this disease
even more insidious is you can't see it by X-ray or MRI. But we
know if we cut out the tumor and don't do anything else, 95 percent
of patients will come back six months later, take chest X-rays and
boom, there's the tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the two-pronged approach of surgery and
chemotherapy had a success rate of only 65 percent. That wasn't
good enough, Kleinerman says. ``I felt that chemotherapy was not
going to be the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, while attending an annual meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research, Kleinerman heard a lecture about
the use of a drug called muramyltripeptide (MTP) in animal studies.
</P>
<P>
   MTP is an agent that helps bolster the immune system, enabling
patients to fight the disease with their own antibodies. In
contrast, whereas chemotherapy destroys cancer cells, it also kills
healthy cells, thus weakening a patient's immune system and making
the patient more susceptible to infections and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinerman speculated that immune therapy treatment such as MTP,
which is administered intravenously, might be effective in
prolonging survival rates or even curing osteosarcoma.

</P>
<P>
   She began extensive research at the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Md. Because large dogs are often stricken with
osteosarcoma, she tested her theory by amputating the cancerous
limbs of dogs and then treating them with MTP. The results were
remarkable: Dogs that received MTP survived longer; many were
cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed it worked in mice, showed it worked in dogs, and got
the pharmaceutical company to manufacture it for patient studies,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Kleinerman launched phase one of the trial, examining
the toxicity of MTP. Two years later she began phase two, studying
patients who had osteosarcoma that had spread to their lungs. This
trial was conducted nationally with two groups: patients who
received only chemotherapy and those who received chemotherapy and
MTP.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 patients from around the country took part in the
trials. And the results provided the first breakthrough in treating
this type of cancer, which affects about 2,000 young people
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Although patients reported flulike symptoms during the first 24
hours of being treated with MTP _ fever, chills, fatigue and muscle
aches _ they did not experience the debilitating side effects
commonly associated with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to measuring the toxicity of MTP, Kleinerman
monitored each patient's immune system to determine the proper
dosage of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   During the second phase of the trial, Kleinerman administered
MTP to osteosarcoma patients who had undergone surgery to remove
tumors, then redeveloped the tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took out the tumors we could see and gave them MTP,'' she
says. ``We were able to cure 33 percent of the patients.'' These
are patients who have been cancer-free for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those is Kurt,'' Kleinerman says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Since it accepted its first 10 patients in 1944, M.D. Anderson
has treated more than 400,000 people with cancer. There are now
6,000 patients participating in 531 clinical trials, each of those
trials having the potential to prolong survival rates or cure
specific types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 500 active protocols here,'' says Dr. Robert
Bast, vice president of translational research at the center.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, Kleinerman, 51, juggles laboratory research
with various other responsibilities. She teaches, makes patient
rounds, and often writes papers for scientific journals or for
grants funding her work.
</P>
<P>
   She also serves on a National Cancer Institute study section
that reviews grants three times a year; she is vice chairman of
M.D. Anderson's Institutional Review Board, which ensures patient
protection and informed consent for clinical trials at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to Dr. Leonard Zwelling, vice president for
research administration and a professor of medicine and
pharmacology at M.D. Anderson. Their lives are devoted to fighting
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Zwelling says it has taken the medical community almost three
decades to understand how cancer works.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1961 when (President) Kennedy said we were going to the
moon, the principles governing how we got to the moon were known,''
he says. ``In 1971, when President Nixon declared the war on
cancer, we didn't know what the problem was.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwelling says doctors now know cancer is a disease of the genes,
and the major characteristic of cancer cells is their uncontrolled
growth. Not only are these cells malfunctioning, but cancer cells
suppress the immune system, so normal cells are malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   He says the goal is to find treatments that will selectively
kill cancer cells, leaving the normal ones standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the dawn of the age where that finally may be
possible,'' Zwelling says.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Kleinerman's research and subsequent trials has
helped make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this may not be a home run, it might be a double,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   But even successful trials do not guarantee that cancer patients
will benefit in time to prolong or save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The MTP trials, for example, were closed in 1998, and the drug
is not available on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is economics, which frustrates researches such
as Kleinerman. Because osteosarcoma is rare, it is simply not
financially feasible for a pharmaceutical company to manufacture
the drug and go through the process of having it approved by the
Federal Drug Administration. The expense is considerable and the
return negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinerman says that the company manufacturing MTP during the
trials stopped but that a small company then agreed to make the
drug. That company, she says, went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had calls from many patients and doctors and I have to
tell them the same thing _ there is no drug,'' Kleinerman says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she continues her research into treating
osteosarcoma, her interest in this disease dating 20 years to when
her husband took her to see Promises in the Dark, about a doctor's
unsuccessful struggle to save a girl with osteosarcoma.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kleinerman pursues the next step in fighting
osteosarcoma; she is working to develop an aerosol treatment for
the disease in which patients use an inhaler that would spread the
treatment directly to the lungs. ``We've shown that this is
effective in our animal osteosarcoma model,'' she says, ``and so
once the dose is determined by the phase one trial we hope to go
into a phase two trial.''
</P>
<P>
   An aerosol would help reduce side effects of most cancer
treatments. ``If you have ants in the kitchen, you want to spray
the counter where the ants are; you don't want to set off a bomb in
the whole house,'' Kleinerman says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kurt Weiss is back in school, counting the days until
he graduates in 2002. His dream is to return to work with his
mentor on her research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be real blessing,'' he says.

   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.

   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ In New York in 1994, Carl Chancellor
and Bob Dyer looked like tourists, snapping pictures at the Statue
of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy restaurant, clinking
beer bottles and wineglasses in heady toasts back at their hotel.
More than tourists, they were colleagues out on the town
celebrating. Chancellor and Dyer were part of a team of reporters
for The Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes
of this city of 215,000 people. Their series earned the paper
journalism's big award, the Pulitzer Prize. In Akron, there were
congratulatory speeches for a staff that had united behind the
series and gloried in having been a healing force in the city. The
Beacon Journal also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the
series ended, it introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the
perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman
and a white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer,
who is white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment. Which made it all the more startling when,
just a year later, the jubilation began to fade _ for the men and
the newsroom. Troubled by the state of race relations, The Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in. Many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown less progress. By Dana Canedy. (6240

   RACE-POLITICS (Bainbridge Island, Wash.) _ Many voters here say
that by putting a Chinese immigrant's son and two descendants of
slaves atop the governing pyramid of the state, Washington state
has transcended race. But if the old racial order has eroded, a
more complex one has replaced it, and now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in
them what the voters see in themselves. By Timothy Egan.

apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by a far

Cobb Jr. and his partner, Jeff Levy, had built an Internet research
company in Atlanta and by May 1999 each man's net worth had swelled

second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are

old plantation, eight simple cabins stood in a field of clover.
Generations of whitewash were peeling in ugly patches from the
mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had rotted away, and there
were gaping holes where doors and windows used to be. Obscured by
rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories
of the slaves who once lived in them. Will re-enactments of slave
life at a former plantation, now a national park, help to heal
racial wounds _ or open them? By Ginger Thompson. (6500 words, with

   RACE-KIDS (Maplewood, N.J.) _ Friendships ebb and end. It
happens everywhere, but what is striking is that it happens even
here, where the school district is extraordinarily mixed. But as if
pulled by internal magnets, black and white children begin to
separate at sixth grade. These are children who walked to school
together, learned to read together, slept over at each other's
houses. But race becomes as much a fault line in their world as in
the world their parents hoped to move beyond. By Tamar Lewin.

RED SOX TROUBLES LEAVE THEM REELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Red Sox are in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   They lost a game in which sacrificial lamb Chris Carpenter
started for Toronto against Pedro Martinez _ as one-sided a matchup
as there can be in baseball _ they lost a game in which they went 3
for 17 with runners in scoring position, and they lost a game in
which only the steady glove of second baseman Jeff Frye prevented
them from a true baseball rarity, the starting infield going for
the cycle of each committing errors.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot hit. They cannot field. They cannot win close games.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are in trouble. Serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And a former Red Sox pitcher, Blue Jays set-up man Paul
Quantrill, said it's about time the rest of baseball realizes the
team to fear in the American League East is not Boston or New York,
but the team north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the attention we deserve,'' said Quantrill. ``The
Red Sox and Yankees get it all. The Yankees always have a lot of
focus on them, and Boston _ I've played there for a few years _
it's such a rivalry there's always that focus on the Red
Sox-Yankees rivalry. And I hope it stays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Yankees are in trouble and the Red Sox are
unraveling. While Boston and New York have taken huge steps
backward in June, it is the Blue Jays, with that fearsome lineup,
who have stepped forward and grabbed a clear lead in a division
just waiting to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   In Quantrill's view, the Red Sox ``are beat up'' and ``the
Yankees don't even know who their starters are. They're scuffling
just to find starting pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly comfortable with our situation and not because
we're playing well,'' said Quantrill. ``Both those teams are good
teams and they're going to get going, but I like the fact we are
where we are. We've got the pieces to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the Blue Jays have David Wells. While the focus
has been on Martinez as the American League's best pitcher, Wells
quietly has gone out and compiled a scintillating 12-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than dependable,'' said Toronto manager Jim Fregosi.
``When we need him, he always comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays were able to sweep the Red Sox even without Wells
taking the mound at SkyDome. In Quantrill's mind, this was huge
``because the Red Sox and Yankees both kicked our butts last year
and we've been able to beat them this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Darrin Fletcher out of the lineup and Homer Bush
hitting in the .180s, ``there's no letup in our lineup,'' said
Quantrill. ``We'll get Fletcher back before long and once Homer
gets going, the lineup'll really be something.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Blue Jays' foes, Quantrill said he fears the beat-up Red
Sox more than the Yankees. Boston, despite its obvious lack of
talent at key positions, battles hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox, I give them credit,'' said Quantrill. ``The Red
Sox are the scrappiest team. They really play hard and just really
play well with what they've got. They're going to give you a tough
time every time. The Yankees have been the team the last few years
but, to be honest with you, we've got as many pieces as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' most telling weakness, said Quantrill, ``is the
lack of experience. We've got a lot of young guys, unlike the Red
Sox and Yankees, and that's why it's important for us to come in
and play well against Boston and New York. As a lesson for the
young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Quantrill qualified all of his comments with ``right now,'' as
in, ``Right now, this is is how it looks, but there's a long way to
go.'' Fregosi was more blunt, saying the division won't really come
into focus until July 31, when the teams have made whatever moves
they must make before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``But obviously we can hit,'' said Quantrill, and just as
obviously the Blue Jays have a much more fearsome lineup than
Boston or New York. ``Our pitching just needs to come together, but
that's true for all three teams. The Red Sox are beat up completely
and have a lot of injuries and the Yankees are scuffling.''
</P>
<P>
   The zany schedule-maker now sends the Blue Jays off on a
two-week road extravaganza, like the one the Red Sox had in early
June and the one the Yankees are now experiencing. And for Boston,
the only bright light is that the Baltimore Orioles now move into
Fenway Park. The Orioles have been playing worse than the Red Sox.
Baltimore has lost nine in a row.

CITIBANK ASKS MEXICAN COURT TO ENFORCE GOVERNMENT PAYMENT OF LOAN
INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FINEREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexican government is once again embroiled in
a borrowing problem with Citibank, resurrecting memories of the
Latin debt crisis two decades ago. But this time Mexico is not late
in its payments. Rather, the bank says, Mexico has paid too early.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that a bank would get upset if a borrower with a
history of financial instability wanted to pay off a debt early,
known in banking as a prepayment. But for Citibank, Mexico's
prepayment of a $2.5 billion loan means the bank loses hundreds of
millions of dollars in interest income it had assumed would flow in
over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, the savings in interest from prepayment helps
minimize the taxpayer cost of salvaging the country's banking
system, which is still burdened with insolvencies.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank contends early payment of the loan to circumvent the
interest costs is illegal and is petitioning a Mexican court to
stop it. A Mexico City judge will hold a hearing June 30. It is
unclear what the next step in the legal process would be.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been under intense fire from opposition
parties to curb the mushrooming cost of the bank bailout. And as
the Citibank debt was among the most costly on the books of the
government's bank bailout agency, the government said it decided to
repay now and save taxpayers at least $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank insists that Mexico is not permitted to pay off the
debt yet. The timing of the dispute, coming just days before
Mexico's presidential elections, has made it a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The government does not want to alienate foreign banks and other
overseas investors whose money is critical to Mexico's economic
stability. At the same time, no Mexican politician wants to be seen
as fearful of a big financial power like Citibank, which to many
Mexicans symbolizes the hold that the United States has
historically exerted over Mexico and other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   It was Citibank, after all, that was among the most aggressive
American lenders to countries like Mexico and Brazil, which
struggled to renegotiate billions of dollars of delinquent debts in
the 1980s. The chief negotiator for American banks during that
crisis, William Rhodes, is a vice chairman at Citigroup, Citibank's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's current dispute with Citibank revolves around
Citibank's May 1998 agreement with the government to buy Banca
Confia, a 230-branch commercial bank that had a history of bad
management, money laundering and corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank purchased Confia for $185 million on the understanding
that the government would assume $2.5 billion in Confia debt and
repay it to Citibank over eight years. This would provide Citibank
with about $120 million a year for the restoration of what Julio de
Quesada, the chief executive of Citibank's Mexico subsidiary,
called ``a broken bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, de Quesada called the debt a subsidy, ``an
integral part of the deal to compensate the bank for fixing
Confia.'' If the government had not assumed the debt, he said,
Citibank would not have bought Confia.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government's bank bailout agency, for its part,
maintains that the Confia agreement allows the agency to pay
Citibank back at any time. Vicente Corta, a lawyer who is executive
secretary of the agency, said it would never have made the
prepayment without legal grounds to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Some banking analysts agree. Lawrence Madsen, who follows the
banking industry for the investment firm UBS Warburg in New York,
said that if the bank bailout agency had not researched the
legality of a prepayment, ``I really would be very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Citibank and the bank bailout agency have pledged to use
all the legal tools at their disposal to defend their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have been watching the case say the argument is
likely to center on whether the Confia sale documents specify that
Mexico's bank bailout agency can pay back the debt in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank argues that the documents allow only the prepayment of
the total equity value of Confia, now worth about $137 million.
Corta of the bank bailout agency says there is no prohibition
against further payments.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank also argues that the bailout agency, known as the Bank
Savings Protection Institute, violated the Mexican Constitution by
assuming it is empowered to act at all, because the Confia deal was
signed by another Mexican regulatory agency, one that no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Fauzi Hamdan, an opposition party legislator who presides over a
congressional committee overseeing Mexico's bank bailout, said the
bailout agency was acting within its legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank has also expressed anger about how the prepayment was
made, suggesting it was done deliberately to catch the bank off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bailout agency announced on the afternoon of May 4 that
the prepayment would be made at noon the following Monday. Because
May 5 was a holiday, Citibank was not given the opportunity to
protest the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Citibank's legal representatives hand-delivered letters
to the houses of the bailout agency directors over the weekend,
explaining that it would be difficult to accept such a huge amount
of money at such short notice. The government responded by
splitting the payment in two _ nearly $1.1 billion on Monday, May
8, and the rest two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers watching the case said Citibank was unlikely to drop it
without a promise that Mexico will pay the lost interest. Corta
seems happy to leave it to the judge to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at the end of the day they are in the right, we will pay
all that corresponds to them,'' Corta said. ``But if we are in the
right, then all we ask is that they accept the court's decision and
that they publicly declare that we always acted in accordance with
the law.''

YANKEES MIGHT HAVE HAD SOSA, WILLIAMS, GONZALEZ OUTFIELD YEARS
AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An outfield of Sammy Sosa, Bernie Williams and Juan Gonzalez
just might have been the greatest outfield ever assembled. It's not
a fantasy outfield. It's not a Rotisserie outfield. It could have
been the Yankees' outfield.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees would not have had to trade all of the prospects
in their minor league system to get Sosa and Gonzalez. They had
both youngsters within their grasp before they signed their first
professional contracts with other teams. Sosa, Williams, Gonzalez.
They would have been this era's Tinker to Evers to Chance,
memorialized in poetry and song.
</P>
<P>
   And just how would the Yankees have accomplished this master
stroke? By signing Sosa when he was in their tryout camp in the
Dominican Republic in 1984 and taking Gonzalez more seriously, in
1985, when their scouts saw him and when Williams talked about his
friend, who happened to be Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Some, though not all, of the Gonzalez story has been told
before. Sosa related his Yankees experience in his autobiography
that was published earlier this year. But Fred Ferreira, a
remarkably candid executive with the Montreal Expos, added
perspective to both stories this week in the face of the Yankees'
efforts to acquire Gonzalez or Sosa in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira was the Yankees' international scouting director when
Gonzalez and Sosa were approaching the age when they could sign
with major league organizations. Sosa came first, arriving at the
Yankees' complex in San Cristobal just after he turned 16 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw myself into every drill,'' he recounted in ``Sosa,''
written with Marcos Breton and published by Warner Books, ``and I
stayed for a while, hoping that the elusive offer would finally
come, that I would finally get a real contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa added that ``everything was going well with the Yankees''
until a trip to the bathroom changed the course of baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks into the camp, or school, Sosa and his fellow
hopefuls were ``just hanging out after a practice'' when Sosa
needed to use the bathroom. He was wearing only his underwear, and
it was apparently against camp rules to wander around in underwear.
When he went to practice the next day, Sosa related, he was told
that ``I'm thrown off the team.'' He protested, but to no avail. He
went home, his goal unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent him home,'' Ferreira said in a telephone interview
Sunday night. ``My man in the Dominican called me and said, `You
know the kid you saw the other day and liked a little bit? He just
did this tonight.' I said, ``Oh really? Tell him to pack his bag
and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira said he had never told the story before but that ``it's
absolutely true,'' and he stood front and center in acknowledging
that it was his decision to jettison the young prospect who would
grow up and hit 129 home runs in the last two seasons of the 20th
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him; I sure did,'' Ferreira said. ``But even today, if
a kid messes around, you have to have some sort of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira recalled that during the players strike in 1994 he went
to the Dominican Republican and while there encountered Sosa.
``Sammy was all decked out,'' Ferreira related. ``He looked at me
and said, `I remember you.'
</P>
<P>
   It was the summer of 1985 when the Yankees had their shot _ no,
two shots _ at Gonzalez in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Rivera, a Yankees scout on the island, found Williams
and also noticed a friend of his. But Rivera went away without
pursuing Gonzalez, who was a year younger than the 16-year-old
Williams. And the reason Rivera wasn't interested in Gonzalez was
that he would dance in the outfield during a game. Rivera felt
Gonzalez was horsing around and didn't have the right approach to
the game. He said he wanted to sign a player, not a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira said he was unaware of that story, but he readily
related another as an addendum to the Williams signing story, which
has been told before.
</P>
<P>
   Having discovered Williams, the Yankees could not sign him,
under the rules, until his 17th birthday, which was a couple of
months away. Rivera recommended hiding young Bernie, and that's
what they did, putting him in a baseball camp in Connecticut near
the home of Doug Melvin, then the team's scouting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We convinced his mother if he was going to play professionally
it would be best for him to become acclimated to the U.S.,'' said
Melvin, now the Texas Rangers general manager. ``He flew home the
night before he turned 17.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira arranged Williams' trip to Connecticut. ``Just before
Bernie went to the camp,'' Ferreira disclosed, again accepting the
consequences of his decisions with class, ``he asked me if there
was a chance of him bringing a friend with him. I didn't want to
ask Mr. Steinbrenner for more money to hide another kid so I said
no. That kid turned out to be Juan Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wound up signing Sosa and Gonzalez 10 months apart.
Now they are both available as established high-priced talent. The
Yankees may wind up with one. They could have had both.

 &HT;    A PUSHY UPSTART, CELERA DROVE SEARCH FOR GENOME MAP
 &HT;    With GENOME.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Craig Venter traces his interest in human genomics
to his service as a medical corpsman in Vietnam 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned firsthand how tenuous our hold on life can be,'' he
said at a White House ceremony Monday that hailed the combined
efforts of his Celera Corp. and an international network of
government-funded scientists in deciphering the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience inspired my interest in learning how the
trillions of cells in our bodies work and interact to create and
sustain life,'' Venter added.
</P>
<P>
   The trillions of cells in Venter's own body seem to interact in
ways that lead him to be labeled _ depending on who's labeling _ as
a shallow, slapdash researcher or a visionary scientist and
corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief scientific officer of Celera, Venter has
presided over a private gene sequencing venture that in a few
months overtook and nearly passed the government consortium in the
race to define the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Venter was a researcher at the National Institutes of Health
until 1992, when he left in a dispute over his efforts to patent
genes he had discovered as part of the government-funded Human
Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the nonprofit Institute for Genomic Research in
nearby Rockville, Md., that same year, and in 1998 founded Celera
with backing from Perkin-Elmer Corp., a company that manufactured
telescopes (including the faulty lens of the Hubble Space
Telescope), microscopes and other scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The word Celera was crafted from the word celerity, which means
``rapidity of motion or action.'' The company was well named.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Perkin-Elmer device called the ABI-PRISM 3700, which
essentially examines a stretch of human DNA and identifies
different segments by the way they respond to a laser beam, Celera
set out to sequence large quantities of DNA very rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic strands were first chopped into thousands of tiny
segments, and the patterns by which key molecular components
appeared along the strands were recorded by several hundred of the
automated ABI-PRISM machines.
</P>
<P>
   A supercomputer analyzed similarities at the opposite ends of
each strand to determine how they fit together, much like the
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   By last April, less than two years after the company was
founded, Venter announced Celera had sequenced the genome of one
human being. That meant the ABI-PRISM had identified all the
pieces, but hadn't yet put the jigsaw puzzle together. The
computers were being used to assemble the pieces, and the virtual
completion of that task was what was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the government program posting the results of its own
sequencing efforts on the Internet and Celera committed to make its
own work public in a scientific paper to be published in September,
Venter was asked Monday how he expected to make any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort to make a financial return for our investors will
be from understanding that information,'' he said. Already, he
said, the company was advising pharmaceutical manufacturers,
biotech firms and universities on how to understand the human
genome.

Science Times section, to stories, graphics and photos on the human
genome announcement.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENOME (Washington) _ Ledeall: President Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair joined scientists from around the world
Monday in announcing the completion of a working draft of the
instructions to make a human being. Clinton described the mapping
of the human genome as ``the most important, most wondrous map ever
produced by humankind,'' at a White House press conference linked
by satellite to Blair in London. They were responding to the
announcement by scientists that they had unraveled 97 percent of
the human genetic code, and 85 percent of the data had been
assembled in the right sequence. Hailing what it called a landmark
in knowledge, the international public consortium spearheaing the
research, the Human Genome Project said it had ``assembled a
working draft of the human genome _ the genetic blueprint for a
human being.'' (Summary from wires) By Nicholas Wade.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The race to map the human genome, which has arrived at the
finish line in a carefully prearranged tie, has been portrayed from
the first as a classic pitting of privately and publicly funded
science. The moral overtones in much of the commentary have favored
the Human Genome Project, led by Dr. Francis Collins and financed
by the National Institutes of Health, over the profit-driven Celera
Genomics and its flamboyant lead scientist, Dr. J. Craig Venter.
But what the race really demonstrates is the value of scientific
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was a race, the post-genomic era of biomedicine
has arrived at least five years ahead of schedule. And it is not
wildly optimistic to say that this translates into hundreds of
thousands of lives saved or prolonged 10 or 15 years from now, at
about the same time the baby boom generation becomes most prone to
cancer and other common killers. As one of those boomers, I take
this matter to heart.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I got a graphic demonstration of what genomics
will mean to cancer research from Richard Klausner, director of the
National Cancer Institute. In a briefing at the National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda, Md., Klausner showed slides of cells taken
from two women. The slides told identical stories: the cells in the
women's lymph glands were bloated, diffuse and dividing out of
control. Using the slides, doctors had diagnosed B-cell lymphoma in
both women. Both were given a 45 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Then Klausner flashed a second set of images on the screen,
showing what these two women's cancers looked like from the genomic
perspective. Scientists conducting a research study had washed
solutions containing the women's lymph cells over lymphochips, bits
of glass about the size of a nickel that had been studded with
thousands of short strands of DNA representing known human genes.
What resulted were patterns of red and green dots, like a grid of
traffic lights, revealing which genes were active and which were
dormant. Neither pattern looked anything like the one seen in
healthy lymph cells. But they didn't look like each other, either.
Down at the molecular level, where cancer originates, the chips
showed that the women actually had two quite different diseases,
caused by different mutations in their genetic codes.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing their lymphochips with those from other cancer
patients, the scientists predicted that one woman might actually
have an 80 percent chance of survival; the other, a grim 20
percent. The wider meaning is that with the genome finished,
researchers in other studies can now compare such patterns to begin
investigating what leads cells to run amok in cancer in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a taste of what will be possible once researchers
begin to exploit the information in the entire human genome, which,
in a remarkably amicable ending to what was a genuinely hard-fought
race, Celera and the Human Genome Project revealed in tandem
Monday. They are expected to publish their ``rough draft'' versions
simultaneously later this year, and both sides now stress that
their methods proved ``complementary.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both scrambled feverishly to try to be first, though
with differing aims: Celera to exploit a window of time to sell
access to genetic information that only it could provide, the
public program to prevent such information from becoming entangled
in intellectual property rights. The scientists on both teams also
wanted a share in what everyone knew would be a magnificent
scientific achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It is not my habit to go around touting the virtues of free
enterprise. But having watched this race intimately over the past
two years, I have little doubt that if the competition from
industry had not come along to challenge the government's genome
program, it would still be fixed on a noble but distant goal: to
slowly piece together, by 2005, a highly accurate, finished
rendition of the 3 billion-letter human genome that would ``stand
the test of time,'' in the often repeated phrase of Collins. This
more refined version of the code will still be produced, though
sooner because of the competitive pressure _ the delivery date has
now been moved up to 2003. It will be an invaluable tool for
researchers for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   But Venter and his associates at the Perkin Elmer Corp. in
Connecticut, who conceived the idea of a private human genome
initiative in the first place, understood that this generation of
scientists needs a version of the genome to work with now, even if
it isn't perfect, and even if it costs drug companies a few million
dollars a year and university researchers a little grant money to
use it most effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Because the government was galvanized into supplying a competing
product that will be freely available, there is no chance that the
human genome will be tied up by the private sector, if there ever
was such a threat. And Celera, to make a profit, must, with its
commercial competitors, now entice researchers and the
pharmaceutical industry with even better genomic information and
with complex software that will help make sense of all this new
data. This should further accelerate the battle against disease.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question who has won this contest. It is those
people who will live longer because it took place. I may be one of
them, and so may you.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In achievement so profound that no metaphor seemed
able to capture it, scientists said Monday they have pieced
together a ``rough draft'' of the human genome _ the entire set of
DNA scripts in our cells that strongly influence health and
illness, behavior, special abilities, and how long we live.
</P>
<P>
   Competing teams _ one public, one private _ each said they had
mapped more than 3 billion letters of DNA code (the majority of the
genome) and had sequenced, or identified, 85 to 99 percent of the
genome. The information pouring out of these sequencing projects is
giving biomedical researchers an avalanche of data they believe
will revolutionize medicine and give humankind unprecedented
knowledge of its genetic endowment.
</P>
<P>
   It will take another year or two to fill in gaps and correct
errors in the genetic map, but what has been achieved so far has
been more successful and less expensive than anticipated when the
audacious plan was crafted little more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two rival scientific groups, one public and the other employed
by a private biotechnology company, put aside wrangling for a day
to announce in a joint appearance that they were in about the same
place in sequencing the genome information.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton called the information in the draft _
really an immense string of chemical letters, a 100,000 page-long
sentence, that tell cells how to make proteins _ ``the most
important, most wondrous map ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Other comparisons floated during a White House ceremony and
scientific press conference were to Galileo's discoveries in the
solar system, the invention of the printing press, the Manhattan
Project that produced the first atomic bomb, and the decade-long
space program that landed men on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught a glimpse of an instruction book previously
known only to God,'' said Dr. Francis Collins, the geneticist who
led the public consortium.
</P>
<P>
   J. Craig Venter, president of Celera Genomics Inc., the private
company that entered the genomic race just 20 months ago, provides
the potential to wipe out cancer and other diseases ``in our
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the most ebullient scientists sobered as they warned of
dangers that individuals' unique genetic messages, which could
reveal future disease risks or be linked to purported behavioral
traits, might be used against them. Collins, the director of the
international Human Genome Project financed largely by the federal
government, urged rapid passage of national legislation to protect
genetic privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the genetic sequence information is only a starting
point: the raw DNA messages have to be analyzed to find out what
genes they contain, what proteins the cells make from those gene
recipes, and how the proteins interact with each other to build the
body, regulate its function and enable humans to create their own
world.
</P>
<P>
   With just the DNA sequence, ``We have the encyclopedia, but we
don't have Hamlet,'' said Shirley Tilghman, a Princeton University
geneticist and an architect of the genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Although 16 research centers contributed to the public genome
project, the final push in the last 18 months was credited to the
five largest centers. One of the five, operated by the Whitehead
Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, churned out
about one-third of the DNA code by itself _ about 1.2 billion
chemical letters of DNA, the biggest production of any of the
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lander, the Whitehead scientist who led the effort, said
the center had gone from a ``dark horse'' in the sequencing effort
to excelling because of innovations in organizing the work.
</P>
<P>
   Tilghman, at Princeton, said Lander was ``one of the heroes'' in
the public effort, and praised his ``creative, out-of-the-box
thinking'' that stepped up the pace of sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, gene sequence information released by the Human Genome
Project as it went along has been pounced on by biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies who predict a new era of ``personalized''
medicine in which drugs will be tailored to individuals'
differences in the way drugs act on them. Genetic tests that
predict what illnesses a person will be prone to, and gene therapy
that treats diseases by correcting the genetic errors that cause
them, are consequences of knowing the human gene sequence.
Eventually, people may have gene tests at birth that predict their
entire future health patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who led the consortium of 16 gene-reading centers
funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of
Energy, said the project scientists estimate that it requires 3.15
billion chemical letters _ in a four-letter alphabet of repeating
As,Cs,Ts and Gs _ to spell out the DNA instructions by which an
individual develops from an embryo and becomes a functioning adult.
</P>
<P>
   The federal project has determined the exact sequence of those
chemical letters in about 85 percent of that 3.15 billion letters,
Collins said. About $300 million has been spent on the public
effort so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's Venter reported a near-identical estimate for the size
of the genome _ 3.12 billion letters _ and said his company's
supercomputers had assembled sequence information equivalent to 99
percent of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists on both sides of the contest said those numbers
can't really be compared because the federal effort's sequence
information has been checked an average of 7 times per base, or
chemical letter, while Celera's has been checked only about 4 times
per base.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's company, which has spent hundreds of millions of
dollars sequencing lower organisms like a bacterium and the fruit
fly in addition to the human genome, plans to make money by giving
subscribers a first look at the sequence information packaged along
with other research information and computer programs that aid in
translating the sequence into drugs and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said Celera, which ``doesn't have thousands of
scientists'' but which early on harnessed new robotic DNA
sequencing machines, began decoding the human genome last
September, and tested Venter's own strategy for speeding the
process by sequencing the genome of Drosophila, the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest source of conflict between the two projects was
Venter's refusal to publicly release Celera's sequence data until
subscribers have had a chance to view it and search it for
patentable genes. Moreover, about 30 percent of Celera's sequence
data the company got from the public GenBank database into which
the Human Genome Project has been depositing its data every 24
hours.

HITACHI SAYS NEW STORAGE MACHINES MOST POWERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The data storage market continued to heat up
Monday as Hitachi Data Systems of Santa Clara, Calif., announced a
new line of storage devices that it claims will be more powerful
than top-of-the-line machines sold by market leader EMC Corp. of
Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi's announcement is the latest in the chaotic, fiercely
competitive $35 billion annual market for devices capable of
storing massive amounts of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   It comes less than two weeks after Sun Microsystems Inc. made a
similar run at the storage market with the introduction of a line
of inexpensive modular machines.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the Internet, the demand for data storage has
exploded as companies accummulate mountains of information about
individual customers, and as the Web becomes a medium for
delivering data-intensive voice and video content.
</P>
<P>
   With demand for storage projected to grow by double-digits each
year for the next five years, companies such as Hitachi, Sun,
Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM Corp. have recently piled into a
once-sleepy market pioneered by EMC in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi's new Freedom Storage 9900 products take aim at EMC's
high-end Symmetrix devices. Unlike Sun, which touted its product's
relatively low price, Hitachi is seeking to compete on performance,
saying its machines can store twice as much as EMC devices and can
operate several times as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four to six times faster than anything else on the market
today,'' said Robert Ward, director of product management at
Hitachi in Santa Clara, Calif. ``It will clearly also be the
largest capacity storage subsystem available today.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers will have to pay for that performance, however.
Hitachi executives estimate their new systems will cost on average
30 percent more than Hitachi's current storage devices. Depending
on the model, prices will range from $600,000 to $12 million for a
configured system.
</P>
<P>
   EMC officials downplayed Hitachi's announcement, saying the
Hopkinton company's service and software are superior to Hitachi's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense is that if Hitachi wanted to make a frontal attack
on EMC, they picked the wrong area,'' said Don Swatik, vice
president of strategic planning at EMC. ``Hitachi has been
historically weak in software and support. And that's where we have
a legendary reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi last year scored against EMC by luring Hewlett-Packard
as a reseller of Hitachi storage devices. HP had, until then, been
a reseller of EMC products.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi Data Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd.
in Japan, doesn't disclose its storage revenues. But Dave Roberson,
chief operating officer of Hitachi Data, said its storage business
is growing more than 20 percent a year and accounts for two-thirds
of the subsidiary's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. estimates that Hitachi Ltd, the parent
company that operates two storage units, had 4.3 percent of the
external storage systems market in 1998 and just 3.8 percent in
1999. By contrast, industry leader EMC had 19.9 percent of the
market in 1998 and 22.7 percent last year, according to EMC.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson said Hitachi Data Systems' biggest clients include
telecommunications and financial services firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the two fastest-growing customer segments,'' said
Roberson. ``Virtually every one of our customers in those areas
(is) looking at very large orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Internet is spawning a new crop of companies
that sell online storage, including Storage Networks, a start-up in
Waltham. ``That is an example of a customer that wasn't even on our
radar screen a year ago,'' Roberson said.

MEL GIBSON'S FAMILY TAUGHT LESSONS FOR `PATRIOT' ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mel Gibson isn't too handy with a tomahawk, and he doesn't own
any guns, so his prowess with a musket is open to question. But
toss out those two skills and Benjamin Martin, the conflicted
freedom fighter Gibson plays in the new Revolutionary War epic
``The Patriot'' is a pretty close fit for the actor.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious parallel comes from the fact that Gibson, like his
counterpart in ``The Patriot'' (which opens in theaters Wednesday),
is the father of seven children. But the connection goes deeper
than family ties. Both men share a fear of themselves and their
past transgressions, a foreboding that's neatly summed up in
Gibson's first words in the film: ``I have long feared that my sins
would return to me and the cost would be more than I could bear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel had a clear sense of the religious and moral aspects of
the script,'' says ``Patriot'' screenwriter Robert Rodat (``Saving
Private Ryan''). ``If anything, he put us on the hot seat about
turning up the volume on those things. He really wanted to take a
scalpel to the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, those tortured opening words, spoken from Martin, a
character who looks back on his days as a hero of the French and
Indian War with a mixture of revulsion and regret. And while Gibson
isn't ready to bear his soul to Barbara Walters, he does offer
several clues about his own regrets and fears, most of which
revolve around marriage and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The karma thing in the script is the key to who that guy is
and it's actually the key to parenthood and the key to all your
fears,'' Gibson says. ``With me, yeah, I have some regrets, but
that's what happens over time. You've got to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for me, family ... it can just evaporate in a heartbeat,
which is one of my greatest fears,'' Gibson continues. ``The older
I get, the more I don't want to be away. Things can really fall
apart in your family, so you just want to stay close. There's more
fear attached to that than there used to be, which is funny, isn't
it, because I've devoted a little more time. The scary bit is the
fear probably arose from a greater familiarity (with his family).
And the sad news is that that familiarity probably wasn't there
before as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 44, has been married for 20 years and he and his wife,
Robyn, have seven children, ranging in age from 19-year-old
daughter Hannah to his 14-month-old toddler son, Tommy. Gibson's
proficiency as a father inspired screenwriter Rodat, who wrote the
part of Martin with the actor in mind, believing that Gibson could
convincingly play a family man who puts his children before his
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even put the number of kids at six in an early draft, kind
of as a signal to the powers that be that Mel Gibson should be this
man,'' Rodat says. ``After we signed him and his son was born, we
increased the number of kids to seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds ``Patriot'' co-producer Dean Devlin: ``Mel brought
something to the movie that you can't act, and that's his
experience as a father. You'd watch him off-camera and you could
clearly see that this was a guy who's at ease around kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson says any appearance of ease is misleading, particularly
when it involves his own brood. (His other children _ all boys _
include twins Edward and Christopher, 16; William, 14; Louis, 12;
and Milo, 9.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm far from an expert on child-rearing,'' Gibson says.
``We've just been making up the rules as we go along and doing the
best we can, hoping and praying we're not doing any permanent
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson laughs off the last comment, but it's clear he's still
beating himself up over some of his past absences from his family's
life. Early in his marriage, he had problems with alcohol,
resulting in a drunk-driving arrest in Toronto in 1984 while making
``Mrs. Soffel'' and splashy tabloid headlines in 1990 when a
college student sold snapshots of a wild weekend with Gibson that
included two other attractive co-eds.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson missed the birth of his daughter in 1981, and laments not
forging a relationship earlier with her. ``Then when she needed me
when she was a teen-ager, we didn't have that foundation, and it
was a little rocky,'' Gibson says, choosing his words slowly.
``Again, time passes, you live, you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Owning up to his mistakes doesn't come that easily, but Gibson
says there isn't anything he won't discuss with his children. To
him, it's the best way to illustrate the difference between right
and wrong and the consequences of making the improper choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see them going off the rails, I'll say, 'You know, I did
that,''' Gibson says. ``And they'll say, 'Really?' 'Yup, and I
gotta tell you right now, it doesn't pay.' And you tell them stuff;
you admit doing the stuff that you don't want them to do. It really
hits home and makes a point for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I almost need to do that in order to explain myself.
Otherwise they don't know what the hell I'm talking about. It's a
riddle. But if you say, 'Hey, let me shed a little light on this. I
got into a car once after having drunk too much and this is what
happened. Don't !ital!do it. It's really stupid.' Then they'll
listen and maybe learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it is is saying that you're part of the same miserable
condition that they are,'' Gibson concludes. ``You know they aren't
going to make the right choices all the time because they're human,
too. You just try to make them understand how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the sixth of 11 children, Gibson is well-versed in the
dynamics of large families. But he's never been forced to defend
his family in the manner that Martin must in ``The Patriot,''
although he has no doubt about how he'd act if his children were in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a bona fide coward, but it's amazing what
you'll do if you need to,'' Gibson says. ``I remember when I was
about 15, I woke up to the sound of my sister screaming. And she
said, 'There's a guy out back and he's beating your father up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I ran out the back and there was indeed some kind of
intruder, but it was quite the opposite way around. My old man was
kicking his a--. He kicked him in the a-- and put his face through
a window. And the guy was taking off and I found myself chasing him
with a frying pan, just running down the road in my underwear. I
wanted to kill the guy. It offends you so badly that anybody would
come and try to (mess) with your family.''
</P>
<P>
   With his own children, Gibson says the worst he's had to do is
heel a man whose hands were getting a little too friendly with his
daughter. When it comes to his boys, Gibson's usually the one
protecting other people from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be a handful at times,'' he admits. ``But they're
good kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As for becoming a father again in his 40s, Gibson says ``it's
just the greatest thing,'' even if it means changing diapers once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even savoring that,'' he says with a laugh. ``You have to
because they grow up so fast. You know, at first when we found out,
we wondered, well, can we start this again? We're not exactly
spring chickens anymore. But having a baby tends to make you a
spring chicken. It's a funny thing. The little guy is just
something.''

JUDGE REFUSES TO GRANT GLOBE FREELANCERS AN INJUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Superior Court Judge Carol S. Ball denied a request
Monday for an injunction that would have prohibited The Boston
Globe from enforcing a controversial new ``license agreement'' with
its freelance contributors beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives the Globe the right to reproduce
freelancers' past and future work in other forms, including online,
without additional compensation. About 750 of the paper's
freelancers are facing a July 1 deadline to sign the agreement or
stop working for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The freelance plaintiffs accuse the Globe of trying to take
their intellectual property while the paper says its agreement,
which allows contributors to retain their copyright, is more
equitable than many in the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing last Friday, the plaintiffs argued for an
injunction to set aside the July 1 deadline and prevent the Globe
from enforcing the agreement with those who have signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiffs here, artists all, believe with honest and
compelling conviction that they have been wronged by the cold,
cruel realitites of the e-commerce business world,'' said Ball in
her ruling denying that motion. ``It is not clear however, that the
business practice at issue violates,'' the law. ``The plaintiffs
may ultimately have a remedy at law, but the issuance of emergency
injunctive relief would be inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased, and I hope the judge's decision will cause
(the plaintiffs) to think long and hard about whether they want to
continue the litigation,'' said Globe attorney William Berkowitz,
adding that the paper will soon file a motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Indira Talwani indicated Monday that the
plaintiffs are eager to contest the merits of their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that even though this is the new world of e-commerce,
the same old rules apply,'' she said. ``This case is about the
Globe refusing to do business unless the plaintiffs agree to turn
over valuable rights for which the Globe is not offering additional
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal reaction is that I think we've got a strong case
and finally, quite outside the legal issue, there's the moral
issue,'' said Elijah Wald, a member of the Boston Globe Freelancers
Assocation and supporter of the plaintiffs. He characterized the
Globe position as ``give us the rights to everything you've written
or never write for us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe spokesman Richard Gulla, while expressing pleasure with
Ball's ruling, said, ``We hope those freelancers who haven't signed
the new license agreement will do so. For the Globe's part, we wish
to continue a long-standing relationship that we believe has been
beneficial to both the Globe and its freelance contributors. We
have always valued their contributions and we always will.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulla also said that freelanders who do not sign by the July 1
deadline would not be precluded from ever working again for the
paper, adding that ``if somebody wants to sign beyond the July 1
date, that's fine.''

&HT;     SUPREME COURT LEAVES MIRANDA WARNING INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil libertarians won a major victory Monday when
the Supreme Court refused to overturn a landmark decision of the
1960s, ruling that police must continue to warn suspects of their
rights to remain silent and obtain a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 vote, the highest court decided not to discard the
so-called Miranda ruling of 1966 and replace it with an obscure,
less-stringent federal law, passed in 1968, that allows voluntary
confessions to be used against suspects even when police fail to
give the warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not
supersede legislatively,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote
for the court majority. ``We decline to overrule Miranda
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a generation of police dramas in movies and on
television, the Miranda warnings have become familiar to most
Americans. The warnings stem from the 5-4 Miranda vs. Arizona
decision, which said police must warn suspects of their rights
before questioning them.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings state that suspects have the rights to remain
silent and to have a lawyer even if they can't afford one, and that
anything suspects say may be held against them in court.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Rehnquist acknowledged the pervasive role of the
Miranda decision in modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the
point where the warnings have become part of our national
culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was pleased the Miranda warnings were
``resoundingly'' upheld. ``They have worked for law enforcement by
providing clear standards for our officers and they have worked to
protect the rights of our citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, also praised the court, calling the original Miranda ruling
``an emblem of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro added that ``doing away with the police warnings would
have sent a terrible message about our criminal justice system,
that effective law enforcement depends on keeping people ignorant
of their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the ruling provoked an unusually harsh dissent from
Justice Antonin Scalia, who was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.
Both conservative justices are frequently allied with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In the dissent, Scalia said Monday's decision ``converts Miranda
from a milestone of overreaching'' into one of ``judicial
arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also accused Rehnquist, O'Connor and Kennedy of turning
their backs on previous rulings in which they had questioned the
constitutional underpinnings of the 1966 Miranda decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the majority decision, Robert Scully, president of
the National Association of Police Organizations, said it ``will
only increase the amount of litigation on this point in state and
federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully said the case ``was not about whether giving the warnings
made good public policy, which many law enforcement officers
support. Rather, it was about the automatic exclusion of
incriminating statements if there was a technical violation of the
Miranda guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling ended a long-running challenge to the Miranda
decision by conservative critics, who never accepted its
legitimacy. These critics maintained that the court of the 1960s _
much more liberal than the present court _ had overstepped its
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The critics said that the warnings tie the hands of police,
discourage suspects from confessing and sometimes allow the guilty
to go free when a law enforcement officer fails to give the
warnings at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those complaints and to rising crime, Congress in
1968 passed an anti-crime measure, known as section 3501 of the
federal criminal code, that said confessions ``voluntarily given''
may be used in court regardless of what the Supreme Court had said
in the Miranda decision.
</P>
<P>
   But that law lay dormant for three decades as law enforcement
agencies and the courts chose to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   The law, however, was applied by an appellate court in the case
of Charles Dickerson, accused of an $876 bank robbery in
Alexandria, Va., on Jan. 24, 1997. During the robbery, a witness
took down the license plate number of the getaway car, a white
Oldsmobile. Three days later, FBI agents showed up at the Takoma
Park, Md., apartment of the car's registered owner, Dickerson. The
car was out front.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said the agents busted in. They say he opened the
door. He agreed to accompany them to an FBI office but refused to
let them search his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent Christopher Lawlor later testified that he had noticed
a wad of cash on the bed as Dickerson picked up his coat. During
Dickerson's questioning at the FBI office, Lawlor left the room,
called a magistrate and got permission to search the suspect's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor returned to the interview room and told Dickerson he had
obtained a search warrant. Dickerson then confessed to driving his
car in a series of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickerson gave his statements before being read his Miranda
rights. Later, he asked a U.S. District Court to throw out his
confession based on the 1966 decision, and the trial judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond
overturned the trial court decision, ruling that the Miranda
requirement had been superseded by Congress' 1968 crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the warnings imposed by the Miranda
decision were never constitutionally mandated.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's decision, Rehnquist made it clear that in
Miranda, the high court intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment's
clause stating that ``no person shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote, ``Miranda, being a constitutional decision of
this court, may not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1966 decision was based on the case of a Phoenix truck
driver, Ernesto Miranda, who was accused in 1963 of raping an
18-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda confessed, was convicted and was sentenced to 20 to 30
years in prison. But his lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court,
arguing that he should have been informed of his rights to remain
silent and to consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The high court agreed, excluded Miranda's confession from
evidence and sent the case back to Arizona for a new trial. In
1973, Miranda was convicted of the 1963 rape at a second trial,
sent to prison and paroled. In 1976, at the age of 34, he was
stabbed to death in dispute over poker.

SALARY SITE TO ANNOUNCE DEAL WITH YAHOO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salary.com, a Web site offering information about how much
people are paid in different jobs in various US cities, will
announce Tuesday that top Web portal Yahoo Inc. has contracted to
offer its ``Salary Wizard'' search service to Yahoo's more than 50
million monthly visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Founded a year ago, Salary.com uses a secret list of sources,
including government data, trade associations and research by its
own analysts, to compile listings of salary ranges for 1,200
different jobs in cities across the United States. It is aiming to
increase salary coverage to 3,000 or 4,000 jobs by December.
</P>
<P>
   Salary.com is not disclosing what Yahoo will pay for use of its
site, which is also syndicated to over 20 other Web services.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Web sites that ``signed a deal with America Online
or Yahoo . . . could file immediately for an IPO,'' or initial
public offering, said Salary founder and chief executive Kent
Plunkett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that that's the case today, but this is
definitely a big boost for us,'' Plunkett said. ``It moves you up
to a different league'' and puts pressure on other Web portals to
consider adding the Salary feature as a link.
</P>
<P>
   With no publicity, Yahoo added a link to the Salary Wizard site
last Wednesday night that quickly led to a 20 percent increase in
traffic to the Salary site. Plunkett said the site, which has
increased from one to 18 Web servers in the last year, has added
eight more servers in anticipation of an avalanche of Yahoo
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Boston last November, 35-person Salary recently moved
to a Wellesley, Mass. office building once held by DirectHit.com,
which was acquired by search service Ask Jeeves in January in a
deal then valued at $532 million in stock. ``We think the space has
good karma,'' Plunkett said.
</P>
<P>
   Salary aims to make money by charging other Web sites for access
to its site and selling aggregated information about who visits the
site. In August, it plans to begin running banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett said Salary executives think they are well ahead of
their competition among compensation comparison services, both in
the breadth and quality of their information, and believe it will
prove a compelling site for most working people to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is like sex on the scale of human needs,'' Plunkett
said. ``People just need to know if they are making enough money.''

STREAM INTERNATIONAL PLANS $60 MILLION EXPANSION WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stream International Inc. of Canton, Mass. will build up to a
dozen new call centers worldwide as part of a $60 million expansion
it plans to announce Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Closely held Stream provides technical support for customers of
companies including Microsoft Corp. and Excite(at)Home. It now has
about 7,000 employees at 14 centers, including about 1,000 workers
in Canton. An expansion over the next year will add another 6,000
employees, including about 255 in Canton, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Stream's call-center business is booming as hardware and
software companies hire outsiders to answer questions about their
products. The business is known as ``outsourcing,'' and it spares
companies from having to talk to live customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stream had revenue of about $340 million and income
of about $10 million. This year, it expects income of around $30
million. ``We think we're key in the customer equation,'' said
Scott Murray, president of Stream. Customers who order software
over the Web tend to select vendors on the basis of service, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stream competes with other outsourcing companies, including
Sitel Corp. of Omaha, Teletech Holdings Inc. of Denver, and
MyHelpdesk.com of Norwood, Mass. Stream is a descendant of a
company known as Corporate Software and got its start in the
call-center business in the early 1990s as a support center for
users of Microsoft's DOS and Windows programs.
</P>
<P>
   It became a majority-owned unit of R.R. Donnelly &AMP; Sons Co. of
Chicago in 1995, then was spun off in a management buyout last
December with backing from Bain Capital, which owns 62 percent.
Managers, including Murray and chief executive Steve Moore, own 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moore and Murray are preparing to open 10 to 12 more
call-centers, big warehouses of office cubicles costing about $10
million each. Costs are usually split between Stream and its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Canton and seven other domestic sites, Stream has
facilities in Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, Northern Ireland, and
Japan. Altogether, its employees field 35 million phone calls and
send out 6 million e-mails a year.
</P>
<P>
   New sites will include buildings in Montana, New Mexico, Canada,
and northern Spain, among other places. Stream also said it will
hire 600 workers in Bombay, to provide support via e-mail. In
Canton, Stream plans to upgrade its infrastrucure and add about 55
new corporate staff employees, 100 software support workers, and
100 new employees for hardware support.

COMMENTARY: ALTERED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department's decision to no longer use the term
``rogue states'' to describe the likes of Libya, North Korea or
Iran, but to refer to them instead as ``states of concern,'' was
one of those policy moves that is easy to ridicule. In fact, let's
do that for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   I travel to some of these places and I can't imagine calling
home and having my wife ask me, as she often does, ``Where are
you?'' and I answer, ``Honey, I'm in a state of concern.'' That's
really going to cause problems. Couldn't we do something more
politically correct, like referring to the North Koreas and Iraqs
as states that are ``legally challenged'' or ``states in need of
Ritalin''?
</P>
<P>
   Kidding aside, there is a serious issue behind the State
Department's move. On the one hand, it makes sense that we stop
calling these countries rogue states, because such blanket
categorization can obscure our own thinking and thus our ability to
adapt policy and respond to changes.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, categorizing them as ``states of
concern'' doesn't solve all our problems. It implies that there are
``states of concern'' and everybody else is basically on the right
track _ and that is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   You see, there are basically two broad trends in the world
today. One, which the State Department has captured, is that due
largely to the pressures of globalization, rogue states
increasingly do not want to, or can't afford to, remain rogues any
longer, and are reaching out.
</P>
<P>
   But due to the same pressures, many new or old democracies are
no longer able to remain democracies either _ and this is just as
big a concern. I would call these ailing democracies ``states of
flux,'' which could turn into ``states of despair'' or even
``states of rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at them all. It is not surprising that the State
Department would want to redefine rogue states, because at least
some of the rogues are looking to go straight. During the Cold War,
rogues had more fun. Being a rogue state was a growth industry,
because the Soviet Union or China were always there to buy your
rogue junk, rebuild your rogue army and subsidize your roguish life
style.
</P>
<P>
   But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and China going from
Mao to Merrill Lynch, there is no more superpower to subsidize a
roguish life style. Countries that want to grow today have to turn
to the supermarkets _ the big global financial markets _ and they
not only won't subsidize roguish behavior, they will punish
countries for roguish behavior by withholding money to grow.
</P>
<P>
   That's why rogue states wanting to remain rogue states today
have to be able to either generate their own income _ with oil,
drugs or diamonds _ or be able to terrorize and isolate their
people so efficiently that they have no choice but to suffer in
silence. But as internal changes in Iran, Syria, North Korea and
Cuba all demonstrate, even the most isolated, ideological rogues
are finding it harder and harder to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   So all of these rogue leaders are trying to reach out and open
up _ but without giving up power or totally going straight. ``All
these states realize that gradually opening up their countries and
engaging in the global economy is their only answer, but a soft
landing for their societies means a hard landing for their
regimes,'' says the Wilson Center's Robert Litwak, author of
``Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   So we are now entering a period in which all these rogue regimes
(and China) are going to try to bring their hard states in for soft
landings, but without giving up power, and that is going to spark a
lot of infighting, backsliding and civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   But these same pressures on countries to open up, get up to
speed for globalization and build institutions that are squeezing
the rogues are also threatening to turn some old and new
democracies _ Pakistan, Indonesia, Venezuela, Colombia, Nigeria,
Peru and maybe Russia _ into new rogues. These are the ``states of
flux'' _ countries that opted for democracy, but have been so
swamped by corruption and overwhelmed by the difficulties of
state-building that their democracies are increasingly imperiled or
virtually dead.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that these states of flux will turn into states of
despair (Sierra Leone or Liberia) _ literally failed states. And,
if more and more democracies fill that category, it could turn out
to be our biggest concern of all.

FED EXPECTED TO PASS ON ANOTHER RATE HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting committee begins
two days of meetings Tuesday, there is wide agreement among
economists that Fed members will stand pat and won't raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1999, the Federal Open Market Committee has
systematically raised rates seven times. The biggest of these
moves, a one-half percentage point hike last month, pushed the
federal funds rate to 6.5 percent. As they debate the nation's
money policy, Fed members seated around an enormous table are
likely to base a decision of restraint on data showing that the
economy is beginning to slow, that rate hikes in the pipeline are
beginning to bite.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed's decision may be transparent, most economists
said the Fed must base its decision on murky evidence and
conflicting data. For example, new home sales fell in May,
indicating a slowdown. But existing home sales surged in May, a
bizarre twist in an industry sensitive to interest rates. The
country that month also turned in its weakest jobs report in years,
yet few economists believe the data reflect reality.
</P>
<P>
   Add election-year politics to the mix, and economists argue the
Fed would be wise to tighten now _ long before the November
presidential election _ to insulate itself from charges of
partisanship that might influence the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Available economic data ``do not show any clear change'' in the
economy's direction, said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of
the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York. The institute's
data is said to be closely watched by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Achuthan said the service sector, for example, generates half of
gross domestic product and is barreling along. ``It's critical to
have a service sector downshift to have a soft landing, and we
don't see that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed does not act during this meeting, some economists
predict a rate hike at its August meeting is assured.
</P>
<P>
   But with each FOMC meeting, the risks of error grow in an
economy that is as difficult to calibrate as a finely tuned violin,
economists said. Inflation, though still benign, is clearly
accelerating. A decision not to raise rates could open the Fed to
accusations it gave inflation the oxygen it needs to ignite.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed is likely to focus on the government's May
employment report, which showed the private sector reduced payrolls
by 116,000 jobs. It was the biggest monthly decline in business
hiring since the early 1990s recession and indicated the engines of
job creation may be finally hitting limits.
</P>
<P>
   Fed members who argue it would be prudent to hold off and await
more data confirming a slowdown are expected to prevail. Many
politicians agree, saying that as long as inflation remains low,
the Fed should let the economy expand, creating jobs and prosperity
in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very much a political hard sell for the Fed to
move next week when the prices are still so benign, and job numbers
and retails sales are showing signs of slowdown,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist for FleetBoston Financial Corp., summing up
a view held by many of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists, including Ayers, believe the May job
numbers were an aberration, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics
conducted its survey of employers too early in the data-gathering
cycle to fully count all hiring that took place in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it (raise rates) in June, they'll do it in
August certainly,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in favor of a rate hike demonstrate the difficulty of
getting monetary policy right when the data indicate it is such a
close call, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Yamarone, chief economist for Argus Research Corp. in
New York, is among a small minority who predict the Fed will act
now and is telling his firm's clients to expect a rate hike.
</P>
<P>
   He forecasts June will bring much stronger job gains of 470,000,
compared with average monthly job growth this year of just over
300,000.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-charging job market is just one reason a Fed rate
increase of one-quarter percentage point will be announced
Wednesday, after the two-day meetings conclude, Yamarone said. He
also cited Monday's report by the National Association of Realtors
that sales of existing homes rose 4.3 percent in May. Home sales
are supposed to be extremely sensitive to rate hikes, but the
housing market's reaction to rising rates has been mixed, with
sales falling one month and rising the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Fed's biggest fear: They refrain from doing
anything and hot data start to appear. You already see it here, one
day before they meet,'' he said. Fed members will be forced to make
their call without the June jobs figures, which will be reported by
BLS the following week.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed doesn't act, it may also trigger another surge in the
stock market, he said, adding fuel to the economic engine by
encouraging consumers to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation _ not job growth or home sales or Nasdaq gains _
is the Fed's central fear.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly consumer price data show inflation remains benign but is
accelerating. The consumer price index has risen 3.1 percent over
the past year, ending in May. That is a full percentage point
higher than the CPI for the year ending in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Economists largely attribute that to oil prices, which have a
temporary impact on inflation. But Fed governor Laurence Meyer, the
inflation hawk on the FOMC, is expected to reiterate an argument
made recently at the Boston Club that the so-called ``core''
inflation rate, minus oil and food prices, is also rising. While
the core CPI rose only 2.4 percent during the past nine months,
core inflation spiked 3.2 percent in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also closely watches a future inflation gauge, known as
FIG. Calculated by the Economic Cycle Research Institute _ based on
a variety of data, from inflation abroad to America's debt levels _
FIG hit an 11-year high in April and moderated slightly in May.
``It's screaming inflation and it's one of Greenspan's favorites,''
Yamarone said.
</P>
<P>
   Even economists who think the Fed will not act say the decision
is an extremely difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   That's contrasted to a year ago, said William Cheney, chief
economist for John Hancock Financial Services Inc., when ``there
was a feeling all the risks were on one side: The only serious risk
was they wouldn't tighten enough, and inflation would get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the risks have changed. Given ``hints'' of a slowdown,
Cheney said, ``it is a more difficult decision and that's apart
from the issue of whether you're seeing any increase in
inflation.''

   PICTURE BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Marco and Polo,'' by Dieter Wiesmuller
(Walker &AMP; Co., $16.95). Ages 3-8.
</P>
<P>
   In this charming buddy tale, Marco Monkey explores the frigid
Antarctic with his new friend, Polo Penguin. Shivering, Marco
returns to his tropical home with Polo, who admires the scenery but
swelters in the heat. Can their friendship survive? High-quality
paper gives a luxurious feel to the lush, exuberant artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?'' by Jane Yolen, illustrated
by Mark Teague (Blue Sky Press, $15.95). Ages 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   Do baby dinosaurs pout at bedtime and slam their tails and roar
and shout for one book more? Not these little guys. They tuck in
their tails and give a hug and one kiss more. (Get the hint, kid?)
Delightful nighty-night tale with goofy-sweet illustrations that
extend to the decorative endpapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Tim and the Brave Sea Captain,'' by Edward Ardizzone
(Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard, $16). Ages 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   Little Tim wants very much to be a sailor, but his parents say
he is too young. When he stows away on a steamer, he learns how
hard sailors work, especially when a storm nearly sends them to
Davy Jones' locker. This enchanting 1936 tale launched a series
that ran until 1977. The wispy, pen-and-ink artwork proves how
fetching line drawings can be. See also ``Tim to the Rescue'' and
``Tim and Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Jabe,'' by Jerdine Nolen, illustrated by Kadir Nelson
(Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard, $15.95). Ages 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   In this original tall tale, a slave with the strength of John
Henry and the leadership of Moses mysteriously spirits slaves away
to freedom, one by one. Compelling storytelling, original page
design and emotional watercolor/gouache illustrations give this
book a literary feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Lonely Sea Horse,'' by Saxton Freymann and Joost Elffers
(Arthur A. Levine Books, $15.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Another vege-tale from the duo that created ``How Are You
Peeling?'' (A New York Times Best Illustrated Book) and ``Play With
Your Food.'' As before, exotic produce is fashioned into characters
suggested by their colors, shapes and textures. Here Bea the lonely
``sea horse'' (actually chioggia beets with a face) finds
companionship with two crabs, three puffer fish, four lobsters,
etc., a k a shiitake mushrooms, horned melons and ginger root.
Predictable doggerel coupled with photo illustrations that are oh,
so clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue and Green Ark,'' by Brian Patten with 11 illustrators
(Scholastic, $18.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than an alphabet book, this is a lyrical tribute to the
natural wonders of our fragile earth, the ``blue and green ark
adrift in the dark.'' Illuminated gold-leaf letters are the thread
of consistency in a hauntingly beautiful book illustrated by 11
British artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lizzy and Skunk,'' by Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick (DK Ink,
$14.95). Ages 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy is afraid of dark shadows, spiders and making mistakes.
But her hand-puppet, Skunk, is fearless _ until he gets lost. Now
Lizzy's the brave one, searching under the bed, in the attic and up
a tree to bring her beloved Skunk safely home. A warm tale of
friendship and bravery told with pleasing simplicity, illustrated
with gently whimsical watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practically Perfect Pajamas,'' written and illustrated by
Erik Brooks (Winslow Press, $16.95). Ages 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Percy the polar bear loves everything about his red, footed
pajamas _ except the ridicule they inspire in the other bears. A
clever suggestion by an arctic fox puts everyone on the same
fashion footing. The ending is a bit contrived, but bold,
expressive artwork sings in this debut by a Seattle author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sally Goes to the Beach,'' by Stephen Huneck (Harry N. Abrams,
$17.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Sally, a black Labrador, visits an island in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   where she meets lots of dogs and has many fun adventures. Simple
story, great presentation. You can't help but smile at this
oversized book, strikingly illustrated with color woodcuts and told
from a doggy point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``When They Fight,'' by Kathryn White, illustrated by Cliff
Wright (Winslow Press, $14.95). Ages 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   A young badger describes how frightening it feels when his
parents fight (``The world shakes, the house quakes ... mighty
monsters make me quiver'') and how happy he is when they are
friends again (``When they are friends, the sun comes out. ... I am
as strong as a lion''). The simple text and endearing pictures _
charming in that English, ``Redwall'' way _ provide an opening for
young children to share their own anxieties. It might even inspire
parents to ``think of the children'' when tempers run high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebb &AMP; Flo and the Greedy Gulls,'' by Jane Simmons (Margaret K.
McElderry/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.95). Ages 3-7.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fun day at the beach until seagulls raid the picnic
basket. Flo blames the theft on her hapless pooch, Ebb, who goes
off to sulk in the rowboat. By the time the real thieves are
fingered, Ebb is adrift in a stormy sea. All ends well in this
heartwarming tale, amplified by colorful, smudgy pictures ripe with
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost! A Story in String,'' by Paul Fleischman, illustrated by
C.B. Mordan (Henry Holt, $15.95). Ages 5-9.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a loop of yarn, Grandma tells of a resourceful mountain
girl who uses her wits to find her way home in a snowstorm. Learn
how Grandma contorts the yarn into the shape of a dog's head, the
north star and other story elements. Illustrated with ink on
clayboard for a woodcut effect.
</P>
<P>
   CHAPTER BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   ``Dovey Coe'' by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Atheneum, 181 pages,
$16). Ages 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   This stunning debut novel, set in the Appalachians of North
Carolina in 1928, is among the best reads of the season.
Suspenseful and beautifully written, it features one of the
strongest heroines since Scout Finch. Twelve-year-old Dovey openly
disdains her sister's spoiled suitor, a rich townie who looks down
on mountain folk and taunts her deaf brother, Adam. ``I hated
Parnell Caraway as much as the next person,'' she announces in the
first paragraph, ``but I didn't kill him.'' You're hooked. Rich in
mountain dialect and nuanced characters, it carries us along as
Dovey develops a hard-won understanding of herself and her world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharaoh's Daughter,'' by Julius Lester (Harcourt, 182 pages,
$17). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, a distinguished black writer who converted to Judaism in
the early 1980s, immersed himself in the history of ancient Egypt
to write this fictitious account of the young Moses, born into
slavery and raised by the pharaoh's daughter. Told alternately by
an older sister and by young ``Mosis'' himself, it explores the
conflict inherent in being born Hebrew under a single God but
raised Egyptian under a pantheon of gods. A very human story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuck in Neutral,'' by Terry Trueman (HarperCollins, 116
pages, $14.95). Ages 10-up.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn McDaniel, 14, loves living in Seattle. He's blessed with
total recall and a great sense of humor. The bad news: He has
cerebral palsy and is severely developmentally disabled, with no
ability to move or communicate. And he thinks his father is
planning to kill him. Author Trueman, who lives in Spokane,
explores tough issues in a novel inspired by his own severely
disabled son. Is there intelligent life inside that useless shell?
Is ``mercy killing'' ever justified? A grippingly original, if
grim, exercise in empathy and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Fox Chronicles,'' by Gary Paulsen (Delacorte, 281
pages, $8.95 hardcover). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen, a polished literary writer, steps outside the box in
this action-adventure page turner that's perfectly pitched for the
``reluctant reader.'' It's the year 2057 and America has been taken
over by an evil confederation. Fourteen-year-old Cody Pierce, a k a
White Fox, must break out of an enemy camp, elude capture and
return to free the other children. The sentences are short, the
heroes and villains are in sharp relief, and the action is non-stop
and often violent, in the manner of a blockbuster summer movie.
Escapist fun with no literary pretensions whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star in the Storm,'' by Joan Hiatt Harlow (Margaret K.
McElderry Books, 150 pages, $16). Ages 9-12.
</P>
<P>
   When a surly farmer turns the village of Bonnie Bay against her
gentle Newfoundland dog, Maggie must keep him safe. But the dog is
needed desperately when a gale overcomes a coastal steamer with 100
passengers. Maggie knows Sirius can help with the rescue, but if he
emerges from hiding, will his life be at risk? A heartwarming and
gently paced dog story with factual details of daily life in
Newfoundland in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likes of Me,'' by Randall Beth Platt (Delacorte, 244
pages, $15.95). Ages 14-up.
</P>
<P>
   Cordelia, an albino girl who is half Caucasian and half Chinese,
feels freakish and unwanted growing up in a Western Washington
logging town of 1918. Her infatuation with a reckless youth named
Squirl leads her to Seattle's colorful Luna Park. The naive girl
lodges with Squirl's half-sister, the local madam, and lets the
smooth-tongued Squirl turn her into a mystical sideshow star _
until tragedy upsets their plans. The story falters in
believability after a splendid start, but you can't fault the
originality of this coming-of-age novel, replete with
larger-than-life characters and local color.
</P>
<P>
   ``River Boy,'' by Tim Bowler (Margaret K. McElderry, 155 pages,
$16). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Weakened by a heart attack, Jess' irascible grandfather insists
the family take him to his boyhood home by a remote river in
England. He can't rest until he finishes a painting called _
mysteriously _ ``River Boy.'' Jess, his soul mate, senses the
fleeting presence of a boy along the river and must discover its
connection to her ailing grandfather. This reflective novel, which
won England's Carnegie Medal, has a metaphoric quality and is slow
to get to the point. But it's comforting in its gentle treatment of
family, loss and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging,'' by Louise Rennison
(HarperCollins, 247 pages). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   This comically angst-filled diary has been likened to an
adolescent ``Bridget Jones's Diary.'' Here Georgia Nicholson, a
spunky but confused 14-year-old, frets over boys, breasts, acne and
``snogging,'' British slang for kissing. It's fun and light, a good
beach read. But Sue Townsend did this far better (using a male
protagonist) in ``The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13}'' and
``The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole,'' which are funnier, sadder,
deeper and more complex (and better appreciated by adults).
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy and Mr. Camphor,'' by Walter R. Brooks (Overlook Press,
244 pages, $23.95). Ages 8-up.
</P>
<P>
   The delightful, if somewhat dated, middle-reader series about
Mr. Bean's talking animals ran from 1927 to 1958 and is being
reissued, two volumes at a time. Here the intrepid and poetic pig
takes up houseboat life as summer caretaker of a country estate.
But his hoped-for tranquillity is shattered by portrait-gnawing
rats, the cook's ne'er-do-well relatives and a pesky horsefly named
Zero. This 1944 title has allusions to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the
wartime labor shortage and an amusing campaign to get hungry
insects to patriotically bypass victory gardens in favor of
roadside weeds. Like all Freddy books, it's great fun. (Note: Page
222 contains a single but jarring reference to a well-liked jail
inmate known as ``Joe the Gimp.'' Your call.)
</P>
<P>
   NON-FICTION
</P>
<P>
   ``The Anti-Boredom Book,'' by the editors of ``Owl'' and
``Chickadee'' magazines (Owl Books, 128 pages, $12.95 paper). All
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 133 boredom busters grouped under the headings of
Magical Fun, Kitchen Fun, Party Fun and Outdoor Fun. Some, like
tongue twisters and optical illusions, require no materials at all.
Others use simple items like newspaper, keys, brooms, etc. With
lively color photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls Think of Everything,'' by Catherine Thimmesh,
illustrated by Melissa Sweet (Houghton Mifflin, 57 pages, $16).
Ages 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   Meet some ``mothers of invention'' _ from Sybilla Masters of
1715, who devised a new way to clean and cure corn, to 10-year-old
Becky Schroeder, who in 1974 became the youngest female to receive
a U.S. patent (for glow-in-the-dark writing paper). Paper bags,
windshield wipers and bullet-proof Kevlar: Where would they be
without these visionary women? Lively, illustrated profiles and
brief info about the patent process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic Flying Fun With Science,'' by Ed Sobey, illustrated
by Bill Burg (McGraw-Hill, 90 pages, $11.95 paper). Ages 8-12.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Sobey's projects is they use common household
items, they're simple, and they're fun. Make a workable paper
airplane or flying disc, build a pingpong-ball launcher using PVC
pipe and a hair dryer, turn cut paper into a flutter mobile or
build a low-riding hovercraft. Sobey, a Redmond oceanographer and
president of the Northwest Invention Center, explains the science
and tells how to extend the fun and games into science-fair
projects. See also ``Wacky Water Fun With Science.''
</P>
<P>
   POETRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Salting the Ocean: 100 Poems by Young Poets,'' selected by
Naomi Shihab Nye, illustrated by Ashley Bryan (Greenwillow,
$16.95). Ages 8-up.
</P>
<P>
   These poems are the real thing _ deep-down honest, fresh and
spare. Nye gathered them through 25 years of poetry workshops with
kids in grades 1 through 12. (``I feel like a puppy that can't
catch up to his mother. Like a creek that runs fast but can't reach
the ocean ...'' As a footnote, Nye tracked down these former kids
and found ... grown-ups. Dentists, surveyors, teachers, actors. And
poets all.

JUDGE REFUSES TO GRANT GLOBE FREELANCERS AN INJUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Superior Court Judge Carol S. Ball denied a request
Monday for an injunction that would have prohibited The Boston
Globe from enforcing a controversial new ``license agreement'' with
its freelance contributors beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives the Globe the right to reproduce
freelancers' past and future work in other forms, including online,
without additional compensation. About 750 of the paper's
freelancers are facing a July 1 deadline to sign the agreement or
stop working for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The freelance plaintiffs accuse the Globe of trying to take
their intellectual property while the paper says its agreement,
which allows contributors to retain their copyright, is more
equitable than many in the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing last Friday, the plaintiffs argued for an
injunction to set aside the July 1 deadline and prevent the Globe
from enforcing the agreement with those who have signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiffs here, artists all, believe with honest and
compelling conviction that they have been wronged by the cold,
cruel realitites of the e-commerce business world,'' said Ball in
her ruling denying that motion. ``It is not clear however, that the
business practice at issue violates,'' the law. ``The plaintiffs
may ultimately have a remedy at law, but the issuance of emergency
injunctive relief would be inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased, and I hope the judge's decision will cause
(the plaintiffs) to think long and hard about whether they want to
continue the litigation,'' said Globe attorney William Berkowitz,
adding that the paper will soon file a motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Indira Talwani indicated Monday that the
plaintiffs are eager to contest the merits of their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that even though this is the new world of e-commerce,
the same old rules apply,'' she said. ``This case is about the
Globe refusing to do business unless the plaintiffs agree to turn
over valuable rights for which the Globe is not offering additional
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal reaction is that I think we've got a strong case
and finally, quite outside the legal issue, there's the moral
issue,'' said Elijah Wald, a member of the Boston Globe Freelancers
Assocation and supporter of the plaintiffs. He characterized the
Globe position as ``give us the rights to everything you've written
or never write for us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe spokesman Richard Gulla, while expressing pleasure with
Ball's ruling, said, ``We hope those freelancers who haven't signed
the new license agreement will do so. For the Globe's part, we wish
to continue a long-standing relationship that we believe has been
beneficial to both the Globe and its freelance contributors. We
have always valued their contributions and we always will.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulla also said that freelanders who do not sign by the July 1
deadline would not be precluded from ever working again for the
paper, adding that ``if somebody wants to sign beyond the July 1
date, that's fine.''

 &HT;    Expect fewer market gyrations, report says
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Financial sailing may be a little calmer in the months
ahead. That's the consensus of the gurus at Barron's (June 26)
midyear forecast roundtable.
</P>
<P>
   They foresee fewer market gyrations in the second half, thanks
in part to the interest-rate medicine doled out by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   They're buying financials, which have taken a beating because of
concerns about interest rates. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and MONY
Group all make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   So do energy shares, such as Frontier Oil, Exxon Mobil, Royal
Dutch, BP Amoco, Apache and Anadarko.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy counseling: Corporate bosses no longer consult
psychotherapists and ministers for wisdom, says the Economist (June
30). They're turning to the cleverest thinkers of all: ancient
philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morris, author of ``If Aristotle Ran General Motors: The New
Soul of Business,'' earns $30,000 an hour _ one of the highest fees
for a non-celebrity speaker in America _ teaching Socrates and
Hegel to the likes of IBM, Campbell Soup, General Electric and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marinoff, who wrote ``Plato, not Prozac! Applying Philosophy
to Everyday Problems,'' is heading the rise of ``philosophy
counseling,'' with roots in Europe in the early '80s but new to
America. He's a bargain at $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Best Web sites: Quite a few finance and investment magazines
have discovered that a practical service they can offer is to help
harried readers find their way among the thousands of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest, Smart Money (July), The Wall Street Journal's
personal finance magazine, offers ``the 52 best Web sites to save
you time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life (July) goes one better and offers the 50
``most incredubly useful'' Web sites, for those who ``thought you'd
seen everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern tech magazine: Theoretically, the Internet has rendered
geography meaningless. Reality is another matter, say two
technology magazines that look at the South as a future Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A new tech magazine that claims to cover ``the New South's new
economy'' _ digitalsouth (July/August) _ looks at venture
investment in seven leading tech hubs: Atlanta; Austin, Texas;
Baltimore; Dallas; Research Triangle Park, N.C.; South Florida, and
Washington/Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In a package of articles on the venture capital industry, Upside
(July) also looks at what it calls the ``Silicon South,'' or
``investing with a Southern accent,'' focusing on Atlanta and on
North Carolina's Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capitalists in this region straddle the traditional
finance world and that of the new economy,'' writes Jason Kelly,
who happens to be editor in chief of digitalsouth.

ONE-PARTY RULE ENDS IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ As the first results trickled in late Monday
night from polling stations around the country, it became
increasingly clear that Zimbabwe's weekend parliamentary election _
widely seen as the nation's most important vote since the poll that
ended colonial rule two decades ago _ has broken the grip of
one-party rule.
</P>
<P>
   But after a bitter and violent campaign, neither President
Robert Mugabe's party, nor its rival, seemed eager to practice the
politics of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In the anxious lull between the voting and the announcement of
full results, expected Tuesday, polling agents painstakingly
counted close to 3 million ballots by hand, international observers
cast a wary eye for signs of fraud, and the two main parties began
staking out their turf.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, claiming a mandate before
the first tallies were even reported, vowed to impeach Mugabe if he
refused to share power. The president, whose term does not end
until 2002 and who has sole authority to name his Cabinet, shrugged
off that demand, rejecting a joint government regardless of the
poll's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe may be forced to reconsider. The two parties were running
neck and neck, with the opposition claiming 30 seats and the ruling
party 32 in early counting. Whatever the final tally, political
observers say, the political landscape has been fundamentally
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe cannot stem the tide. The wish of the electorate is
pluralism in parliament,'' said Mike Mataure, a former legislator
from the ruling party who is now starting an institution on
democratic governance. ``If he denies the opposition participation
in his government, he is asking for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 65 percent of voters cast ballots over the weekend _
more than twice the turnout in the last parliamentary vote five
years ago. Election officials said the high participation slowed
counting. Although delays exacerbated fears around the country of
vote rigging, international observers reported no serious problems
in the counting.
</P>
<P>
   Political dissent has had a tough time gaining a foothold on the
African continent. The post-colonial period, starting in the late
1950s, ushered in nationalists who replaced foreign rule with their
own forms of oppression. Mugabe, one of the last of that generation
of ``strongmen,'' has shown no patience with dissent during his
long rule.
</P>
<P>
   But economic decline, hastening over the past three years to the
current point of crisis, gave his critics an opportunity. The
trade-union movement met tax hikes with strikes. Lawyers and
human-rights groups launched a civic forum for constitutional
reform. Last September, these forces coalesced around the labor
movement to create the Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe doesn't have to look far for examples of accommodation
between political rivals. To it's south, South Africa defied all
predictions of civil war when the black and white communities
negotiated a peaceful end to minority rule, paving the way for
democratic elections in 1994. To the east lies Mozambique, where
two guerrilla movements ended 17 years of civil war through
dialogue, and last December contested their second peaceful
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Mugabe to embrace powersharing. The president and his
party ``have a very low threshold for tolerance,'' said John
Makumbe, a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe in
Harare. ``Mugabe does not tolerate any elements that have a
different view, even within his own party. Working with a another
party in parliament would require that he take a totally fresh
approach to governance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's highly unlikely, Makumbe said, which means Zimbabwe may
find itself in an awkward new era of divided governance, with the
legislative and executive branches controlled by different parties.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has vowed to impeach Mugabe if he does not
include them in his government. Unless it wins a two-thirds
majority in parliament, however, it would need support from within
Mugabe's party. That's unlikely for two reasons. First, few
expected the opposition to win even a simple majority, since the
constitution allows Mugabe to appoint 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Makumbe also said, would sooner destroy his own
party than let it dictate the terms of his retirement: ``Below
Mugabe, there are many in the party who are progressive, but they
are dead scared of him. He will still find ways to bulldog them.''
</P>
<P>
   The election, it appears, has moved a bitter political contest
from the campaign trail to the halls of government. Both sides
claim a right to power, but both could be mistaken. Popular
mistrust in the ruling class does not equal confidence in the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, the strength of
the opposition is the same: The people are fed up with the
government,'' said Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan academic at Columbia
University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With joblessness, inflation, and interest rates all soaring
above 50 percent and gas pumps constantly running dry, voters are
clamoring for urgent economic improvement. Like it or not, the two
sides will be forced ultimately to seek consensus.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mamdani said, ``all the social problems will still be
there on the morrow of the election.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   From 1932 to 1934, when they were terrorizing Texas, Oklahoma,
Missouri and Arkansas, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow often came to
Fort Worth _ but to hang out, not hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used Fort Worth as a place to rest,'' says Sue
McCafferty, former president of the North Fort Worth Historical
Society. ``I don't know of anyone left who actually saw them, but I
knew people who did.''
</P>
<P>
   When the couple stayed overnight in Fort Worth, it was usually
on the wild north side, McCafferty says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they would be in separate hotels,'' she adds. ``That would
make it harder for them to be taken by surprise and captured. Clyde
stayed at the old Stockyards Hotel, and I think Bonnie was in The
Oasis, which was diagonally across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   McCafferty's favorite Bonnie and Clyde Fort Worth tale ``was
told to me by a man who said he was there when it happened,'' she
says. ``Clyde was in a north side bar one night, drinking with some
old boy, and all of a sudden Bonnie walks in. Now, that old boy
didn't know he was standing next to Clyde Barrow, and he didn't
recognize Bonnie Parker. He starts to shoot his mouth off to Clyde
about her. You know, things like, `Look at that doll!' Then he
starts on Bonnie, trying to impress her. She just tells Clyde,
`Let's go,' and they do, with that old boy hollering after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were gone, somebody said to him, `Are you out of
your mind? Do you know who that was? Bonnie Parker probably had a
big enough gun in her purse to blow your head off!' And I expect
that man never talked out of turn to a strange woman again.''

 &HT;    RECORD SURPLUS PROMPTS ELECTION-YEAR DEAL FROM CLINTON
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics
categories
 &HT;    BY BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. government is on track to take in a record
$4.2 trillion more than it will spend in the coming decade,
President Clinton announced Monday, touching off a new round of
partisan jockeying over how to use the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated surplus _ a whopping $1.3 trillion more than the
White House projected just last winter _ points to the persistent
strength of an economic expansion that continues to exceed the
expectations of analysts, both public and private.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to shield the windfall from Republican calls for tax
cuts, Clinton laid out a plan for using $2.7 trillion for debt
relief and another $1 trillion for an array of Democratic
priorities including low-income tax cuts and efforts to shore up
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered congressional Republicans an election-year deal,
however, saying he would go along with a tax cut of up to $250
billion, over 10 years, to reduce the so-called marriage penalty,
if Republicans would match that dollar-for-dollar with a program to
provide prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal would allow each party to claim a legislative
victory in an area important to their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good-faith offer where I want to meet them
halfway, I want them to meet me halfway,'' Clinton told White House
reporters. ``We can clearly afford this, and we ought to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, were wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with the president,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in a prepared statement.
``What I will not do is engage in political horse trading that
gives short shrift to the long range challenges we face as a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have proposed a tax cut of $150 billion over
five years to reduce what they regard as a penalty paid by married
couples who file joint income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate Republican aide said the party wants to reach an
agreement with Clinton on prescription drug benefits and the
marriage penalty, but it rejects the approach of bargaining over
the issues on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure the policy's right,'' said the aide,
``before we start trading off numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the rhetoric lies a historic political debate over what
to do with the massive surpluses the government expects to generate
over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just last February, when Clinton submitted his fiscal 2001
budget proposals to Congress, those surpluses were projected to
total up to $2.9 trillion over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   In its summer Mid Session Review of budget matters, though, the
White House projected Monday that the surplus could total as much
as $4.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, the federal surplus is projected to hit $211
billion _ the largest ever _ and it's likely to grow to $228
billion next year, the White House projects.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surplus, in both years, comes from the Social
Security program, which is currently taking in more in employee
premiums than it is paying out on retirement and worker disability
benefits. Budgeting practice establishes a firewall that treats
Social Security premiums separately from general tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Setting Social Security surpluses aside, the surplus for this
year is projected to be $39 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rosy budget outlook assumes the economy _ still growing, at
an annual rate of 5.4 percent during the first quarter of this
year, after more than nine years of expansion _ will continue to
grow by 3 percent a year, on average, over the coming decade.
That's up from the projected 2.7 percent average growth rate
assumed in the February projections.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the federal debt is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed dedicating $2.7 trillion in surpluses _ $2.3
trillion from Social Security and $403 trillion from Medicare_ to
debt reduction over the coming decade. That, he said, along with
the debt repayment already scheduled, would enable the Treasury
Department to wipe out the $3.5 trillion publicly-held debt by the
year 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly-held portion of the overall federal debt is what
the government owes to banks and private investors, on which it
pays more than $200 billion a year in interest _ or 12 cents for
every federal tax dollar the government collects.
</P>
<P>
   The overall federal debt _ the product of three decades of
deficit spending _ would continue to increase, rising from its
current level of $5.5 trillion to $6.5 trillion, under White House
projections, by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   That reflects the growing obligations of the Social Security
program to working baby boomers who begin retiring en masse a
little more than a decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Social Security obligations would build with or
without the budget surpluses. The increased Social Security
obligations are, in part, a symptom of the growing economy, as the
more jobs there are, and the more that workers own, the more they
pay into the system, on the promise of receiving retirement
benefits in the future.

 &HT;    Sosa's votes to go with him if he switches leagues
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ National League votes cast for Sammy Sosa won't be
wasted if the Chicago Cubs trade the slugging outfielder to an
American League team before the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig has decided that Sosa's votes will go
with him if he switches leagues. The All-Star Game is July 11 at
Turner Field in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is third among outfielders in the next-to-last National
League vote totals, released Monday. With 801,404 votes, Sosa is
behind Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. (1,000,924) and San Francisco's
Barry Bonds (873,847). Montreal's Vladimir Guererro (724,352) is
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   American League vote totals will be released today. Last week,
the top AL outfielders were Jermaine Dye of Kansas City, Bernie
Williams of the Yankees and Manny Ramirez of Cleveland. Sosa might
finish with more votes than any of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Voting at ballparks ends today, but fans can continue to cast
votes on the Internet through Saturday. New York Mets catcher Mike
Piazza is the leading NL vote-getter with 1,239,531.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game starters will be announced July 4. The
pitchers and reserves will be selected the next day by the
managers, Bobby Cox of the Braves for the National League and Joe
Torre of the Yankees for the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting race in the American League is at
shortstop, where Seattle's Alex Rodriguez went into this week with
a lead over the Yankees' Derek Jeter and Boston Nomar Garciappara.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Garciaparra narrowly won the starting spot despite
having 25,000 votes thrown out because they were cast on the last
day by a Red Sox fan through a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   Because of computer ballot-stuffing, Major League Baseball took
steps this season to ensure that votes are legitimate. No more than
25 votes will be accepted from any one e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Balloting at stadiums also was limited to 25 games for the first
time. In the past, some teams had advantages because they had more
home games during the voting period.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is expecting a record 14 million votes to be cast this
year, with at least 2 million coming from the Internet. Votes can
be cast at team Web sites and two others
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com and www.seasonticket.com).

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It has been 14 years since Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky began making the transition from icon to man when he
emigrated to Israel. It has been four since he morphed further from
man to politician.
</P>
<P>
   But his experience as a prisoner of conscience in the former
Soviet Union not only stamped him forever; it also shaped others'
expectations of him in unyielding ways.
</P>
<P>
   To Israelis and to Jews worldwide, Sharansky is somewhat frozen
in time behind the bars where he sat for nine years while they
invested in him as a hero and fought for his freedom. And
everything that he does is judged as a return on that investment,
which means some amount of disappointment for everyone, left and
right, secular and religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody marched for me,'' Sharansky, 52, said in an
interview Monday. ``And everybody feels I owe them.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Sharansky is fighting an uphill battle to persuade
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to join hands with the rightist Likud
Party to form a national unity government. He portrays this, too,
as an outgrowth of his days as a Soviet dissident. In his old
punishment cell, he says, he did not distinguish between different
kinds of Jews, and ever since meeting the divided reality of the
Jewish nation, he has sought to forge a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Some lionize him for this, and contend that Sharansky would be
an ideal national leader, much as he would break the mold with his
thickly accented Hebrew and a military record that consists of
three weeks in the national guard.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of Sharansky, who tend to be disillusioned friends
and former supporters, contend that for all his talk of healing, he
is a divisive force.
</P>
<P>
   Doves here long ago stopped expressing their disappointment that
Sharansky, a former human rights champion, ended up taking a hard
line on peace and joining the nationalist camp. Now, though, they
say their disappointment has turned to anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, Sharansky, through publicized letters to the
prime minister, has been demanding that Barak apply the brakes
instead of pedaling furiously toward an Israeli-Palestinian summit
meeting in the United States. If Barak does not stop to brief his
coalition in detail and take into account opposing points of view,
Sharansky said, he will not accompany him to a summit conference
and he will quit the government.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting is a threat that Sharansky has made before, not only to
Barak but also to Benjamin Netanyahu, the rightist prime minister
who preceded him. But right now it is a threat with real teeth
because a pullout by Sharansky would endanger Barak's fragile
coalition during a tense round of peace negotiations. Even though
Sharansky's party, Yisrael B'Alyia, holds only four seats in
Parliament, his departure would be unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about the size of his party, he's a somewhat
peripheral figure,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a Hebrew University
political scientist. ``But his power exceeds his party's stature,
both because the government is now extraordinarily fragile and
because he is Natan, ne Anatoly, Sharansky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like an epic hero of the Jewish people for the 20th
century, even though something happened on the way from Anatoly to
Natan,'' Ezrahi added, referring to the Russian given name and the
chosen Hebrew one.
</P>
<P>
   Former associates say that what happened is politics. ``He
survived the Gulag, and now he's applying the same rules of
survival to the political arena,'' said Hirsh Goodman, a columnist
for the magazine Jerusalem Report who used to be a close friend of
Sharansky. ``He's wooing a constituency, and turning his back on
the liberal human rights personality that he was. I think he's an
obstructionist, and intellectually and politically dishonest, but,
hey, that's just playing the brutal rules of the political game in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky's fans maintain the exact opposite, that only he rises
above the political swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffering does deepen people, and he's the least petty person
in the country,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, a columnist and a
spokesman for Am Ehad, an Orthodox advocacy group. ``He really
believes in compromise not as a necessity of government, but as a
fundamental principle.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharansky went on a television program recently, the host
made a word play on his name, calling him ``Psharansky,'' which
incorporates the Hebrew word for compromise. Sharansky took it as a
compliment. But his media adviser was horrified because he knew
that Israelis _ and especially Russian-Israelis _ would read it as
an insult, a synonym for ``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor of Vesti, a Russian-language newspaper here, says the
immigrants are applauding Sharansky's ``very strong and very tough
position of recent days.'' Sharansky's constituency tends to be
antagonistic to the idea that Israel, such a small country compared
with the former Soviet Union, would make territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to give grades to our politicians,'' said Elia
Naymark, the editor. ``But in the last few days, his score is very
high. Because a lot of immigrants from Russian support the
right-wing position. They kept waiting for him to speak up. And now
that's what he's doing, what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sharansky and his fellow former refuseniks have
gravitated through the years to the right of the Israeli political
spectrum. Their experience in Russia apparently taught them to
disdain concessions to an ideological foe. Reared in an empire,
they also never quite understood the logic of ceding territory to
an adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky does not precisely share his constituents' concern
about land. To him, the ideological obstacle to plunging into
peacemaking is that he would be hesitant to trust an agreement
forged with what he sees as an authoritarian regime, like that of
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He thinks that Israel is
giving and not getting, that it should be demanding
democratization, changes in Palestinian textbooks and the
confiscation of illegal weapons in exchange for territorial
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to live in the abstract love of the people of
the world, and the so-called new Middle East,'' he said. ``Everyone
will be kind and good if we just sign on the bottom line. But
that's a good way maybe to commit suicide, not to build a real
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, including critics, are charmed by Sharansky personally.
Short and bald, he is nobody's blow-dried politician, and he seems,
in all ways but intellectually, quite unpretentious. He sits in the
front seat beside the driver of his government-issued Volvo, for
instance, instead of in the back. He hangs on his office wall a
rubberized caricature of himself, a puppet from a political satire
show.
</P>
<P>
   Next to his desk sits a chessboard suspended in mid-game. It is
part of his lore that he is a chess wizard who played in his head
when he was imprisoned. Now, as then, he said, he is always in the
middle of a game with himself, but ``the board helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who once admired him worry that he is cultivating a
cult-like following. ``In his thinking, it is not the immigrants
who sent him to the Parliament, but he who brought them there,''
said Roman Bronfman, who split from Sharansky last year to form a
small left-secular Russian party. ``He feels like a messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would describe his evolution since the Soviets
released him and allowed him to emigrate to Israel in 1986,
Sharansky said longingly that everything used to be black and
white. ``The main principle then was: no compromise,'' he said.
``In the morning, you said no to the KGB, and in the evening you
said no. You could feel yourself a tzaddik.'' That is a holy man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the free world,'' Sharansky continued, ``it is a lot more
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharansky weighs in on broad national issues like
peacemaking, some here accuse him of overstepping his bounds. His
party is supposed to be what they call here a kielbasa party _ that
is, only interested in its next handout. Sharansky said some people
say to him, ``How dare you take big stands when your people are
only interested in sausage!''
</P>
<P>
   He says he thinks that Barak is trying to co-opt him by inviting
him to attend a summit meeting, if there is one, in Washington. He
thinks Barak will make it impossible for those who oppose an
agreement to reject it, because ``the impatient world'' will be
applauding Israel ``in front of all the cameras.'' Israel would
risk international isolation to turn its back on such approbation.
</P>
<P>
   So that, he said, is why he is acting to halt things in their
tracks, and urging Barak to form a partnership with Ariel Sharon,
the rightist Likud leader. Sharon, he said, will abandon his
uncompromising positions once he is inside the circle of power.

<P>
   Of how he lived and died.

<P>
   GIBSLAND, La._ The lonely stretch of backcountry road doesn't
look much different now than it did on the morning of May 23, 1934.
</P>
<P>
   It was called Sailes Road then; it is Louisiana State Road 154
South now. Once gravel, it's now paved. But the narrow, two-lane
corridor is still flanked on both sides by thick scrub and trees.
The road winds left and right, up and down, making it impossible to
drive too fast, just like 66 years ago. And there's one particular
spot, at the foot of a fairly steep hill, fronted by a heavy clump
of trees and brush, that offers excellent sightlines and ample
cover to anyone wanting to shoot directly across the two lanes.
</P>
<P>
   So the brush is the same, and the winding road pretty much the
same. But, of course, the monument wasn't there that morning _ the
graffiti-stained, half-chipped-away lump of granite with the
inscription, ``This site, May 23, 1934, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie
Parker were killed by law enforcement officials.'' That was erected
a few years later by Bienville Parish residents eager to cash in on
their community's newfound notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Barrow gang's getaways ended, almost instantly turning
this otherwise unremarkable stretch of road into a pilgrimage spot.
After all these years, people still come from all over the world to
see the ``death monument.''

   About six miles from the site, in Gibsland (pop. 1,200), City
Hall is a Bonnie and Clyde souvenir store, offering coffee cups and
bumper stickers and T-shirts festooned with photos of the couple
brandishing guns. There are also bricks for sale ($10 for whole
bricks, $5 for fragments), allegedly from chimneys of local houses
where Bonnie and Clyde slept. Proceeds pay for an annual
re-enactment of the ambush that killed the famous outlaws. It's
going on seven decades since the bloody, one-sided shootout that
lasted at most three minutes, but tourists still come to see where
and how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw from 3,000 to 5,000 visitors every year,'' says
70-year-old Billie Jean Pollard, chairman of the local committee
that oversees the re-enactment. ``They come from England, Spain,
Holland, Japan. Year after year, people never, ever, stop coming.
They can't hear or see or learn enough about those two.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``They class them as cold-blooded killers
</P>
<P>
   They say they are heartless and mean
</P>
<P>
   But I say this with pride
</P>
<P>
   That I once knew Clyde

<P>
   When he was honest and upright and clean.''

   The ``death monument,'' like Graceland for Elvis fans, is the
one place Bonnie and Clyde enthusiasts feel they must visit. But
this rural Louisiana parish near Shreveport is hardly the only
community that can lay claim to the Barrow gang. Dallas, in fact,
has the most substantial hold on the famous outlaws _ it is where
they grew up, began their life of crime and are buried. In fact,
starting from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, it is possible to
combine Dallas; Fort Worth; Stringtown, Okla.; and Gibsland, La.,
into a sort of ``weekend Bonnie and Clyde getaway'' that would sate
the desires of the most devoted chronicler of the outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   For chronology's sake, though not convenience', begin with the
old Barrow garage in Dallas at the intersection of Singleton and
Borger roads. Amazingly, the building at 1221 Singleton, where
Clyde's father operated his garage, is still there, but Clyde
probably wouldn't recognize it. A subsequent occupant painted it
bright blue, yellow and green. The front stands empty, but the back
half of the small building and its yard are still used as an auto
repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde tried to eke out a grease-stained existence here during
the early days of the Depression, though fixing cars certainly
wasn't what he had in mind for his future.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde wanted to be a jazz musician. He had taught himself to
play guitar and saxophone, but in 1930, there were few
opportunities to get started in professional music, and the
21-year-old's day job was helping his father in the elder Barrow's
struggling business.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Bonnie Parker had even grander dreams. The
slender, attractive girl, who wore a size 2 dress, hoped to become
a movie star. Life hadn't cooperated with her dream, either.
Married at 16, Bonnie's husband was in prison, and she was
waitressing in a dumpy Dallas cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in January 1930, the scar-crossed couple met for the
first time at the home of a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just clicked, and everybody around them felt it,'' says
Phillip Steele, an historian whose recently published book, ``The
Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde'' (Pelican Press, $9.95), was
co-authored with Marie Barrow Scoma, Clyde's younger sister.
``Together they still had big dreams, but they lived in a time when
nobody had money for gas or sugar, let alone luxuries. They had no
money. Clyde's big treat was sneaking into movies. He couldn't
afford a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoma, who died last year at age 81 just after the first draft
of ``The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde'' was finished,
desperately wanted a book ``that told the truth about them,''
Steele says. ``I guess hundreds of books on the subject have been
written. But none had access to Marie's memory. So, understanding
that there were some truthful things Marie didn't enjoy including
about her brother and Bonnie but that still had to be in there, we
tried to create a book with valuable insights.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Barrow family lore, the Parker family considered
itself superior _ at least to Clyde's kin. The Parker house in
dingy west Dallas (Bonnie's late father was a bricklayer) was nicer
than the Barrows'. Clyde tried to make a good impression when
calling on Bonnie at her mother's home. But their fledgling
relationship was interrupted when police from Denton arrested Clyde
for car theft in that city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde and his older brother Buck had started stealing
things,'' Steele says. ``That's what lots of young men did during
the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang,
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you all have read
</P>
<P>
   How they rob and steal,
</P>
<P>
   And how those who squeal
</P>
<P>
   Are usually found dying or dead.''

<P>
   For Clyde, imprisonment _ and then a daring breakout and
recapture (Bonnie smuggled a gun into his Waco prison cell) _
followed his arrest in 1930. Clyde's crimes and jailbreak earned
him a 14-year sentence at Eastham Prison Farm near Huntsville. But
he was not to be rehabilitated during his stay. Just the opposite,
in fact: A diary kept by Clyde's mother records that Clyde was
sodomized by another prisoner there, an incident she said hardened
a previously sweet-natured young man.
</P>
<P>
   After Clyde was paroled in February 1932, he briefly moved to
Massachusetts in a half-hearted attempt to go straight. Within
weeks, he returned to Texas and Bonnie. The spark between them was
still very much there, and, together again, this time forever, they
soon began the crime spree that would make them famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the real story of Bonnie and Clyde starts, at
least in most people's opinions,'' Steele says.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the legendary Barrow gang were, however, strictly
small-time crooks, bypassing banks in favor of mom-and-pop stores
and gas stations. But their minor misdeeds suddenly turned big time
in late April 1932 when they killed for the first time _ by
accident. One of the gang tried to shoot open a safe; the bullet
ricocheted and killed the owner of the Hillsboro store, who was
being held nearby at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrow gang was now on the hook for murder, and they headed
north to Stringtown, a town that would become pivotal in the
creation of the Bonnie and Clyde of lore.
</P>
<P>
   Stringtown is about a three-hour drive northeast of Fort Worth,
following Interstate 35W north, U.S. 82 east to Sherman and U.S.
75/69 north.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 5, 1932, a dance was being held in
Stringtown at an outdoor pavilion adjacent to the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just me and one other fellow playing at the dance,''
recalls 86-year-old Duke Ellis of Atoka, who witnessed the night's
events. ``I was on guitar. He was on fiddle. We were up on this
raised platform, playing some of the popular tunes of the day. A
good crowd had turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   About 9 p.m., a car pulled up into the gravel lot by the
bandstand. Ellis recalls it was ``a Ford, maybe a '31 model. There
were three men in it _ Clyde Barrow, Raymond Hamilton and a third
gang member named Milligan. Well, they took turns getting out, one
at a time, to dance while the other two stayed in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   More than music was available at the dance; Ellis says someone
passed around ``wildcat whiskey _ you know, moonshine. It was
prohibition but people drank.'' The Barrow-gang trio gulped down
their share, looking, Ellis adds, ``just like everybody else there.
I never did see them disturbing the peace in any way, but most
every law officer in Atoka County was at the dance, too, and
Sheriff Charley Maxwell started telling folks he was going to
arrest those men in the car _ for drinking, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell walked up to the Ford, put his foot on the running
board, and leaned over to tell Clyde and Hamilton they were under
arrest (Milligan was on the dance floor).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just finished playing `Way Down Yonder,' maybe it was,
when I heard a noise like a car backfiring,'' Ellis says. ``I
looked over and the sheriff's body went flying back off that
running board. Harry Bryant, a man who was not a deputy or
anything, grabbed the gun off Charlie's body and started shooting
at the car. Clyde, he started trying to drive away fast, but he hit
a culvert and the car turned over on its side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Barrow and Hamilton scrambled clear, guns blazing. Deputy
Eugene Moore was hit and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullets were flying everywhere,'' says Ellis, who tried to
take refuge behind a nearby garage. ``One girl who was near me kept
hollering she knew she was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde and Hamilton eventually snuck back into Stringtown, where
they stole the first in a series of cars to make their getaway back
to Texas. (According to Ellis, the gang member he identifies as
Milligan was left behind and later captured.)
</P>
<P>
   Back at the outdoor pavilion, Ellis was recruited to help carry
the badly wounded sheriff to a nearby bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood just soaked through that bed from him,'' Ellis says.
``He only lived because a woman who was a bootlegger kept pouring
whiskey down him. He had six bullet holes in him _ I counted
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor pavilion is gone now; a fruit stand is in its place
at the side of U.S. 69. Parts of the gravel parking lot remain.
Bessie Childress, who runs the fruit stand, is glad to show
visitors where Sheriff Maxwell's body fell. (''Right here by this
tree.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Stringtown gunfight was a turning point for the Barrow gang.
After the murder of a police officer, Bonnie and Clyde, with
nothing left to lose, became cold-blooded killers _ and
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The gang (eventually joined by Clyde's brother Buck and Buck's
wife, Blanche) continued its pattern of robbing small businesses.
Now there was gunplay as often as not. During the next two years,
they killed perhaps a dozen people, including two Grapevine police
officers. Sometimes there were car chases down twisting roads. The
gang had a huge advantage _ most guns used by law enforcement
officers weren't powerful enough for the bullets to penetrate the
bodies of cars. Clyde didn't have that problem; his weapon of
choice was a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) that could blow a hole
through any auto.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``penny dreadful'' novelists of the era loved
Bonnie and Clyde. Steele guesses hundreds of short, sensational
novels about the duo were published from 1932 through 1934.
Newspapers across the Southwest also competed to write the most
lurid stories about their exploits, both real and imagined. Clyde
and Bonnie loved it _ though not one particular story in the
Star-Telegram. The gang came to Fort Worth on a handful of
occasions, usually to hang low and regroup on the city's rollicking
north side, where it was relatively easy to go unnoticed. They took
lots of pictures of themselves, which were widely distributed. But
though Bonnie, who once dreamed of being a famous movie star, loved
the publicity, she was incensed about a report that she smoked
cigars, insisting she only posed with one for a joke photo.

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Ask Stan Shih about personal computers, the
Internet or his native Taiwan, and he holds forth enthusiastically.
Not for nothing is Shih, the voluble founder of the computer maker
Acer, regarded as the head cheerleader and unofficial spokesman for
corporate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Shih whether he favors an independent Taiwan, and he
turns monosyllabic. ``No,'' he says, as his Cheshire-cat smile
tightens.
</P>
<P>
   Shih, 56, has good reason to be wary. As the chairman of one of
Taiwan's biggest multinational corporations, he has major
investments in mainland China. Since Chen Shui-bian, a strong
supporter of Taiwanese independence, was elected president in
March, being identified as a person who supports independence _ or
one who even seems to _ has become a sure way to derail one's
prospects in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always neutral in election campaigns,'' Shih said. ``The
fact is, President Chen appointed me as one of his advisers. I
couldn't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Shih says he did not even vote this year. Yet his advisory role
looked awfully close to a vote of confidence. And worse, he
appeared to be endorsing a man whose party espouses independence
for Taiwan. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a vital part of Chinese
territory that was separated during the civil war that ended in
1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the Chinese government to Chen's election was
swift and angry: It put out the word that Taiwanese businessmen
with ties to the new president or who favored independence for
Taiwan were putting their China operations at risk. The statement
was widely interpreted as a warning to Acer and Shih.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Shih is one of several captains of industry here who have
been caught in the treacherous political waters between Taipei and
Beijing. Some, like the plastics tycoon Hsu Wen-lung, have been
frank advocates of independence. Others, like Chang Yung-fa, a
shipping magnate, are longtime supporters of Chen. Still others,
like Shih, simply like to oblige future leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Beijing is scrutinizing the political
beliefs of Taiwanese business leaders and warning those who stray
from the official line that there is only one China. Political
analysts say the crackdown could undermine the historic role of
commerce as a bridge between Taiwan and China, binding the
countries closer together even when they diverge politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last election, China came to realize that businessmen
can play a very strong role in Taiwanese politics,'' Tien Hung-mao,
Taiwan's foreign minister, said in an interview last month. ``So
China has begun politicizing the economic relationship between the
two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tien worries that Taiwanese business executives may be forced to
take a loyalty oath to protect their investments in China. Those
who refuse may become the targets of tax audits, surprise
inspections and other forms of harassment by the Chinese
government. In the worst case, some companies may be forced to
leave China and take their capital and skills with them.
</P>
<P>
   Since China opened its doors to Taiwan two decades ago, trade
across the Taiwan Strait has proved to be remarkably resistant to
politics. In the first quarter of this year, while Beijing was
threatening military action if the Taiwanese elected Chen, Taiwan
exported $6.2 billion worth of goods to China, a 16 percent
increase over 1999. It imported $1.3 billion, a 33 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   But Taiwan's investment in China is showing signs of weakness.
While the amount of investment contracts increased 46 percent in
the first quarter, the actual volume of Taiwanese money flowing
into China declined 9.5 percent, to $420 million, according to the
Foreign Trade Ministry in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that could be an early barometer of trouble. Even
investors like Shih, who were once wooed by Beijing to build
factories with promises of tax breaks and reduced import duties,
acknowledge they can no longer plow money into China without
thinking twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be concerned,'' Shih said. ``But I cannot control
their opinion. If they welcome me, I will contribute to their
country. If they don't welcome me, I have so many other things to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shih is not as passive as he sounds. He traveled to a technology
conference in Beijing in April, enduring a snub when high-level
officials did not meet with him. And he plans to return in August
to promote a new Web site, which features a series of lectures by
him. By sharing his insights on entrepreneurialism with mainland
students, Shih clearly hopes to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   Acer has a lot riding on Shih's charm offensive. Earlier this
year, the company opened a $50 million factory in the province of
Guangdong to make personal computers. Several more plants are on
the drawing board. The company is also testing an Internet service
in Shanghai. It hopes to roll out the service commercially, which
would make it a pioneer in China's interactive communications
business.
</P>
<P>
   For Acer, China is the linchpin in its plans to become a global
leader in the technology industry. Shih said Taiwan, with 23
million people, was simply too small to supply it with enough
workers or customers to compete with giant overseas rivals like
Dell Computer or IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Acer is also struggling in the fiercely competitive American
personal- computer market. The company is counting on rapid growth
in China to offset its tribulations in the United States. Shih
believes that despite the political uncertainty, Taiwanese
companies are still the best-positioned to dominate the mainland
market. Someday, he predicted, Taiwan and China will be parts of
the same greater China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long it will take,'' he said, ``but sooner or
later, after China becomes more competitive and self-confident, we
will treat China as our home market.''  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody shares Shih's optimism. Dennis Chao, the managing
director of a Taiwanese sportswear manufacturer, opened a factory
in the southern city of Guangzhou in 1987. He said he was drawn by
the Chinese government's promise of favorable treatment for Taiwan
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, however, Beijing stopped treating Taiwanese
differently than other foreign investors. Chao, 48, said that
losing breaks on import duties on machinery and raw materials has
made it uneconomical for him to install new equipment or otherwise
expand his factory, which employs 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the last month, the Chinese government warned Taiwanese
investors in the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian that they would
be subject to unspecified sanctions if they advocated independence
for Taiwan. Chao says he has studiously steered clear of politics.
But he said such threats only added to China's reputation as an
impossible place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not enemies; we're all Chinese,'' Chao said as he shook
his head. ``It's enough to drive you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said China's crackdown has been fueled by its
irritation with a few high-profile personalities in Taiwan rather
than any overall objection to where most business leaders stand on
the issue. In particular, Beijing is angry with Hsu Wen-lung, the
chairman of Chi Mei Industry, a petrochemical giant.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu, whose company has six factories in China, staunchly
supports Chen and has proclaimed his desire for an independent
Taiwan. The Chinese government has subjected Chi Mei to numerous
inspections and ordered state companies not to do business with it.
It is the only known case of retaliation so far.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Beijing could play hardball with Hsu because it had
a large and competitive domestic petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a policy of selective sanctions,'' said Andrew Yang,
the secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy
Studies, a research organization here. ``It is not a unified policy
toward Taiwan companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Yang said China would be unlikely to take Draconian
steps against Acer, which, as a high-technology company, provides
expertise and thousands of skilled jobs. Despite the contretemps
with its founder, Acer has not lost its license to test Internet
services in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Shih is going out of his way to protest his political
innocence. He says he hopes for the eventual reunification of
Taiwan and China. In case there is any misunderstanding, he adds,
``I also agree with the Chinese government's position that
businessmen shouldn't support independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say that Shih, who learned business by helping his
mother sell duck eggs and stationary, was probably turned into more
of a symbol than he ever wished during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Shih has been very conservative his whole life,'' said
Antonio Chiang, the editor of The Taipei Times, an English-language
newspaper that supports Chen. ``But he is sympathetic to the cause
of reform. Chen Shui-bian is the only one who can reform Taiwanese
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say Beijing does not pay attention to such
subtleties. They believe the Chinese government is using commercial
ties as a lever to subdue Taiwan. Beijing pursued a similar
campaign with Hong Kong investors before the former British colony
reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, even tycoons who had been knighted by Queen
Elizabeth swore fealty to Beijing. Some experts say the lure of the
mainland market is so Strong that it will get similar allegiance
from Taiwan's tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, China relied heavily on Taiwanese
investment, but now foreign investors from many countries are in
China,'' said Liang Su-Yung, head of the Strait Peaceful
Reunification Association, a pro-China lobbying group. ``Taiwanese
companies need China more than it needs them.'' &QL;

GIBSLAND, La.: a joke photo. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Amon,'' his biography of Star-Telegram publisher Amon
Carter, Jerry Flemmons tells about a letter Clyde sent to Carter
after being displeased with printed comments about Bonnie: ``You
better think, decide and make up your mind and not let your Editor
make another remark about Bonnie like you did the other day,''
Clyde wrote the publisher. ``They called her my cigar-smoking
woman. Another remark about my underworld mate and I will end such
men as you mighty quick. I know where you and your reporters
live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter scared the hell out of Amon,'' Flemmons adds. The
letter ``was never mentioned in the Star-Telegram, but until the
couple's ambush and death in Louisiana, Bonnie was never again
called a cigar smoker.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their time in Fort Worth was peaceful, there were
headline-grabbing shootouts in Missouri and Arkansas, plus
innumerable close calls after holdups in Texas and Oklahoma. Then
the gang's luck began to turn bad. Bonnie was horribly burned in a
June 1933 car accident; on one of her legs, Steele says, bone
showed through in two places. In July, the gang was cornered in
Iowa. Bonnie and Clyde escaped, but Buck was shot (for the second
time in five days), and he and Blanche were captured. Buck died
from his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scoma told Steele that, no matter where they had been or what
they had done, Bonnie and Clyde always returned to Dallas for
regular visits with their families. At first these were happy
occasions. Scoma recalled her big brother bringing her a new
bicycle, an almost unimaginable gift for a child during the
Depression. But after Buck's death, the gatherings were more
somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that their time was running out,'' Steele
says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think they are too tough or desperate.
</P>
<P>
   They know the law always wins.
</P>
<P>
   They have been shot at before
</P>
<P>
   But they do not ignore
</P>
<P>
   That death is the wages of sin.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   All roads eventually would lead back to Dallas, where the
families of both Bonnie and Clyde lived. But when they returned for
the last time, it would be in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Texas authorities had had enough. Bonnie and Clyde
were making them look bad, and, in the darkest days of the
Depression, the powerful image of glamorous outlaws out to get
something for themselves was one that authorities wanted
desperately to snuff out. So Frank Hamer, a legendary Texas Ranger
with scars from 23 bullet wounds, was named to head a posse
devoting itself exclusively to hunting down Bonnie and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem was obvious. A car recovered from an earlier
shootout with the gang had more than 100 dents from bullets _ none
had penetrated the metal. The posse needed Browning Automatic
Rifles, and there were eight stored in Texas' National Guard
Armory. But the law prohibited the rifles being loaned to
nonmilitary personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came to me, I turned 'em down,'' says 95-year-old
Col. Weldon Dowis of Hot Springs, Ark., then a 29-year-old National
Guard captain. ``It was against the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas congressman Hatton W. Summers wrote Dowis a letter saying
he would take responsibility for the loan. Reluctantly, Dowis
handed over two of the rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to show them how to shoot 'em on our range,'' he
recalls. ``They said they figured they'd know pretty soon where
they could catch (Bonnie and Clyde).''
</P>
<P>
   They were right. In January 1934, the Barrow gang added Henry
Methvin, a young hood whose family had a farm in Louisiana's
Bienville Parish. Bonnie and Clyde had established a previous
pattern of hiding out in the family homes of gang members. Hamer
knew Henderson Jordan, the Bienville sheriff. They arranged a
meeting with Ivan Methvin, Henry's father, and offered a deal: If
Methvin helped the posse ambush Bonnie and Clyde, his son would be
pardoned for his crimes in Texas and Arkansas. Methvin agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Barrow gang showed up in Bienville. Ivan Methvin
welcomed them, then contacted the authorities. The posse was
summoned, the terrain scouted, and, on May 22, Methvin warned his
son to stay away from Bonnie and Clyde the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, Bonnie and Clyde and Henry Methvin drove
into the sleepy town of Gibsland. Henry made himself scarce. The
infamous couple went to a cafe and ordered sandwiches. Bonnie was
still eating hers when Clyde spotted a police car on a nearby
street and told her they had to get back to the car. There was no
concern about Henry's whereabouts; he could easily find
transportation home.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws took Sailes Road back toward the Methvin farm. They
probably didn't hurry; they were enjoying their stay in the area
and weren't too concerned about local residents recognizing them.
Ninety-year-old Pauline Evans, who lived in Bienville Parish at the
time, remembers Clyde pulling his car over to talk to her as she
stood by her family's mailbox. He politely introduced himself _
Bonnie was also in the front seat _ and asked if she wanted a ride.
She declined.
</P>
<P>
   The posse had taken up its position in the brush alongside the
road hours earlier. About 9 a.m., a lookout spotted Clyde's car
coming and gave a signal. Ivan Methvin pulled his truck opposite
the ambush site, parking on the side of the road. Clyde spotted his
host's vehicle as he crested a small hill, and stopped to see if
Methvin needed help. As the car halted, Methvin dived under his
truck. The six members of the posse leaped to their feet and opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finally silent, the officers gingerly opened the car
door. Bonnie was still clutching the remnants of her sandwich. A
.45 pistol was in her lap. Clyde had a sawed-off shotgun beside
him; his beloved saxophone was in the back seat, beside the other
guns he hadn't had time to use. Each of the partially dismembered
bodies had more than 40 bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two outlaws had been silenced. And, with a monument to the deed
soon erected, a town's prominent place on the map was established.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day they will go down together;
</P>
<P>
   And they will bury them side by side.
</P>
<P>
   To a few it means grief,
</P>
<P>
   To the law it's relief,
</P>
<P>
   But it's death to Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie got part of it right. She and Clyde died together. He was
25, she was 23. The posse had their bodies removed from the
bullet-riddled car and shipped back to the Barrow and Parker
families in Dallas, with one delay. The Bienville Parish locals
demanded to see the corpses, so they were put on brief public
display in nearby Arcadia first.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlaw couple weren't buried side by side. Bonnie was
interred in Dallas' relatively upscale Crownhill Memorial Park
Cemetery, at 9700 Webb Chapel Road. Clyde was buried next to older
brother Buck in cramped Western Heights Cemetery a few miles away
at 1617 Fort Worth Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Like the back road where they died, their graves are still
pretty much unchanged. Bonnie's marker reads, ``As the flowers are
all made sweeter by the sunshine and the dew, so this old world is
made brighter by the likes of folks like you.'' A receptionist at
the cemetery says that ``lots of people come to see Bonnie.'' They
leave flowers and notes and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde's grave is harder to find. Western Heights Cemetery is
surrounded by a high chain-link fence, and its gates are often
padlocked, with no visiting hours posted. But people do get in;
part of the fence by the gate has been pulled down to make a
convenient foothold. Clyde and Buck's marker says simply, ``Gone
But Not Forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she died, Steele says, Marie Barrow Scoma hoped her
brother's remains could be moved next to Bonnie's in Crownhill
Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would be a tourist attraction and a good
thing for Dallas,'' Steele says. ``Surely someone could contact the
Barrow family and the Parker family and see if it could happen.''

 &HT;    Sub Serlenga making most of playing opportunity
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ It's one thing for Cindy Parlow to be bagging
hat tricks. Parlow is a fixture at forward on the U.S. women's
soccer team that won the World Cup last year and is favored to keep
its Olympic gold medal in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But for Nikki Serlenga, her future Atlanta professional club
teammate, multiple-goal games are a rarity. The 22-year-old
defensive midfielder is getting her first taste of senior team
competition this year, and she rapidly is becoming a serious
candidate to make the final Olympic cut later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Serlenga scored her first international hat trick in
an 8-0 rout of Costa Rica. For the moment, Serlenga is backing up
starter Lorrie Fair while Michelle Akers recovers from a shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   She appears to have gotten over some initial jitters about
rubbing shoulders with the biggest names in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, you're kind of in awe of them,'' Serlenga
said. ``But you can't play like you're that. If you train like
you're just happy to be here, then you won't be here for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Serlenga, Parlow and goalkeeper Briana Scurry were
allocated to the Atlanta franchise in the Women's United Soccer
Association. Parlow, leads the U.S. with 14 goals in 13 games this
year, including four hat tricks. Scurry is missing the Gold Cup
with a shin injury.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach April Heinrichs, who rested several starters Sunday,
figures to field her top lineup tonight in the Group A finale
against Brazil. That would relegate Serlenga and some of the other
younger players to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes our younger players struggle with the fact that
there are so many good players on the team,'' Heinrichs said. ``We
are trying to push several little buttons that will help their
confidence and development.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner tonight avoids China in Saturday's semifinals. If the
two teams play to a draw, a coin flip would determine the group
winner, because they would be tied on head-to-head play, goal
difference and total goals. Brazil and the U.S. both beat Costa
Rica 8-0 and Trinidad and Tobago 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   For players such as Serlenga, Heinrichs' concerted effort to
break in the next generation of players in an Olympic year has been
the ideal proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more opportunities I get to play, the better I think my
chances are (of making the team),'' Serlenga said. ``I can't
control that, but I'm just going out every game and trying to prove
myself.''

NABISCO DEAL MAKES PHILIP MORRIS INVESTORS AND ICAHN BIG WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN with CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two big winners in the two-part deal to sell off
Nabisco: Philip Morris shareholders, who saw the price of their
stock rise nearly $4 Monday on the news that the maker of Marlboro,
Jell-O and Miracle Whip would now own brands like Oreo and Wheat
Thins; and Carl Icahn, the value investor whose betting against the
market when he bought a stake in Nabisco Group Holdings earlier
this year gave him a large psychic and financial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we bought Nabisco three or four months ago, everybody
said it was in big trouble because of the litigation,'' Icahn
recalled in an interview from his home in East Hampton, N.Y., where
he spent the better part of last week as the final installments in
the closely watched takeover drama unfolded. ``Nabisco was just
amazingly undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   His investment grew to $980 million by the time the deal was
done, netting him and his investors about $600 million, after a
brief period.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings, which makes nuts and condiments as well as
cookies and crackers, will be sold to Philip Morris for $14.9
billion, or $55 a share. Once that deal is complete, R.J. Reynolds
will buy Nabisco Group Holdings, whose only asset is 80.6 percent
of Nabisco Holdings, for $30 a share, or about $9.8 billion. The
holding company will retain $1.5 billion in cash, ``until we decide
what we want to do with it,'' a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Geoffrey C. Bible, the chairman and
chief executive of Philip Morris, said he would not spin off all of
Kraft, which will be a giant among food makers once the acquisition
of Nabisco is complete. The company does plan to spin off 10
percent to 15 percent of Kraft early next year, which Bible said
could generate $5 billion to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in all four companies involved in the deal went up
Monday. ``This transaction has unlocked some value that had been
hidden by the taint of tobacco smoke,'' said John M. McMillin, a
food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Monday that Group Danone, the French food
maker, had submitted a last-minute bid that came close to Philip
Morris' offer. But to break up the deal would cost Danone a fee
that Philip Morris executives estimated at $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the fiscal windfall, the deal is a vindication for
Icahn, who led a short-lived proxy battle last spring aimed at
getting Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman of what was then known as
RJR Nabisco, to spin off the company's majority stake in Nabisco
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Goldstone had already announced plans to spin off
the domestic tobacco business and sell the international rights to
brands like Winston and Camel. Icahn argued that the food holdings
should be freed up instead, leaving the domestic tobacco company
inside the holding company as a hedge against costs from lawsuits
brought by cigarette smokers. In a roundabout way, the deal
announced Sunday, in which R.J. Reynolds will pay $30 a share for
Nabisco Group Holdings, achieves just that.
</P>
<P>
   Far from breaking out the champagne, Icahn said he was more or
less taking the sale of Nabisco in stride. ``It's a great way to
lose,'' he said. ``I think Goldstone did a good job in getting a
good price for Nabisco.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he sent a letter to Goldstone, the chairman of
Nabisco, offering to increase his bid to $31 a share in cash and
short-term notes, which Icahn believes prompted R.J. Reynolds to
improve its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I increased the bid, and while I didn't win, I'm sure it got
the price higher for Nabisco Group Holdings,'' he said. ``I'm sure
glad I didn't go to Spain.'' Instead of heading across the
Atlantic, where he was supposed to attend a wedding, he stayed in
the New York area as investment bankers and lawyers hammered out
the details of the sale of Nabisco Group Holdings, which is
contingent on the sale of Nabisco Holdings going through. Both
sales are supposed to be completed by October; while pending
tobacco litigation could stall the Nabisco Group Holdings deal,
many analysts do not expect that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``R.J. Reynolds is a richer parent as a result of its deal,
which should please plaintiffs,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco
stocks analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. John Coale, a Washington
lawyer who represents some of the plaintiffs in smoking-related
lawsuits, said the improved strength of the tobacco companies
``just means the payments to the plaintiffs are more solid.''  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered whether Icahn, who worked tirelessly to break
up the food-tobacco combination at RJR Nabisco, would turn his
attention next to Philip Morris. Icahn, who is fond of poker, said
that was not in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too huge,'' he said, referring to the size of Philip Morris.
``I like to be in something where you can have some meaningful
input.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his other investments are a small stake in J.C. Penney,
the struggling retailer; a 4.5 million share stake in the
Federal-Mogul Corp., an auto-parts maker; and stakes in casino
operators like Claridge's and the Sands.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also keeping a close eye on certain Internet stocks,
where he has invested money betting that the share price will fall.
``I'm short a lot of the Internets, such as Amazon and
Priceline.com, and have been for the last six months,'' he said.
``I believe some of their business models are completely flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   He owns a Web-based travel agency, Lowestfare.com, which sells
discounted airline tickets and tour packages, which he said was
making money. He called the Internet ``a great thing,'' but because
of the business model of many Internet companies, he said he was
shorting the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the mental makeup to short them,'' he said.
``When the elevator operator is buying them, that's when you short
them. You have to have belief in what you believe. It's like the
Rudyard Kipling poem _ if you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you _ that's what investing is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, he said: ``I think there will be
opportunities in six months to a year. A number of them will have
major troubles, and there will be real value.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn provided an auditors' report prepared by Peat Marwick that
said his investments had produced an annualized 48 percent return
between 1990 and 1995. Since then, an associate said, the rate had
continued along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, there have been some notable failures, including
his 1990 junk-bond takeover of Trans World Airlines, which
eventually went into bankruptcy, and more recently, his protracted
battle with Ronald O. Perelman for control of Marvel Comics.
</P>
<P>
   He is concerned, he said, about the overvalued state of many
stocks. Too many analysts look at cash flow as a guide, he said,
when the true earnings of many companies are overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the proliferation of online trading, done by
people he characterized as overconfident: ``People say they bet on
themselves. But it's like playing at a professional poker game. You
can win for a little while, but beware.''

<P>
   The Ebola virus, which has caused deaths from high fever and
bleeding in African outbreaks, can also infect without producing
illness, according to a new finding by African and European
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of asymptomatic infection was only suggested in
earlier studies, they said in last week's issue of The Lancet, a
medical journal published in London. Now they said they had
documented such infections for the first time. They found that the
Ebola virus could persist in the blood of asymptomatic infected
individuals for two weeks after they were first exposed to an
infected individual. How much longer the virus can persist is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   All outbreaks of Ebola have been controlled by standard
infection control measures such as effective body disposal,
destroying or sterilizing contaminated equipment and appropriate
use of gloves. But if people can be carriers without showing
symptoms, it means control might be more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This degree of containment would be virtually impossible if
symptom-free carriers posed a significant threat of infection,''
Dr. Alan G. Baxter of Newtown, Australia, wrote in an editorial in
the same issue of The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known that Ebola usually spreads from an
infected person to another individual and through contamination in
clinics or hospitals. The new finding suggests that some cases may
result from healthy carriers. How often is unknown. The finding
could help scientists in their long-term quest to develop effective
therapies to treat the virus or perhaps even a vaccine to prevent
infection.
</P>
<P>
   But an immediate effect is to raise the need to reasses health
policy about one of the most virulent viruses known and to
determine how often healthy carriers transmit it, said the
scientific team headed by Dr. E. M. Leroy of Franceville, Gabon.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is transmitting Ebola through blood transfusions.
Dr. Thomas G. Ksiazek, an expert in Ebola at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency in Atlanta, said
that such concern would be much greater in Africa than in the
United States, where blood banks usually ask people who have been
in Africa in recent months not to donate because of the threat of
transmitting malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy's team said another public health concern was transmission
of Ebola virus from healthy carriers through sex. Other scientists
have detected Ebola in semen.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of people with symptoms of Ebola have died in
widely publicized outbreaks in the central African countries of
Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Illness often begins abruptly, from five to 10 days after
exposure to Ebola virus, with symptoms like fever, headache,
vomiting and diarrhea. Then bleeding can occur internally or ooze
from needle sites and through the nose and mouth. Death usually
occurs from five to seven days after the onset of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy's team studied 25 individuals who never developed symptoms
although they lived with family members and cared for them without
using gloves and other precautions in two outbreaks in Gabon in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Using standard virologic techniques, the scientists from Gabon,
Germany and France said they could not detect the virus in the
blood of the healthy contacts. But Leroy's succeeded by using a
technique known as polymerase chain reaction to grow the tiny
amount of virus present.

 &HT;    WebVan to acquire online competitor HomeGrocer
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Online grocer WebVan announced Monday it would acquire
Seattle-based competitor HomeGrocer for about $1.2 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, where residents have been ordering Webvan groceries
since May 1, would have been one of a handful of cities where the
two companies would have competed head-to-head for online grocery
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked as though Atlanta was going to be the first market
where two online grocers were going to be battling it out,'' said
Jupiter Communications analyst Ken Cassar. ``In a way it's too bad
for Atlanta, because there could have been bitter price war that
could have put one of them out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan, based in San Francisco, will pay 1.076 shares, or about
$9.39, for each HomeGrocer share, 16 percent more than HomeGrocer's
closing price Friday.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer is 21.6 percent owned by Amazon.com. Some analysts
say speculation about Amazon's possible financial troubles may have
hastened the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar said the deal makes a good sense. ``The online grocery
business in terms of delivery and infrastructure is extraordinarily
expensive,'' he said. ``At the same time, the market is relatively
small. The market cannot support multiple players competing in the
same market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a merger was probably inevitable, but most analysts
thought it would come later. ``We thought they were going to wait
until they were head-to-head in a number of markets, but I think
it's prudent they didn't wait. They saved themselves a lot of
money. ``
</P>
<P>
   George Shaheen, WebVan's chief operating officer, said the
merger is a simple matter of economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to enter new markets more cost efficiently and
realize additional cost savings,'' he said. ``We will eliminate
overlap, save money and reduce the time spent marketing to win the
loyalty of online shoppers and the total shopping experience.''
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer had originally planned to launch its service in
Atlanta June 14, but delayed the opening indefinitely, saying it
was a marketing decision. Shaheen and HomeGrocer chief executive
Mary Alice Taylor revealed Monday that the company was in the
middle of acquisition negotiations as HomeGrocer was planning the
Atlanta launch.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer has already built a distribution facility in
Lawrenceville, Ga., and had purchased additional property in
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said it was uncertain how VebVan would integrate those
properties into its Atlanta operation. WebVan's central
distribution center is located in Suwanee, Ga., with smaller
distribution centers across metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan sells groceries in Atlanta and the San Francisco Bay
areas. The company plans to reach to 13 metropolitan areas by
year's end. Webvan plans to sell groceries in Atlanta, Baltimore,
Bergen County, N.J., Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Orange County,
Calif., Portland, Sacramento, Calif., San Diego, San Francisco,
Seattle and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen says the deal will be finalized later this year. Webvan
founder Louis Borders will remain as chairman of the board and
WebVan's Shaheen will remain as president and CEO. Taylor will
leave the combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen said the new company will have increased buying power
and smaller operating costs. ``We can spend money much more
efficiently. If you could have it one way or the other, why not
have one clear winner in the marketplace,'' he said.

WEALTHY NATIONS BRAND 35 PLACES AS HAVENS FOR TAX EVADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Type ``tax haven'' into an Internet search engine
and the following come-on is less than a second away:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibraltar _ professional services for using Gibraltar as a
financial center and tax haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies and rich people have used offshore financial centers
to avoid paying income, corporate and capital gains taxes in
industrial countries for generations. The Internet now makes it a
snap to do so without leaving the office.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthy nations, which have lost tens of billions of dollars
year after year, declared Monday that they had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development publicly declared a list of 35 mostly exotic island
getaways, including Samoa, Tonga and the U.S. Virgin Islands, that
have tax laws intended to attract assets from companies and people
who want to evade actual tax payments or potential tax liabilities
in their home countries. The organization named 47 other places
that have ``potentially harmful'' tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 havens have generally declined to cooperate with foreign
investigators who seek to catch tax dodgers. They were given a year
to overhaul their tax laws or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization of business and the point-and-click ease of moving
large amounts of money around the world have transformed remote
havens into profitable financial centers. The United States
strongly backed the ``name and shame'' campaign. Unlike some other
developed nations, the United States imposes taxes on the earnings
of its citizens and companies anywhere they are made. It loses
billions of dollars in tax revenue each year because offshore
financial centers help people hide income from the Internal Revenue
Service, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, wealthy nations publicized another list, of 15
countries and territories they accuse of declining to crack down on
money laundering. Several lands, including the Bahamas, the Cook
Islands and Liechtenstein, appear on both lists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the havens are either colonies, former colonies or
protectorates of European countries, especially the United Kingdom.
Britain has been increasingly willing to put pressure on these
territories, and a British official hailed Monday's announcement as
``a vital step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The full OECD tax haven list includes: Andorra, Anguilla,
Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, the
British Virgin Islands, Cook Islands, Dominica, Gibraltar, Grenada,
Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Liechtenstein, the
Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montserrat, Nauru, the
Netherlands Antilles, Nieui, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, St. Lucia,
St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tonga,
Turks and Caicos, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the named territories objected to the campaign by the
organization. One of them, Jersey, issued a statement calling the
report ``absurd'' and said that wealthy nations had applied a
stricter standard for the Pacific and Caribbean countries and
territories than they did for Switzerland and Luxembourg, which
also have reputations as tax havens. Switzerland and Luxembourg are
members of the OECD. U.S. officials have said that the two
generally cooperate with investigations into tax dodging and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Six countries and territories - Bermuda, the Cayman Islands,
Cyprus, Malta, Mauritius and San Marino - slipped off the
short-list of places to be named as tax havens last week after they
pledged to meet international norms by 2005.

 &HT;    Box brouhaha leaves announcers banned from Braves flights
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves were angry that TBS aired video
Saturday showing that the Turner Field catcher's box had been
altered. As a result, the Braves have banned the cable channel's
four baseball announcers from the team's chartered flights.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Caray, Joe Simpson, Don Sutton and Pete Van Wieren usually
fly with the Braves players, coaches and staff on trips. But now,
they will have to travel on commercial flights, beginning with the
road trip to Montreal and New York starting today. The length of
the ban was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The four announcers are employees of TBS. Time Warner Inc. is
the parent company of both the cable channel and the baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday for comment, Braves president Stan Kasten
replied, ``No, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, reached at his home Monday, declined to comment. The
other three could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   TBS was quiet on the issue, because it is caught between
defending its broadcasters and producers without causing more
friction with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The channel aired the footage on the catcher's box in the top of
the first inning of the game Saturday night. Van Wieren and Sutton
were the announcers on the air at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire John Shulock called a balk on catcher Fernando
Lunar for lining up with his right foot outside the catcher's box.
After the balk call, which led to Bobby Cox's ejection, TBS
superimposed video of Friday night's catcher's box over Saturday
night's version. Saturday's was about 4-5 inches smaller. The
Braves do have the standard 43-inch-wide template to trace the box.
</P>
<P>
   The balk helped figure in the Brewers' first run in what turned
out to be a 2-1 loss for the Braves and pitcher Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Many Braves pitchers, including Maddux, like to have the
catcher's targets set up wide of the plate, so that they miss off
the plate rather than on it. But opposing managers point out that
it increases the chances of umpires calling an outside pitch a
strike rather than a ball.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Brewers manager Davey Lopes had made that
complaint and urged the umpires to make a call that is rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball said that it is looking into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation we're reviewing in the overall context of not
only the box and how it was drawn but the subsequent decision taken
the following day,'' said Sandy Alderson, MLB executive vice
president for baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catcher's box is designed as its name implies,'' Alderson
said. ``A lot of that goes to the way balls and strikes are called.
It's a situation we're looking at. I wouldn't say it's at the top
of our list.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario for the Braves probably would be a fine,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves flew to Montreal for a two-game series, today and
Wednesday. Then, they go to New York for the greatly anticipated
four-game series against the Mets, Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has not played the Mets since beating them in the
National League Championship Series in October, and the Braves have
not played in New York since reliever John Rocker's controversial
statements were published in Sports Illustrated in December.

ADVERTISING: COLORFUL CAMPAIGN WANTS CONSUMERS TO USE XEROX
PRINTERS AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last December, Robert A. Wyatt, a managing partner in
the creative department of the New York office of Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising was walking through Grand Central Terminal obsessing _
as he had for months _ on his latest project: how to persuade the
world that Xerox, a name synonymous with pricey corporate copiers,
also stood for low-priced home printers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, from the window of Posman Books, an image leaped out
at him: A blue dog with bright yellow eyes. ``It just stopped me
cold,'' Wyatt recalled. ``It said art, color, imagination, all
those things you'd want to associate with printers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, the cover of ``Blue Dog Man,'' the painter
George Rodrigue's latest compilation of paintings featuring the
Blue Dog, an image of almost cultlike popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt bought the book and rushed to the office to show it to
Barry Hoffman, his partner on the Xerox project. Several
conversations and plane trips to Rodrigue's New Orleans home later
and a campaign was born.
</P>
<P>
   For an amount he will not divulge _ although he did sound
pleased in a recent telephone conversation _ Rodrigue will paint a
series of Blue Dog ads for Xerox over the next five years. He gets
veto power over story boards. And, he gets to keep the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a serious artist selling printers? ``I make images and
they make images, so why not put them together?'' Rodrigue said.
``Would Andy Warhol have done this? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which Xerox will unveil along with four new inkjet
printers Tuesday at PC Expo here, features Rodrigue's Blue Dog
riding a motorcycle (``twice as fast as the rest of the pack''),
standing guard by the printer (``always faithful to its owner'')
and doing other vaguely printer-related tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Each ad carries the slogan ``a smarter breed of inkjet printer''
_ interesting wordplay in that Blue Dog is, to put it most kindly,
of indeterminate ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The ads represent many firsts for Xerox. They trumpet the $149
price of Xerox's lowest-cost printer, a shocker for a company whose
advertising has always played down the importance of price. Blue
Dog's almost cartoonlike simplicity appeals not just to adults but
to children, a group that uses home printers a lot, but that Xerox
has never pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The ads include the Xerox logo _ ``Xerox, the Document Co.,'' in
muted tones _ but also feature a new logo styled just for the
printer line in red, green, orange and blue. They show the logos of
Staples and other stores that will sell Xerox printers.
</P>
<P>
   And, with a budget of more than $200 million, the campaign is
the most expensive in Xerox history.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes may justify the cost. Xerox reckons that SOHO _
that's industry parlance for small office and home office _
represents a $57 billion market for printers. Canon, IBM and
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen are making huge inroads into Xerox's
corporate markets, so the company badly needs SOHO sales to grow.
And, with Hewlett-Packard already the 800-pound gorilla in the
printer market, Xerox needs to grab those sales before ``to
Hewlett'' becomes as generic a term for printing as ``to Xerox''
has been for copying.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox recently signed a distributor's agreement with Dell
Computer, and analysts say it will soon announce _ probably Tuesday
_ a deal with Compaq to bundle Xerox printers in with Compaq's
personal computers. But Xerox knows it needs even more to bolster
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need bold advertising, because you can't send a lot of
salesmen to call on small businesses,'' said James A. Firestone,
Xerox's senior vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt and Hoffman faced no easy task, though. For decades, Xerox
billed itself as the megacorporation's document utopia. The result?
``Xerox is a household name without a household product, a name
that says big price tags on big copiers for big companies,''
Hoffman said. ``Xerox's competitors could differentiate themselves
from each other, but we had to differentiate Xerox from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue has already painted five Blue Dog ads, at least three
of which will also be used on billboards. Other Blue Dogs may turn
up on packaging for printers and paper. There are no plans to
animate Blue Dog, but its image will be ubiquitous in the
commercials that Xerox will show during the Summer Olympics, which
begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox will also run banner ads featuring Blue Dog on the Web
sites of e-tailers like Amazon.com and Outpost.com, as well as on
portals like Yahoo. It is providing brick-and-mortar retailers with
advertising kits that feature Blue Dog. And starting Tuesday,
Xerox's Web page _ www.xerox.com _ will offer links to more
information on Blue Dog and on inkjet printers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will roll out nationally in August, in time for the
back-to-school season, traditionally a big selling time for
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is equally fortunate for Rodrigue, who has painted
the Blue Dog since 1984. Despite a persistent myth that the Blue
Dog is Rodrigue's homage to a beloved dog who died, it started out
as his vision of the Loup Garou, a weredog (as in werewolf) from
Cajun folklore. Over the years, the dog evolved into a friendlier
more colorful image.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Rodrigue's only foray into advertising was to
participate in the familiar artists' campaign for Absolut vodka,
for which the company commissions artists to paint whatever the
brand brings to mind. Rodrigue recalled painting Blue Dog with
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned down Blue Dog movies, Blue Dog TV shows, toys and
T-shirts, even a request from Steven Spielberg's people to use the
image,'' Rodrigue said. ``Everyone says, `You can make a lot of
money.' Well, I already make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has books and two art galleries. So Rodrigue is at PC
Expo this week, painting Blue Dogs in public view, in effect
serving as a human advertisement for his Xerox advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign will expose the Blue Dog to a lot more people,''
he said, ``and that should make the paintings even more valuable.''

 &HT;    Over the years, Hawks rarely draft too high _ or too well
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Hawks have been caught in the ``Catch-22''
of the NBA. They have been good enough to make the playoffs most of
the time but not good enough to chase a title. And they never have
been so bad that they draft high enough to get a crack at a Tim
Duncan or a Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   That situation won't change Wednesday night, when the Hawks make
the sixth pick of the draft. No one sees a franchise-maker in this
draft class, although Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin or 18-year-old
Darius Miles could rise to that level.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks expect to get a bright, serviceable player with the
sixth pick but not necessarily a star _ although general manager
Pete Babcock won't concede the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all potential,'' Babcock said Monday. ``It's all
potential and youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have had five shots at the lottery in the previous 15
years. They earned their way into the lottery in 1985 and took Jon
Koncak with the No. 5 pick. Because then-coach Mike Fratello and
Stan Kasten, then the GM and now president, were determined to
draft a center, they missed out on Chris Mullin (6, Golden State),
Charles Oakley (9, Cleveland) and Karl Malone (13, Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the Hawks traded into the lottery. They selected Stacey
Augmon in 1991 after dealing veteran point guard Doc Rivers for the
pick. They dealt again last June, using another point guard, Mookie
Blaylock, so they could draft a rookie at the position, Jason Terry
at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Two other times after missing the playoffs, as they did this
season, the Hawks selected Rumeal Robinson in 1990 and Adam Keefe
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks say they will draft for talent, not position. They
haven't always done so, Babcock said, ``because the lower you are
in the draft, the fewer great athletes are available. The talent
issue is gone, so at that point you try to fill specific needs.''

FED LIKELY TO WANT MORE EVIDENCE BEFORE RAISING INTEREST RATES
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a period of rip-roaring growth that fueled
fears of inflation, the economy is showing enough signs of slowing
that the Federal Reserve will most likely leave interest rates
unchanged when it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists and
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But as it looks ahead, the Fed faces two big uncertainties that
could lead it back to raising rates later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear, Fed officials say, that the slowdown of
the last few months will not give way to another resurgence in
growth and inflation pressures. In each of the last two years,
growth slowed in the spring, only to come storming back.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the economy is cooling, the Fed will have to decide
just how cool is cool enough. The central bank will have to resolve
an internal debate over conditions sufficient to slow growth to a
pace that would keep unemployment at its current level of around 4
percent, or whether it will need to push harder on the brakes and
drive unemployment up, perhaps to 5 percent or higher, to ensure
that inflation remains in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate by 1.75
percentage points in six increments over the last year, to 6.5
percent. Economic indicators from the last month have suggested
that the higher rates are beginning to rein in the economy by
dampening consumer spending, slowing the pace of job creation and
taking some steam out of the supercharged stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed officials have been wary of declaring that economic
growth is under control. In public and private statements recently,
officials have indicated that they need to see a few more months of
data to be sure that the economy is responding as they want it to.
And in public appearances in recent weeks, a number of them have
emphasized not the evidence that growth is slowing, but rather
signs that ``core'' inflation _ excluding often volatile food and
energy prices _ is beginning to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data, Robert Parry, the president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech this month, ``makes
it pretty clear that we've reached a stage where inflation is no
longer falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fed officials have done nothing to counter the impression
among investors and analysts that they are willing to put policy on
hold until August, when they meet next, to give themselves more
time to assess the effect of higher rates on the economy. As
concerned as they are about inflation, the last thing Fed officials
want to do is tighten policy so much that they stamp out the
nation's longest economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if the economy is behaving the way it should under
tighter monetary policy,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist at
Primark Decision Economics. ``The Fed can wait and define the
slowdown and the inflation response more clearly before taking any
further action.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed were to buck the conventional wisdom and raise rates
this week, it would probably be in part because of a desire to keep
the financial markets from rallying and fueling a rebound in
growth. Analysts said the central bank's policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee would probably deal with that matter by
issuing a strongly worded statement about the continuing threat of
inflation, putting investors on notice that further rate increases
are possible, if not likely, starting in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to talk tough,'' said Stephen Slifer, an economist
at Lehman Brothers in New York. ``If they chose not to talk tough,
the markets will think they are out of the picture, and if there
was an incipient slowdown it would disappear pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   In both 1998 and 1999, the economy slowed substantially in the
second quarter and then picked back up again to growth rates that
fanned inflation fears among Fed officials.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual pace in the
first quarter, and economists think it has slowed to an annual rate
below 4 percent in the second quarter, which ends on Friday. There
is some reason to think that this slowdown will last longer than
its counterparts the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Fed has tightened monetary policy
substantially in the last year. Moreover, the slowdown appears to
be spread more evenly across the economy, and to have encompassed
consumers more than in the slowdowns in 1998 and 1999. And higher
oil prices relative to the last few years could dampen economic
activity at both the corporate and consumer level by making
everything from a tank of gasoline to raw materials more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the acceleration in the growth rate of
productivity, or output per hour, economists are increasingly
convinced that the economy is capable of sharply higher rates of
non-inflationary growth than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, economists believed that the economy's
non-inflationary speed limit was annual growth of about 2.25
percent. Most estimates now put trend growth at around 4 percent,
or about the estimated current rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   But to project possible inflationary pressures, the speed limit,
or ``trend'' growth rate, is often looked at in conjunction with
the concept of a ``natural'' unemployment rate, or the jobless rate
at which trend growth or higher will set off an inflationary cycle
of wage and price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, does not put much stock in the
natural unemployment rate concept, but some of his colleagues at
the central bank do, most notably Laurence Meyer, a Fed governor.
While some economists say the evidence suggests that the natural
rate is now down to about 4 percent, Meyer puts it at 5 percent to
5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy is slowing, the debate within the Fed could soon
turn to whether a combination of 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth
and 4 percent unemployment will ignite any smoldering inflation
pressures, or whether the Fed should push growth down further to a
level that sends the unemployment rate back up toward 5 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The major question,'' Meyer said in a speech earlier this
month, ``is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the
job done, or whether we need a period of below trend growth to
unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's concern is that inflation has been suppressed until now
in part because of temporary factors that are likely to wear off,
and that when they do, imbalances in the economy like the tight
labor market will again put upward pressure on wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the temporary factors dissipate, Meyer said, ``not only
will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is
made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of
a continuous upward movement in inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: unemployment would have to rise back to the 5
percent level Meyer considers sustainable to ensure that inflation
cannot get a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he puts more faith than many of his colleagues at the
Fed in the idea that there are predictable tradeoffs between
growth, unemployment and inflation. But he is far from alone in
questioning whether the Fed might still have to turn the interest
rate screws tighter later this year, even at the risk of taking
political criticism as election day draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is widely viewed as being more open to the idea that
the economy can sustain a combination of strong growth and low
unemployment without inflation, largely because of his optimistic
outlook about continuing improvements in productivity growth.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other Fed officials, Greenspan is likely to
resist any calls for further rate increases on the basis of a
theoretical relationship between growth, unemployment and
inflation. He will probably be guided more by concrete evidence of
how the economy develops in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting, however, that the two camps are not debating
whether the economy needs to go into recession to wring out any
chance of inflation, only whether it should slow to 4 percent or 3
percent or, at the low end, 2 percent _ still a healthy
performance.

COURT UPHOLDS CONSTITUTIONALITY OF MIRANDA WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court put down the most significant
challenge to its 1966 landmark Miranda ruling Monday as Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist led a 7-2 majority in reaffirming that
under the Constitution, accused persons must be informed by police
of their right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court declines to overturn Miranda,'' Rehnquist wrote for
the majority, noting that it would require ``special
justification'' for the high court to ignore the precedent it set
in Miranda v. Arizona 34 years ago. ``There is no such
justification here. Miranda has become embedded in routine police
practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our
national culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians hailed the high court for upholding Miranda
and defending the constitutional right of suspects against
self-incrimination at a time when allegations of police misconduct
and racial profiling have given rise to waves of tension in the
criminal-justice system.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was pleased the police warnings were
so ``resoundingly'' upheld. ``They have worked for law enforcement
by providing clear standards for our officers and they have worked
to protect the rights of our citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist formed the majority with Justices John Paul Stevens,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. Justices Antonin Scalia, joined by
Clarence Thomas, sharply dissented and argued the court displayed
``judicial arrogance'' in following the precedent set by a case
that was wrongly decided 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion
that we are infallible,'' Scalia wrote. ``I see little harm in
admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from people the
ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those
required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the
criminal investigatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision moots a federal law, passed in 1968, that
was aimed at overturning Miranda. Called section 3501, it allowed
federal prosecutors to take a voluntary confession from a suspect
before the Miranda rights were read. The law had never been
enforced by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Supreme Court reversed a federal appeals court
in Richmond, Va., that ruled last year that under Section 3501, the
voluntary confession of Charles Thomas Dickerson, an indicted bank
robber who had not been read his Miranda rights by FBI
interrogators, was admissible in court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling created an uproar among civil-rights advocates. The
US Justice Department disavowed Section 3501 and refused to defend
it before the high court. Attorney General Janet Reno took the
unusual step of signing the government's pro-Miranda brief as a way
to bolster public confidence in the judicial process. The Supreme
Court appointed Paul G. Cassell, a professor at the University of
Utah College of Law and the country's leading scholar-critic of
Miranda, to argue the case, which was heard in April.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell called the court's decision disappointing and
``superficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad day for victims of crime and law-abiding
Americans,'' Cassell said in an interview. ``The tragic result will
be that thousands of confessed, dangerous criminals will go free
just because police officers have made a mistake in following the
highly technical Miranda rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Robert T. Scully, executive director of
the National Association of Police Officers, said the decision
means that no matter how professional the police are in obtaining a
voluntary or uncoerced confession, the risk is high it will be
thrown out under the Miranda rules. ``Miranda has become a vehicle
inviting routine efforts to exclude voluntary confessions, and the
Dickerson case will only increase the amount of litigation in state
and federal courts,'' Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and defense lawyers said it is quite uncommon
now for police to ignore Miranda warnings or for criminals to go
free because their rights were violated. Indeed, they say, the
recitation of Miranda rights _ ``You have a right to remain silent;
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law; you
have the right to the presence of an attorney; if you cannot afford
an attorney, you have the right to have an attorney appointed for
you'' _ has gone beyond standard police procedure to becoming as
American as ``Law and Order,'' the Pledge of Allegience, and apple
pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court (Monday) said, `We created something that worked,
and there is no reason to mess with it,' '' said Robert Ullmann, a
former federal prosecutor and now a criminal-defense lawyer in the
Boston firm of Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Maclin, a constitutional scholar at Boston University
School of Law, said that when the Supreme Court handed down Miranda
there were dire warnings that ``police would lose convictions and
there would be rapists out on the street.'' Instead, Maclin said,
the police now use the Miranda rules to their advantage -- reading
the warnings quickly, playing down their importance as they deliver
them, and suggesting to suspects they may be better off if they
waive them. ``It's given police the green light,'' Maclin said.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Rehnquist noted the court has, over three
decades, made exceptions and ``refinements'' to the Miranda rule.
He acknowledged that the court now sitting might not have decided
the original case in the same way as the court in 1966, and he
conceded that the ``the rule's disadvantage is that it may result
in a guilty defendant going free.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the chief justice said, none of that outweighed the fact
that ``Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this court, may
not be, in effect, overruled by an act of Congress.'' Moreover,
Rehnquist said, ``while there are more remedies available for
abusive police conduct than there were at the time Miranda was
decided...these additional remedies do not in our view render them,
together with (federal law) 3501, an adequate substitute for the
warnings required by Miranda.''

 &HT;    Road trip has Braves anticipating playoff atmosphere
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nobody _ neither John Rocker nor anyone else _ can
predict what awaits the Braves and their controversial reliever at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Atlanta opens a four-game series against the Mets
in their first meeting since October's National League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Since telling Baseball Weekly that he would ride the No. 7 train
to Shea, Rocker has said only, ``Probably so'' about his mode of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But the start of the Mets series is only two days away, after
two games in Montreal. And the Braves do know that they are ready
to find out what happens and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been feeling that way for two months,'' NL MVP Chipper
Jones said. ``Let's go play, and whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Sports Illustrated article in December, Rocker insulted and
denigrated New Yorkers and their city, particularly the commuters
that ride the No. 7 train.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rocker snapped at a reporter who asked him whether
Major League Baseball or the Braves had recommended he not take the
No. 7 train. ``That's why I don't like to do interviews, because of
questions like that,'' he said. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had been a target of the wrath of Mets fans in October,
after he suggested during the Braves' September series win in New
York that Mets fans go home and put on their Yankees gear.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew how to diffuse some of it, by the way he charmed
fans during the offseason when collecting his MVP Award in a
ceremony in New York. He kidded fans for reminding him that is real
name is ``Lar-ry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has a best-case scenario for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go in and sweep and John wouldn't say anything to garner
anymore headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   And worst-case scenario? ``Anything's possible, but you don't
like to think about those things,'' Jones said. ``I'm not fearful
of anything. I certainly hope nobody gets hurt and people act
responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball and the Mets have taken significant steps
to try to ensure the Braves' safety. Some 450 to 500 police
officers are expected to work the games, and a barricade will be
built over the visiting bullpen to prevent objects from being
thrown on pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg said he has his own plans, especially after
watching the fan sprint onto the field to moon Rocker at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't catch me standing anywhere near him, put it that
way,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg is one of several of Rocker's teammates to have
spoken out against him taking the train to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be foolish to ride the train,'' he said. ``I
think it would be in his best interest to keep his mouth shut and
keep as low a profile as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Braves are bracing for a playoff atmosphere,
given the hoard of media expected and the hype surrounding the
series and Rocker. ``It's hard enough to go to New York and play
the teams they have up there, because they're so good,'' Jones
said. ``Then to have these outside distractions, you shouldn't have
to deal with it.''

ANALYSIS: WHAT IS THE GENOME? A BUNDLE OF CONTRADICTIONS,
APPARENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With main bar, SCI-GENOME; see SCIENCE-TIMES-BUDGET for a complete
description of sidebar stories and graphics.) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome, the sum of all genetic material encased in
nearly every cell of the human body, is very, very long _ at least
three billion chemical letters long, as many letters as you would
find in a thousand copies of an entire Sunday issue of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is pithy. The English alphabet has 26 letters;
the Russian, 33 letters; and the Japanese, 1, 850 symbols. Yet,
with just four distinct characters at its disposal, four nucleic
acid bases, the human genome has given rise to the creators of
every language uttered, every ballad sung, every Pokemon card
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is a pigsty, bulging with non-genes, ex-genes,
freeloader genes, viral detritus, pocket lint and chewing gum. All
but a few percent of it appears to be doing nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. Millions of times a year, egg genome meets sperm
genome, and the result is a human baby, its parts all in place, its
brain a universe of love and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the human genome exults in contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   And scientists, with their announcement that they have completed
a so-called working draft of the entire sequence of the human
genome, must traffic in a few contradictions of their own. They
rightly regard the sequencing of the genome as a major scientific
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a milestone in biology unlike any other,'' said
Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute. ``We only have to do this once, reading out the sequence
of our own instruction book, and here we are on brink of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, scientists know that the bulk of their work in
deciphering that sequence has yet to be done. ``Complexity is the
word on everybody's lips these days when they see what the genome
really looks like,'' said David Baltimore, the molecular biologist
and Nobel laureate who is president of the California Institute of
Technology. ``We've got another century of work ahead of us, to
figure out how all these things relate to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Though scientists underscore the importance of their
accomplishment by calling the genome a ``portrait of who we are,''
they quickly append that: people are not, and never will be, mere
products of their genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my concerns is, that as we begin to glimpse some of the
biological contributions to certain personality traits, in people's
minds those contributions will loom larger than they should,''
Collins said. ``And the notion of genetic determinism will gather
further momentum that it doesn't deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of a seemingly familial disease like
schizophrenia, for example, unknown environmental factors still
loom large, which is why if one identical twin comes down with the
disorder, the other twin has only a 50 percent chance of suffering
the same fate _ despite being genetic clones.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers want to talk about the medical miracles they expect
to come from a better knowledge of the human genome. They don't
want to promise any cure or palliative too soon. Yet they feel
inspired to let their imaginations go as they fantasize about what
the sequence may reveal, and what it may forever conceal.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the emerging details of the genome sequence are most
fascinating for what they say about the fraternity between the
human species and all other creatures on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the genome, and taking it as a kind of image of who
we are, places us squarely with the rest of nature,'' said Jon
Seger, an evolutionary biologist and geneticist at the University
of Utah in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the same genes in flies, worms, monkeys, mice and
people. It's evolution laid out for all to see. There's nothing
peculiar or distinctive about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, for the species-wide homogeneity of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists emphasize the genetic fraternity of humanity.
Humans may be genomically similar to mice and monkeys, but it turns
out that people are extraordinarily similar to each other: there
are far fewer genetic differences, or polymorphisms, among
different peoples, and populations of peoples, than are observed in
individual members of other species, including ape relatives.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery, scientists say, has profound implications for
understanding the various human ``races.'' Kelly Owens and
Mary-Claire King, geneticists at the University of Washington in
Seattle, argued last year in the journal Science that whatever
genetic differences existed between, say, Africans and Europeans,
or Asians and aborigines, they were likely to be literally
skin-deep.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers described how the recent analysis of the
so-called melanocortin-stimulating hormone receptor gene, which is
involved in melanin production, indicated that small discrepancies
in this receptor gene appeared to account for most of the
variations observed in human skin and hair color and texture. If
true, they wrote, then variation at a single, tiny genetic locus in
charge of ``superficial traits'' had been ``the cause of enormous
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, prejudice does not require a rational basis, let
alone an evolutionary one,'' they said in the article. ``But the
myth of major genetic differences across `races' is nonetheless
worth dismissing with genetic evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are also falling over each other for the prize for
the most apt analogy. What is the genome really? Is it the Book of
Life, the Booklet of Life, a blueprint for a human being, an atlas,
a master parts list? Martha Stewart's ``How to Replicate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a metaphor contest going on,'' said Harold Varmus, the
former director of the National Institutes of Health and now
president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
``I've used quite a few of them myself.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, ``I've decided we've got to get away from
the idea of this as a blueprint. That doesn't convey what we have.
Because we don't just have the linear sequence, we have the
physical parts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, computer databases may hold the
sequence information, the lineup of billions of A's, T's, G's and
C's. But the segments of the genome also exist in physical form, in
the bellies of bacterial and yeast cells, which can be manipulated.
``The important thing is having pieces of DNA in your hand, and
being able to figure out how they work by modifying and mutating
them,'' he said. ``That's where the game is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why his favorite metaphor is a kid with a clock. ``You
can take the clock apart, lay the pieces out in front of you, and
then try to understand what makes it tick by putting it back
together again,'' he said.

BIOTECH FIRMS RUSH TO CASH IN ON GENOME PROJECT

<P>
   Many of the next generation gene-based drugs, whose development
is expected to be accelerated by the completion of the human genome
map, will be made in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, dozens of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
that employ hundreds in the state have launched quests to develop
the next blockbuster drug and become the financial beneficiary of
the human genome project. Of the estimated 140 biotechnology
companies in the state, about half are working in areas related to
genomics.
</P>
<P>
   While most have been busy well before Monday's historic
announcement, the scramble to move faster for scientific leadership
and fame as well as patenting rights is now in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday Cambridge-based Millennium Pharmaceuticals
signed a $450 million deal with Aventis SA, Europe's fourth largest
drug maker to jointly develop and produce a family of
anti-inflammatory drugs based on Millennium's cutting-edge gene
research tools and technology. The partnership will share in the
development of medications that treat the underlying causes of such
diseases as arthritis, asthma and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified the most human genes, particularly in the
anti-inflammatory area where we know which genes are turned up and
down so we understand the pathways and the causes of the
diseases,'' said Mark Levin, Millennium chief executive whose
company is focused on cancer, metabolic diseases and inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. signed an $800 million
deal with Novartis AG, Europe's third biggest drugmaker, to develop
as many as eight drugs in the field of kinases natural enzymes that
are linked to cancer, heart disease and nervous disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the human genome project, medical research will never be
done the same way,'' said Josh Boger, Vertex founder and chief
executive. ``What Novartis sees in us today could not have been
done five or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' strategies underline the growing power of strong
biotech firms with extensive genomics capabilities in their
relationship with pharmaceutical giants. Increasingly the major
U.S. and European drug makers are joining with biotech firms for
their next generation of therapeutics _ gene based medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Enabling all drug companies to develop and mine genomic datases
are a panoply of players in the field of bioinformatics _ the use
of high speed computers and extensive databases and mathematical
analysis software. They provide researchers with tools to drill
down into the oceans of data and come up with useful information
for developing gene-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So robust is the market, that bioinformatics tools and services
could generate more than $2 billion in revenues within five years
compared to $160 million last year, according to estimates from
Oscar Gruss &AMP; Son, a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly-based Proteome is working with Spotfire Inc., of
Cambridge, to develop new ways for researchers to see their results
matched against published scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are amazingly busy times for us,'' said James Garrels,
president of Proteome, which functions as a curator of biotech and
genomic infomraiton, seling access to its databases to Millennium
and other drugmakers for $200,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The push to commercialize genetic information has also led to a
flood of patents and patent applications, providing full employment
to patent attorneys. Just last year there were more than 550,000
applications for genetic patents and this year, there several
companies looking to file upwards of 10,000 patents each.
</P>
<P>
   But some attorneys maintain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office will change the rules soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patent office has said it is going to have a higher
standard for showing a partial or full gene sequence linked to the
gene function,'' said Kathy Williams a biotech patent attorney at
Palmer &AMP; Dodge, acknowledging that overall, attorneys familiar with
the biotech and genomic patent issues ``kind of do well when the
biotech industry does well.''
</P>
<P>
   The last four years were also good for Compaq Computer Corp.,
whose Alpha high-speed computer chips in computers were used in by
human genome project's main investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Compaq sells server computers built around the
Alpha design, which the company acquired as part of its purchase of
Digital Equipment Corp. in 1998. The latest versions of the chips
can process nearly a trillion operations per second, making them
useful for researchers at Celera Genomics, the Whitehead Institute,
and others involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq sold the equipment as part of its regular commercial
operations, but issued a press release about its involvement Monday
as part of a broader campaign to promote Alpha, which faces
increased competition from Intel and others.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha chips, and their accompanying software, are developed in
Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and in Nashua, N.H., though Compaq has
shut down local Alpha assembly lines.

 UNDATED: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet, as any would-be Edison soon discovers, it's easier to
deconstruct than reconstruct. And scientists are having a difficult
time making sense of even the most basic springs and gears of the
genome. They don't yet know how many genes the three billion
chemical letters hold, for example, with estimates ranging from a
low of 25,000 to a high of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fashionable arguing over gene number,'' said David Page of
the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who is studying the
sequences of the human sex chromosomes, ``reveals just how
difficult it is to deliver anything concrete with the current state
of sequence analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Biologists also disagree vehemently on the meaning of the vast
stretches of non-gene material in the genome, the estimated 2.5
billion to 2.8 billion chemical letters that do not appear to take
part in the synthesis of proteins, which are the body's worker
bees, the molecules that comprise the body and keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 95 percent of our DNA is just there, and it's
described as not functional,'' said C. Robert Cloninger, who
studying personality and genomics at Washington University in St.
Louis. ``But I don't know of anything in nature that's just laying
around and is not functional.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``functional'' from whose perspective? The human body may
not recruit the sequences for protein duty, but if the sequences do
us no harm, natural selection may not have bothered to get rid of
them. Just as microscopic mites live on our cheek cells and
eyelashes, so our genomes may carry a plethora of nucleic
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can identify almost 50 percent of the genome as being
so-called repetitive elements, or transposable elements, which are
like little viruses that have taken advantage of the cell's
machinery to replicate themselves,'' said Phil Green, a genomics
researcher at the University of Washington. ``And the real number
may be more like 95 percent of the genome, although a lot of these
transposable elements are so ancient that they're hard to
identify.''
</P>
<P>
   In Green's view, the notion of the human genome as a haven for
transposable elements is humbling. ``Not only aren't we the center
of the universe,'' he said, ''we're not even the center of our own
genome. We only have a small part of our own genome that's really
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, the human genome, compared to the genomes of
fast-breeding organisms like bacteria, is ``distinctly suboptimal.
A bacterial genome is densely packed with genes, and there's almost
no junk _ bacteria just can't afford the baggage.'' But because
humans live long and reproduce slowly, and historically have
existed in small numbers, their genomes have not been under
competitive pressure to streamline themselves to Swiss-watch
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the genes that are there may be suboptimal,'' he said.
``Many genes may have picked up mutations that cause their protein
products to work not quite as well as they could, but there hasn't
been selective pressure to weed out all mutations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another insight that emerges from a meditation on the
human genome is: not only is no man or woman an island, no gene is,
either. Genes work in groups, and the performance and specific
architecture of each intimately affects the performance of the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law of universal epistasis, which means that nothing
is simple, and everything depends on everything else,'' said
Cloninger. He and his colleagues have been working on genome scans
to link personality traits with specific genes and genetic
patterns. The more they look, the more tangled the human portrait
becomes. From studies of twins and similar research, scientists had
estimated that, as with schizophrenia, about half of the observed
variations in many personality traits were environmental in origin,
and half were genetic.
</P>
<P>
   But comprehending the genetic half is now complicated by the
fact that it is not enough to tally up the impact on a trait of
this, that and the other gene, said Cloninger. ``You must consider
the complex and nonadditive interactions between the different
genes,'' he said. For example, he and his colleagues have studied
the trait called novelty seeking _ the thirst for new experiences
_and found it to be influenced by three genes: one involved in the
brain's use of the neurochemical dopamine, another in the
neurochemical serotonin, and a third in catecholamine production,
part of the body's fight-or-flight response. If two siblings share
identical forms of all three genes, they turn out to correlate in
their degree of novelty-seeking behavior by about 40 percent. But
if just one of the three genes differs in form between the
siblings, the correlation drops, not to 20 percent or 30 percent,
as one might expect, but to 10 percent or less. The three genes
work as a tightly knit team, together with other tightly knit teams
that have yet to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to like to think in terms of separate things operating
causally in linear sequence,'' said Cloninger. ``But that's not an
accurate picture of the way biology works.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe another metaphor for the human genome is a human dream:
rich with significance, personal yet universal, stuffed with
nonsense, all out of order yet infused with its own mad logic.  &QL;

VIVENDI TOUTS WEB SYNERGIES WITH SEAGRAM WHILE ANALYSTS PONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the next three months, Vivendi's chairman, Jean Marie
Messier, plans to dash between Paris, New York and London,
ebulliently selling the concept of a wireless Internet world where
Vivendi's acquisition of Seagram will reap a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Since the announcement of Vivendi's $41 billion deal to acquire
Seagram last week, analysts have been squinting to see the
synergies between Messier's company _ which owns environmental,
waste disposal and communications businesses _ and Seagram, which
owns a major record company, film studio, theme park business and
liquor operation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Messier, Vivendi's 43-year-old
chairman and chief executive, said Seagram's Universal
entertainment businesses would help lure subscribers to Vizzavi _
Vivendi's Web portal venture with the British telecommunications
carrier Vodafone PLC.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, he said, Vizzavi could promote Universal, for example,
enabling subscribers to download new Universal music albums.
</P>
<P>
   But Messier follows a long list of media executives who have
embraced the concept of vertical integration: mergers that marry
programming and distribution. And those deals, most notably the
Walt Disney Co.'s 1996 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, have often
proved troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the stock performance of both Seagram and Vivendi
since the deal was announced last week indicates that investors on
both sides of the Atlantic remain skeptical. Since reports of the
merger, Seagram shares have risen 17.7 percent, closing at $59.56
Monday. That still leaves a gap between the market price and
Vivendi's offer of $70.44 a share for Seagram. Vivendi's shares,
meanwhile, are down 20 percent, closing at $88.05 Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Three different analysts said Monday that they could not see why
Vivendi needed to buy Seagram to get synergies in a merger,
particularly when Vivendi would be paying 18 times cash flow for
the entertainment operations with no apparent cost savings to be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Messier said he was most interested in the music division, the
cornerstone of which is Polygram, for which Seagram paid about 13
times cash flow just two years ago and achieved cost savings by
combining operations with the other Universal Music labels. If
music is so important, why didn't Vivendi buy Polygram alone when
it was on the market at a lower price?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit early,'' Messier said.
</P>
<P>
   Messier said he now sees an opportunity because the distribution
technology will be global _ the Internet _ and Vivendi, through the
Vizzavi venture with Vodafone, could establish an early stronghold
in Europe, where wireless Internet access is growing much faster
than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But because Universal Music will have every incentive to make
its albums available to Vizzavi's competitors, too, analysts are
wondering why Vivendi could not get access to the music without
taking on the financial costs of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Universal's film business, Messier was quick to say that
the French did not intend to run the Universal's rebounding movie
business, and he praised Stacy Snider, chairwoman of Universal
Pictures. But he failed to mention Ron Meyer, president of
Universal Studios, which oversees Snider's operation. Only after
being asked, did Messier say that Meyer's future was up to him,
seeming to imply that Meyer was dispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Film industry executives say that if the French ultimately want
to dismiss Meyer, who is five years through a 10-year contract, it
could cost Vivendi as much as $100 million. Meyer declined to
comment.

ANALYSIS: WHAT IS THE GENOME? A BUNDLE OF CONTRADICTIONS,
APPARENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With main bar, SCI-GENOME; see SCIENCE-TIMES-BUDGET for a complete
description of sidebar stories and graphics.) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome, the sum of all genetic material encased in
nearly every cell of the human body, is very, very long _ at least
three billion chemical letters long, as many letters as you would
find in a thousand copies of an entire Sunday issue of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is pithy. The English alphabet has 26 letters;
the Russian, 33 letters; and the Japanese, 1, 850 symbols. Yet,
with just four distinct characters at its disposal, four nucleic
acid bases, the human genome has given rise to the creators of
every language uttered, every ballad sung, every Pokemon card
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is a pigsty, bulging with non-genes, ex-genes,
freeloader genes, viral detritus, pocket lint and chewing gum. All
but a few percent of it appears to be doing nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is a pearl, a model of high performance and
reliability. Millions of times a year, egg genome meets sperm
genome, and the result is a human baby, its parts all in place, its
brain a universe of love and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the human genome exults in contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   And scientists, with their announcement that they have completed
a so-called working draft of the entire sequence of the human
genome, must traffic in a few contradictions of their own. They
rightly regard the sequencing of the genome as a major scientific
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a milestone in biology unlike any other,'' said
Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute. ``We only have to do this once, reading out the sequence
of our own instruction book, and here we are on brink of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, scientists know that the bulk of their work in
deciphering that sequence has yet to be done. ``Complexity is the
word on everybody's lips these days when they see what the genome
really looks like,'' said David Baltimore, the molecular biologist
and Nobel laureate who is president of the California Institute of
Technology. ``We've got another century of work ahead of us, to
figure out how all these things relate to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Though scientists underscore the importance of their
accomplishment by calling the genome a ``portrait of who we are,''
they quickly append that: people are not, and never will be, mere
products of their genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my concerns is, that as we begin to glimpse some of the
biological contributions to certain personality traits, in people's
minds those contributions will loom larger than they should,''
Collins said. ``And the notion of genetic determinism will gather
further momentum that it doesn't deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of a seemingly familial disease like
schizophrenia, for example, unknown environmental factors still
loom large, which is why if one identical twin comes down with the
disorder, the other twin has only a 50 percent chance of suffering
the same fate _ despite being genetic clones.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers want to talk about the medical miracles they expect
to come from a better knowledge of the human genome. They don't
want to promise any cure or palliative too soon. Yet they feel
inspired to let their imaginations go as they fantasize about what
the sequence may reveal, and what it may forever conceal.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the emerging details of the genome sequence are most
fascinating for what they say about the fraternity between the
human species and all other creatures on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the genome, and taking it as a kind of image of who
we are, places us squarely with the rest of nature,'' said Jon
Seger, an evolutionary biologist and geneticist at the University
of Utah in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the same genes in flies, worms, monkeys, mice and
people. It's evolution laid out for all to see. There's nothing
peculiar or distinctive about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, for the species-wide homogeneity of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists emphasize the genetic fraternity of humanity.
Humans may be genomically similar to mice and monkeys, but it turns
out that people are extraordinarily similar to each other: there
are far fewer genetic differences, or polymorphisms, among
different peoples, and populations of peoples, than are observed in
individual members of other species, including ape relatives.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery, scientists say, has profound implications for
understanding the various human ``races.'' Kelly Owens and
Mary-Claire King, geneticists at the University of Washington in
Seattle, argued last year in the journal Science that whatever
genetic differences existed between, say, Africans and Europeans,
or Asians and aborigines, they were likely to be literally
skin-deep.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers described how the recent analysis of the
so-called melanocortin-stimulating hormone receptor gene, which is
involved in melanin production, indicated that small discrepancies
in this receptor gene appeared to account for most of the
variations observed in human skin and hair color and texture. If
true, they wrote, then variation at a single, tiny genetic locus in
charge of ``superficial traits'' had been ``the cause of enormous
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, prejudice does not require a rational basis, let
alone an evolutionary one,'' they said in the article. ``But the
myth of major genetic differences across `races' is nonetheless
worth dismissing with genetic evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are also falling over each other for the prize for
the most apt analogy. What is the genome really? Is it the Book of
Life, the Booklet of Life, a blueprint for a human being, an atlas,
a master parts list? Martha Stewart's ``How to Replicate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a metaphor contest going on,'' said Harold Varmus, the
former director of the National Institutes of Health and now
president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
``I've used quite a few of them myself.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, ``I've decided we've got to get away from
the idea of this as a blueprint. That doesn't convey what we have.
Because we don't just have the linear sequence, we have the
physical parts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, computer databases may hold the
sequence information, the lineup of billions of A's, T's, G's and
C's. But the segments of the genome also exist in physical form, in
the bellies of bacterial and yeast cells, which can be manipulated.
``The important thing is having pieces of DNA in your hand, and
being able to figure out how they work by modifying and mutating
them,'' he said. ``That's where the game is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why his favorite metaphor is a kid with a clock. ``You
can take the clock apart, lay the pieces out in front of you, and
then try to understand what makes it tick by putting it back
together again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as any would-be Edison soon discovers, it's easier to
deconstruct than reconstruct. And scientists are having a difficult
time making sense of even the most basic springs and gears of the

SHARP RIVALRIES MARK GENOME PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a scientific enterprise, the race to map the
human genome bears resemblance to the Manhattan Project, the
furious World War II rush to develop an atomic bomb before Nazi
Germany. Both involved unprecedented gatherings of scientists who
worked toward a once unthinkable goal in a brief time.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the genome, however, the race was not between
warring nations but mostly-friendly rivals: J. Craig Venter of
Celera Genomic Inc. and the federal government's $300 million Human
Genome Project. The majority of scientists at Monday's historic
announcement to mark the near-completion of the genome map said the
effort by the two groups, who used different techniques to arrive
at a surpisingly similar result, was, in the end, productive.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the government effort is Dr. Francis Collins, who
once explored the wilderness of the genomic frontier as discoverer
of the gene for cystic fibrosis in 1989, but now heads a research
consortium of almost 1,000 scientists in five countries.
</P>
<P>
   Collins sat to the left of President Bill Clinton, who emerged
as a peacekeeper in the war of words over the genome project. On
the president's right was Venter, the brash Vietnam veteran whose
radical but ultimately successful genomic mapping techniques were
rejected by the government but embraced by private industry. There
he found a home, funding, and, perhaps most important, the computer
power that enabled him to match the government's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was privately concerned about some of Venter's
public criticism of the Human Genome Project, praised him for
``truly visionary pursuit of innovative strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the audience applauding both men was James Watson, who,
with Francis Crick, discovered the double-helix structure of DNA
almost 50 years ago _ a pivotal discovery in the path to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, in a brief interview, said it was ``wonderful'' how
quickly the genome had been decoded, adding, ``I think we'll see
this in history as the equivalent of inventing the printing
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the whole day, however, was a sense that the world
had entered uncharted ethical waters. Will people be discriminated
against based on their genes? Will babies be genetically
engineered? Such possibilites remain far off, but most of those
present said that strict ethical guidelines must be set early on to
prevent such abuses, which most scientists conceded could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Both Collins and Venter urged Congress to pass a ban on genetic
discrimination. A bipartisan bill that would do just that was
introduced in Congress last year. Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, speaking via satellite feed, both suggested an
international genomic ethics panel be created.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of race also repeatedly surfaced, with Clinton
commenting that racial differences seem superficial given that all
humans are almost genetically identical. Venter revealed that
Celera's genomic project utilized DNA from three women and two men
who were white, black, Hispanic and Asian. He noted that ``there is
no way to tell one ethnicity from another'' by looking at their
genomes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the announcement, with its back-slapping and broad
smiles, was the product of some deft scientific diplomacy. On May
7, Venter and Collins were summoned to the house of Ari Patrinos,
who ran the federal Department of Energy's piece of the genome
effort. The war of words between the two sides had escalated, and
each was on the verge of making its own separate genome
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning was tense,'' Patrinos said in an interview.
``There was this history of acrimony. There were a lot of bruised
feelings. . . . Both sides felt as if they had been intellectually
dissed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patrinos kept the meetings going. Finally, last Wednesday,
the agreement to make the joint announcement was sealed. When asked
about the race between Celera and the Human Genome Project, Collins
said, ``The only race we're going to talk about is the human
race.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions and disagreements still exist. Celera wants to
keep its genome data on its own Web site rather than the government
site that most of the scientific community has enbraced.
</P>
<P>
   And who will own gene discoveries? Dozens of companies already
have patents on the functions of some genes but many scientists and
policy makers are uncomfortable with parceling out these molecular
pieces of life's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Collins said, ``is the end of the beginning.''

STUDY SAYS SPENDING ROSE 17.4 PERCENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN
1999 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spending on prescription drugs increased a record
17.4 percent last year, and elderly people saw the largest cost
increases, a new study by a drug benefits company says.
</P>
<P>
   The study, issued Monday by Express Scripts of St. Louis, said
about half of the total increase in drug spending resulted from
higher costs for a typical prescription. Greater use of
prescription drugs and the introduction of new drug products were
responsible for the remainder of the increase, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts manages drug benefits for 9.6 million people and
derived the study from that data.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Toan, president of Express Scripts, said last year's
increase accelerated a trend observed since 1993, when the company
began monitoring changes in drug spending.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs were a significant factor contributing to the increase
in spending last year, as doctors and patients quickly accepted two
drugs used to treat arthritis, Vioxx, made by Merck &AMP; Co., and
Celebrex, marketed by Searle and Pfizer, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, it said, drugs introduced since 1992 accounted
for a remarkable 41 percent of drug spending last year and for 25
percent of all prescriptions filled last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes just two days before the House is expected to
vote on proposals to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare
beneficiaries. One-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries
have no insurance to help pay drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by Express Scripts show why elderly people
feel a pressing need for such coverage and why many members of
Congress worry about the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on prescription drugs averaged $387.09 a person last
year, up 17.4 percent from the average of $329.83 in 1998, Express
Scripts reported. But costs rose most rapidly for older Americans,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a prescription last year rose 18 percent
for women aged 70 to 79, 20 percent for women 80 and older, 9
percent for men age 70 to 79 and 11 percent for men 80 and older,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Enbrel, a new drug for rheumatoid
arthritis, contributed more to the increase in drug spending last
year than more celebrated drugs like Viagra. Enbrel, produced by
genetic engineering, may cost $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Express Scripts made these observations:
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of prescriptions for antihistamines increased 18.4
percent last year. In 1999, as in the two prior years, use of
antihistamines increased more than the use of any other type of
drug. The increase was driven by heavy advertising for products
like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cholesterol-lowering drugs were the second-fastest growing
category last year, as the number of prescriptions increased 18.1
percent. Lipitor, made by Warner-Lambert, and Zocor, made by Merck,
accounted for much of the growth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use of antidepressant drugs increased 11.3 percent last year.
As the stigma of mental illness is reduced and more people become
aware of the symptoms of depression, they are more likely to
receive drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use of gastrointestinal drugs increased nearly 10 percent last
year, in part because of advertising for products like Prilosec.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts said the unit price of prescription drugs rose
an average of 5.4 percent last year, which was substantially more
than the increases for other major goods and services like food,
housing and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of generic drugs rose an average of 7 percent last
year, while prices of brand-name medications rose an average of 5.8
percent, the report said. Generic versions of brand-name drugs
typically cost less, but federal officials say they are
therapeutically equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drugs with the largest price increases last year were
thyroid medications, narcotic painkillers and estrogen replacement
products.
</P>
<P>
   Synthroid, a synthetic thyroid hormone sold by the Knoll
Pharmaceutical Co., accounted for much of the increase in thyroid
drug costs, while Premarin, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to
treat symptoms of menopause and osteoporosis, accounted for much of
the increase in estrogen therapy prices, the report said.

BIOTECH FIRMS RUSH TO CASH IN ON GENOME PROJECT

<P>
   Many of the next generation gene-based drugs, whose development
is expected to be accelerated by the completion of the human genome
map, will be made in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, dozens of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
that employ hundreds in the state have launched quests to develop
the next blockbuster drug and become the financial beneficiary of
the human genome project. Of the estimated 140 biotechnology
companies in the state, about half are working in areas related to
genomics.
</P>
<P>
   While most have been busy well before Monday's historic
announcement, the scramble to move faster for scientific leadership
and fame as well as patenting rights is now in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday Cambridge-based Millennium Pharmaceuticals
signed a $450 million deal with Aventis SA, Europe's fourth largest
drug maker to jointly develop and produce a family of
anti-inflammatory drugs based on Millennium's cutting-edge gene
research tools and technology. The partnership will share in the
development of medications that treat the underlying causes of such
diseases as arthritis, asthma and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified the most human genes, particularly in the
anti-inflammatory area where we know which genes are turned up and
down so we understand the pathways and the causes of the
diseases,'' said Mark Levin, Millennium chief executive whose
company is focused on cancer, metabolic diseases and inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. signed an $800 million
deal with Novartis AG, Europe's third biggest drugmaker, to develop
as many as eight drugs in the field of kinases natural enzymes that
are linked to cancer, heart disease and nervous disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the human genome project, medical research will never be
done the same way,'' said Josh Boger, Vertex founder and chief
executive. ``What Novartis sees in us today could not have been
done five or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' strategies underline the growing power of strong
biotech firms with extensive genomics capabilities in their
relationship with pharmaceutical giants. Increasingly the major
U.S. and European drug makers are joining with biotech firms for
their next generation of therapeutics _ gene based medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Enabling all drug companies to develop and mine genomic datases
are a panoply of players in the field of bioinformatics _ the use
of high speed computers and extensive databases and mathematical
analysis software. They provide researchers with tools to drill
down into the oceans of data and come up with useful information
for developing gene-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So robust is the market, that bioinformatics tools and services
could generate more than $2 billion in revenues within five years
compared to $160 million last year, according to estimates from
Oscar Gruss &AMP; Son, a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly-based Proteome is working with Spotfire Inc., of
Cambridge, to develop new ways for researchers to see their results
matched against published scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are amazingly busy times for us,'' said James Garrels,
president of Proteome, which functions as a curator of biotech and
genomic infomraiton, seling access to its databases to Millennium
and other drugmakers for $200,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The push to commercialize genetic information has also led to a
flood of patents and patent applications, providing full employment
to patent attorneys. Just last year there were more than 550,000
applications for genetic patents and this year, there several
companies looking to file upwards of 10,000 patents each.
</P>
<P>
   But some attorneys maintain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office will change the rules soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patent office has said it is going to have a higher
standard for showing a partial or full gene sequence linked to the
gene function,'' said Kathy Williams a biotech patent attorney at
Palmer &AMP; Dodge, acknowledging that overall, attorneys familiar with
the biotech and genomic patent issues ``kind of do well when the
biotech industry does well.''
</P>
<P>
   The last four years were also good for Compaq Computer Corp.,
whose Alpha high-speed computer chips in computers were used in by
human genome project's main investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Compaq sells server computers built around the
Alpha design, which the company acquired as part of its purchase of
Digital Equipment Corp. in 1998. The latest versions of the chips
can process nearly a trillion operations per second, making them
useful for researchers at Celera Genomics, the Whitehead Institute,
and others involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq sold the equipment as part of its regular commercial
operations, but issued a press release about its involvement Monday
as part of a broader campaign to promote Alpha, which faces
increased competition from Intel and others.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha chips, and their accompanying software, are developed in
Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and in Nashua, N.H., though Compaq has
shut down local Alpha assembly lines.

COURT UPHOLDS CONSTITUTIONALITY OF MIRANDA WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court put down the most significant
challenge to its 1966 landmark Miranda ruling Monday as Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist led a 7-2 majority in reaffirming that
under the Constitution, accused persons must be informed by police
of their right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court declines to overturn Miranda,'' Rehnquist wrote for
the majority, noting that it would require ``special
justification'' for the high court to ignore the precedent it set
in Miranda v. Arizona 34 years ago. ``There is no such
justification here. Miranda has become embedded in routine police
practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our
national culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians hailed the high court for upholding Miranda
and defending the constitutional right of suspects against
self-incrimination at a time when allegations of police misconduct
and racial profiling have given rise to waves of tension in the
criminal-justice system.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was pleased the police warnings were
so ``resoundingly'' upheld. ``They have worked for law enforcement
by providing clear standards for our officers and they have worked
to protect the rights of our citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist formed the majority with Justices John Paul Stevens,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. Justices Antonin Scalia, joined by
Clarence Thomas, sharply dissented and argued the court displayed
``judicial arrogance'' in following the precedent set by a case
that was wrongly decided 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion
that we are infallible,'' Scalia wrote. ``I see little harm in
admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from people the
ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those
required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the
criminal investigatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision moots a federal law, passed in 1968, that
was aimed at overturning Miranda. Called section 3501, it allowed
federal prosecutors to take a voluntary confession from a suspect
before the Miranda rights were read. The law had never been
enforced by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Supreme Court reversed a federal appeals court
in Richmond, Va., that ruled last year that under Section 3501, the
voluntary confession of Charles Thomas Dickerson, an indicted bank
robber who had not been read his Miranda rights by FBI
interrogators, was admissible in court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling created an uproar among civil-rights advocates. The
US Justice Department disavowed Section 3501 and refused to defend
it before the high court. Attorney General Janet Reno took the
unusual step of signing the government's pro-Miranda brief as a way
to bolster public confidence in the judicial process. The Supreme
Court appointed Paul G. Cassell, a professor at the University of
Utah College of Law and the country's leading scholar-critic of
Miranda, to argue the case, which was heard in April.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell called the court's decision disappointing and
``superficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad day for victims of crime and law-abiding
Americans,'' Cassell said in an interview. ``The tragic result will
be that thousands of confessed, dangerous criminals will go free
just because police officers have made a mistake in following the
highly technical Miranda rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Robert T. Scully, executive director of
the National Association of Police Officers, said the decision
means that no matter how professional the police are in obtaining a
voluntary or uncoerced confession, the risk is high it will be
thrown out under the Miranda rules. ``Miranda has become a vehicle
inviting routine efforts to exclude voluntary confessions, and the
Dickerson case will only increase the amount of litigation in state
and federal courts,'' Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and defense lawyers said it is quite uncommon
now for police to ignore Miranda warnings or for criminals to go
free because their rights were violated. Indeed, they say, the
recitation of Miranda rights _ ``You have a right to remain silent;
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law; you
have the right to the presence of an attorney; if you cannot afford
an attorney, you have the right to have an attorney appointed for
you'' _ has gone beyond standard police procedure to becoming as
American as ``Law and Order,'' the Pledge of Allegience, and apple
pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court (Monday) said, `We created something that worked,
and there is no reason to mess with it,' '' said Robert Ullmann, a
former federal prosecutor and now a criminal-defense lawyer in the
Boston firm of Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Maclin, a constitutional scholar at Boston University
School of Law, said that when the Supreme Court handed down Miranda
there were dire warnings that ``police would lose convictions and
there would be rapists out on the street.'' Instead, Maclin said,
the police now use the Miranda rules to their advantage -- reading
the warnings quickly, playing down their importance as they deliver
them, and suggesting to suspects they may be better off if they
waive them. ``It's given police the green light,'' Maclin said.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Rehnquist noted the court has, over three
decades, made exceptions and ``refinements'' to the Miranda rule.
He acknowledged that the court now sitting might not have decided
the original case in the same way as the court in 1966, and he
conceded that the ``the rule's disadvantage is that it may result
in a guilty defendant going free.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the chief justice said, none of that outweighed the fact
that ``Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this court, may
not be, in effect, overruled by an act of Congress.'' Moreover,
Rehnquist said, ``while there are more remedies available for
abusive police conduct than there were at the time Miranda was
decided...these additional remedies do not in our view render them,
together with (federal law) 3501, an adequate substitute for the
warnings required by Miranda.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: JAPAN'S STAID VOTERS ISSUE A WAKE-UP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Just when many seemed ready to begin writing off Japan's
democracy as hopelessly moribund, the huge advance made on Sunday
by an opposition party once seen as hapless has awakened the
country to the possibility of political change.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Democratic Party overcame discouraging opinion polls,
bad weather and an electorate often seen as apathetic to emerge
from parliamentary elections as a solid challenger to the Liberal
Democratic Party, which has held power almost without interruption
since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Japanese political analysts describe the weeks
ahead as completely uncharted _ a highly unusual situation in a
country where politics usually seem carefully scripted. What seems
certain is that despite morning-after headlines here that strangely
spoke of a vote for continuity, more change _ perhaps dramatic
change _ is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite party denials that Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori would be
removed any time soon, the catastrophically loose-tongued leader
who oversaw the Liberal Democratic Party's debacle is already being
spoken of in some quarters in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens next very much depends upon whether Mori remains
in office after the G-8 Summit,'' said Hidekazu Kawai, a professor
of comparative politics at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. ``I
believe that he is already on the road toward what we call an
honorable retirement. But if he does not retire, strife within the
LDP will only become stronger, because people will be afraid to
fight another election under his leadership.'' Japan's next
parliamentary election, an Upper House vote, is due next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has been gearing up for a full year to
host the G-8, a meeting of leaders of major industrial powers.
According to this view, Mori's success as a host of the event will
serve as a dignified occasion to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberal Democrats have far more to worry about than a
feckless prime minister who needlessly provoked independent voters
by urging them to ``just stay in bed'' on Election Day rather than
play havoc with his encouraging poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The largely unheralded story of the past decade or so has, in
fact, been the creeping demise of a party that has been in power so
long that analysts must reach for comparisons to a place like
China, rather than the Western democracies, for parallels.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the Liberal Democratic Party governed easily with
its comfortable parliamentary majority, stifling debate and
co-opting other parties with budgetary sweets to secure their added
support as needed. The party suffered a momentary setback _ its
only loss of power _ in 1993, when Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of a
small reformist party, formed a brief-lived government.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Liberal Democrats have been back in power,
firmly at first, but less comfortably with every passing election,
as the number of independent voters has increased, and as their
support has tilted toward opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's predecessor, the late Keizo Obuchi, achieved a large
ruling majority only by forming a controversial and awkward
coalition, bringing together a pacifist, Buddhist-backed party that
favors social spending, New Komeito, with the Liberals, a hawkish,
Thatcherite party.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Sunday's vote, the Liberal Democrats are
left with their awkward allies, and are hobbled with a weak
coalition that even together holds only a slim majority.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors seem to have contributed to the ruling party's
fading hold on the electorate. For one, urban voters in particular
seem to have grown disgusted with the government's free spending in
rural areas. Endless projects like ultramodern airports for small
farming prefectures and an ever-expanding, but money-losing bullet
train network, have cost Japan a half trillion dollars during two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Such projects are justified in the name of pump priming to keep
the country's economy afloat _ and that barely, after a decade of
decline. But voters, particularly urban voters, seem to have caught
onto the game and decided that this is really about nothing more
than buying the support of the countryside for the Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the impression that Japan is a country divided in two,
a rural and an urban country,'' said Yoichi Masuzoe, an independent
who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Tokyo. ``In the capital, and
in other urban areas, L.D.P. candidates lost, including many of its
big names. Their traditional way of distributing money, in the name
of public works, has only worked with rural voters. The salary man
in Tokyo is more concerned about what is happening to the country,
and they have shown their desire for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is whether Japan will stick to a traditional,
dirty way of handling matters, favoring the rural areas, or whether
it is choosing a new way, a more open and rational policy-based
approach. The next two years will tell, but I believe this is
really a historic transition period.''
</P>
<P>
   If a major transition is under way, many people feel that the
outcome will be a more stable two-party system, or at least a
system involving two large, rival coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Through its performance, the Democratic Party took a major step
toward becoming a leader of one of those coalitions. And many
analysts said that the way that it did so bodes well for the future
of Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete with the Liberal Democratic Party on the
basis of seductive promises, the Democrats took the usual tack of
warning voters that substantial pain lies ahead for Japan after
years of overindulgence and drift.
</P>
<P>
   Most specifically, in a campaign that most often resembled a
competition between poster hangers rather than a contest over
ideas, the Democrats distinguished themselves by promising new
taxes and specific spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Although few people are willing to credit the Democratic Party
with having a full-blown platform on how to run the economy, or,
many say, the maturity yet to govern, many analysts saluted this
act of electoral courage as a sample of the kind of spine that will
be needed to revive the country.

COMMENTARY: LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our topic for today, people, is The Proper Mate for Women in
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   We are looking at today's state legislative primary in Goose
Creek, S.C., in which Rep. Shirley Hinson is being challenged by
her estranged husband, Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the issues,'' says Hinson, who was arrested in 1998
for making a death threat against another state representative he
believed was having an affair with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate tactics for a desperate person,'' said Ms. Hinson,
who once took out a restraining order against her husband, accusing
him of stalking her at the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   We have been down this road before, more or less. There was the
case of Rep. Coya Knutson of Minnesota, whose bid for a third term
in 1958 ended in disaster when her alcoholic husband published a
``Coya Come Home'' letter, accusing her of having an affair with
her administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Langley got elected to Congress from Kentucky in 1926
after her spouse, Rep. John Wesley Langley, was sentenced to the
federal pen for bootlegging. She talked Calvin Coolidge into
pardoning him, and the newly sprung Langley immediately ran against
her for his old seat. The third candidate, not married to either
one of them, won.
</P>
<P>
   But our modern version of the disastrous political spouse
generally tends more in the direction of overzealousness.
</P>
<P>
   We are thinking, for instance, of Albert Pirro, a lawyer in the
New York City suburbs who devoted a great deal of energy to
promoting the career of his wife, Jeanine, a rising Republican star
and the current Westchester County district attorney. One of
Pirro's 33 companies produced a cable TV show starring Mrs. Pirro.
Another hired a political consultant to advise her on what to do
when she developed one of those ``nanny'' tax problems that were
all the rage in the early 90s. (The consultant's advice, which
seemed to work well, was that Mrs. Pirro should come clean on her
TV show.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Pirro deducted this stuff as business expenses,
along with the family's six cars and an $1,800 wrought iron fence
for the Vietnamese potbellied pigs. Last week he was convicted of
tax evasion, and Mrs. Pirro's career is toast. However, women of
the future may be able to pick up helpful hints from her story,
such as the advisability of sticking to cocker spaniels as
household pets. They may also conclude that when a spouse starts
doing business through 33 different companies, it's time to start
thinking separate tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   New York has never had much success at getting women elected to
high office, but we're an absolute databank of what can go wrong in
a political marriage. This year, of course, we've hit the jackpot
with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already taught the world
everything it needs to know about the perils of a dual-career
candidacy. Never again will anyone running for anything promise the
voters they will get two for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, politicians would all follow the example of
the president in ``West Wing'' and marry physicians. Doctors can
generally get a job anywhere, and you seldom see them wandering
around the Capitol lobbying for legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Our latest Senate candidate, Rep. Rick Lazio, had the good
judgment to marry a nurse. (Yes, Lazio was the guy chosen to run
against the first lady after the mayor's marriage imploded and the
Westchester DA's husband failed to convince a jury that the cost of
fighting a paternity case was a legitimate business deduction. Is
this a great state, or what?)
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Patricia Lazio does not seem to be under threat of
indictment, nor was she exiled to the Food Channel for the duration
of her husband's career, like Rudy Giuliani's estranged wife, a
former TV anchor. She works part time at a hospital breast cancer
unit. Everything seemed perfect until Lazio told reporters about a
talk they had during a controversy over his stock investments.
``She said: `Listen, you know what? We're honest, decent people. I
clean my own house. We have nothing to be ashamed of,''' he
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lazio is currently trudging from Horseheads to Ogdensburg
in support of her husband's Senate campaign, while caring for two
small children and doing her job at the hospital. If she gets no
help around the house, I think he can kiss the working women's vote
goodbye.

LUCENT CREATES A NEW BRAND NAME TO MARKET TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to create a strong new force in the market for office
telephone systems and networking equipment, Lucent Technologies
Inc. intends to announce a new brand Tuesday for its unit that
sells communications products to business customers, people close
to the division said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which Lucent calls its Enterprise Networks division,
is in the process of being spun out of Lucent as an independent
company. Lucent plans no initial public offering of stock in the
new company, which has $8 billion in annual revenue. Instead,
Lucent intends to distribute all of the shares in the new company
directly to its shareholders by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday just what the new company would be called.
A Lucent spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the name of the new brand, Tuesday's announcement
will not answer the main question that many of Lucent's investors
are asking these days: does the company plan to spin-off its
fast-growing microelectronics unit? Lucent's top management has at
least considered such a move, but it does not appear that a final
decision has been made. Any announcement of such a move probably
would not be made for at least two weeks, according to one person
close to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the microelectronics division, which
makes chips and other components used in advanced communications
equipment, has annual revenue of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
Nonetheless, because it is growing quickly and because investors
are currently infatuated with comparable companies like JDS
Uniphase and Broadcom, the microelectronics division could enjoy a
stand-alone market value of $50 billion or more. Lucent does not
report financial results for its microelectronics business, but the
larger business unit to which the microelectronics section belongs
reported revenue growth in the most recent quarter of 38 percent,
to $1.7 billion, over the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the enterprise networks group has twice the revenue
of the microelectronics operation, it is likely to have a much
smaller market value. That is because the Enterprise Networks group
is actually shrinking, at least in its current form. For the most
recent quarter, Lucent announced that the division generated $2
billion in revenue, down 8 percent from the comparable period of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least in part, Lucent wants to spin out the Enterprise group,
which includes among its products office phone systems and office
communications cables, because it is dragging down the growth rate
for the overall company.

 &HT;    Global influences abound on plates of city's eateries
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta ($3.50) takes a world view with its July cover story on
the city's booming ethnic restaurant scene. Researching the article
was adventurous in many ways, says dining critic Christiane
Lauterbach. In addition to sampling sea slugs, brains, monkfish
liver and goat, Lauterbach ventured into places where men dined
behind curtains and female companionship was included in the price
of appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles of note include Thonnia Lee's report on Atlanta's
growing community of African-American women writers, Scott
Freeman's update on the elusive bombing suspect Eric Rudolph and
Mary Jo DiLonardo's profile of golfer Rosie Jones _ ``the best
professional athlete you've never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Waving the flag: Apparently the last couple of issues of
George ($2.95) were not a fluke; the magazine founded by John F.
Kennedy Jr. is improving editorially (financially, too, notes
editor Frank Lalli, who reports that circulation has increased by
25 percent to 500,000). In the July issue, Richard Reeves takes a
look at new American patriots such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),
singer Patti Smith and radio talk show host Don Imus. Actor Mel
Gibson talks about some of the myths of 1776 that were dispelled
during the filming of ``The Patriot.'' It seems our original
citizen-soldiers were a bunch of whining malcontents and deserters
who relied on mercenaries to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calorically overwhelmed: Life for many American kids is one
Happy Meal after another. At least that's the way it appears in
Newsweek's ($3.50) cover story on Generation XXL. One in three kids
faces long-term health problems because they are overweight, says
writer Geoffrey Cowley. The convenience of fast food and snacks is
one factor, Cowley says, but adding to the problem is the removal
of physical education programs from many school systems. The worse
things parents can do is nag or restrict food, says psychologist
Jane Laubross. Instead, she says, set an example and focus on
health and more physical activities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Between the covers: Larry McMurtry not only writes books _ he
collects them by the thousands and sells them in a four-store
complex in the town that was the inspiration for ``The Last Picture
Show.'' Book ($4.95) magazine visits McMurtry at Booked Up, his
``book ranch'' in Archer City, Texas, where the author displays an
impressive selection of first editions such as Eudora Welty's ``The
Golden Apples,'' George Orwell's ``Shooting an Elephant'' and
Dalton Trumbo's ``Johnny Got His Gun.'' Also featured in this issue
are an interview with Georgia poet laureate David Bottoms and a
list of 10 first novels you shouldn't have missed. Included are
Toni Morrison's ``The Bluest Eye'' and John Updike's ``The
Poorhouse Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: The lad mags this month are filled with scantily
clad actresses as well as some interesting reading. Maxim ($3.95)
features ``X-Men'' stars Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and
Famke Janssen in a cover story on the much-anticipated summer
blockbuster. ... Gear ($3.50) also weighs in on ``X-Men'' and the
history of other comics that were made into movies, from ``Jungle
Jim'' to ``Men in Black'' ... FHM ($2.99) offers a revealing
interview and photo layout of Alicia Silverstone and an equally
revealing profile of Irish-American dancer Michael Flatley.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Newcomer: Southern Living has launched Southern Living
Weddings ($4.95), a publication aimed at brides-to-be and newlyweds
who want to maintain certain traditions. One issue is planned for
this year, but more are expected in 2001, says spokeswoman
Katharine Carroll. The magazine features a directory of regional
experts and resources, articles on gracious Southern weddings, and
post-ceremony suggestions for decorating a first home and
stress-free cooking for two.

 &HT;    Interest brewing in teakettle designer Graves
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Graves may be internationally renowned in design
circles, but the architect has hardly been a household name.
</P>
<P>
   A whimsical little teakettle he designed for Target, however,
may bring fame to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to see my products in the store, there
was a little girl there who looked at her mother and said, 'Look,
Mommy, at all this cool stuff,''' Graves said. ``Her mother said,
'Yes, dear, it's very nice, and, you know, I do need a new kettle.'
Then they went over to my decorative objects, and the girl said,
'These must be by the same people because they're cool, too!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter that the stuff was by Michael Graves,'' he
said. ``They got it.''
</P>
<P>
   What they ``got'' is that good design doesn't have to be
expensive. Big-name designers like Graves are seeing to that.
</P>
<P>
   The post-modern architect and product designer _ whose kettle
and initial dozen other housewares for Target now total more than
600 products _ tonight addresses the Georgia chapter of the
American Society of Interior Designers at Atlanta's Swissotel.
</P>
<P>
   Pairing Graves, whose architectural designs range from Humana's
headquarters in Louisville, Ky., to the Michael C. Carlos Museum
renovation in Atlanta, with mainstream America has brought the
65-year-old designer national acclaim. ``I expected a wave or two
but nothing like what's happened,'' he said by phone from his
Princeton, N.J., office.
</P>
<P>
   Graves and his team agreed to design two categories of products
for Target _ teakettles, toasters and mixers, and decorative
objects. Next month, they'll roll out telephones, radios and CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Because the products are priced widely _ $3.99 for a Hipper
Flipper spatula, $40 for the ``Toast Modern'' toaster, $499 for an
Indonesian hardwood patio set _ there's something for everyone.
More important, middle-income consumers are getting the message
that good design is good design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell people I'd spend as much time designing a
stainless steel teapot for Target as I would if I were doing a
sterling silver service for Cartier,'' Graves said. ``It's just as
hard _ or harder because of the cost restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton University architecture professor created a
tempest in a teakettle of sorts when the Target line debuted in
February 1999. Graves' sleek $34.95 kettle had a striking
resemblance to one he'd designed in the '80s for Alessi, the
European housewares giant, which sells for $115. Alessi steamed,
but the comparison made Target's egg-handled kettle _ and Graves _
all the hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in addition to product design, Graves' firm is juggling
30 building projects, including a bid for a major design at a
Singapore university. Emory University also had sought his
involvement for a planned addition to the Carlos Museum, where he
headed a 1982 renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who also designed Midtown's 10 Peachtree Place building
where Coca-Cola has offices, is well aware of Atlanta's penchant
for tearing down. ``To save good buildings, you have to have a very
strong government and people with very strong feelings to care for
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the key to reducing sprawl is good urban schools
that will entice suburban families to live downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that impresses everybody about Atlanta is your great
old mansions, the gardens and rolling hills of green,'' Graves
said. ``When you drive into some of those neighborhoods, I know why
people live there. It's truly wonderful.''

   Rome Reduces Traffic by Limiting Tour Buses
</P>
<P>
   All roads may lead to Rome, but these days not everyone
traveling on them can reach downtown. Since April 6, tour buses
have not been allowed to circulate freely or park within the
historic center. City officials passed the regulations to avoid
potential traffic jams as many thousands of pilgrims visit Rome in
the Jubilee Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, tour buses entering Rome must pass through one of six
checkpoints on main roads into the city. (As the system becomes
increasingly computerized, they will be reduced to three.) At the
checkpoint, the bus is registered and upon payment of a fee, which
can be paid in advance, is issued a permit. Different kinds of
permits exist, some giving access to a parking spot at one of the
18 new lots inside the city limits. Most of them are open 24 hours
a day and are guarded around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, tour-bus drivers would park wherever they could,
and this often contributed to Rome's notoriously congested traffic.
Since the measure went into effect, buses found without a permit,
or illegally parked, are fined.
</P>
<P>
   After registration, buses can circulate freely outside the
third-century Aurelian walls, but they can only venture into the
historic center _ delineated by the walls _ to drop off and pick up
passengers near the principal tourist attractions, hotels and
restaurants. The designated parking lots are within walking
distance of public transportation (city buses, trams or the subway)
and the new J-line Jubilee buses that connect the principal
pilgrimage sites as well as Rome's monuments. There are nine J-line
buses, all air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which were hotly contested by tour
operators and bus drivers before the city relaxed those regarding
the drop-off sites and cost of the permits, have most Romans
breathing a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available at the Romotur Web site:
www.romotur.it.
</P>
<P>
   By Independence Hall, a New Ritz-Carlton
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, the chain's first new hotel in
the United States in almost 10 years, is now open at 10 Avenue of
the Arts, occupying two landmark buildings near Independence Hall.
Amenities include such innovations as a technology butler to solve
problems without charge for laptop-carrying guests and a bath
butler to draw one's bath and supply, at extra charge, Champagne
and truffles or exotic scents.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Classical Girard-Mellon Bank buildings, with a rotunda
copied from the Pantheon in Rome and a tower dating from the early
1900s, were designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White. The renovation cost
$88 million, giving the hotel 331 rooms, including a
2,100-square-foot penthouse, and 20,000 feet of meeting space, two
restaurants and two lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Guest rooms, with extra-large windows, are done in gold and
azure or gold, burgundy and green, with wood accents and moldings
reminiscent of grand European hotels, along with prints of historic
Philadelphia sites on the walls. There are cordless phones and
outlets for high-speed Internet connections. The two-bedroom
penthouse has an exercise room, a sauna, a kitchen and a living
room. Guests on the four Club Floors below the penthouse have
access to the services of a concierge and a lounge where free
meals, snacks and drinks are served.
</P>
<P>
   Rates range from $320 a night for a double room, $420 for a Club
room and $3,500 for the penthouse. Reservations: (800) 241-3333 or
(215) 735-7700.
</P>
<P>
   Another Delay For Amtrak's Acela
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak suffered another setback last month in getting its
high-speed equipment into service between Washington and Boston.
Officials believe the earliest possible starting date for the Acela
Express is now late August.
</P>
<P>
   The new delay, from a hoped-for late July start, came when bolts
broke on the trucks of new electric locomotives after 40,000 miles
of testing. Rick Remington, an Amtrak spokesman, said that the
locomotive manufacturer, Bombardier of Montreal, had not told the
company how long the bolt replacement and testing would take. He
said engineers, after a rough ride, found that one bolt was broken
and one missing. All the locomotives were then inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amtrak has been operating some renovated Acela cars on
the Northeast Corridor, they have been coupled to older engines and
the trains have not reached the 150-mile-per-hour speeds expected
from the new locomotives. Hopes for getting the all-new equipment
into service last winter were dashed when the wheels wore
excessively in high-speed tests.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Touring a Street of Gems
</P>
<P>
   Much of New York City's diamond industry is concentrated on West
47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. A
two-hour tour designed to help visitors investigate and navigate
the hundreds of jewelry merchants lining the block was recently
introduced by a company called FINY (Fun in New York).
</P>
<P>
   The tour group will hear five or six merchants talk about
various types of jewelry _ diamonds, colored gems and precious
metals, for example _ and offer shopping tips as well as
information and legends about different types of gemstones.
</P>
<P>
   Participating merchants provide coupons for discounts ranging
from 20 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamond District tour is offered every day but Sunday, 11
a.m. and 2 p.m. The cost is $15. Reservations are required at least
one day in advance: (203) 894-8043.
</P>
<P>
   High Notes and High Rides in New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   Defying nature, Jazzland Theme Park opened recently east of New
Orleans with a spectacular 4,000-foot-long roller coaster, 29 other
rides and French Quarter-style architecture constructed on a
platform four feet above what was formerly a soggy playground for
alligators, armadillos and nutria.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The casual visitor will be unaware that much of the 55-acre park
is built on a massive but unobtrusive steel and concrete shelf
resting on 18,000 wood pilings, 50 feet tall, sunk deep into the
soft, damp earth of Louisiana's Mississippi River delta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Originally planned as an attraction focusing primarily on the
infectious homegrown rhythms that attract millions of people
annually to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the French
Quarter Festival and the city's music clubs, Jazzland was expanded
to include a variety of rides with names like the Muskrat
Scrambler, Lafitte's Pirate Ship, Zydeco Scream and the Voodoo
Volcano.
</P>
<P>
   A children's section, Kids' Carnival, offers an interactive
playground and scaled-down versions of some of the adult rides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the music attractions is a Cajun-style dance hall near
17-acre Jazz Lake, where the last remaining alligators were ousted
to make way for a five-times-a-day water-ski show. Popular
Louisiana musicians perform at the dance hall daily from 4 to about
9 p.m. Dance hall food will include such Louisiana dishes as
grilled or smoked Creole chicken ($6) and seafood boudin ($5).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pontchartrain Beach section, offering fried catfish po-boys
for $6, recalls the city's smaller, Art Deco lakeside amusement
park that closed in the early 1980s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Developed at a cost of $110 million, Jazzland is at 12301 Lake
Forest Boulevard about eight miles east of the French Quarter near
the intersection of I-10 and I-510; (504) 253-8100.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $31; $26 for children. Open daily from June 2 to
Aug. 20. The hours during May vary. Open weekends only from Aug. 26
to Oct. 29, and closed during the winter.

   NEW YORK _ This spring, the grievances at 1084-1086 Home Street
in the South Bronx piled up like the garbage in the courtyard:
sporadic heat and hot water, unpaid light bills, water-cracked
walls, rats swaggering through like neighborhood bullies. Hallway
graffiti cursed the landlord, who had not bothered to paint over
it.
</P>
<P>
   The building's state was not the handiwork of a profiteering
landlord. Rather, the overseer of 1084-1086 Home Street is the
Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a Bronx nonprofit
community development corporation once praised as a national model
for residents who want to restore failing housing and reclaim lost
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its own properties are increasingly troubled, whether by
periods without heat, as at 1100 West Farms Road, or by unrealized
plans, as with a former synagogue, empty and encrusted with
scaffolding and graffiti, on Fox Street.
</P>
<P>
   For a group that got its start rehabilitating abandoned
buildings, there may be no symbol more dispiriting than 866 Beck
Street, a Banana Kelly building that deteriorated so much that it
was emptied of tenants and boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our savior has become a slumlord,'' said Marta Rivera, the
chairwoman of the local community board and a tenant at 1084 Home
Street since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, if harsh, is understandable, given what Banana
Kelly, which drew its memorable name from the curve of the Bronx
street where it was born, once meant in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, foundations, reporters and government officials
flocked to the Hunts Point-Longwood neighborhoods to see how Banana
Kelly had transformed drug-infested, derelict tenements into
livable spaces, and had created low-income, low-rise housing co-ops
that proved the salvation of a once-devastated area.
</P>
<P>
   To its critics, the decline of some of Banana Kelly's properties
is a physical reflection of the group's internal disarray, which is
sketched in remarkably consistent terms by current and former board
members, former employees and financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Local merchants have shunned, and in some cases sued, the
organization because of unpaid debts; at least one oil company
began demanding cash on delivery. Former employees who have exited
through its revolving door accuse top officials of using program
money for international travel, a charge that, according to one
federal law enforcement official, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is also examining. The group's board, the essential
instrument for accountability, has withered to a tiny group that
rarely meets.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Kelly's revenues from foundations, government grants and
development projects dropped from nearly $6 million in 1994 to
barely $3 million in 1998. It currently has no city financing. Its
debts, meanwhile, have mounted into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars. It is in arrears on six city mortgages, and behind on its
payroll taxes. At times, its employees say, their offices lacked
for toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Grand plans, most notably a big paper recycling plant proposed
for the South Bronx, have stalled or failed. Many residents have
lost faith.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years after its formation, Banana Kelly is one of the
Bronx's major landlords. It manages 41 buildings that house
formerly homeless and low-income and working-class families. Over
the years, it has expanded into a multiservice agency employing 95
people who do everything from managing its properties to counseling
AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Its many triumphs have included a 1996 award from the city as an
outstanding community-based organization and another at a United
Nations conference that year. But its critics say its recent awards
reflect an organization coasting on past glories.
</P>
<P>
   The group's chairwoman, Yolanda Rivera, disputed the critics,
saying that it is a wonderful time for Banana Kelly, and that she
was bringing renewed vigor to righting it financially. She cited
the high school the organization started in 1997; the Board of
Education has authorized the construction of a new building for the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera denies any allegation that money was misused. She said
many of the property problems were caused by tenants who had never
learned how to live independently, and said politics or
``mischief'' motivated many of her critics. She said that the city
had been little help in alleviating the organization's debts, and
that she deserved credit for keeping the organization afloat in a
trying period. ``I'm not ashamed that we continue to operate, that
we are healthy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her defenders say that she is paying the price for being a
successful Hispanic woman. Joe Hall, who worked at Banana Kelly for
eight years, said Rivera embodies ``the great paradox of community
development in New York'': foundations and other institutions say
they want to cultivate indigenous leaders like Rivera, but then are
threatened when they succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, Banana Kelly's situation is less paradox than
parable, illustrating some of the dangers inherent in the recent
history of government's relationship with poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few decades, government has stepped back from
direct involvement in areas like housing and health care, and
instead encouraged community development organizations like Banana
Kelly to step into the breach.
</P>
<P>
   Neither adequate resources nor oversight have always followed.
When nonprofit organizations have struggled, government overseers
have often been ill positioned or unwilling to attempt reform. No
government agency even has a complete sense of Banana Kelly's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Banana Kelly's very purpose has protected it.

   Bush says he wants to break INS into two parts
</P>
<P>
   By Jena Heath
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush told the League of United
Latin American Citizens on Monday that he wants to make the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service more consumer friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to chop the INS into two agencies _ one for law
enforcement and one for helping immigrants. It's a plan similar to
one that U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has been unable to push
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as people are coming to feed their families, our
country must be mindful that they're human beings ,'' Bush told
LULAC's 71st annual convention. ``And I must stell you that the INS
sends a different message at times. It's too bureaucratic. It's too
paperwork-oriented. It is an agency that sends mixed signals to
people we're trying to help. I intend to reform the INS.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush angered some Latino leaders when he skipped
meetings of LULAC, the National Council of La Raza and the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as the race for the Hispanic vote has intensified,
both Bush and Vice President Al Gore have aggressively courted
Latinos with ad campaigns and speeches. Bush's effort to attract
the Hispanic vote also has included appearances by George P. Bush,
24, the Spanish-speaking son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his
Hispanic wife, Columba.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain addresses LULAC Thursday and Gore, the
presumptive Democratic nominee, appears Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore spoke to the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials; Bush spoke to the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Bush and Gore are scheduled address the National
Council of La Raza's annual conference in San Diego. Bush was set
to address the Congress of Racial Equality in New York Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is making an all-out effort to woo the
fast-growing, traditionally Democratic Latino constituency.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population
increased from 22.4 million in 1990 to 31.8 million in 1999.
Hispanic voters also are concentrated in vote-rich California,
Texas and New York. Those states total 202 electoral votes; 270 are
needed to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not address several key issues in his speech, including
President Clinton's choice of El Paso lawyer Enrique Moreno for the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the use of statistical
sampling in the 2000 Census. Texas senators Phil Gramm and Kay
Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans, are opposing Moreno's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   LULAC President Rick Dovalina said he spent 20 minutes with Bush
before the speech and that Bush told him he would look into the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   On the census issue, Democrats charge that sampling _ using a
formula to determine the count _ is the only way to insure that
traditionally undercounted minorities are represented as states
draw congressional and legislative districts. Republicans counter
that Democrats are simply trying to find ways to inflate the
numbers of voters friendly to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not said how he would handle the issue if he makes it
to the White House, but has said he favors an actual count. Rep.
Charles Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, wrote to Bush for the fourth time
Monday seeking clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that he had described Bush as, ``parading around with
his taco politics,'' after the governor failed to attend last
year's LULAC annual conference in Corpus Christi, Texas, Dovalina
said Bush has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we did here today has changed that,'' he said.
``Because I spent 20 minutes with him back there and he was very
receptive and listening as opposed to telling us what (he feels)
are the Hispanic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would support Bush in November, Dovalina said he
didn't know. He said he couldn't remember if he voted for Bush in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall,'' he said. ``I'm a Democrat so I don't think I
did. But he does really have a lot of support in Texas.''

   ``Not-for-profits in these communities on the housing side are
so critical a resource,'' said Jerilyn Perine, the first deputy
commissioner at the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and
Development. ``We want to see them succeed. We don't want them to
fail. Their importance goes simply beyond their own organization.
It's not as if if they disappeared, someone will take their
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Ruins _ A Radical Idea: Save Buildings
</P>
<P>
   Banana Kelly bloomed from the ruins, at a time when housing in
the South Bronx was being burned, not built. In the 1970s, a group
of residents on Kelly Street united to stop the demolition of three
buildings on their block.
</P>
<P>
   The group revamped those buildings and won title to them and
others from a city desperate to divest itself of abandoned or
deteriorating housing. The city provided loans for rehabilitation
or gave Banana Kelly newly renovated buildings to manage, usually
asking only a symbolic pittance in return.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Banana Kelly incorporated as a nonprofit corporation
providing housing and services. Its adopted as its motto, ``Don't
Move. Improve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was coming in to see how we did this, how did we get
people together,'' recalled Pearl White, a founding member who said
she could still remember the splinters stinging her hands as she
helped rehabilitate the buildings. ``It was a tourist attraction,
almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Banana Kelly brought tens of millions of dollars in investment
to its community and rehabilitated more than 2,000 units of
housing; it also suggested that the tide of hopelessness could be
turned. Its methods, like sweat equity, allowed residents to trade
work for ownership, and its performance won it federal, state and
city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association is an
umbrella organization for the limited partnerships and low-income
co-ops that own the buildings it manages. It is supposed to collect
rents, do maintenance, pay real estate taxes, and make mortgage,
water and sewer payments.
</P>
<P>
   Like many community-based housing developers, it is in a
difficult financial position. The group's rents are low, and its
tenants vulnerable to falling behind in payments. While Banana
Kelly has been taken to Housing Court dozens of times, it has had
to bring hundreds of delinquent tenants there, incurring legal
expenses each time.
</P>
<P>
   The city also handed over properties in need of more work than
it provided financing for, said Harold DeRienzo, Banana Kelly's
founder, and Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rivera, who became the organization's chief executive in
1991, Banana Kelly undertook a variety of social service
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she wanted to wean both tenants and the organization from
dependence on government, Rivera also turned to large-scale
economic development. In 1992, Banana Kelly joined with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a national environmental advocacy
organization, to develop a paper recycling plant to be built in the
South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was designed by Maya Lin, best known for the Vietnam
War Memorial in Washington, and praised by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it has yet to be built _ financing and politics have
postponed it indefinitely _ and like a castle in the air, it
drained personnel and attention from an organization struggling on
the ground.

<P>
   Staff Turnover _ A Poor Record Of Management
</P>
<P>
   As Banana Kelly grew, its infrastructure was being stretched.
When Rivera took over, she dismissed a number of the staff, saying
an excess of professionals had distanced the agency from the
community.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, new employees and executives have come, but
few have stayed long. Many have been fired in the agency's many
purges during the last eight years. Even today, Rivera said, most
of the staff is brand-new. But the influx of new ideas and energy
was beneficial, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency eventually became overwhelmed, current and former
officials said. Financial backers of Banana Kelly describe almost
willfully incompetent financial management. They say Banana Kelly
never found a workable system for collecting and tracking rents and
expenditures, and did a poor job of separating its various
operations. It missed tax advantages, and a $2 million state grant
awarded in 1998 to renovate 866 Beck Street and another building is
being withheld because Banana Kelly has not provided an updated
audited financial statement, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the nearly $1 million owed for water and sewer
services, more than $500,000 in real estate taxes, the overdue
$127,000 an oil company is trying to collect, the liens and
lawsuits over the years from accountants, hardware stores and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees describe continual pressures to use money
earmarked for specific programs to offset those debts, and say
programs and maintenance operations had to run on shoestrings.
Superintendents reached into their own pockets to buy everything
from paint to oil; the group's former president said he had to take
out a loan to make the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as employees were scrounging, Rivera and a few associates
were traveling, as part of an international venture the group
established several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By Rivera's own admission, some part of the organization's
dwindling resources _ what she calls general, or unrestricted funds
_ were used to pay for that travel, including a trip to a
conference in Kenya for her and several associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good group rate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as part of an investigation into Banana Kelly's finances,
the FBI is looking at whether federal program money was used to pay
for that trip and whether Rivera's relatives went with her, a
federal law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the Africa trip was a Bronx-based consultant who
did particularly well under Banana Kelly's auspices. By the time
the consultant, Aureo Cardona, left the organization last year, his
company, Crescendo Inc., was being paid $15,000 a month to manage
Banana Kelly's properties, and he had been given access to a
$50,000 expense fund _ to be replenished as needed _ to do
``national and international engagements'' for the group. And,
under a contract he signed with Claude Gooding, the organization's
former president, he was to receive $1 million if the recycling
plant went to financial closing, which it has not.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera says she knew nothing about that contract, and the two
parted ways after The New York Post reported the deal last year.
Cardona is now suing Banana Kelly for back pay, saying his contract
was breached, and would not discuss his history with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent traveler was Hall, who was named president of
Banana Kelly International. Hall, who said his salary was $55,000,
lived in a Banana Kelly apartment at 814 Manida Street, which is
supposed to house low-income tenants exclusively under the
agreement by which the city transferred the building to Banana
Kelly in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he did not know the building was for low-income
tenants; Rivera said she thought it was for low- to moderate-income
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rivera has been at the center of controversy almost since she
took charge of the organization in 1991, after having been
chairwoman of its board since 1985. She has retained her board
chairmanship during her tenure as chief executive, an arrangement
that her predecessor, Getz Obstfeld, called ``fairly uncommon,''
and that her critics assert insulates her from accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can tell you another nonprofit that does it,''
Obstfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the board has shrunk, with as few as three
members, including Rivera, usually attending no more than one
meeting a year, the minimum required by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Kelly's bylaws say that ``board members are not to be
directly involved with management.'' Yet over the years, in
addition to Rivera, various board members have been employed by
Banana Kelly, including Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, a member since
1996, who became the organization's president last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Rivera has elevated those she considers loyal, her
critics say, she has sometimes vindictively dispatched those she
believes are not. In February, she fired five longtime building
superintendents without notice, making a variety of accusations
that she conceded in an interview may be difficult to prove. She
has since been trying to evict them from their apartments, although
the dismissals await union arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the law in Banana Kelly,'' one of the fired
superintendents, Agripino Morales, said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tenants Make Do _ Buildings Worsen, Repairs Go Undone
</P>
<P>
   But neither deep resentment nor financial travails seem to have
affected Banana Kelly, its critics say. As its city financing has
dwindled to nothing, it has simply turned to the state and federal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   City officials could foreclose on Banana Kelly's mortgages, but
feel that doing so would set the community back 20 years. While
housing officials have been aware of Banana Kelly's management
problems for years, in April 1999 the housing department turned
four more buildings over to the group for a down payment of $4.
</P>
<P>
   So tenants make do with the landlord they have.
</P>
<P>
   In Lydia Rios' third-floor apartment at 788 Fox Street, an April
visit by a city housing inspector left a checklist of violations,
from no smoke detector to a leaky ceiling. She shrugged. Each year
the housing inspector orders repairs, and they go undone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaky ceiling comes as no surprise to the owner of the
building's ground-floor bodega, who points to the water damage
pressing down on his ceiling and his $2,000 monthly rent bill and
asked, ``Isn't Banana Kelly supposed to be an organization for poor
people, to help the community?''
</P>
<P>
   Banana Kelly's financial backers and city officials say they
have become particularly concerned in recent months because of
deferred maintenance to Banana Kelly's properties.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said the organization is seeking a loan to pay off back
taxes and rehabilitate 788 Fox Street and several other buildings.
But, she said of tenants, ``If conditions were as bad as they
sometimes say, they would have moved out.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the organization's roots, that sentiment sits poorly with
Pearl White, a cosmetologist who has sat on Banana Kelly's board
since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   As a board member, she said, she has futilely challenged
Rivera's actions and demanded more records. She was warned, she
said, that if she spoke publicly about her concerns, she would be
removed from the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see any of the buildings end up like the
condition we were in,'' she said, sitting in the apartment on Kelly
Street she helped bring back to life with her bare hands more than
two decades ago. ``I don't want to see Banana Kelly ruined.''

COMPUTER SLANG SCOFFS AT WETWARE (THE HUMANS) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 9th graf, bgng `As the former...,' contains language that may
offend some people.) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As couch potatoes become ``mouse potatoes,'' as teen-agers
become ``screen-agers,'' the once lowly geek has become a cultural
icon, studied by the fashionistas of Seventh Avenue and the Nasdaq
watchers of Wall Street alike. As geek chic takes hold of the
technology-obsessed culture, geek-speak seeps into everyday
language.
</P>
<P>
   Most people now know that ``viruses'' aren't just germs spread
from person to person but malicious programs that can spread
overnight from one computer to millions of others around the world.
``Spam'' is no longer a ham product but a form of computer
junk-mail; ``toast'' refers not to a breakfast choice but to a
state of being dead or burned out; and ``cookies'' aren't
fattening, chocolate-chip-studded snacks but tiny files containing
information about our computers that can be used by advertisers to
track users' online interests and tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier technological developments left their mark on the
language. The railroads gave rise to expressions like ``going off
the rails'' and ``getting sidetracked''; the steam engine produced
``working up a head of steam'' and ``full steam ahead''; and the
automobile left us with ``pedal to the metal,'' ``firing on all
cylinders'' and ``eatin' concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, phrases generated by the computer age tend to
be more sardonic and pejorative. ``Blamestorming'' refers to group
discussions devoted to the assignment of blame; the acronym
``kiss'' means ``keep it simple stupid''; and ``ego-surfing''
alludes to Internet searches for one's own name.
</P>
<P>
   So what does cyberslang say about the digerati and the brave new
world? As collections of slang found in books like ``Jargon Watch''
(assembled by Gareth Branwyn), The New Hacker's Dictionary
(compiled by Eric S. Raymond) and ``Cyberspeak'' (by Andy Ihnatko),
as well as a host of online slang sites (most notably The Microsoft
Lexicon, Netlingo and The Ultimate Silicon Valley Slang Page)
readily attest, geek-speak conjures up a chilly, utilitarian world
in which people are equated with machines and social Darwinism
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberland has been heavily influenced by pop culture and it
boasts its share of counterculture phrases drawn from comic books,
children's stories, sci-fi movies and New Age movements. ``Deep
magic'' (meaning ``an awesomely arcane technique central to a
program or system'') comes from C.S. Lewis' ``Narnia'' books; the
online abbreviation TTFN (meaning ``ta-ta for now'') comes from
``Winnie the Pooh''; and ``fear and loathing'' (meaning the state
of mind ``inspired by the prospect of dealing with certain
real-world systems and standards that are totally brain-damaged but
ubiquitous'') comes, of course, from Hunter S. Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail abbreviations like ``4-ever'' and ``2B or not 2B'' sound
like outtakes from a Prince song, while emoticons (those sideways
smiley faces like :-) used to indicate a user's feelings) summon
visions of Hello-Kitty lunchboxes.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its playful love of puns and cool disdain for
``suits,'' the high-tech world is, at heart, a cruel, unforgiving
place ruled by the merciless dynamics of the marketplace. There are
multiple terms for success (including ``winnage,'' ``winnitude,''
having an ``Elvis year,'' being ``golden'' or ``on velvet'') and an
equally large number of terms for failure (``lossage,''
``lossity,'' ``Big Lose'') and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   As the former Wired writer Paulina Borsook points out in her new
book ``Cyberselfish,'' the digital community is increasingly a
world that mirrors our ``winner-take-all, casino society,'' a
community that projects the attitude ``I've got mine (or certainly
intend to if the goddamned bureaucrats don't get in my way), so
screw you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the looking glass world of high tech, writers and artists are
known as ``content providers,'' and a ``showstopper'' refers not to
a thrilling tour de force but, as The Microsoft Lexicon notes, to
``a function, object or issue important enough to jeopardize a ship
date or schedule'' _ in other words, ``a really big bug.'' ``Evil''
doesn't have a moral connotation in cyberland but indicates
something ``sufficiently mal-designed as to be not worth the bother
of dealing with.'' ``Elite'' suggests something pirated or stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberland's politics are libertarian, as Borsook observes; and
its presiding muse is Ayn Rand. This is a world with an acronym for
``Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt'' (FUD) and another for ``Waste of
Money, Brains and Time'' (Wombat), a Nietzschean world in which
leaders are known as ``wizards'' or ``net.gods,'' and followers are
dismissed as ``sheeple.'' Calling someone a ``404'' (from the World
Wide Web error message, ``404 Not Found'') means he is clueless or
has a high ``bozon count,'' while accusing him of being a ``BDU''
means he's a ``Big Dumb User.''
</P>
<P>
   What venerated ``alpha geeks'' and lowly ``smurfs'' share is a
tendency to talk about people as if they were machines. To be
``uninstalled'' means being fired or dismissed, whereas a
``plug-and-play'' refers to a new employee who fits in without any
additional training. Doing a ``bit flip'' means undergoing a
disturbing personality change; indulging in ``nonlinear behavior''
(NLB) means acting irrationally; possessing huge ``bandwidth''
means having lots of talent or brains.
</P>
<P>
   A ``bio-break'' refers to a trip to the bathroom, and
``client/server action'' refers to sex. Stress puppies ``ramp up''
to cope with added work and ``batmobile'' _ by putting up defensive
emotional shields _ when threatened with unwanted intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Such language tends to ratify the unflattering stereotype of the
computer geek, described in The New Hacker's Dictionary as
``withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually frustrated and
desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft.'' While
that book's editor, Eric Raymond, observes that such stereotypes
are ``far less common than mainstream folkore'' would have it, he
adds that ``hackers have relatively little ability to identify
emotionally with other people,'' so accustomed are they to spending
hours and hours at the computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view echoed by Borsook, who writes that techies are
uncomfortable ``with squishy stuff and the intangible and that
which can't be reduced to formulae'' or programs.
</P>
<P>
   Geek-speak is flush with disparaging or defensive references to
the real world and flesh-and-blood human beings. The nonvirtual
world, so much messier than the one online, is derogatorily
referred to as a ``carbon community'' or ``meatspace.'' Individuals
who aren't online are shrugged off as PONAs (``persons of no
account''); printed magazines and newspapers, as ``treeware'' or
``dead tree editions.'' ``Analog'' is an adjective used to refer to
things in the ``real world'' (defined in ``Cyberspeak,'' as ``that
which cannot be accessed via a keyboard''), but it's also used to
describe things that are sloppy or graceless.
</P>
<P>
   For geeks who prefer ``text sex'' to physical encounters, e-mail
to ``facemail,'' e-commerce to ``bricks and mortar'' shopping, the
human body is nothing but ``wetware'' _ a fragile, inefficient
alternative to the shiny hardware of their computers.
</P>
<P>
   This outlook, Mark Dery notes in his book ``Escape Velocity,''
is reflected in those cyberpunk stories in which the human mind is
downloaded into computers and thus liberated from ``meat-jail,''
and cyborgs herald a future in which the body is redefined as a
``warmblooded machine.''
</P>
<P>
   This cybertopian world would eliminate ``PEBCAK'' (tech support
shorthand for ``Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard''), but
then it would also eliminate ``meatbots'' _ or human beings, as
they are still currently known.

A DANCE FEAST WHERE FUN FLOWS ACROSS THE AISLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Given the customary abstraction of contemporary dance,
it is easy to see the metaphor behind Jiri Kylian's use of bridges
as the theme of his show celebrating the 40th anniversary of the
Nederlands Dans Theater and his own 25 years as the company's
principal choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always tried to build bridges,'' he explained,
``bridges between people, races, nations, continents.''
</P>
<P>
   But for this show, ``Arcimboldo 2000,'' which is touring eight
European cities this spring and summer, the Czech-born
choreographer has done more than use bridges as symbols. He has
also built real bridges from the stage over the orchestra pit into
the audience. Significantly, these are bridges crossed by both the
performers and the public. Here, at least, there is no curtain
separating illusion and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, spectators encounter video cameras recording
their arrival, with the scenes replayed on a screen onstage. They
are then guided behind and below the stage to discover a score of
dancers, bedecked in feathers, moving in slow motion and hidden in
odd places, like spirits who people the darkened theater.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, visitors arrive on stage and cross the bridges into the
theater to take their seats. Once the show begins, it is the
dancers' turn to go in the opposite direction, popping up in the
audience before crossing onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in one boat, under the same roof,'' said Kylian, 53,
who gave up the administrative duties of artistic director of the
company last fall to concentrate entirely on choreography. ``The
public becomes performers too. The whole idea is to include
everyone in the fun. It's all about entertainment, it's a feast, a
big multicolored gateau, a mosaic. That's why I thought Arcimboldo
would be an appropriate title.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known as the 16th century painter who created bizarre
portraits using fruits and vegetables, Giuseppe Arcimboldo was also
Master of Ceremonies at the court of Rudolph II in Prague and, as
such, had the job of organizing banquets, tournaments, fireworks
displays and other assorted fun and games. Appropriately, after
``Arcimboldo 2000'' opened in The Hague in May, it traveled first
to Prague, then to Paris, and it ends its tour at the Edinburgh
Festival in September.
</P>
<P>
   It is the spirit of Arcimboldo, rather than his fruits and
vegetables, that sets the mood of the show, a potpourri of
sequences that include some pieces in the company's repertory and
others created for the occasion. To keep the tone festive, the
accompanying music is a cheerful medley of extracts from works by
Tchaikovsky, Steve Reich, Aare Merikanto, Morton Feldman, John
Cage, Bach, Schubert and others.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian has designed the spectacle to display the multiple
talents of the company. So five dancers have also created works:
Jorma Elo made the video recordings of spectators and performers
before the show; Karine Guizzo conceived and organized the
backstage mise-en-scene; and Johan Inger, Patrick Delcroix and Paul
Lightfoot created their own choreographies. Only 40 percent of the
first half of the evening is signed by Kylian, although most of the
second half is his.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's three troupes, which frequently tour
separately, are now in the same show and, for the finale, dance as
one ensemble: the 28 dancers of NDT1, the main troupe, founded in
1959: the 16 members of NDT2, formed in 1979 for dancers 17 to 22
(many graduate to NDT1); and the four ``seniors'' of NDT3, which
Kylian created in 1989 to allow them to keep dancing ``between 40
and death,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Kylian has a soft spot for NDT3 _ and not only because
it includes his German-born wife, Sabine Kupferberg. In fact,
``Arcimboldo 2000'' opens with Gerard Lemaitre, the 63-year-old
French dean of the company, who is soon joined by Kupferberg, 49,
David Krugel, 41, and Gioconda Barbuto, 43. They take their seats
at a table and, as other dancers spin around them, do a comic turn
spoofing the solemnity of dance auditions.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Way a Lone: To Somebody No Longer Here,'' a piece by
Kylian that was performed at last year's Lincoln Center Festival,
Lemaitre, Krugel and Kupferberg become contemporary clowns in a
clever interplay between dancers on screen and onstage. At the end
of the show, after all the dancers have performed a splashy finale
decked out in bright red costumes, it is again the NDT3 four who
complete the cycle by wiping off their makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``With NDT3, it's not about what they cannot do, but what they
can do better than the others,'' Kylian explained in an interview
before ``Arcimboldo 2000'' was presented at the Palais Garnier in
Paris this month. ``They can stand onstage and do nothing. Their
energies are very different. Many old dancers are still performing
around the world but they are pretending to be 30. I think they
should dance their age and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that since the choreography was designed for each member
of NDT3, there was no question of a second cast. ``With the young,
I'm more like a teacher,'' he went on, ``and the work is less
linked to their personality. Young dancers injure themselves very
easily because they don't yet know how to handle their bodies. NDT3
has only four dancers but they know their bodies, their
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the younger dancers provide much flair, as in Inger's
sequence, ``Modern Furies,'' where five women appear in leather
jackets, high heels and dark glasses as mafia molls, and Delcroix's
``Strange Animals,'' in which 18 dancers interact in green costumes
that give them the appearance of insects. As always with the
Nederlands Dans Theater, stunning costumes are very much part of
the show, in this case designed by Joke Visser and Yoshiki
Hishinuma, who began his career working with Issey Miyake.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a year ago, Kylian said: ``Every piece should
give you something to take home with you.'' In this case, he said,
``Arcimboldo 2000'' is intended specifically as ``a present to our
public,'' a party from which the guests take home a gift. Indeed,
the choreographer has come up with a pun to explain what he is up
to: ``Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, but today is a
gift; that is why we call it the present.''

LAWSUITS BROUGHT AGAINST 6 MANAGED CARE COMPANIES UNDER
RACKETEERING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Miss., Ill., Calif.)   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new batch of lawsuits accuses six big managed care companies
of misleading health plan members. The suits were filed Friday in
U.S. District Court in Miami, where a judge recently promised a
speedy decision in a similar suit against Humana Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Humana suit, the latest court actions accuse the
insurers _ Aetna, Cigna, Foundation Health Systems, Pacificare
Health Systems, Prudential Health Care and United Healthcare _ of
failing to disclose to plan members that they offered rewards to
doctors and other employees who denied payments for care and
limited hospital admissions.
</P>
<P>
   The suits also contend that the companies defrauded members in
violation of the federal antiracketeering law, which provides for
treble damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, who were involved in huge settlements in earlier
suits against tobacco companies, said they would seek to combine
dozens of suits against Humana and the six insurers in a single
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would lead to a faster resolution to have
everything in one court,'' said Stephen Neuwirth, a partner of
David Boies of Armonk, N.Y. Boies was recently appointed as one of
two lead plaintiffs' lawyers in the Humana case. Richard F. Scruggs
of Mississippi is the other lead plaintiffs' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boyle, a lawyer for Humana, said the company did not want
the consolidation of the latest suits to slow down a ``fast track''
schedule that the judge had set, to consider a Humana motion for
dismissal. He contended that the suits were ``without legal merit''
and should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court recently ruled, in a unanimous decision, that
an Illinois woman could not claim a breach of fiduciary duties,
under a federal pension and health care law, to sue her health
plan. While the high court did not address the disclosure issue,
Boyle said, the decision will be ``very very helpful to
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, plaintiffs lawyers insisted that the Supreme
Court ruling did not apply to their suits.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation, a big California managed care company, ``will
contest the consolidation in Florida,'' a spokesman said. Industry
lawyers have contended that the companies have different products
and policies and should not be lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said 11 suits against Humana had been consolidated at the
company's request. Judge Frederico Moreno set a July 7 deadline for
Humana to submit its dismissal motion and scheduled a hearing on it
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge lets the case proceed, the plaintiffs must file
their arguments for seeking class-action status by Aug. 15 and
Humana must respond by Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides expect to add two more suits against
Humana, which were filed on behalf of doctors. Archie Lamb, a
plaintiffs' lawyer in Birmingham, Ala., said his group also wanted
to include suits by doctors against Aetna, Cigna, Foundation,
Pacificare, Prudential (now a unit of Aetna), and the Blue Cross of
California unit of Wellpoint Health Networks. Lawyers for the other
defendants declined to comment, saying they had not seen the new
suits, which only became available in Miami Monday. Neuwirth said
the Boies-Scruggs group would seek to have the cases consolidated
by the multidistrict panel of federal judges in late July.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Lane, a managed care analyst at Salmon Smith Barney,
said that 33 suits seeking class-action status had been filed
against insurers between Oct. 3 and May 25. Most were filed in
federal courts. None has been certified as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   The suits also argued that the managed care companies conspired
to adopt similar operating practices at industry meetings sponsored
by companies selling guidelines; by standard-setting and
accrediting groups; and trade groups.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Spadea, Serena Williams finally taste victory again
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ Over the past few years, Greg Rusedski and Tim
Henman have provided the natives with hope that the Wimbledon men's
trophy will one day return to Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of the Wimbledon fortnight, that hope
was cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   American Vince Spadea, who brought a tour-record 21-match losing
streak into The Championships, upset the 14th-seeded Rusedski 6-3,
6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (8), 9-7. The five-set marathon lasted nearly six
hours, included a two-hour rain delay and barely finished before
darkness set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was outrageous,'' Spadea said. ``I felt like I won the
match 16 times. It's been a rough year, a rough patch in my life in
tennis. I put things together. I competed well today. I'm a
fighter. We were like gladiators out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea, who hadn't won a match since October, had to scratch and
claw for this one after Rusedski saved two match points in the
fourth-set tiebreak to force the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist in 1997 but lost in the
first round the following year before making it to the fourth round
last year. Spadea reached the second round for only the second time
in six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Henman, with a pair of quarterfinal and two semifinal
appearances over the last four years, is now Great Britain's lone
hope. The eighth seed begins play today against Paradorn
Srichazphan of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Serena Williams had a triumphant return
from a 2{-month layoff because of tendinitis in her left knee.
Looking as big and strong as when she won the U.S. Open last year,
but displaying a game that she called ``better'' than the one she
had in New York, Williams knocked off Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-3,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is off right now,'' said Williams, when
asked which part of her game was lacking after such a layoff. ``I'm
in shape. I'm looking better. I'm more fit. I think for a normal
person, I would say physique.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams proved she wasn't a ``normal'' person when she won the
U.S. Open as the seventh seed last year. She is seeded eighth here
_ a drop that reflects the time off _ and said she is eager to get
her ranking up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel comfortable down here,'' Williams said. ``I'm
always itchy. I feel weird. It's just not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon could give her the boost she seeks. Although she has
played here only once _ a third-round loss in '98 _ Williams came
off the court exuberant Monday, convinced that grass is her best
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel free,'' Williams said. ``I can breathe freely. This is
really my surface. I play a fast game. I should be dominating
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a couple of long games Monday, she did dominate, needing
only 1 hour, 9 minutes to defeat Carlsson. Williams had her serve
broken only once, despite facing eight break points. She broke
Carlsson four times on four opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the knee that was injured before the Amelia
Island tournament in April held up fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK now,'' Williams said. ``It's not like, you know, 200
percent, but it's pretty far up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Big sister Venus Williams also had an easy opener, beating Czech
Kveta Hrdlickova 6-3, 6-1 in a match that lasted less than an hour.
Venus utilized her serve-and-volley, winning the point on about
half of her net approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me to serve-and-volley every point,'' Venus said.
``I have a good volley. I'm confident in my volleys. The only thing
I think that you have to worry about is getting passed, but the
person can't pass you every time. It's going to be difficult,
especially with my wingspan.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters feel they are better prepared than most players
simply because they have each other for practice partners, which
makes every workout seem like a tournament final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is that we have these practices, because we
always are hitting with each other,'' Venus said. ``If anything, we
should be the most prepared for the next opponent or if we play
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are in the same half of the draw and would not play
each other until the semifinals. Venus, however, would first have
to get past top-seeded Martina Hingis, whom she could meet in a
quarterfinal match.
</P>
<P>
   In other first-round matches, three-time defending champion Pete
Sampras had an easy time against Czech Jiri Vanek, winning 6-4,
6-4, 6-2 and extending his Wimbledon record to 47-1 dating to 1993,
including 32-1 on Centre Court. Hingis, who was upset in the first
round last year, made quick work of Spain's Angeles Montolio 6-1,
6-2, and unseeded Anna Kournikova weathered a rain delay to oust
No. 10 Sandrine Testud of France 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.

TOPPLE THE QUEEN! ENTHRONE YOURSELF ON A STAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Canada Journal) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ For Canadians tired of maple leaves or
airbrushed photos of the queen on their stamps, Canada Post
suggests the 21st-century alternative: Personalize your postage
with a photo of the new baby, the new graduate, the happy couple or
the loyal dog.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity stamps, the latest product for an ego-centered age, made
their debut in Canada on May 6, and the response has been
overwhelming. ``We are getting 400 to 500 orders a day,'' said Tim
McGurrin, spokesman for Canada Post, the state-run postal service.
``The buzz has tipped us off that we are really onto something
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Calgary's main post office, sales clerks were handing
out photocopied order forms only one week after the national
launch. A clerk said apologetically, ``They only gave us 50
brochures, and they are gone already.''
</P>
<P>
   From Ottawa, McGurrin, who has ordered one sheet of stamps
featuring his own photo and one sheet featuring his 2-year-old
daughter, explained that people wanting to personalize their
postage needed only to fill out a form, mail in a photo and send
payment. (Order forms and instructions can also be downloaded from
the Canada Post Web site, www.canadapost.ca).
</P>
<P>
   Within about three weeks, applicants receive in the mail a sheet
of 25 self-sticking printed ``gilt frames,'' marked ``Canada'' and
``46'' _ for Canada's domestic letter rate. This comes with a
second sheet of 25 ``personalized self-adhesive photo stickers,''
or ``vignettes autocollantes'' in French. After sticking the frame
on the upper right hand side of an envelope, the letter writer
places the photo sticker in the center of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Each sheet costs $24.95 Canadian, plus tax, or more than double
the cost of a sheet of 25 normal domestic-rate stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada Post is ripping us off again,'' grumbled Dwayne Miner,
owner of Stampede City Stamps, a stamp shop next to the main post
office here. ``It costs a dollar, but you only get 46 cents of
postage. Who's going to pay a buck to mail a letter?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his grumbling, Miner confessed that he, too, had fallen
for Canada Post's latest promotion to milk money from collectors
and the public. He said that at a national stamp show in Winnipeg
in late April, where the personalized stamps were previewed by
collectors, he had joined an hourlong line to have stamps made of
``my beautiful self.'' Now he is ordering stamps of ``Simon _ he's
my buddy, a Bernese mountain dog.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Australia, Britain, Singapore and Switzerland
have started to offer customers the option of buying stamps with
their photo printed on attached tabs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service, however, has no plans to allow
Americans to personalize their postage. Don Smeraldi, a Postal
Service spokesman, said in an interview, ``Having an individual on
a stamp would personalize it to the extent that we wouldn't have a
good return on printing stamps, because we print them in the
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Canada is exploring more ways for people to express
their individuality with stamps. Along with the photo stamps,
Canada Post has issued five different greeting stickers that can be
placed in the gilt frames. These stickers, which include a heart, a
pen and the word ``Surprise,'' ``will allow customers to customize
their correspondence according to mood or message,'' said Micheline
Montreuil, Canada Post's director of stamp products.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Australia led the way in personalized postage tabs,
Canada Post goes one step further by creating a truly custom
stamp,'' reads the current issue of Canada Stamp Details, a Canada
Post publication for collectors. ``Canada Post holds the worldwide
patent for the double-sticker greeting stamp and is investigating
more possible uses for this creative offering.''
</P>
<P>
   In early July, Americans will be able to buy instant
personalized stamps when Canada Post sets up its traveling
personalized stamp printing machine at a major stamp show in
Anaheim, Calif. Collectors say that this essentially is a legal way
of printing money, since few American collectors will use their
stamps to mail letters from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For collectors, personalized stamps pose a challenge because
variations could be as extensive as names in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J.G. Verge, president of the Royal Philatelic Society of
Canada, said, ``I think they're going to be more popular with the
general public than they'll be with collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his three daughters in college, he predicted more
orders: ``They're all graduating in the next three years, so I
imagine I'll do stamps of their graduation pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   McGurrin said Canada Post had also fielded a number of calls
from small businesses asking if they could order stamps with their
logo. His response: ``Absolutely! Anything within good taste is
pretty much going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid legal unpleasantness, customers signing ``picture
postage'' order forms must confirm that they have ``the necessary
copyright and consent permission'' for the images. In addition,
Ashton Potter Canada Inc., the Ontario printer that has started
printing the photo sheets, vows to reject all obscene, racially
biased or any other content deemed inappropriate ``for any
reason.''

FITTING TAXIS FOR WHEELCHAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City has started on a road that may lead to taxicabs
that are able to accommodate wheelchair users in their chairs. The
Taxi and Limousine Commissioner, Diane McGrath McKechnie, has
submitted a proposal requiring that the city's medallion taxi fleet
include such cabs, which are usually minivans modified to provide
ramps that fold down in the back or on the side.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act, the federal civil rights
law dealing with hotels and motels, trains and buses, airports and
public arenas, does not cover taxicabs. But at least 14 cities in
the United States and 7 in Canada have accessible cabs in
operation, according to research by the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans
Association. These cities include Chicago, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Boston and Las Vegas. A number of them
enacted rules requiring these vehicles, almost all since the ADA
was signed by President George Bush in 1990.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accessible taxis have been a goal of McKechnie's since she got
her job in 1996, according to Allan J. Fromberg, the Taxi and
Limousine Commission spokesman, but the industry has so far failed
to respond. Her proposal, scheduled for a hearing June 29, says
that effective July 1, 2001, all vehicles equipped to serve as
medallion cabs would have to be accessible, as would livery cabs,
black cars and limousines unless the dispatching companies elected
to arrange for equivalent service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston has 50 accessible cabs in its medallion fleet of 1,775,
and expects to get as many as 50 more by the end of the year. Mark
Cohen, the director of licensing for the Boston Police Department,
said that after seven years of accessible cabs there, it was still
a work in progress. The first batch of vans, for example, used side
ramps, and the vans were so low to the ground that they plowed
snow. One company that modified vans for wheelchair entry has gone
out of business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medallions for modified minivans cost less, to offset the cost
of the modifications and the higher cost of operation. The
operating life of the vans is also shorter, Cohen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The demand for use has not been so great as expected but, he
said, ``it was a good idea.'' The modified vans are travelers'
favorites, he said, because whole families with luggage, with or
without a wheelchair, can pile in at the airport. The vans can be
hailed on the street or called through a radio dispatcher of any
major cab company. ``I don't see how any city could get away
without having any,'' Cohen said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the consumer services commission oversees taxicab
regulations. Commissioner Caroline Orzac Shoenberger, a former New
Yorker, said her city was probably most like New York. Although
there is a great marketing potential for accessible cabs, she said,
``unfortunately, the cities have to mandate.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said that Chicago was asked for accessible taxis by the
Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1997 and she got the mayor to
allocate $15,000 for a pilot conversion process. She set up a
meeting but industry representatives said they should be able to
charge wheelchair passengers more because it took longer to get
them in and out of a cab. ``Not a good argument,'' Shoenberger
said, pointing out that loading and unloading strollers also took
extra time. She added that state discrimination law if not federal
law would look unkindly on a differential.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago law was enacted in 1997 and the first accessible cabs,
which are side-loading, were on the streets in 1998. If a company
has 15 or more medallions, it must have one or more accessible
cabs, she said. There are 31 or 32 on the streets now; there will
be 35 by September and 8 more by the end of the year. To get one, a
customer should call the radio dispatcher of a major company.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shoenberger said that her last case as a lawyer in private
practice was a mother with a wheelchair child who had to take on an
entire suburban school system, and that this probably influenced
her views. ``Transportation should not be a barrier to people's
living fruitful lives,'' she said. ``If tourists know they aren't
going to be stranded at the airport or the museum, they are going
to come. Everyone gains.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Lauderdale, Rick Bannister oversees the wheelchair
division of the Yellow Cab Co., where 21 out of 541 Yellow Cabs
have been modified, with rear ramps. The vans can carry a
wheelchair user, four other passengers and the driver.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such taxis have been in existence for nine years, and there has
been a slow but steady increase in use. On the weekends, Bannister
said, they probably do 25 trips a day between the airport and the
cruise-ship pier. The fare to the Fort Lauderdale pier is $10, and
to the Port of Miami $55. The company got into this area because
the owner, Jessie Gaddis, had a friend who used a wheelchair and
had trouble getting a cab. Yellow Cab: (954) 565-2800. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has 14 cab companies, according to Ken Smith, an
investigator for the Las Vegas Taxicab Authority, and there are 27
accessible cabs in operation, two to a company except for one new
operator. Las Vegas cabs are dispatched by radio, and a call to any
company should bring an accessible cab. The city has had accessible
vans for at least 10 years, Smith believes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, companies were required in 1996 to see that 2
percent of their fleets were accessible cabs. Doris Smith, a senior
investigator in the Los Angeles City Department of Transportation,
said that 127 were now in service with 10 major companies, all
available on call to the dispatcher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iram Rashada, assistant general manager of Los Angeles Checker
Cabs, (800) 300-5007, said that 24 of the company's 290 taxis were
accessible and have been in the fleet for three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, according to Nathan Dwiri, president and general
manager of the Yellow Cab cooperative there, has authorized 75
accessible cabs, but only 55 are in service. Yellow Cab, (415)
626-2345, has 30 of these ``ramp taxis,'' Dwiri said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New York livery company, Symphony Transportation, has five
Chrysler minivans with side ramps. John Acierno, the head of the
overall company, Executive Transportation, said it was a joint
project begun in the last year with Easter Seals, whose mission is
helping people with disabilities. Easter Seals donated the
minivans, each adapted to carry two wheelchairs plus three
passengers and a driver, and provided driver training. The company
operates the vans, does licensing, call-taking, billing and the
like. The reservation number is (800) 253-1443. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it by advance arrangement,'' Acierno said, ``and some on
an as-soon-as-possible basis. Our goal is to provide an instant
response.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said that Executive Transportation would like to see the
project expand, and that through his board position in the Black
Car Industry Association was talking about how to go further.
``It's time to get up to critical mass,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The taxi and limousine commissioner, McKechnie, said: ``The goal
is to see a reasonable number of taxicabs and livery vehicles
accessible. It was time to move the process forward.''

Astros could use some comic relief
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   What if, in a bold attempt to follow up on ABC's recent decision
to put comedian Dennis Miller in the booth for Monday Night
Football broadcasts, the Astros did the same?
</P>
<P>
   What if in hopes of juicing up this hellish season, an array of
comedians past and present, gone-but-not-forgotten voices as well
as current stars, could join Milo Hamilton in the radio booth?
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Welcome to the Astros Radio Network. With me today is
Bob `There's Still' Hope. There is still hope, isn't there, Bob?''
</P>
<P>
   Hope: ``No, there's not. Actually, not one of the `On The Road'
films I made was as bad as what the Astros have done on the road
this year. Home isn't so hot, either. I've visited troops in Da
Nang that had less of a 1,000-yard stare on their faces than some
of these guys with the bases loaded and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell ya, if the tabloids think I'm the one on life
support, they ought to go to Enron Field some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Well, how bad is it? Hey, heeeere's Johnny!''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson: ``This Astros season is so bad Magic Johnson had
a better run on late-night TV. Billy Ray Cyrus had more hits.
Pee-wee Herman never struck out in clutch situations this often.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld: ``Sure he did. Want to have a contest?''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``What kind of contest?''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld: ``Let's you and I not order room service on the road
until the Astros can win three in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``I think the Astros will win that one. But really, what's
the biggest problem with this team right now? How would you
describe it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Kinison: ``AAAwwwooh. Aaawwooh. Aawwooh!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock: ``%$&AMP;. $%&AMP;. %!''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pryor: ``&AMP;%$. &AMP;$. %$!''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Why don't we ask someone else? How would you describe
it, Henny?''
</P>
<P>
   Henny Youngman: ``Take the pitching staff . . . please!''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Dangerfield: ``I tell you, the Astros don't get no
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Foxworthy: ``You know, you might be an Astro if the only
thing juicier than a big hunk o' Spam on the plate is one of your
fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be an Astro if you strike out looking three times
with runners in scoring position. You might be an Astro if you've
gone from the penthouse to a trailer park in the path of a twister
in less than nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be a new-and-not-so-improved Astro if pictures of
Cindy Crawford and Morgan Fairchild that once hung in the clubhouse
have been replaced with pictures of Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera. You might be an Astro if all the peach fuzz on the new
faces still doesn't add up to the hair on Ken Caminiti's goatee.''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``You might be right. Hey, there's a long fly ball off
Jose Lima . . . back, back, gone. Holy Toledo!''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Carey: ``Don't you mean, `Holy Cleveland?'''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Look, you've got your favorite city in Ohio; I've got
mine. Whose line is it, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin: ``That Lima, he's one wild and crazy guy!''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Yeah, but he's 1-11. What's that Larry Dierker is
shouting down there in the dugout?''
</P>
<P>
   George Carlin: ``I think it's the seven words you can't say on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Do you read lips?''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne: ``No, but if you hum a few bars, I'll sing the
national anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   Milo: ``Uh, no. Things haven't gotten that bad yet.''
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman: ``Sure, they have. In fact, here are the Top 10
reasons things have gone so wrong for the Astros this season:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 10 _ No Dome dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 9 _ Pinstripes only work for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 8 _ The last time I spent $5.25 for a beer, Charles
Barkley was at the table next to me with a fistful of dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 7 _ Jeff Bagwell should have kept the Capt. Lou Albano
beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 6 _ Jose Lima lost his mojo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 5 _ We need the other Maddux!
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 4 _ Two words: Casey Candaele.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 3 _ That's baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 2 _ Another division banner would cover up all the
advertising in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the No. 1 reason things have gone so wrong for the Astros
this season: How can you expect them to get into contention when
they can't even get onto the Internet? That requires putting three
W's together.''
</P>
<P>
   George Burns: ``Say goodnight, Astros.''

ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION IS ELATED AS ELECTION LOOKS TIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Supporters of the opposition party cheered
and danced early Tuesday as election results from the weekend's
parliamentary elections showed the fledgling party running neck and
neck with the governing party that has dominated Zimbabwe for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The final result was unclear, but with about half the vote in
from counting stations across the country, tallies quickly
established that the nine-month-old party had become a powerful
opposition force in Zimbabwe _ a feat considered unimaginable just
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For years, President Robert Mugabe's governing party has
controlled all but three seats in parliament. But the new
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, easily
surpassed that figure, quickly winning 31 seats and claiming
lopsided victories in urban districts, where voters have been
squeezed by skyrocketing inflation and deepening unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party carried 32 mostly rural districts, where the
party's support has traditionally been strongest. Political
analysts predicted that the votes would continue to split along
urban and rural lines for the 120 parliamentary seats up for
election as the counting continued through the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials continued to insist that they would win a
majority of seats in the end, but they publicly acknowledged that
for the first time they had misjudged the mood and needs of people
in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and party officials had campaigned heavily on the pledge
that they would make good on their promise to redistribute fertile
land, which is still mostly owned by the tiny white minority here.
They supported the invasions of hundreds of white-owned farms by
black squatters and were widely blamed for condoning a campaign of
intimidation and violence that left at least 26 people dead, most
of them opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the message clearly had little appeal for urban voters, who
had grown weary of fuel shortages, corruption and unfulfilled
promises. And here in the capital and in the second-largest city,
Bulawayo, people flocked in droves to the new party that promised
an improved economy and clean government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not being swept away by these elections, but we're
getting a kind of wake-up call,'' said Jonathan Moyo, the spokesman
for the governing party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front, known as ZANU-PF. ``They're doing better
than I expected them to. It's a reality check for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first results, which had been expected on Monday afternoon,
trickled in slowly last night. In a nation where elections have
been characterized by voter apathy in recent years, about 60
percent of the more than 5.8 million registered voters cast ballots
during the polls on Saturday and Sunday and election officials were
quickly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation waited anxiously, the officials spent hours
checking ballot boxes and ballot slips for any evidence of
tampering or election rigging. Angry young supporters of the
opposition, who waited eagerly for the results outside the office
building of the election directorate here, grumbled suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, observers from the European Union had condemned
Mugabe's party, accusing it of supporting the violence and
intimidation that marred the run up to this weekend's vote. And on
Monday, the government quickly deployed police officers around the
country to prevent any outbreaks of violence and urged the public
to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my appeal that the Zimbabweans continue to be calm,
peaceful as they have displayed during the voting period,'' said
Augustine Chihuri, the national police chief. ``Those ones who win
must win gracefully and not target the losers. Those ones who lose
must accept losing with honor so that they don't spark problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the night reportedly passed peacefully with most
people glued to their television sets and radios, waiting nervously
for the votes to come in. It was the first time since blacks won
majority rule in 1980 that an opposition party had challenged the
governing party in every single district.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the first time in nearly two decades that many voters
had gone to sleep without knowing for sure what the morning's
election result would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long night, a long wait,'' said Ian Makone,
an official in the MDC's election directorate. ``I think a pattern
is emerging. We're going to be very strong in the urban areas. But
it's going to be a nail-biting experience.''

   NEW YORK _ Noontime in Manhattan, and the strap-style T-shirt
brigade was out.
</P>
<P>
   Mali Heled, a 26-year-old doctoral candidate at Cambridge
University in England, was taking a break outside a sandwich shop
across from the New York Public Library, where she had spent the
morning reading James Joyce manuscripts. She wore a flimsy fuchsia
skirt and the sort of white ribbed undershirt one associates with
Arnold Schwarzenegger changing a tire on his Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the library I wear a jean jacket because I like to be a
little more covered,'' Heled said, surveying the many women passing
by in similarly skimpy attire, often with bra straps showing. ``But
out here I think it's perfectly OK to dress like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Bryant Park near Times Square, Nicola Thompson,
25, was catching some sun before heading back to work. Thompson, a
paralegal at a Midtown law firm, was wearing a rose-print dress
with spaghetti straps _ a style that, until the advent of more
casual business dress codes, one might have seen in SoHo on a
weekend but rarely on a Tuesday in Midtown. Thompson said she has
no hesitation about wearing this kind of dress to work, though she
usually covers it with a sweater. ``It's a young law firm _ my boss
is only 33,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of women interviewed on the street, Thompson
suggested that more liberal office dress policies aren't the only
force behind an explosion of tank tops, bare-toe high heels, clingy
skirts and midriff-revealing knits. ``I think American women are
much more comfortable now showing more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It may not come as news to people in the fashion industry, or
even to women who take their cues about modesty and skirt lengths
from television programs like ``Sex and the City,'' but there has
been a conspicuous change in the landscape in the past two summers.
It wasn't all that long ago that such seemingly chaste styles as
sleeveless dresses and open-toe shoes were verboten in most
offices. And as for going without stockings _ that, too, was
something you didn't see except around the offices of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   But like mushrooms after a rain, all these styles are popping up
with a persistence and an elan that suggest a change in the way
women view themselves and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, say retailers and social observers, the attitude
isn't confined to trendy urbanites and runway-ready 20-somethings.
Banana Republic says a stretchy strap-style tank top (with built-in
breast support) is among its most popular looks. Ellen Tracy, a
label for midlevel career women, says its button-down work shirt
cropped to show off the bellybutton is a hit. And the surge of
bare-it fashion is also attracting older women and heavier women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a decided shift to a sexy, glamorous, almost
trashy interpretation of fashion,'' said Connie Marsh, trend and
design manager for Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., whose 860 stores serve
middle-income people across the country. ``Performing best are more
bare items like very plunging necklines on T-shirts or halter
tops.''
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for styles that hug the figure or reveal much of it
is causing a shift in the retail world. American Eagle Outfitters
and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, whose baggy silhouettes made them the cool
shops for teen-agers of the mid-1990s, have suffered a slowdown.
But banner comebacks are being reported at Guess, which grew to
prominence in the 1980s showcasing the curvaceous bodies of Anna
Nicole Smith and Claudia Schiffer in revealing tops and skintight
jeans, and at the Limited, with its streetwise style.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that sexy was this big was the 1970s, but fashion
historians see a big difference between the satin-blouse braless
look popular in the disco era and the styles today. ``Then that
kind of outfit was for partying,'' said Susan Bordo, a humanities
professor at the University of Kentucky who has written several
books on body image. ``Now it has a place in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordo said that popular culture, in particular ``Ally McBeal''
and ``Sex and the City,'' have contributed to the change. ``A
decade ago, the feminist ideal was to have a great career and a
family,'' she said. ``Now the ideal is to have a great career and
dress like a sex kitten, too.''

</P>
<P>
   But in this new era, dressing like a sex kitten does not
necessarily mean wanting to be one. States of public undress do not
connote licentiousness as much as a decade ago. ``The trend toward
skimpiness does not seem to be correlated to sexual liberation the
way it was in the 1960s and '70s,'' said Valerie Steele, a
historian at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing's former signals are disappearing. ``Fashion has lost
its meaning as a signifier,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative
director of Barneys New York. ``Someone can be showing lots of leg
_ it doesn't mean they are a lap dancer, the same way having a
pierced body part no longer means you are an interesting person.
Everyone is doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, dressing sexily is as much about power and entitlement
as about attracting mates. Younger women are moving the
unapologetically sexy look into even the most buttoned-down
corporate suites. Mati Bonetti, 27, recently left a marketing job
at the tobacco giant Philip Morris, where she felt totally at home
wearing capri pants, sheer skirts and mules. Asked what she would
say to a supervisor who questioned her attire, Bonetti, who is
about to start a job at MTV, replied, ``I'd say, `Well, I don't
think I am insulting you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bonetti, who has a graduate business degree from Columbia
University, added, ``You know, a lot of women say to themselves: `I
have an MBA under my belt. I work hard. I don't have to prove
anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   At a big accounting firm, a 22-year-old recruit (who asked not
to be named for fear of repercussions) has been defying the dress
code by wearing sleeveless sweaters, T-shirts in clingy polyester
and knee-high boots. ``I know it might not be 100 percent
appropriate,'' she confessed, ``but I fault those who would judge
me on what I wear.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation's sense that it is fine to look sexy _
very much cultivated by the fashion magazines and retailers _ has
spread to older women and heavier women, who in previous fashion
cycles shied from provocative clothing. ``I never hear shoppers
saying, `This is too young for me,' the way they did a decade
ago,'' said Joe Denofrio, senior vice president of Macy's East.
``Though sometimes I wish we did.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kirna Zabete, a chic SoHo boutique, Beth Shepherd, a
co-owner, said that not long ago a personal shopper requested ``a
little nothing skirt'' for a client, a woman in her late 50s.
Shepherd said she asked if the woman planned to wear a layer under
the see-through garment, and the shopper retorted, ``She doesn't
wear slips.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Lane Bryant, cotton stretch tube tops in bold colors and
Hawaiian prints are emerging as favorites among customers who wear
large sizes. ``They are blowing out the door not only in our small
sizes, 14 and 16,'' said Chris Hansen, the executive vice president
for marketing, ``but across the board, all the way up to sizes 26
and 28.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant applauds the change among its customers. ``It has
taken us four years to move the fashion offering and the confidence
of our shopper to the point where she feels she is deserving of the
same looks as a size 4,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Alderfer, a high school student and an aspiring actress
in Manhattan, described her own shift in size 16 clothes. ``I've
recently gotten into halter tops, because they show off my back,''
she said. ``I've only recently become more comfortable with my body
type, but the reaction is pretty positive. People say, `Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   If the fashion cognoscenti are right, the desire to undress will
not end with hot weather. Style watchers expect an equally
provocative fall. Handkerchief halter tops in cashmere and alpaca
have been ordered by stores in record numbers. Also hot are suede
boots with stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fall and spring 2001, we think sexy will be even bigger,''
said Denofrio of Macy's. ``This fall, leather will be the uniform,
and you are going to see it for men's as well. Forget baggy pants.
The form-fitting rib-neck, stretch pants and leather blazer _ that
will be the uniform.''

BOEING WINS 777-X ORDER FROM EVA AIRWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. notched an important
billion-dollar-plus win Monday for its new 777-X program, and
snatched a potential order away from rival Airbus Industrie in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp., the country's second largest
airline, announced it will be one of the launch customers for the
ultra-long-range Boeing jets known as the 777-300X and 777-200X.
The carrier will buy a mix of 7 of the new jets for delivery
beginning in the fall of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was especially sweet for Boeing. Even though
EVA operates an all-Boeing fleet of 35 planes, the airline had
signaled it might buy new jets from Airbus for the first time to
meet its future long-rage transport needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the airline turned around,'' Seddik Belyamani, Boeing's
executive vice president of commercial airplane sales, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great win for us and a great endorsement of the 777
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus had been pushing hard to sell EVA on its its
ultra-long-range A340-500 and A340-600. EVA had even signed a
letter of intent to buy the Airbus jets, Seddik said.
</P>
<P>
   The A340-500 will compete with the 777-200X and the A340-600
will compete with the 777-300X. The Airbus jets are supposed to
enter service in 2002, a year before the Boeing jets. But Airbus
recently said the program is behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A firm order from EVA for the Airbus planes would have been a
big blow to Boeing, which lost an important bid last year to sell
Taiwan's state-controlled China Airlines a dozen 777s. Instead,
China Airlines signed a $1.8 billion deal for seven Airbus
A340-300s.
</P>
<P>
   EVA is the second customer to publicly announce a launch order
for the 777X planes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines, one of the launch customers for the original
777, said in April that it ordered eight of the 777-300X jets to
replace older 747s on international routes.
</P>
<P>
   EVA will buy four of the -300X models and three of the -200X
models.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced the launch of the two planes in February. They
are targeted for Asian airlines looking for 21st-century widebody
jets that have the range to fly more than 300 passengers non-stop
between Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 301-seat 777-200X will be able to fly up to 10,100 miles
before refueling, and the 359-seat 777-300X will be able to fly up
to 8,314 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has landed around 30 firm orders for both planes worth
more than $5 billion, and has another 15 to 20 orders pending,
according to sources. But JAL and EVA are the only customers to
publicly announce launch orders so far.
</P>
<P>
   Belyamani said he expects three or four more more launch
customers to publicly announce orders before the end of the
Farnborough International air show, which will be held near London
in late July.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much the EVA order is worth, since Boeing
has not yet published the list price for the 777-300X and 777-200X.
</P>
<P>
   The 777-300 has a list price from $167.5 million up to $192.5
million, depending on the configuration and customer options. The
777-200 has a list price from $150 million to $170 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the the 777X planes will certainly be more expensive than
the current versions, the EVA order is probably worth more than $1
billion at list prices. But launch customers typically get big
discounts of as much as 25 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Belyamani would not say how much of a discount Boeing gave EVA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are heavily negotiated,'' he said. ``They took
advantage of their launch-customer status. But it is still a
win-win situation ... We make money and they get a good deal.''

ECUADOR PINS HOPES ON SHIFT TO DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that promises to make one of South America's
lesser-known tourist destinations more appealing to American
visitors, Ecuador, whose attractions include the Galapagos Islands,
spectacular volcanoes and Amazon jungle, is abandoning its
currency, the sucre, in favor of the dollar. Both currencies are in
use at the moment, but the transition to the dollar is expected to
be complete by September. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shift comes after the value of the sucre dropped from 6,200
to the dollar at the beginning of 1999 to 25,000 to the dollar in
January of this year, when dollarization was decreed. That plunge
in value made Ecuador probably the biggest bargain for visitors to
Latin America, a distinction it is likely to retain for the
foreseeable future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the drastic devaluation that occurred in the
year leading up to dollarization, the price of our packages was
reduced 15 to 20 percent,'' said Pablo Burbano, president of
Metropolitan Touring, a leading travel agency in Quito, the
Ecuadorean capital. ``The dollar goes a long way here, and even
though dollarization means things will get a little more expensive,
we are going to continue to be a cheap destination for the next few
years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For American tourists, the new system simplifies typical tourist
transactions. ``Visitors are not going to have to worry anymore
about changing money or things like what the commission is on
traveler's checks compared to cash,'' said Maria Carmen Granizo,
president of the Ecuadorean Association of Tourism Companies, a
trade group. ``All they need to do is bring their dollars and use
them directly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador is not the first country in Latin America to adopt the
dollar as its national currency. Panama did so soon after gaining
its independence from Colombia in 1903, and Argentina in recent
years has maintained the peso at a one-to-one parity with the
dollar; the two currencies can be used almost interchangeably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in Ecuador, an Andean country of 12.5 million people
notorious for its political and economic volatility, the shift to
the dollar has proved controversial. Undertaken in hopes of
providing stability, the change had barely been announced when a
military coup overthrew President Jamil Mahuad. Dollarization
protests by Indian and labor groups continue, but there has been no
reported hostility toward American visitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One consistent complaint of dollarization opponents, somewhat
odd coming from people who are used to calculating prices in
multiples of 10,000, is that the new system is too complicated and
hard to use. There has also been a spurt of inflation, as stores
and businesses round prices up to the nearest dollar, but that is
expected to abate soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, because we did not have a strong currency, we
were always having to change prices and our interest rates were
very high, which discouraged investors,'' said Rocio Vazquez,
minister of tourism and environment. ``Our prices have always been
competitive, but now we think we can also compete with the quality
of our product,'' he said, and attract, for example, more
international hotel chains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that Ecuador's domestic tourist industry
will have to adjust. Most leading hotels were already billing
customers in dollars, based on the exchange rate of the day, to
protect themselves from currency fluctuations and thus are likely
to be unaffected. But for tour operators, the new system will
require more efficiency and foster greater competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the exchange rate has always been used as a
cushion against any unforeseen problems or costs,'' Granizo said.
``If the exchange rate was 15,000 today, you knew it was going to
be 18,000 tomorrow, so you were protected if, for instance, you had
to suddenly contract an extra bus at the last moment. But that
buffer has now disappeared.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another result of dollarization is that Ecuador is likely to
make a greater effort to draw American visitors to a country that
is only a four-hour flight from Miami. In the past, tourism efforts
have focused much more on Europe, to the extent that, according to
the Ecuadorean Embassy in Washington, Ecuador does not currently
even have a tourism information and promotion office in the United
States. But Ecuador's tour operators are planning what they call a
caravan to visit the United States later this year to promote
all-inclusive and other packages aimed at the American market. Of
the 508,000 tourists who visited Ecuador in 1999, down slightly
from 1998, barely one third were from the United States, and many
of those came to study Spanish in low-budget exchange programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the atmosphere of social agitation our country
experienced, our image abroad was hurt,'' Vazquez said. ``But to
the extent that the economy stabilizes as the dollarization plan is
implemented, we expect that the flows of visitors and of capital
will resume.''

SUPREME COURT REAFFIRMS MIRANDA DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS, SCOTUS-PRIMARY, SCOTUS-HATE-CRIME) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Miranda decision
Monday by a 7-2 vote that erased a shadow over one of the most
famous rulings of modern times and acknowledged that the Miranda
warnings ``have become part of our national culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said in an opinion by Chief Justice William Rehnquist
that because the 1966 Miranda decision ``announced a constitutional
rule,'' a statute by which Congress had sought to overrule the
decision was itself unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda had appeared to be in jeopardy, both because of that
long-ignored but recently rediscovered law, by which Congress had
tried to overrule Miranda 32 years ago, and because of the court's
perceived hostility to the original decision.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice said, though, that the 1968 law, which
replaced the well-known Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test
of whether a confession was voluntary, could be upheld only if the
Supreme Court decided to overturn Miranda. But with Miranda having
``become embedded in routine police practice'' without causing any
measurable difficulty for prosecutors, there was no justification
for doing so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas cast the dissenting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the federal
appeals court in Richmond, Va., which held that Congress was
entitled to the last word because Miranda's presumption that a
confession was not voluntary unless preceded by the warnings was
not required by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday _ only 14 pages long, in Rehnquist's
typically spare style _ brought an abrupt end to one of the odder
episodes in the court's recent history, an intense and strangely
delayed refighting of a previous generation's battle over the
rights of criminal suspects. Miranda vs. Arizona was a hallmark of
the Warren Court, and Rehnquist, despite his record as an early and
tenacious critic of the decision, evidently did not want its
repudiation to be an imprint of his own tenure.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable drama in the courtroom Monday as the
chief justice announced that he would deliver the decision in the
case, Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525. The announcement
meant that he was the majority opinion's author. Given his
statements over more than 25 years about Miranda's lack of
constitutional foundation, there was the distinct possibility that
he was about to announce that Miranda was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   The way Rehnquist chose to begin his announcement did little to
clarify matters. ``You have the right to remain silent,'' he
intoned in a firm voice, moving on to the other familiar warnings
without further introduction. Some in the courtroom audience
wondered whether they might be hearing these phrases as the
official words of the court for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the chief justice finished delivering his opinion,
there was no ringing endorsement of Miranda, but the message was
clear: ``Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoning and
its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the first
instance,'' he said, ``the principles of stare decisis weigh
heavily against overruling it now.'' The Latin phrase, meaning ``to
stand by things decided,'' is the court's standard reference for
the doctrine of adherence to precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Both in his courtroom announcement and in his written opinion,
Rehnquist made only passing reference to a series of opinions
throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s suggesting that Miranda was not
itself embedded directly in the Constitution but was rather just a
``prophylactic'' effort to protect the underlying Fifth Amendment
right against compelled self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One of his own early opinions, Michigan vs. Tucker in 1974, said
the ``procedural safeguards'' adopted in Miranda ``were not
themselves rights protected by the Constitution'' _ a quotation
that Scalia flung back at the chief justice in his bitter
dissenting opinion Monday. These post-Miranda decisions permitted
prosecutors to use statements obtained in violation of Miranda to
impeach a defendant's credibility or for other purposes beyond the
prosecution's direct case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions illustrate the principle _ not that Miranda is
not a constitutional rule _ but that no constitutional rule is
immutable,'' Rehnquist said, describing the ``modifications
represented by these cases'' as ``a normal part of constitutional
law.''
</P>
<P>
   In his stinging dissent, which Thomas joined, Scalia accused the
majority of playing intellectually dishonest ``word games'' to
justify going beyond the court's authority to apply the
Constitution's commands. He said: ``Since there is in fact no other
principle that can reconcile today's judgment with the post-Miranda
cases that the court refuses to abandon, what today's decision will
stand for, whether the justices can bring themselves to say it or
not, is the power of the Supreme court to write a prophylactic,
extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a vindication for the Clinton administration,
and particularly for Attorney General Janet Reno. In the face of
opposition from parts of her law enforcement constituency within
the Justice Department, she put the department on the side of an
indicted bank robber in arguing that Miranda was a statement of
constitutional law and that the 1968 statute, known as Section
3501, was not a valid exercise of congressional authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision recognizes Miranda has been good for law
enforcement,'' the attorney general said Monday, adding: ``Most
importantly, it will continue to provide a public sense of fairness
in our criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer
joined the chief justice's majority opinion. There were no separate
concurring opinions, a rare expression of unanimity among the
majority in a major case.
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything else, the decision reflected the court's
deep suspicion, expressed in several recent decisions, of
congressional incursions into the realm of constitutional
law-making that the justices regard as reserved for the court
alone. In this, the decision was reminiscent of the 1992 decision
that reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion, joined by
justices who might well not have voted for Roe vs. Wade in 1973 as
an original matter but who thought the court would weaken itself by
repudiating the precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The validity of the 32-year-old law had not come before the
court until now because no administration, of either party, sought
to apply it. Section 3501 was injected into the case against
Charles T. Dickerson, accused of participating in a 1997 bank
robbery in Alexandria, Va., by a career federal prosecutor who
asked the U.S. District Court there to use the law to admit
incriminating statements that Dickerson had given in the absence of
Miranda warnings. The court refused, and the Justice Department
would not permit Section 3501 to be pressed on appeal. A
conservative legal organization here, the Washington Legal
Foundation, won permission to make the argument as a friend of the
court from the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which admitted
the confession and accused the department of abdicating its
responsibility.

   Q. Will there be events in England to celebrate the publication
of the fourth Harry Potter book? _ Ivan S. Moughton, St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. There will be quite a bit of fanfare for J.K. Rowling's new
book about the adventures of Harry Potter, the young wizard who has
generated such a frenzy among younger readers. However, precise
details of the events are surrounded by mystery. Even the title of
the book will not be officially revealed until July 8, the day of
publication. That is also when a three-day celebratory train tour
is scheduled to begin. Bloomsbury, the publisher of the book and
the organizer of the tour, will not reveal details about the
train's route and related events until later this week. A
spokeswoman suggests that you watch the company's Web site,
www.bloomsbury.com.
</P>
<P>
   The steam train, painted red and named the Hogwarts Express
(from the train that is featured in the Harry Potter books) will
leave London with J.K. Rowling on board and will travel between
London and Scotland on July 8, 9, and 10, with stops for
book-signing events along the way.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, 18 and 19 the author will sign books in stores
around London and in Brighton, on the south coast of England. On
July 17, Rowling will make an appearance at Harrods between 9 and
11 a.m; tickets will be given to the first 750 people to enter the
store at door No. 5 in Hans Crescent. Between 1 and 2 p.m., Rowling
will read and autograph books at Waterstones in Piccadilly. Tickets
for this event are also limited and must be won in a competition at
the shop on July 8 between 8:30 a.m. and 11 p.m. Entrants, 17 years
old and under, must answer three Harry Potter-related questions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brest for Families
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Brest with my wife and sons (14-year-old twins)
for a few days and would like information on activities that will
appeal to all of us. _ Larry M. Silverten, Hartford  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Brest, on Brittany's Atlantic coast, is one of the most
important military and commercial ports in France. While little
remains of the old city center, which was bombed during World War
II, there are many activities for tourists of all ages, most of
them related to Brest's status as a maritime hub.
</P>
<P>
   The recently expanded and renovated aquarium Oceanopolis, with
its three large pavilions recreating tropical, temperate and polar
ecosystems, is modeled on the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California.
The complex, about 10 minutes from the center of Brest, also houses
several restaurants with ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $13 (calculated at a
rate of 6.9 francs to the dollar); $10.15 for children 4 to 12
years old. Information: (33-2) 98.34.40.40; www.oceanopolis.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another place worth visiting is the Maritime Museum, housed in a
portion of the Chateau de Brest, a medieval fortress overlooking
the harbor. The museum focuses on the history of Brest and its
port, through maps, boat models, paintings and sculptures. A walk
between the chateau's towers and outer walls provides panoramic
views of the coast and the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Admission is
$4.20, $2.60 for children under 18. Information: (33-2)
98.22.12.39.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies offer boat tours around Brest. These vary from
one-day excursions to overnight cruises, and all are suitable for
families and English speakers. One option is aboard La Recouvrance,
a replica of an early 20th-century military schooner. The boat has
different itineraries of varying lengths. Information and
reservations: (33-2) 98.33.95.40.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame de Rumengol, a boat built in 1945 to transport sand,
has been renovated and converted into a tourist boat and was
classified a historic monument by the French government in 1990.
Smaller than La Recouvrance, this boat tours not only the coast and
harbor of Brest but also several nearby rivers, stopping at small
fishing ports along the way. Adults $26, children under 18, $15.20.
Information: (33-2) 98.20.06.58.

MLS TO REVIEW SPITTING ACCUSATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Mexican striker Luis Hernandez's tenure with the
Galaxy took another strange turn Saturday night when Kansas City
Wizards defender Matt McKeon alleged Hernandez spit on him
following the Wizards' 2-0 victory in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer officials said Monday they will review the
incident this afternoon and decide whether a suspension is in
order. The Galaxy visits defending MLS champion D.C. United on
Wednesday, then travels to meet Dallas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spit on me three times and then when (teammate) Chris
(Klein) came over, he spit on me again,'' McKeon told reporters
after match. ``You can't do that in this league. He has no respect
for the American players. There's no need for that. That's a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Wizards players claim they saw Hernandez spit on McKeon,
but Hernandez said afterward he couldn't remember spitting on anyo
``Words are one thing, but the spitting is another,'' K.C.
goalkeeper Tony Meola said. ``I hope we're in for more soccer from
him and less of that other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid remembers the incident differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at the tape; the only thing I can see is Klein
throwing an elbow at Luis as he stepped between Luis and Matt,''
Schmid said Monday by telephone. ``There was just a lot of
frustration involved. I don't know about the spitting. Luis said he
didn't spit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Machnik, vice president of MLS game operations, has reviewed
videotape of the incident but could not confirm that Hernandez spit
on McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see players milling around, then the camera breaks away
and comes back after 15 or 20 seconds and players are still milling
around,'' said Machnik. ``Looking at it the first time, I didn't
see anything on that particular tape that showed Hernandez
spitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and McKeon were clearly arguing at close range.
Hernandez's head jerked forward, but there was no video evidence
that he spit on McKeon. However, he might have unintentionally spit
on McKeon while the two shouted at each other.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Machnik said the incident would be reviewed today
with MLS commissioner Don Garber and MLS executive vice president
Ivan Gazidis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's still an alleged spitting incident,'' said
Machnik. ``I imagine that we will interview several players and
gather information. Certainly, if it happened, the league would
consider it a very bad thing and a serious offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, MLS handed down the biggest fine and
suspension in league history. San Jose striker Khodadad Azizi was
suspended three games and fined $7,000 after shoving a referee.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, acquired last month from Tigres of the Mexican First
Division, has already been called a $4 million flop by an MLS
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hernandez's arrival, the Galaxy was cruising along,
unbeaten at 5-0-5. After Saturday's loss, the team dropped to 2-4-2
with Hernandez and 7-4-7 overall. The two-time Mexican scoring
champion and league MVP is without a goal or assist and is not
making friends with his MLS rivals.

WARNACO FILES COUNTERSUIT AGAINST CALVIN KLEIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Warnaco Group Inc. answered a lawsuit by Calvin Klein
Inc. by filing its own set of unusually personal charges against
the designer and his namesake company Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco, which makes underwear and jeanswear under the Calvin
Klein label, is seeking nearly $1 billion in damages from Calvin
Klein Inc. and the designer. The complaints against the company
include defamation, breach of good faith and interference with its
business practices. Warnaco is also claiming Klein was essentially
absent at the helm of his company and that his lack of direction
hurt its jeanswear business. In addition, Warnaco is suing Klein
himself, claiming that he defamed the company with ``malicious
public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, Linda J. Wachner, Warnaco's chief
executive, said her company was forced into the suit to protect its
reputation and the Klein trademarks, which are a valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warnaco is acting on behalf of its shareholders to protect its
business interests as well as its co-ownership of the Calvin Klein
trademarks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As of 5 p.m. Monday, Calvin Klein said it had not seen the suit.
But in response to a statement by Warnaco, the company said,
``Warnaco's announcement is a thinly veiled attempt to divert
attention from the fact that Warnaco has been systematically
violating its agreements with Calvin Klein Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their business goals, the suit and countersuit have
taken on a personal tinge. Last month, Klein surprised the fashion
world by seeking to end his relationship with Warnaco, his largest
licensee, accounting for roughly 40 percent of Calvin Klein Inc.'s
estimated $160 million in annual design and royalty fees, the
overwhelming bulk of Calvin Klein's revenue. Klein accused Warnaco
and Wachner of willfully ``diluting'' the quality of his brand by
distributing merchandise in unauthorized channels like Costco and
B.J.'s Wholesale Club. He also accused Wachner of being
unprofessional and abusive.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not have been worse for Wachner. The chief
executive was already under pressure from at least one irate
investor because Warnaco, which also makes underwear and clothing
under numerous names besides Calvin Klein's, had repeatedly missed
earnings estimates, and its stock has been in decline for almost a
year. The Klein suit pushed down the stock to a new low of under $7
a share, though it gained 18.75 cents Monday to close at $7.1875.
Soon after the suit, one of the company's biggest shareholders sent
a scathing letter to Warnaco's board saying that Wachner was to
blame for the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   To make his case, Klein appeared on Larry King Live soon after
filing his suit and criticized Wachner and her company.
</P>
<P>
   Wachner filed a motion to have the Klein suit dismissed, but has
been biding her time for a response until filing the countersuit
with the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Warnaco complaint has two parts. In the first part, Warnaco
asserts its right to distribute products in any venue that has
products consistent with ``the reputation, image and prestige'' of
the Calvin Klein brand and insists that the warehouse clubs meet
these criteria because they ``showcase some of the world's most
prestigious brands.'' The lawsuit includes copies of Costco Web
pages showing items from such luxury brands as Coach, Prada, Gucci
and Baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   In part two of the suit, Warnaco accuses Klein of using the law
suit to ``wrest control of the lucrative Calvin Klein trademarks''
to make the company more attractive to prospective acquirers. Last
October, Klein and his long-time partner, Barry Schwartz, engaged
the investment firm of Lazard Freres to find a buyer for their
private company. Though several companies perused the books _
including Tommy Hilfiger Inc., Liz Claiborne and Warnaco _ none
were apparently willing to meet Klein's minimum asking price, said
to be $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco also accuses Klein of a ``vicious public relations
campaign'' to regain control of the licenses. On Larry King Live,
he told a seemingly surprised host that the quality of Calvin Klein
jeanswear now in stores had been ``compromised'' and much of the
merchandise was ``not up to standards.'' The Warnaco suit calls
these statements ``deliberately false and malicious'' and
identified them as among the sources of their trade libel claim.
</P>
<P>
   The apparel manufacturer further alleges that these statements
have already hurt its business, most specifically by scuttling a
contract to produce almost $400,000 of Calvin Klein jeanswear
business for a Canadian retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most curious of all, Warnaco accuses Klein of abandoning
his responsibility to design new jeans. `` Klein apparently no
longer has any personal involvement in the design of the products
that bear his name,'' the Warnaco suit states. ``Indeed, since
September 1999, Klein has not attended a single regularly scheduled
design meeting. Instead, he has surrendered his responsibilities to
a constantly changing cadre of low-level inexperienced designers.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Klein denied the charges. ``Calvin Klein
actively sets the design philosophy and direction and has an
accomplished design team in tune with that philosophy to execute on
the direction,'' the company spokesman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is not expected to help Warnaco's standing with
investors in the short run. ``In the near term, it is going to be a
distraction,'' said Harvey Robinson, an apparel analyst with the
Baltimore-based Chapman Co. ``It will not help the stock.''

GERALD J. WHITROW, AUTHOR OF PHILOSOPHIC TOMES ON TIME, DIES AT
87 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Russia)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald J. Whitrow, a mathematician and philosopher who devoted
much of his life to pondering the nature of time, died on June 2 in
London. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He was fond of telling a story about the Russian poet Samuel
Marshak visiting London before 1914. His English was imperfect, and
he asked a man in the street, ``Please, what is time?''
</P>
<P>
   The passer-by answered: ``That's a big question. Why ask me?''
</P>
<P>
   Whitrow himself did not have an absolute answer to the question,
which bridges disciplines from mathematics to cosmology to biology,
history and psychology. But by combining prodigious scholarship
from the ancient Greeks to modern physicists, he argued
persuasively in more than 100 academic papers and a string of books
that an integrated, interdisciplinary understanding of time should
be possible.
</P>
<P>
   But can time be said to have a beginning, a direction and an
end? His assiduous scholarship suggested that the answer might
depend on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of his most influential book, ``The Nature of
Time,'' published by Nelson in 1961 and Oxford in 1980, was that a
concept of time is fundamentally necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He said time was not ``a mysterious illusion of the intellect.''
Rather, he declared, ``It is an essential feature of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Whitrow was invited to serve as the first president of
the newly founded International Society for the Study of Time,
which tries to provide a framework for interdisciplinary
discussions of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of that group, J.T. Fraser, said Whitrow had
``demonstrated that, even in our epoch of immense amounts of
interesting but fragmented scientific understanding and humanistic
insights, it is possible to filter all major ideas about time
through the mind of a single person _ and produce an elegant and
brilliantly clear survey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald James Whitrow was born in Dorset. When he was 4, the
family moved to London. Though they were poor, he won a series of
scholarships, including one to Christ Church College, Oxford, where
he won highest honors in mathematics. At 24 he was named a lecturer
in mathematics, a feat so prodigious that it prompted an article in
The Daily Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   His doctoral thesis at Christ Church concerned kinematic
relativity, a subject created by his adviser, E.A. Milne, and
derived from Einstein. It uses the discipline of cosmology to deal
with the motions of objects.
</P>
<P>
   From that work he moved on to studying the philosophy and
mathematics of time and motion. The first of his 10 books was ``The
Structure of the Universe'' in 1949, and the last was ``Time in
History'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his musings could be simultaneously provocative and
playful. In ``The Nature of Time,'' he noted that the Stoic
philosophers of ancient Greece believed that the planets
periodically return to the same relative positions they occupied at
the beginning of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars again move in their orbits, each performing its
revolution in the former period, without variation.'' he wrote.
``Socrates and Plato and each individual man will live again, with
the same friends and fellow citizens. They will go through the same
experiences and the same activities. Every city and village and
field will be restored, just as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this restoration of the universe takes place not only
once, but over and over again _ indeed, until all eternity without
end.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he worked for the Ministry of Supply,
researching ballistics. His apartment in Cambridge was bombed and
his landlady was killed. In timely fashion, he was away when the
attack happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 he was appointed a lecturer at Imperial College of
Science and Technology in London, where he remained for the rest of
his career. He lived in Wimbledon, was active in London academic
society and clubs and loved opera.
</P>
<P>
   Whitrow is survived by his wife of 53 years, Magda.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his clear, booming voice, he was frequently heard on
the radio. Friends love to tell of the time he gave three talks on
the nature of time for the British Broadcasting Corp., only to have
them broadcast in the wrong order. They had to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Whitrow came across as the proverbial dignified Englishman.
Fraser tells of the time a famous speaker did not turn up, and
those waiting for him grumbled, but not Whitrow. ``He simply
remarked, `Some people have no manners,''' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had a wry sense of humor. He liked to recall the
time he mentioned his friend Karl Popper, the philosopher, at a
party, saying, ``I am going to see Popper tomorrow.'' A guest
replied, ``Good heavens, is your father still alive?''

REPORT SCOLDS WORLD BANK FOR APPROVING FUNDS FOR TIBET FARMERS'
RELOCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER AND JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a scathing internal assessment, a World Bank
inquiry has found that the bank violated its rules when it approved
a Chinese antipoverty plan that would have involved relocating
58,000 farmers on the edge of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The project raised a storm of protest last year from
environmental and human rights groups. Those groups contended that
the bank was aiding China's effort to dilute the minority Tibetan
population, which the Communist leadership has long regarded as a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bank plan, $40 million would be spent to relocate some
of China's poorest farmers to more fertile land, outside Tibet's
boundaries. A result would be to put ethnic Han Chinese farmers
into Qinghai, territory that Tibetans consider part of their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet who was
born in the resettlement region, met President Clinton last week.
After the meeting, he said that the bank initiative ``would be a
source of more problems'' and that the project should not proceed
for the present.
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments over the project have quickly expanded beyond
questions of Tibet, becoming a test of whether the World Bank is
sufficiently sensitive to the political and social ramifications of
some of its projects.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the project pitted James Wolfensohn, the
politically savvy president of the bank, against the Clinton
administration, which recently re-appointed him to his post while
declaring its opposition to the China project.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn suspended a part of the project last year, referring
the dispute to an internal ``inspection panel,'' after the United
States, Germany and a few other nations charged that the entire
program had been mishandled within the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank planned to release the result of its harshly-worded
report last week, but decided against releasing it at the last
moment. A copy of the 160-page document was provided Monday to The
New York Times by sources hostile to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The report refers repeatedly to ``confusion'' among the bank's
staff, which seemed unable to agree on what standards to use in
judging the project's effects. The report also describes a
``disturbingly wide range of divergent and, often, opposing views''
on how the bank should interpret its own policies on handling
environmental and social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested, without quite saying, that the bank bent its rules
to accommodate China's leaders, who wanted to borrow millions of
dollars for the project interest-free under a program for
underdeveloped nations. The project was approved last year just
days before China's eligibility for those loans permanently expired
because of its rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the huge bank has been accused
of ignoring its own rules to bend to the wishes of a major client.
Another internal report, more than a year ago, concluded that the
bank overlooked the corruption of former President Suharto's regime
in Indonesia, another major client of the international lender.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical element of the new report was its conclusion
that the bank never seriously considered alternative locations for
the farmers _ locations that would not raise the sensitive
political questions of whether the bank was helping China's leaders
dilute the concentration of Tibetans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The board's report prompted a sharp response from Wolfensohn in
a private letter to members of the World Bank's board. He argued
that the bank's guidelines for assessing projects like this one are
not hard and fast. The inspection panel, he wrote, is trying to
``push the bank in the direction of a literal and mechanistic
interpretation of its rules.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton administration officials view the inspection
report as a vindication of their views, bank officials said the
inspection panel's heavy-handed criticism sounded similar to
complaints about the project registered repeatedly by private
charity and activist groups. ``The panel is out to change the bank
and this was a stalking horse,'' said one bank official, who asked
to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank board is scheduled to decide July 6 whether to
authorize a new, 15-month, $2 million study into the environmental
and ethnic impacts of the resettlement, exploring many of the
issues raised in the inspection panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Stephens, the bank's spokesman for Asia, said the panel
made several valid observations about oversights in the way the
bank handled the resettlement project. He said that bank officials
now agree that they should have classified the resettlement project
as requiring a higher level of environmental scrutiny than they did
originally. Bank officials also did an arguably poor job of
assessing the ethnic impact of the project, Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were clearly areas in the surveys that did not give
confidence that the results were reliable,'' he said. `These were
judgment calls and they made some errors.`

 &HT;    Government proposal changes 65-year old rules for truckers
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you think America owes much of its current
prosperity to industry's fabled ``just-in-time'' system of
flawlessly choreographed shippers, suppliers and stores, think
again, says Brent Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   He and other truckers say the nation's supply chain of
last-minute deliveries and minimal inventories _ touted by
economists as one of the nation's major productivity advances in
decades _ is actually built on a foundation of countless wasted
hours of waiting and unpaid labor by truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a waiting game,'' says Perkins, who was headed
for Kent, Wash., last week with his wife and driving partner,
Kathleen Perkins, and a load of carpet.
</P>
<P>
   They had just spent the night waiting with 20 other truckers in
a parking lot in Dalton, Ga., to pick up loads.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said he and his wife, team drivers for Kennesaw
Transportation Inc., also had waited 10 hours the previous day for
their trailer to be unloaded at Publix Super Markets' warehouse
near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And while those hours of waiting generally don't cost Publix or
other shippers a penny, they do extract a heavy cost along
America's highways. About 755 deaths and almost 20,000 injuries per
year result from accidents involving fatigued truckers, researchers
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   They say truckers, who are paid by the mile, not by the hour,
routinely violate federal duty hour limits to make up for time lost
on waiting or loading and unloading.
</P>
<P>
   The recently minted Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
hopes to force truckers and shippers to clean up their acts by
retooling the Transportation Department's 65-year-old ``hours of
service'' rules controlling how long truckers can work and drive
each day before resting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's proposal, announced in April, will
be the subject of a public ``listening session'' at the Atlanta
South Truck Stop in Jackson on Thursday and Friday. The public has
until Oct. 30 to comment on the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would, among other things, put drivers' work and
rest periods on a 24-hour day to better fit human sleep cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also would do away with an abused system where
drivers currently record their work time in log books. Instead, the
logs would be replaced with onboard electronic recorders to track
when regional and long-haul drivers are actually driving.
</P>
<P>
   The feds hope the new rules will eliminate about 115 fatalities
and almost 3,000 injuries annually from fatigue-related truck
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules are a strong message from the federal
government that trucking companies ``have to reform their own
shop,'' says Gerald Donaldson, senior research director for the
insurance industry-supported Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
He says three-fourths of long-distance truckers violate the current
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a completely pervasive scofflaw culture out there,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed regulation already is losing some air; critics
from both industry and highway safety groups have knifed about half
of the proposal's tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted earlier this month to block funding to
implement the new regulations, but the issue will come up again
when a conference committee considers the House and Senate versions
of the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Safety advocates praise the proposed regulation's call for
electronic monitoring. But they also say the proposal is flawed by
ignoring its own fatigue research. The new rules would allow
truckers to drive 12 hours without a break _ two hours longer than
the current rules allow _ despite research showing the risk of a
fatigue-related crash rises dramatically after 10 hours of driving.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Izer knows well what happens when drivers push too long.
</P>
<P>
   Her 17-year-old son and three friends were run over and killed
in 1993 by a truck driver who apparently had fallen asleep behind
the wheel after working illegally long hours and keeping a
fraudulent log book. She founded Parents Against Tired Truckers in
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatigue is the No. 1 problem in the industry,'' she says. But
it's an under-reported cause of truck-car collisions , she adds,
because truck drivers are far more likely than other drivers to
survive to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who plans to speak at the hearing this week in Georgia,
says he doesn't see how the proposed regulations will solve the
fatigue problem.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the truck isn't moving, he says, the ``black boxes''
to monitor drivers won't be able to distinguish when drivers are
resting or when they're still working, but not driving, such as
loading their trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he says, the new rules would cut his and his wife's
incomes by thousands of dollars per month and often strand them far
from home during mandatory two-day rest periods each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to shut down a lot of trucks,'' he says,
when drivers are forced to take longer rest breaks each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's going to affect is drawing people into the industry.
Can they make as much money as they made before?'' asks Andrew
Flanagan, vice president of Kennesaw.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 120 mostly husband-wife teams to
shuttle carpet and produce between the West Coast and Georgia in
refrigerated trucks, also would have to buy more trucks, hire more
drivers and raise its rates if the proposed regulations take
effect, he says.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service is likewise concerned it would risk
violating the proposed rules during the Christmas rush, when its
delivery drivers routinely work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody that has a higher commitment to safety than
us,'' says Norman Black, a UPS spokesman. ``(But) on first blush,
we are not seeing any flexibility here to recognize special
situations like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Associations says the federal proposal
would raise shipping costs by billions of dollars and put at least
100,000 more trucks and drivers _ already in short supply _ on the
road to replace those on rest breaks. The industry group estimates
that trucking companies already are short 80,000 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But safety advocates counter that the trucking companies' dire
predictions are overblown. The solution to the fatigue issue, heavy
driver turnover, and short capacity, they say, is sitting under the
industry's nose _ in clogged warehouse parking lots across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible amount of productive time that's going
down the rat hole right now,'' says Donaldson, as truckers rush to
meet rigid delivery deadlines, then wait, and wait some more.
</P>
<P>
   Counting driving, waiting and loading time, he says, truck
drivers routinely work 3,000-4,000 hours a year vs. about 2,000 for
the typical office worker.
</P>
<P>
   About a fourth of that is wasted time ``sitting around waiting
for loads,'' he says. If unproductive time were reduced 25 percent,
no new trucks or drivers would be needed, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   Kennesaw's Perkins agrees that many drivers are working _ but
not logging _ many long days of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, truckers are allowed to drive up to 10
hours and spend up to 15 hours on duty before they must take an
8-hour break. They must take a 24-hour break after accumulating 60
hours on duty in seven days or 70 hours in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would require most drivers to be off 12 hours out
of 24. But most long-haul drivers now routinely work up to 125
hours a week if you count the time they spend waiting near a
warehouse to be called to a dock, says Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife make about $40,000 each per year. They haul
carpet out west from Georgia, and meat and produce from California
and Washington back to Georgia, making several round trips per
month.
</P>
<P>
   But in between each load, they must wait, half-sleeping and
half-listening to the radio until their truck is called to be
loaded or unloaded. Drivers often have to load trailers themselves
or hire ``lumpers'' to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be sitting up all day long monitoring that CB (radio),
then you drive all night long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is paid 40 cents a mile. He generally isn't paid for
roughly 40 hours per week he spends waiting, loading or unloading,
though much of that time is supposed to be logged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find anybody that logs that waiting
time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers, especially owner-operators with truck loans to pay,
have little bargaining power compared to shippers like Wal-Mart or
Ford Motor Co. They are now the biggest dispensers of time in
so-called ``just in time'' distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they are held hostage to shippers and receivers,''
says Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   One of trucker drivers' protections disappeared in 1962, he
explains, when federal regulations that tied truckers' working
hours to a 24-hour day were replaced with the current 10 hours on,
8 hours off schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which deregulated the
trucking industry, ``raised the ante for truckers to remain
competitive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty of deregulation that helped create today's marathon
truckers, he says, was the fading away of ``detention'' penalties
that shippers had to pay if they made truck drivers wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring the shippers explicitly under the
sanctions,'' he argues.
</P>
<P>
   The Truckload Carriers Association, a trade group for regional
and long-haul trucking firms, is trying to jawbone shippers into
cutting waiting times to two hours. Their surveys show their
drivers average more than 40 hours a week of waiting, loading and
unloading time.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations likewise pressure trucking firms to
wring out inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's out of carriers' hands. They can't do it by
themselves,'' says Robert Rothstein, general counsel for the
association. ``A lot of the time, they don't have the bargaining
power.''

ON THE IOWA PRAIRIE,   A REAL RIVER CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Editors: the 3rd take is a 350-word information box.) (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prof. Harold Hill is back on Broadway, flashing $8 million worth
of smile and what Meredith Willson termed his calling card of a
suitcase. Nightly, the ``bang beat bell-ringin'
ever'-time-a-bull's-eye salesman'' dissolves into a lovesick puppy
as theatergoers wallow unashamedly in the old-time corn-pone
verities.
</P>
<P>
   Today's message: It isn't all make-believe. Out in the heart of
what Willson called the ``hailstone and sarsaparilla belt'' exists
the real River City. Its true name is Mason City, Iowa, and it is
indeed a place of marching bands, barbershop quartets and dandy ice
cream parlors. But it is more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mason City, where Willson was born in 1902, has transformed his
boyhood home into a Victorian gem, put a collapsing Frank Lloyd
Wright house back together and plans to restore a Wright bank and
hotel. Beyond Wright, it boasts one of the nation's finest
collections of Prairie School architecture in an achingly
picturesque, if slightly too arboreal, setting. What's more, the
town's museum of antique trucks is nothing to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly charming attraction is the largest collection of
puppets made by Bil Baird, another native son. Local lore has it
that he gave the ``l'' in his first name to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   Mason City (population 29,040) is a few miles east of Interstate
35 about halfway between Minneapolis and Des Moines, and, truth to
tell, represents nothing so much as a failed dream. Mason City was
a big-thinking burg that figured it might be the next Chicago. As a
local history book published in 1911 put it, the then 60-year-old
dot in Iowa's rolling prairie amounted to ``the most important town
in a wide belt of the country extending from the Great Lakes to
where the Golden Sands of our Western Coast receive the waves of
the Great South Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time ``The Music Man'' is set, the early 1900s, Mason
City had five rail lines, four newspapers and four vaudeville
houses. Local banks had assets of over a million dollars and, in
the 1930s, would be paid the high compliment of a visit by John
Dillinger's gang, which robbed the largest of $52,000.
</P>
<P>
   This bountiful sense of significance explains why Wright and
people like Walter Burley Griffin working in the same direction _ a
genuinely new American architecture _ were invited to build things.
It was reflected in an emphatically middle-class appearance, from
picket fences to the ample, instrument-filled home of Willson's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the tranquil, timeless part of Mason City is now
surrounded by strip malls, Wal-Mart and its imitations and enough
fast-food joints to choke a teen-ager. There is no passenger train
to the town anymore, though there is talk of revving up the
putt-putt electric trolley that once ran to neighboring Clear Lake
(it has occasionally been run for shorter distances). But the rosy
vision of ``The Music Man'' resonates still in the footbridge
across Willow Creek (alas, many times modified) and the stately
oaks presiding over squeaky-clean streets.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that America turned out differently from the
dreamers' dreams. Chicago remained Chicago. But there are moments,
particularly around twilight, when time seems to have stalled in
Mason City, Iowa. It is almost possible to think it stopped
entirely in 1912, the year of ``The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is strongest in the summer when most visitors come:
it has been a generation since disease killed the elms, but green
canopies again blanket the streets, and cars with license plates
from any number of states prowl about. In July and August, Mason
City is hot and humid and feels like a destination.
</P>
<P>
   The Willson house, which was built in 1895, is suffused with
light from expansive windows, a few of them stained glass. People
have always wandered by to take a look, but five years ago it was
acquired by a local foundation and opened to the public from May
until October, otherwise by special appointment. What made our tour
special was the lively commentary of Caralee Miller, one of 30
docents.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Meredith's cradle, covered with the quilt his
grandmother made. We learn that at 14{ pounds he was the biggest
baby born in the county for many years afterward. We learn that his
mother, Rosalie, taught the town's first kindergarten class in her
home. We learn that Meredith, the third child, had a sister, Dixie,
who taught herself to play the harp in two weeks so she could give
a recital at the Congregational Church. She later joined the circus
and wrote a good book about her elephant-riding experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments, many of which actually belonged to the family, are
scattered about. The calendar is stuck forever on January 1912.
There is evidence of Meredith's ultimate achievement on a
blackboard where he choreographed stage movements for ``The Music
Man,'' easily the most valuable thing in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Already you could sense the scale of his eventual
accomplishments: attending what became the Juilliard School of
Music, then becoming John Philip Sousa's principal flutist and
piccolo player without an audition, then first flutist for the New
York Philharmonic. Cracking wise about Mason City on the radio with
George Burns and Tallulah Bankhead. Writing ``May the Good Lord
Bless and Keep You,'' on the basis of his memories of the Sunday
school where his mother was superintendent of the younger grades.
When he died in 1984, he was buried in Mason City to the salute of
76 trombones.
</P>
<P>
   Miller mentioned some coincidences uncovered as local volunteers
put the house together as a period piece. One was that the roller
organ in the parlor can play only one song, ``Stars and Stripes
Forever.'' This was the song for which young Willson dreamed of
playing the piccolo solo in Sousa's celebrated band.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the Willson house is Marjorie's Tea House, which
opened last August. It was the home of one of Willson's childhood
chums, Marjorie Sale, who now lives in Virginia and is crowding
100. It is a nice little restaurant, offering Greek stew, roast
pork and a light chicken sandwich on a typical day. The homemade
brownies with butterscotch sauce were scrumptious.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the beginning of Mason City's entrepreneurial
approach to its heritage. A $10 million Music Man Square is being
built next door to house theaters, a museum, rehearsal rooms and an
indoor streetscape modeled on ``The Music Man'' set. It is opening
gradually; the partly finished building was dedicated at the town's
annual band festival last month with a thousand-member barbershop
quartet and 76 used trombones dangling from the ceiling.
Ultimately, there will be a pool hall, soda fountain and
barbershop, among other working stores, all to be finished by 2002,
the centenary of Willson's birth. Rosemary, Willson's widow, now 78
and living in Southern California, is supplying $5 million and two
grand pianos.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   The Mason City Foundation is also remodeling a nearby mansion as
a bed-and-breakfast, and has its eye on an adjacent antiques mall
as a site for a working bakery in honor of the yeasty profession of
Willson's father.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Willson house is the Mason City Public Library,
a large Georgian-style brick structure built in the 1940s and still
in use. Here dozens of handwritten notes from famous authors are
displayed, among them Washington Irving, Samuel Johnson and George
Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Charles H. MacNider Art Museum, a truly
captivating place given by the philanthropic family who lived
there. One is struck by the view of the creek and woodland from
wide Tudor windows, but there is more. Lithographs by Grant Wood
and George Bellows are outstanding, and Thomas Hart Benton's
exuberant painting, ``Spring Tryout,'' depicting a young man trying
to ride a spirited horse, is of a stature one expects of New York
or Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most whimsical attraction is the collection of Bil
Baird's work from Broadway, the movies, television and two world's
fairs. Virtually all the puppets from his production of ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' performed in his Greenwich Village theater in the
early '70s, frolic in one case. Another displays the puppets used
in the film ``The Sound of Music.'' There are more than 400 puppets
in all, as well as the artist's sayings and scribblings. ``When I
make a puppet, I hang myself on straps like a lab specimen to make
sure the motions are right, as written,'' one quotation said.
Baird's Mason City roots are apparent from the display of the noted
puppeteer Tony Sarg's production of ``Rip Van Winkle'' at a local
theater during his teens. The show, he said, impelled him into the
world of marionettes.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor leaving the museum finds himself on a street that is
parallel to Willow Creek. This and the street across the creek are
called the Rock Glen-Rock Crest National Historic District and are
home to Prairie School houses designed by Wright's contemporaries.
Walter Burley Griffin designed five of the eight houses, including
one of craggy rock that local residents call The Castle and
architectural historians term one of the first modern houses of the
20th century. Griffin would shortly go on to design Australia's new
capital, Canberra, but his Mason City work is viewed as the Prairie
School's apotheosis.
</P>
<P>
   It is a short walk, one accompanied by woodpeckers and
songbirds, to another truly amazing building. Local people worked
for years to painstakingly restore and move a house designed by
Wright in 1908 to a nearby site. It was based on a famous plan for
a $5,000 house Wright published in Ladies' Home Journal. At its
lowest ebb, the Stockman House had become a dilapidated photo
studio. Its restoration is intriguing because it is half pure
Wright, including china patterns from Tokyo's Imperial Hotel. The
other half reflects the tastes of the relatively affluent doctor's
family who lived there. There is a bearskin rug and furniture from
the Arts and Crafts Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The docents here are wonderful too. We caught up with one of
them, Dr. Robert McCoy, a retired surgeon who lives in a nearby
Griffin house. He told how borings were taken to determine the
original paint, revealing hues considerably more autumnal than
anticipated. He pointed out that Wright designed storm windows to
be loaded from the inside, something not commonly done until after
World War II. Most important, he showed how the house, built around
a huge fireplace, flows organically. ``Every room is a
destination,'' McCoy said. ``No room is a passage to another
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of Wright should then head promptly for the corner of
Federal Avenue and State Street. Here are a somewhat deteriorated
bank, designed to resemble a vault, and a hotel, in the Prairie
School style, that have lapsed into different uses. But the
exteriors still clearly show Wright's intentions. The roof of the
hotel is being rebuilt with state money.
</P>
<P>
   There is more in Mason City. In the town's Central Park, the
newly restored monument to the 24 local sons who fell in the Civil
War, is impressive. So is the tiny Suzie Q Cafe, which has nine
stools (almost always filled), no tables and a fabulous pork
tenderloin sandwich. For dessert, there is Birdsall's, an
old-fashioned ice cream parlor that sells a swell ``turtle,'' a
concoction involving ice cream, hot fudge, caramel and nuts. I had
mine with black walnut ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   We wandered by Ransom's Pool Hall with its cigar store Indian,
but my 12-year-old son, Roy, was deemed too young to enter. The
click of balls sounded so enticing. Had that dratted Professor Hill
beat us to the punch?
</P>
<P>
   We then headed for the Van Horn Collection, which specializes in
trucks built before 1930, the year Lloyd Van Horn was born. There
are wonders in this place, including some 50 trucks. There is a
1920 General Motors circus truck with working calliope. A Saurer
beer truck from 1912. A John Deere manure spreader from 1914.
Antique gas pumps. The first snowmobile, made in 1917 from a Model
T, and an immense collection of antique cream separators. Plus free
coffee and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   There are even inspirational signs from an earlier time: ``If
you are a self starter, the boss won't have to be a crank.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a good time for a drive. A few miles northwest of the
airport, there is a spot in a cornfield visited by people from all
over the world. It was here that a plane carrying the
rock-'n'-rollers Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper
crashed in February 1959. Just about anyone can tell you how to get
there. The final half-mile is a hike across rich black loam. The
site is marked by a small monument, a stainless steel guitar and
records with each singer's name.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic flowers and handwritten notes were strewn about. There
was a plastic pair of glasses like those Buddy Holly wore. The wind
blew and in the distance trucks hummed along the Interstate.
Somebody had written words those ``by God stubborn'' Iowans in
``The Music Man'' would surely endorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray not for a lighter burden but a stronger back,'' the note
said.

SUPREME COURT INVALIDATES NEW JERSEY HATE CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-NYT) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday declared New Jersey's
hate crime law unconstitutional on the grounds that it improperly
permitted the judge, rather than the jury, to make the crucial
finding that the crime was motivated by bias, and that it did not
require proof of that finding beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision will have only a modest impact in the area of
hate crime legislation, because most states already require a jury
to make the finding of motive under the reasonable doubt standard.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision opens the door to challenges to sentencing
procedures in many other contexts, including federal drug sentences
and even the structure of the federal sentencing guidelines
themselves in which the jury determines guilt and the judge makes
many essentially factual determinations that lead to the final
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   As the dissenters warned Monday, and which the justices in the
majority did not dispute, the decision could cause widespread
ferment in criminal sentencing. The four dissenters said the
decision marked ``a watershed change in constitutional law.''
</P>
<P>
   With five separate opinions totaling 106 pages, the decision,
Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, was one of the most closely
fought and in some respects surprising decisions of the term. The
case cut across the court's usual ideological lines. Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by
Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg. Justices Scalia and Thomas also filed concurring
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G.
Breyer, who each wrote dissenting opinions, along with Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The court had been pointing in this direction in recent
decisions, but the majority opinion put the holding starkly and
unequivocally: ``Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any
fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey hate crime law is similar to a law in North
Carolina, but differs from those of other states that make the
finding of biased motive an element of the offense that the
prosecution has to charge in the indictment and prove to the jury
like any other element of the crime. The hate crime bill the New
York Legislature passed this month follows this latter model, as
does the federal bill that cleared the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey law was challenged by a Vineland man, Charles
Apprendi Jr., who pleaded guilty in 1995 to firing several bullets
into the door of a neighboring black family's home. The maximum
sentence for the firearms offense was 10 years. Under the hate
crime law, the prosecutor then asked the trial judge to find that
the crime had been motivated by racial bias. The judge held a
hearing at which Apprendi, who is white, disputed that charge. The
judge found against him, thus subjecting Apprendi to a possible
additional 10 years; the final sentence was 12 years on both
aspects of the offense. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the law
in a decision last year.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority Monday, Justice Stevens said that ``at
stake in this case are constitutional protections of surpassing
importance,'' the right to due process of law and the guarantee of
a trial by jury. He said that it was one thing for a judge to
exercise discretion within the statutory range for the offense as
set by the legislature. But he said the court could not accept
``the novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from
the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal
defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if
punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the decision, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman
said that ``what we need to do is amend the law and put that power
back in the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   While the majority opinion suggested that the constitutional
problems could be avoided as long as any judicially imposed
sentencing factors kept the final sentence within the statutory
range for the offense, the dissenters expressed doubt that the
decision could logically be confined within those boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice O'Connor said that if the decision meant, as it appeared
to, `'that a defendant is entitled to have a jury decide, by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact relevant to the determination
of sentence under a determinate-sentencing scheme,'' then the
ruling ``will have the effect of invalidating significant
sentencing reform accomplished at the federal and state levels over
the past three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, she said, the decision ``threatens to unleash a flood
of petitions by convicted defendants seeking to invalidate their
sentences in whole or in part.'' O'Connor said the majority failure
`'to clarify the precise contours of the constitutional principle
underlying its decision'' left federal and state judges ``in a
state of limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The court will almost immediately have a chance to indicate
whether it wants to let this debate simmer in the lower courts, or
whether it wants to assign itself the task of clarifying the full
import of Monday's ruling. The justices have been keeping a number
of cases involving the sentencing guidelines and, particularly,
federal narcotics sentencing, on their docket while awaiting
decision in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The drug cases would appear to be particularly vulnerable to the
majority analysis Monday, because the jury in such cases typically
finds guilt while the sentencing judge makes many crucial
determinations about the type and quantity of the drugs, the harm
caused by the offense, and the individual characteristics of the
offender.

LEE WANTS SEIZED EVIDENCE SUPPRESSED IN LOS ALAMOS SECURITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Federal prosecutors and lawyers for Wen Ho
Lee, the government scientist accused of mishandling nuclear
secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, wrangled Monday over
the defense's motion to suppress a raft of documents seized at
Lee's home last year on the grounds that the warrant used was
unconstitutionally broad.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong hearing, sometimes tense, ranged from seemingly
technical concerns like whether the warrant was stapled to the
sealed affidavit prosecutors used to obtain it, to sweeping
arguments over whether the affidavit itself was so broad as to
violate the Fourth Amendment's guarantees against unreasonable
search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, was indicted last December on 59 counts of illegally
downloading to unsecured computer files secret data from the Los
Alamos weapons lab where he had worked and then copying the files
to computer tapes, some of which have since disappeared. He has
pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail and faces life in
prison if convicted at a trial schedule for November.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing was the latest in a series of pre-trial
arguments, but it was important because a ruling invalidating the
warrant and suppressing evidence seized at Lee's home in White
Rock, N.M., on April 10, 1999, could cripple the prosecution in a
case that the government has described as threatening the nuclear
balance of power and Lee's defenders have characterized as a racist
witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the search, some 15 FBI agents took computer-related files,
and 10 big boxes of material, including a book of plays by
Tennessee Williams and short stories by Guy de Maupassant, because,
an agent testified Monday, they had phone numbers and Chinese
characters written in them or on slips of paper tucked inside. But
the warrant shown to Lee that day made no reference to specific
items sought, simply noting they were detailed in an affidavit
which the government had asked a judge to seal on national security
grounds and would not show Lee or his lawyers at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, this is the worst warrant that any members of this
defense team have ever seen,'' said Mark Holscher, one of Lee's
lawyers. He also sharply criticized the affidavit's list of various
categories of items to be seized, and its repeated use of the
phrase ``includes but is not limited to,'' as impermissibly broad
under existing federal court precedents requiring that such an
affidavit in support of a warrant must be formally ``incorporated''
into the warrant itself.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended that the warrant was not technically
flawed, but went on to suggest that even if it was, the FBI agent
who drafted it and the magistrate who signed it were acting in good
faith on an urgent matter. The warrant was drafted shortly after
Lee permitted a search of his office and investigators discovered
that the files were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To grant this motion, the court would have to promote a staple
to constitutional significance,'' said the lead prosecutor, George
A. Stamboulidis, in arguing that the agent in charge of the search
had all the documents together in a single manila envelope at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent, Michael W. Lowe, testified that items like the
book of plays were seized because they contained Chinese writing
that might have been relevant to the investigation and could not
have been readily translated on the scene during the four-hour
search.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearing, Judge James A. Parker asked a series of
patient, probing questions of both sides, but seemed to be pressing
the defense lawyers in particular to justify any implication that
the government might have acted in bad faith. He made no ruling
from the bench, and neither side would predict when he might issue
one in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Parker ordered the prosecution to provide a list, by
next week, of possible foreign nations it may argue Lee intended to
help by downloading the highly sensitive data. He had been under
investigation on suspicion of passing secrets to China, but has not
been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the defense filed a separate motion, seeking to
compel the government to provide various material, including Energy
Department counter-espionage training videos, that Lee contends
will show that he was a target of selective prosecution, and that
``ethnic Chinese'' workers had been the subject of racial profiling
by federal counter-intelligence investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Parker set a hearing date of Aug. 15 on that motion, on which
prosecutors would not comment.

HUMBERTO GORDON, LEADER OF SECRET POLICE UNDER PINOCHET, DIES AT
72 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Humberto Gordon, who commanded the Chilean secret police
for seven years in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, died on
June 15 in his house near Santiago. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had a heart attack while under house arrest, The
Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   After having led the secret police, Gordon was a member of the
junta that controlled Chile from 1973 to 1990. Pinochet made Gordon
head of the secret police in 1980, after leftist guerrillas had
stepped up their activity. Then, as Pamela Constable and Arturo
Valenzuela wrote in ``A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet''
(1991, Norton), Gordon ``launched an all-out campaign to infiltrate
an destroy the radical left.''
</P>
<P>
   An official report has said that more than 3,000 people were
killed in the Pinochet era and that 1,000 have not been accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon died, he had retired from the army and had been
indicted in connection with the homicide of Tucapel Jimenez, a
well-known union leader. A judge had linked the slaying to the
secret police. Gordon contended that he and his force had no
connection with the case. He had also been indicted in connection
with four other killings.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez was found slain in his car in 1982. He had been
repeatedly shot in the face, and his throat had been slashed. For
years, the case was tied up in courts by a judge with close ties to
the military, which contended that a carpenter had fatally stabbed
Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   But a Chilean munitions clerk told a court in Paris that he had
issued the murder weapons in Jimenez's slaying to four agents from
the secret police. The agents were set free, for lack of
incriminating evidence, after after a trial that brought out
information about a secret police plot to demolish opposition labor
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon married Maruja Maturana, who survives him. They had a
daughter.

CLINTON OFFERS A DEAL TO DIVIDE GROWING BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton raised his projection of the
federal budget surplus Monday by nearly $1.3 trillion for the next
decade, putting a breathtaking sum of new money on the table as the
two parties and their presidential candidates battle over tax cuts,
spending and how to prepare for the nation's long-term challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we use these surpluses in this moment of prosperity will
determine America's future for decades to come,'' Clinton told
reporters in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate brought the total surplus projection to just
under $4.2 trillion for 2001 through 2010, including $2.3 billion
from the Social Security system and almost $1.9 trillion from
general tax receipts. Seeking to frame the debate over how the
money should be used, Clinton immediately proposed a deal to divide
a portion of the windfall with the Republican majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would agree to a Republican proposal to cut
taxes for married couples by roughly $250 billion over 10 years if
the Republicans would go along with his $253 billion proposal to
add prescription drug coverage to the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out his budget framework, Clinton also stressed that
he would put the government on a path to eliminate the $3.5
trillion national debt by 2012, a year ahead of his previous
schedule, and to use a portion of the non-Social Security surplus
to help extend the solvency of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction to Clinton's proposed deal from the two top
Republican leaders, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, fell somewhere between skeptical and
dismissive. And despite Clinton's desire to bring prescription drug
coverage to Medicare on his terms before leaving office in seven
months, it was unclear whether the two sides would even be able to
negotiate during an election season in which they are eager to
highlight their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clinton's offer suggested, the surplus, if it
materializes, is big enough to give both parties much of what they
want, and its sheer size has left Democrats and Republicans alike
struggling to get a handle on the politics of potential plenty.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, divided government has led to
gridlock on tax cuts and major new spending initiatives. The latest
round of surplus numbers _ which are likely to be followed within
days or weeks by a similar set of new projections from the
Congressional Budget Office _ will only raise the stakes in the
election, with both sides asserting that they have a more prudent
plan for making the most of the fiscal bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign said the new figures
vindicated his contention that the nation can afford the large tax
cut he has proposed and still have money to create private
investment accounts within Social Security, improve education and
health care, build a national missile defense system and reduce the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign said the new figures
highlighted the benefits of fiscal responsibility and the contrast
between Gore's emphasis on shoring up Social Security and Medicare
and Bush's push for a tax cut that would give most of its benefits
to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The new surplus projections are to some extent subject to
changes in the economy, and any nasty economic surprise could dim
the chances of the surpluses materializing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged as much Monday. He said it would be a
mistake to allocate all of the projected surplus at this point, and
he proposed a $500 billion ``reserve fund'' that would be held
aside until the fiscal situation becomes clearer and voters send a
message about what they want to do with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projections could be wrong,'' Clinton said. ``They could
be right. That's why we shouldn't spend it all now. And moreover,
we're having a debate in which the two candidates have very
different notions about what should be done with this moment of
prosperity, and the American people ought to have some say in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton said, the nation could not be ``blind
to the fact that we have an enormous opportunity here.''
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have already agreed that the Social Security
surplus should go only to reducing the national debt or shoring up
the retirement system to help it weather the aging of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the gain in the numbers released Monday was in the
non-Social Security portion of the budget, bringing to almost $1.9
trillion, from $746 billion under the administration's old
calculations, the pot of money that is up for grabs over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said the surplus projection was driven up by a
combination of the economy's current strength and an expectation
that at least some of the improvement in the economy will be long
lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last year, they said, the economy has performed
substantially better than anticipated. Because the economy is
bigger now than previously foreseen, it would generate
larger-than-anticipated tax revenues even if economic growth from
this point on did not exceed the rates that the White House had
assumed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House's Office of Management and Budget also
revised upward its economic growth assumptions, reflecting a
general consensus among economists that the United States is
capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10 years covered by the projection, the administration
is now assuming average economic growth of 3 percent a year, up
from 2.7 percent under its previous budget projection, made in
February. Many economists think the nation's potential
noninflationary growth rate is actually closer to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total increase of $1.275 trillion in the 10-year surplus
projection, $984 billion comes from the improved economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The projection also includes $375 billion in additional revenue
over the decade from technical changes in the estimates of tax
receipts (the increases are offset by an $84 billion reduction in
projected receipts stemming from legislation passed so far this
year).
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest of the technical changes is an upward revision
in personal income tax revenues, in part from a surge in capital
gains that taxpayers are reaping from stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In offering to swap a tax cut for his prescription drug plan,
Clinton was to some extent insulating Gore and Democrats in
Congress from criticism by Republicans, who accuse them of opposing
popular tax cuts. Republicans have been pressing to address what
they call the ``marriage penalty,'' the quirk in the tax code that
leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes than they would
if single. But the bills they have proposed would give tax cuts to
nearly all married couples, even if they do not pay a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed intent on sparking one last round of
negotiations with the congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proposal for true compromise,'' Clinton said. ``It
asks each party to accept some of the positions of the other party
in the name of progress.''

 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an achievement that represents a pinnacle of
human self-knowledge, two rival groups of scientists said on Monday
that they had deciphered the chemical book of life that defined the
human organism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are learning the language in which God created
life,'' President Clinton said at a White House ceremony attended
by members of the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' leaders, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera
Genomics, and Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute, praised each other's contributions
and signaled a spirit of cooperation from now on, even though the
two efforts will remain firmly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome consists of two sets of 23 giant DNA molecules,
or chromosomes, with each set _ one inherited from each parent _
containing more than three billion chemical units. The successful
decipherment of this vast genetic archive attests to the
extraordinary pace of biology's advance since 1953, when the
structure of DNA was first discovered, and presages an era of even
brisker progress.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the human genome is expected to revolutionize the
practice of medicine. Biologists expect in time to develop an array
of diagnostics and treatments based on the genome and tailored to
individual patients, some of which will exploit the body's own
mechanisms of self-repair. The knowledge in the genome could also
be used in harmful ways, particularly in revealing patients'
disposition to disease if their privacy is not safeguarded, and in
provoking discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The joint announcement is something of a shotgun marriage
because neither side's version of the human genome is complete.
Neither side has sequenced _ that is, determined the order of the
chemical subunits _ the DNA of certain short structural regions of
the genome, which cannot yet be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can either side describe the genome's full size or determine
the number of human genes. Celera says the gene-coding part of the
genome consists of 3.12 billion letters of DNA; the  &UR; institute &LR; 
says it consists of 3.15 billion units, a letter difference of 30
million.letters of DNA
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement heralds an unexpected truce between the
two groups of scientists who have been racing to finish the genome.
Veering away from the prospect of asserting rival claims of
victory, the two have chosen to report simultaneously their
attainment of different milestones in their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has obtained its 3.12 billion letters of the genome in
the form of long continuous sequences, mostly about 2 million
letters each, but with many small gaps. A less complete version has
been reported by the Human Genome Project, a consortium of academic
centers supported largely by the National Institutes of Health and
the Wellcome Trust, a medical philanthropy in London. Collins, the
consortium's leader, said its scientists had sequenced 85 percent
of the genome in a ``working draft,'' meaning its accuracy will be
upgraded later.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of the human genome meet the important goal of
allowing scientists to search them for desired genes, the genetic
instructions encoded in the DNA. The consortium's genome data is
freely available now. Celera has said it will make a version of its
genome sequence freely available at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   In their remarks at the White House, Collins and Venter both
sought to capture the wider meaning of their work in identifying
the eye-glazing stream of A's, G's, C's and T's, the letters in the
genome's four-letter code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' Collins said. Venter spoke of his
conviction from seeing people die in Vietnam, where he served as a
medic, that the human spirit transcended the physiology that is
controlled by the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two genome versions were obtained through prodigious efforts
by each side, involving skilled management of teams of scientists
working around the clock on a novel technological frontier.

CALLED `THE NEW FDR,' BUSH MAKES APPEALS TO IMMIGRANTS AND BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush continued Monday to present
himself as a ``different kind of Republican,'' describing an
immigrant-friendly approach to the bureaucratic Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and making a broad appeal to black voters
in an address Monday night in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lauded racial harmony in the dinner speech before the
Congress of Racial Equality at a midtown hotel. He said he wanted
to fund mentoring programs for children whose parents are in prison
and rally ``the vast armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the dais were Wayne LaPierre, executive director
of the National Rifle Association; Bob Grant, the conservative
radio talk-show host; Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and descendants of
Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, Jefferson's slave, and his
first wife, Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Bush, Roy Innis, chairman of CORE, said: ``He
loves people, he relates to people, he is the new FDR.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said Bush was dedicating
himself this week to making a broad appeal across party lines to
groups that traditionally lean Democratic. Tuesday he plans to
discuss welfare-to-work programs in Michigan, and Wednesday he
plans to speak in Ohio about removing barriers to those with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, the Texas governor said he would propose
legislation to split the INS into two separate agencies, one to
deal with law enforcement and the other to provide services to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For years, officials across the political spectrum have
supported restructuring the unwieldy immigration service, and two
bills are moving through the Republican-controlled Congress to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was addressing the League of United Latin American
Citizens at a conference Monday in Washington, spoke in brief
generalities, saying that as president he would ``reform the INS''
and that he wanted a ``more humane'' approach to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides said later that while he would propose his
legislation, he favored the approach being advanced by Sens.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.. Their
bill is viewed by pro-immigration groups as more helpful to
immigrants than the bill in the House proposed by Republican Reps.
Lamar Smith of Texas and Harold Rogers of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference between the bills is that Abraham's, in
splitting the agency in two, would put one person in charge to
supervise both the law enforcement and service functions to make
sure that they would be taking consistent legal and policy
approaches. It also sets deadlines for processing visas, rather
than letting them drag on.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-immigrant groups worry that if the agency is split into two
separate entities with two separate top executives, the law
enforcement branch would consume most of the money and that the
services for immigrants would get short shrift. The enforcement
side gets the lion's share of the agency's money now, but backers
of the Abraham bill hope that would change.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said that the governor was not
endorsing any particular legislation but added, ``There are no
differences between the governor's bill and Abraham's bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's language was vague and his view seems to differ
little from that of the Clinton administration and Vice President
Al Gore, the point was to distinguish himself from the immigration
Republican politics of yore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outreach, it's the governor following through on his
promise that the Republican Party has to be the party of inclusion,
for single moms, for new citizens coming to America,'' Fleischer
said. ``It's different from a lot of the sights and sounds that
people have been hearing from the Republican Party in recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been working to live down the reputation
the party gained in 1996 when some prominent Republicans, including
Pete Wilson, then the governor of California, backed Prop. 187 in
California to deny medical and education services to children of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not comment directly on Prop. 187 at the time, saying
he did not want to tell another state what to do, but said he would
educate all children. And in speaking to the Latino group Monday,
he reiterated his opposition to ``English Only'' programs, saying
he favored ``English Plus,'' which teaches children English but
encourages them to learn other languages.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would grant tourist visas to immigrants who were
waiting for their visas if their spouse or child had already
received permanent legal residency status. Now, such family members
are ineligible to visit, on the theory that they would try to stay
in the United States illegally if their spouse or parent had legal
status.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration
Forum, said in a telephone interview that Bush's advocacy of
splitting the immigration service in two was ``not exactly a
profile in courage,'' since almost everyone supports it.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was more interesting that Bush had not mentioned
other issues of importance to Latino voters and especially
immigrants, like the H-1B visa bill, which would raise the number
of visas granted to high-tech workers from abroad. Bush supports
increasing the number of visas, but Republicans _ and Democrats,
particularly those from organized labor _ are divided over whether
this is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't speak to the tough issues, though he's trying to
present himself as a new kind of Republican,'' Sharry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is also courting the Hispanic vote, is to address the
Latino group on Friday. Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said
the vice president wanted to streamline the immigration agency.
``Bush would start from square one and we don't think that's
necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting more broadly on Bush's approach, Hattaway said:
``Bush is clearly trying to make himself out to be a different kind
of Republican by appearing friendly to immigrants. But under his
leadership in Texas, Hispanics are not doing as well as other
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Hispanics in Texas were disproportionately poor, in part
because Texas has a minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, compared with
the federal minimum of $5.15 an hour.

THE TWIST IN THE PEDRO STORY: THE OBLIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It sounds so obscure, this muscle that may be causing
Pedro Martinez so many problems of late.
</P>
<P>
   The oblique.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a muscle that is used in almost any daily activity
that requires a twisting motion. Take away the fancy name, and
you're talking about your side muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you do normally that is not straight ahead involves
some twisting activity, which means you're using your oblique
muscles,'' said Dr. Timothy Kremchek, chief orthopedic surgeon for
the Cincinnati Reds. ``Golfers hurt their oblique muscles.
Construction workers, who do a lot of twisting on the job, they can
get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   There are internal and external oblique muscles. The internal
oblique is a small, thin, deep muscle of the abdomen that extends
from the hip bone to the cartilage of the lower ribs. It protects a
weak point in the abdominal wall and works with the external
oblique to help twist the torso.
</P>
<P>
   The external oblique is a large, thin sheet of overlapping
muscle that runs along the side of the torso. It is divided into
two portions that meet at the waist. This muscle is involved in
flexing the spine when the trunk twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek, who did his residency at Tufts and spent time at both
New England Baptist Hospital and New England Medical Center, has
never examined Martinez, and emphasizes that he is not offering an
assessment of what may be ailing the Red Sox ace. For him, it bears
repeating: He does not pretend to be qualified to speak to
Martinez's case directly.
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek will, however, talk in general terms about oblique
muscle injuries. Among his patients was former Red Sox pitcher
Steve Avery, who was never the same after straining his oblique
muscle while with the Atlanta Braves. Avery, who signed with the
Reds after leaving the Red Sox following the 1998 season, told
Kremchek he changed his mechanics to compensate for the pain in his
side and never was able to regain the form that made him one of the
premier lefthanders in baseball when he came to the big leagues in
the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Avery underwent surgery for a torn rotator cuff and
is now back in the Braves' system, attempting a comeback. Kremchek
said there is really no way of knowing for certain whether Avery's
shoulder problems were related to the strained oblique muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oblique muscle injuries are not uncommon at all,'' Kremchek
said. ``You tend to see them more often early in spring training,
but they can occur during the season, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we find with throwers who have an oblique
muscle injury is they start changing the way they throw because
they're unable to twist in their delivery and follow through like
they normally would. And when you start changing your motion, that
can lead to elbow and shoulder injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we try to get the pain away, maintain the range of
motion and make sure the pitching coach is watching closely that
the pitcher is not changing his motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek said there is no way to know why some players are more
susceptible to oblique muscle injuries than others. Martinez said
he developed soreness on his left side while throwing during a side
session a couple days after his 2-0 mastery of Roger Clemens and
the Yankees May 28 in New York. By that Friday in Philadelphia, the
Sox announced that Martinez would be scratched from his next day's
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' Martinez insisted at the time, adding that
he has had occasional problems with the side since the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different than runners who develop Achilles'
tendinitis,'' Kremchek said. ``Some get it, some don't. It depends
on how they run. Same thing with pitchers. It depends on how they
twist their body to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers use their oblique muscles on both their windup and
follow-through. And if a pitcher can't twist like he normally does
because he hurts, he sometimes compensates by opening up too soon.
We've learned over time that pitching goes from the foot to the
knee to the hip to the back to the elbow to the shoulder. If one is
not working rhythmically or is weak, a pitcher starts opening up
too much. If one muscle is not working right, a pitcher will use
other muscles to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's pain, that will change a pitcher's approach to his
command and his approach to his velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who gave up five runs in 6 2/3 innings Sunday and
allowed three home runs for the second start in a row, acknowledged
that his command was very much off. His velocity also was down, and
while he insisted he wasn't hurt, his teammates said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hurt, and everybody in here knows it,'' reliever Rod Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Kremchek said, is that oblique muscles heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not obvious like a broken bone or a torn ligament,''
Kremchek said. ``Your player is going to be your best guide as to
how much it hurts. And your pitching coach should be able to tell
how much it inhibits him.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stretching, strengthening, and time,'' Kremchek said. ``You
don't want to get him back too soon. But it also depends on the
caliber of your pitcher, how badly you need him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you want to get him right.''

 &HT;    Spadea ends losing streak with Wimbledon victory
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ His parents had gone home to Boca Raton two
days earlier, probably in despair, Vince Spadea joked later.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent had virtually guaranteed his British fans a win in
the well-read pages of The Sun _ London's tabloid featuring
bare-topped Page3 girls and lots of Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   And few others had given him much chance to end his ATP
Tour-record 21-match losing streak against big-serving Greg
Rusedski, the 14th seed and a grass-court lover.
</P>
<P>
   But at 9p.m. Monday in London (4 p.m. EDT), Spadea lifted his
arms in victory to the few friends in his supporters box and to
himself. He had finally won.
</P>
<P>
   The streak was over, after months of losing, of working when it
seemed hopeless, of close losses and horrible losses, of injury, of
scrutiny. It was over, after three hours, 56 minutes of play and
nearly two hours of rain delay Monday at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm popping champagne like I won the tournament,'' Spadea said
later. ``I'm going to enjoy it, because that's what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea defeated Rusedski 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-7 (8-10), 9-7 on
Court1, which seats 11,429 and was filled with passionate British
fans waving signs and flags for Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Spadea urged a partially booing crowd to give him
credit for a hard-fought match, even though he'd been a bit testy
during play. He won them over with a broad grin once they began
applauding. Davis Cup captain John McEnroe hugged him too _ so hard
Spadea said he felt ``like my kid was born or something. That was a
great feeling, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he entered a near-empty interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am. Six months,'' Spadea said. ``It was worth the wait,
huh people?''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought victory was his first since reaching the
semifinals at Lyon in October. He defeated Jim Courier, then
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, before losing to Lleyton Hewitt. He tried not
to lose faith in himself during the streak, but the number finally
got to him last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girl in a bar asked me how old I was and I told her 21
because I've got that number in my mind, all over my brain,'' said
Spadea, 25, laughing after finishing most of his media obligations
at about 11p.m. He hadn't yet called his parents but wished they
had been here after all they've put into his career over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one became his number after Spadea lost to Sebastien
Grosjean last week. That loss broke an ATP record held by Gary
Donnelly, a Phoenix doubles specialist who lost 20 straight from
November 1996 to September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea said he thought about his streak just once while playing
Rusedski and admitted to himself then that losing this match _
after failing to convert two set points in the second set and two
match points in both the fourth and fifth sets _ would be ``very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the streak hasn't haunted him daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough patch in my life in tennis,'' Spadea said.
``It didn't really faze me so much. I was trying to enjoy my life a
little more, trying to improve my tennis game. Everything wasn't
clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept going to the gym, brought on former Australian star Pat
Cash to help his game, kept playing and kept trying to improve upon
his career-high No.19 ranking, where he finished 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't playing poorly,'' he said. ``I had a great year last
year, but I needed to add some things to get to even a further
level. I just wasn't sure how to do it. I wasn't that organized.
It's hard to improve, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   And when he saw his Wimbledon draw, he wasn't encouraged,
despite his usual good results against top players in big
tournaments. He suspected television and fans would be watching
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to put a microscope on me,'' Spadea said.
``With a guy who is a great grass-court player, and my record on
grass, it just made it so much more adverse.''
</P>
<P>
   But he endured, after he and Rusedski fought like gladiators, as
he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea credited Cash, who has been helping him informally since
his first-round loss at the French Open. Spadea came straight to
London and started working on grass, particularly on approaching
the net, playing more aggressively and believing in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very generous,'' Spadea said. ``It's been an amazing
experience to work with someone of that stature. He's definitely
changed my outlook on grass-court tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   And the victory can't hurt any of that, particularly the way it
came.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, despite his column in The Sun, hinted at a foot injury
that has been hampering him but wouldn't elaborate and credited
Spadea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' said Rusedski, adding that he plans to
escape tennis for several days now. ``I didn't take my
opportunities when I had them. He's too good a player to lose as
many matches as he lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea couldn't agree more and said he's curious to see how a
victory feels this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even analyzing the monkey that I had on my back,'' he
said. ``I'm just focused on the fact that this will be a great
memory, no matter what happened to me this year.''

SPADEA COURTS FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ To him, each boo was a bouquet, each teardrop a
champagne toast, each curse a hosannah.
</P>
<P>
   Let them rant and whine and wail, all 11,429 of them; Vince
Spadea didn't care. Nothing was going to diminish his moment of
redemption. And so he turned and bowed and waved his arms wildly
and smiled exultantly toward each corner of Court 1 at the All
England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club Monday. None of these hostile
witnesses could appreciate what he had been through: the longest
losing streak in tennis history, 21 matches, until this glorious,
if torturous, first-round Wimbledon victory over No. 14 seed Greg
Rusedski, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken him 3 hours 56 minutes, interrupted by a 1-hour
45-minute rain delay, and five match points to get this anvil off
his head. And even his grand moment illustrated his wretched
fortune. He was not the crowd's conquering hero but the conqueror
of their hero: Rusedski, who along with Tim Henman is annually
anointed the savior who will bring Great Britain its first local
Wimbledon champion since Fred Perry in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so their wait has been 64 years; Spadea's had seemed
longer, even though it dated back only to last October in Lyon,
France, when Yevgeny Kafelnikov had provided Spadea's last taste of
victory before Lleyton Hewitt began the steady diet of defeat. So
he wasn't about to rush out of paradise. He was going to linger and
enjoy the moment, and he was going to make these people enjoy it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   And darned if he didn't do it. By the sheer force of his
determination and the incandescence of his celebration, he won them
over just as he had won over their man. You've convinced us, they
conceded. Good show, chap. And suddenly, the catcalls and
imprecations turned into cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to enjoy the moment and give myself a good
reward for the accomplishment I made today,'' said Spadea, a
loosey-goosey 25-year-old from Bacon Raton, Fla., whose futility
supposedly epitomized the imminent demise of American tennis once
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi leave the world stage. ``I think the
crowd kind of appreciated it, too. We're out there fighting like
gladiators. I just feel like the crowd deserves some kind of
communication, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What was communicated to the crowd was nonstop gripping tennis,
even if on many occasions it appeared Spadea and Rusedski were
gripping their own throats.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, a carpetbagging Brit who was born in Canada but
transplanted himself to a more receptive tennis clime to capitalize
on his mother's status as an English native, landed only 48 percent
of his 130 mile-per-hour first-serve rockets in a desultory first
set. And he seemed on the brink of bowing out meekly when he
trailed, 5-3, in the second, bouncing his racket off the grass to
demonstrate his frustration. But then the rains and the recovery
came. Rusedski closed to 5-4 before the suspension, and when play
resumed, he outlasted Spadea, 7-5, in the eventual tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Now the match was even, and this was Spadea's cue to wilt. He
began playing the role of the collapsing churl, staring ominously,
shaking his head disgustedly over each line call that aggrieved
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what it's all about,'' said Spadea, ``just kind of being
a real person, showing your emotions, doing what you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski felt like escaping after his debacle. With an
unexpected, and unwanted, fortnight's vacation now awaiting him, he
announced his plans: ``Go as far away from this place as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wouldn't leave peaceably, even after a tepid third-set
loss. Facing match points at 5-6 and 7-8 in the fourth-set
tie-break, he resurrected himself, eventually nailing a cross-court
backhand for a 10-8 survival.
</P>
<P>
   And in the palpitating fifth set, he actually found himself
serving for the match at both 7-6 and 8-7, while Spadea was
thinking, ``Here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so difficult,'' Spadea said. ``I'm starting to think
there's no such thing as fate, man. You create it. Gee, when he was
8-7, 7-6, I was just like, `Hey, man, I can't believe life works
this unfair.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't this time. After extricating himself from both chasms,
Spadea squandered two more match points, then kissed the heavens as
Rusedski brought the melodrama to a close by sending a forehand
return long.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his wandering through the desert, Spadea never gave
up on himself, though he might have had Monday's outcome gone the
way of all those others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had lost this match, that would have been the lowest
point,'' he said. ``I was thinking, `Holy goodness, where do I go
from here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, ``I wasn't playing poorly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski concurred: ``He's too good a player to lose as many
matches as he lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Rusedski and his adopted countrymen, he served
as the proof of that Monday.

COURT SAYS CALIFORNIA'S BLANKET PRIMARY THREATENS POLITICAL PARTY
IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With sidebar, SCOTUS-PRIMARY-REACT) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court invalidated California's blanket
primary Monday, calling it a ``stark repudiation of freedom of
political association'' that stripped political parties of the
ability to control their own nominating process and define their
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the California system, an extreme version of the more
common open primary, all voters, regardless of their party
membership, get a single ballot from which they can select among
candidates of any party affiliation: a Republican for governor, for
example, and a Libertarian for the State Assembly. Alaska and
Washington are the only other states with such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision cast doubt on the more common open primary,
used in more than half the states, in which any registered voter
can request a particular party's primary ballot. In some states,
the crossover privilege is limited to independent voters and does
not extend to members of a different party.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing the majority opinion Monday,
said that ``this case does not require us to determine the
constitutionality of open primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, who voted in dissent along with
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the decision ``cast serious
constitutional doubt'' on those approaches as well.
</P>
<P>
   The case was an appeal by four California political parties, the
Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Peace and Freedom parties.
They opposed the blanket primary when it was adopted as a voter
initiative in 1996 and then challenged it in court on the ground
that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of
association.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question for the court was how to characterize a
political primary: as the public's business or as the party's
essentially private affair. The private view prevailed. ``In no
area is the political association's right to exclude more important
than in the process of selecting its nominee,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which had affirmed an earlier ruling by
the federal District Court in Sacramento that the burden on the
parties' right of association was not severe.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state's political parties objected to Proposition
198, it was popular with the voters: a majority of Democrats and
Republicans, as well as independents, supported it at the polls in
1996. Its supporters' rationale was that it would bring more people
to the polls and ``promote representative democracy,'' as
California told the justices, by guaranteeing that ``candidates
will be more representative of the electorate and more broadly
reflect the views of the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority Monday found that justification objectionable. It
was not the business of the state to try to make political parties
more ``centrist,'' Scalia said. Rather, he said, the system was an
invitation to a party's ideological opponents to raid the primary
and select a nominee who does not, in fact, represent the party's
core beliefs. ``A single election in which the party nominee is
selected by non-party members could be enough to destroy the
party,'' Scalia said, describing the threat as ``a clear and
present danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters viewed the entire issue through the opposite end
of the analytical telescope, emphasizing the public, rather than
private, function of a political primary. ``The protections that
the First Amendment affords to the internal processes of a
political party do not encompass a right to exclude nonmembers from
voting in a state-required, state-financed primary election,''
Stevens said in a dissenting opinion joined by Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that while a party's internal governance was its
own business, ``an election, unlike a convention or caucus, is a
public affair.'' The dissent added that ``in an era of dramatically
declining voter participation, states should be free to experiment
with reforms designed to make the democratic process more robust by
involving the entire electorate in the process of selecting those
who will serve as government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Scalia said the state's interest in
opening up the process could be better, and constitutionally,
served by using a nonpartisan blanket primary. Under that system,
parties nominate their candidates and then the voters select from
among all the contenders, with the top two vote-getters moving on
to the general election. Louisiana has such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No.
99-401, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. Kennedy filed a concurring
opinion to say that not only Proposition 198 but also federal
campaign law, as interpreted and upheld by the court, were
undermining political parties' First Amendment rights by limiting
the parties' ability to make contributions directly to their
candidates and inducing the parties to turn to soft money and issue
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unfortunate decisions remit the political party to use of
indirect or covert speech to support its preferred candidates,
hardly a result consistent with free thought and expression,''
Kennedy said.

 WASHINGTON: technological frontier.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spurring their efforts was the glittering lure of the genome as
a scientific prize, and a rivalry fueled by personal differences
and conflicting agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a genomics pioneer whose innovative methods have at
times been scorned by experts in the consortium's camp, has often
cast himself, not without reason, as an outsider battling a hostile
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium scientists were halfway through a successful
15-year program to complete the human genome by 2005, when Venter
announced in May 1998 that as head of a new company, later called
Celera, he would beat them to their goal by five years.
</P>
<P>
   His bombshell entry turned an academic pursuit into a fierce
race. Collins responded by moving his completion date forward to
2003 and setting this month as the target for a 90 percent draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks have pulled out all the stops,'' he said of his
staff in an interview last week. ``They have achieved a ramp-up
that is beyond anything one would have imagined possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has spent $300 million on sequencing the human
genome since January 1999, when its all-out production phase began.
Celera has not released its costs, but Venter said a year ago that
he expected Celera's human genome model to cost $200 million to
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The race opened with mutual predictions of defeat. The
consortium's senior scientists predicted in December 1998 that
Venter's method of reassembling the sequenced fragments of genomic
DNA was bound to fail. In May 1999, Venter, confident of Celera's
impending success, observed that the National Institutes of Health
and the Wellcome Trust were ``putting good money after bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups were divided by political as well as technical
agendas. The consortium's two principal scientists, Dr. John E.
Sulston of the Sanger Center in England and Dr. Robert Waterston of
Washington University in St. Louis, insisted the genome data should
be published nightly, an unusually generous policy because
scientists generally harvest new data for their own discoveries
before sharing it.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the consortium's administrative leaders, Dr. James D.
Watson and his successor Collins, made a point of seeking out
international partners so that the rest of the world would not feel
excluded from the genome triumph. Thus, even though centers in the
United States and Britain have done most of the heavy lifting,
important contributions to the consortium's genome draft have been
made by centers in Germany, France, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Academic scientists have felt some chagrin that an altruistic,
open and technically successful venture like the Human Genome
Project should be upstaged by a commercial rival financed by the
company that made the consortium's DNA sequencing machines.
</P>
<P>
   But though Celera seeks to profit by operating a genomic data
base, Venter also believed he could make the genome and its
benefits available a lot sooner. He has succeeded in doing so, as
well as in spurring the consortium to move faster.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's truce between the two teams offers several advantages.
For Celera to claim victory over the consortium would risk
alienating customers in the academic community. For the consortium,
the surety of opting for a draw now may have seemed better than the
risks of claiming victory with a complete genome much later.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's version of the genome depends on the consortium's data.
And the many small gaps in Celera's sequence will probably be
filled by the consortium's scientists, adding further to their
claim of credit for the final product.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The present truce between the two sides is limited to Monday's
announcement and an agreement to publish their reports in the same
journal, although the details remain to be worked out. There will
also be a joint workshop to discuss the two versions of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that has been discussed with Collins is just cooperation,
not collaborative efforts,'' Venter said last week. ``We are trying
to coordinate, to take some of the heat and animosity out of
things. From Celera's side, we want the public to trust us, and if
we are all acting like just scientists we won't get that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The versions of the human genome produced by the two teams are
in different states of completion because of the different methods
each used to determine the order of DNA units in the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium chose first to break the genome down into large
chunks, called BACs, which are about 150,000 DNA letters long, and
to sequence each BAC separately. This BAC by BAC strategy also
required ``mapping'' the genome, or defining short sequences of
milestone DNA that would help show where each BAC belonged on its
parent chromosome, the giant DNA molecules of which the genome is
composed.
</P>
<P>
   BACs are assembled from thousands of snippets of DNA, each about
500 DNA letters in length. This is the longest run of DNA letters
that the DNA sequencing machines can analyze. A computer pieces
together the snippets by looking for matches in the DNA sequence
where one snippet overlaps another.
</P>
<P>
   But the BACs do not assemble cleanly from their component
snippets. One reason is that human DNA is full of repetitive
sequences _ the same run of letters repeated over and over again _
and these repetitions baffle the computer algorithms set to
assemble the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The stage the consortium has now reached is that all its BACs
are mapped, making the whole genome available in a nested set of
smaller jigsaw puzzles. But the BACs are in varying stages of
completion. The BACs covering the two smallest human chromosomes,
numbers 21 and 22, are essentially complete. But many other BACs
are in less immaculate states of assembly. Many consist of
assembled pieces no more than 10,000 units long, and the order of
these pieces within each BAC is not known.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of the assembled pieces in each BAC now covers 85
percent of the genome. This working draft, as the consortium calls
it, is maybe not a thing of beauty but is of great value to
researchers looking for genes and represents a major
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's genome has been assembled by a different method, called
a whole genome shotgun strategy. Following a scheme proposed by Dr.
Eugene Myers and Dr. J. L. Weber, Celera skips the time-consuming
mapping stage and breaks the whole genome down into a set of
fragments that are 2,000, 10,000 and 50,000 letters long. These
fragments are analyzed separately and then assembled in a single
mammoth computer run, with a handful of clever tricks to step
across the repetitive sequence regions in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The approach ideally required sequencing 30 billions units of
DNA _ ten times that in a single genome. Venter seems to have taken
a considerable risk by starting his assembly at the end of March
this year when he possessed only a 3-fold coverage of the genome.
He has since raised his total to 4.6-fold coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may have been influenced by Celera's rate of
capital expenditure _ the company's electric bill alone is $100,000
a month _ and by the need to sequence the mouse genome as well so
as to offer data base clients a two genome package. The mouse
genome is expected to be invaluable for interpreting the human
genome, and Venter said on Monday that Celera would finish
sequencing it by the end of the year.

 &HT;    Hingis, Williamses coast
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Three favorites for their tennis and one
favorite for other reasons won on the opening day of Wimbledon play
Monday at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   Top seed Martina Hingis and sisters Venus (No.5 seed) and Serena
Williams (No.8) all easily moved into the second round with
straight-set victories. Unseeded tabloid star Anna Kournikova
struggled against 10th seed Sandrine Testud but finally pulled off
a 7-5, 5-7, 6-4 upset on her fourth match point.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis defeated Spain's Angeles Montolio 6-1, 6-2 and was
pleased with her performance, particularly after losing in the
first round here a year ago to Jelena Dokic, then ranked No.129.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) definitely feel better than last year,'' Hingis said.
``Coming into this tournament with a victory, with a little bit
more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, playing in just her second Wimbledon and after
a two-month layoff, defeated Asa Carlsson 6-3, 6-2 but didn't serve
and volley nearly as much as her father had directed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, dad and coach, joined his daughters in England
this year for the first time while their mother, usually the
traveling coach, stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   He probably was happier with Venus Williams' serve-and-volley
performance. She used the style almost every chance she got and
beat Kveta Hrdlickova 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me to serve-and-volley every point,'' Venus said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova kept her ever-attentive fans happy with her victory,
enduring a 1-hour, 45-minute rain delay and defeating a top-10
player on Centre Court at her favorite tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova thought Testud relaxed and improved when she got
behind, making it difficult for Kournikova to complete the win. But
she said the three missed match points didn't take anything away
from her feelings afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good,'' she said. ``It's probably the happiest
that I've felt after a match. This is probably the most meaningful
because it's at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras criticizes Spaniards: Top seed Pete Sampras easily moved
into the second round, ending Jiri Vanek's Wimbledon debut 6-4,
6-4, 6-2, and afterward wondered why Alex Corretja and Albert Costa
didn't show their unhappiness with the seeding by winning matches
instead of withdrawing in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Alex and Albert feel like they should have been seeded,
but grass is a unique surface that you have to make exceptions
for,'' the six-time defending champion said. ``They went home,
which is obviously disappointing, but this tournament will probably
still go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rankings of No.11 and 15, respectively, both were
unseeded this year. They felt it was unfair the ATP required them
to play but the tournament had the freedom not to seed them. Juan
Carlos Ferrero, ranked No.13 and also unseeded, joined in the
protest but withdrew because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he wouldn't object to surface-specific rankings
throughout the tour, which were suggested as ways to solve the
problem universally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get seeded at the French, I'd go out there and try
to do well to prove to the event that I'm worthy of being seeded,''
he said. ``You really try to rise above it instead of being a
little childish about it and going home. It's a bit disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest event we have in the game. Everybody
should play it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an achievement that represents a pinnacle of
human self-knowledge, two rival groups of scientists said on Monday
that they had deciphered the chemical book of life that defined the
human organism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are learning the language in which God created
life,'' President Clinton said at a White House ceremony attended
by members of the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' leaders, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera
Genomics, and Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute, praised each other's contributions
and signaled a spirit of cooperation from now on, even though the
two efforts will remain firmly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome consists of two sets of 23 giant DNA molecules,
or chromosomes, with each set _ one inherited from each parent _
containing more than three billion chemical units. The successful
decipherment of this vast genetic archive attests to the
extraordinary pace of biology's advance since 1953, when the
structure of DNA was first discovered, and presages an era of even
brisker progress.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the human genome is expected to revolutionize the
practice of medicine. Biologists expect in time to develop an array
of diagnostics and treatments based on the genome and tailored to
individual patients, some of which will exploit the body's own
mechanisms of self-repair. The knowledge in the genome could also
be used in harmful ways, particularly in revealing patients'
disposition to disease if their privacy is not safeguarded, and in
provoking discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The joint announcement is something of a shotgun marriage
because neither side's version of the human genome is complete.
Neither side has sequenced _ that is, determined the order of the
chemical subunits _ the DNA of certain short structural regions of
the genome, which cannot yet be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can either side describe the genome's full size or determine
the number of human genes. Celera says the gene-coding part of the
genome consists of 3.12 billion letters of DNA; the  &UR; institute &LR; 
says it consists of 3.15 billion units, a letter difference of 30
million.letters of DNA
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement heralds an unexpected truce between the
two groups of scientists who have been racing to finish the genome.
Veering away from the prospect of asserting rival claims of
victory, the two have chosen to report simultaneously their
attainment of different milestones in their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has obtained its 3.12 billion letters of the genome in
the form of long continuous sequences, mostly about 2 million
letters each, but with many small gaps. A less complete version has
been reported by the Human Genome Project, a consortium of academic
centers supported largely by the National Institutes of Health and
the Wellcome Trust, a medical philanthropy in London. Collins, the
consortium's leader, said its scientists had sequenced 85 percent
of the genome in a ``working draft,'' meaning its accuracy will be
upgraded later.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of the human genome meet the important goal of
allowing scientists to search them for desired genes, the genetic
instructions encoded in the DNA. The consortium's genome data is
freely available now. Celera has said it will make a version of its
genome sequence freely available at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   In their remarks at the White House, Collins and Venter both
sought to capture the wider meaning of their work in identifying
the eye-glazing stream of A's, G's, C's and T's, the letters in the
genome's four-letter code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' Collins said. Venter spoke of his
conviction from seeing people die in Vietnam, where he served as a
medic, that the human spirit transcended the physiology that is
controlled by the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two genome versions were obtained through prodigious efforts
by each side, involving skilled management of teams of scientists
working around the clock on a novel technological frontier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spurring their efforts was the glittering lure of the genome as
a scientific prize, and a rivalry fueled by personal differences
and conflicting agendas.

   Academic scientists have felt some chagrin that an altruistic,
open and technically successful venture like the Human Genome
Project should be upstaged by a commercial rival financed by the
company that made the consortium's DNA sequencing machines.
</P>
<P>
   But though Celera seeks to profit by operating a genomic data
base, Venter also believed he could make the genome and its
benefits available a lot sooner. He has succeeded in doing so, as
well as in spurring the consortium to move faster.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's truce between the two teams offers several advantages.
For Celera to claim victory over the consortium would risk
alienating customers in the academic community. For the consortium,
the surety of opting for a draw now may have seemed better than the
risks of claiming victory with a complete genome much later.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's version of the genome depends on the consortium's data.
And the many small gaps in Celera's sequence will probably be
filled by the consortium's scientists, adding further to their
claim of credit for the final product.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The present truce between the two sides is limited to Monday's
announcement and an agreement to publish their reports in the same
journal, although the details remain to be worked out. There will
also be a joint workshop to discuss the two versions of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that has been discussed with Collins is just cooperation,
not collaborative efforts,'' Venter said last week. ``We are trying
to coordinate, to take some of the heat and animosity out of
things. From Celera's side, we want the public to trust us, and if
we are all acting like just scientists we won't get that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The versions of the human genome produced by the two teams are
in different states of completion because of the different methods
each used to determine the order of DNA units in the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium chose first to break the genome down into large
chunks, called BACs, which are about 150,000 DNA letters long, and
to sequence each BAC separately. This BAC by BAC strategy also
required ``mapping'' the genome, or defining short sequences of
milestone DNA that would help show where each BAC belonged on its
parent chromosome, the giant DNA molecules of which the genome is
composed.
</P>
<P>
   BACs are assembled from thousands of snippets of DNA, each about
500 DNA letters in length. This is the longest run of DNA letters
that the DNA sequencing machines can analyze. A computer pieces
together the snippets by looking for matches in the DNA sequence
where one snippet overlaps another.
</P>
<P>
   But the BACs do not assemble cleanly from their component
snippets. One reason is that human DNA is full of repetitive
sequences _ the same run of letters repeated over and over again _
and these repetitions baffle the computer algorithms set to
assemble the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The stage the consortium has now reached is that all its BACs
are mapped, making the whole genome available in a nested set of
smaller jigsaw puzzles. But the BACs are in varying stages of
completion. The BACs covering the two smallest human chromosomes,
numbers 21 and 22, are essentially complete. But many other BACs
are in less immaculate states of assembly. Many consist of
assembled pieces no more than 10,000 units long, and the order of
these pieces within each BAC is not known.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of the assembled pieces in each BAC now covers 85
percent of the genome. This working draft, as the consortium calls
it, is maybe not a thing of beauty but is of great value to
researchers looking for genes and represents a major
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's genome has been assembled by a different method, called
a whole genome shotgun strategy. Following a scheme proposed by Dr.
Eugene Myers and Dr. J. L. Weber, Celera skips the time-consuming
mapping stage and breaks the whole genome down into a set of
fragments that are 2,000, 10,000 and 50,000 letters long. These
fragments are analyzed separately and then assembled in a single
mammoth computer run, with a handful of clever tricks to step
across the repetitive sequence regions in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The approach ideally required sequencing 30 billions units of
DNA _ ten times that in a single genome. Venter seems to have taken
a considerable risk by starting his assembly at the end of March
this year when he possessed only a 3-fold coverage of the genome.
He has since raised his total to 4.6-fold coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may have been influenced by Celera's rate of
capital expenditure _ the company's electric bill alone is $100,000
a month _ and by the need to sequence the mouse genome as well so
as to offer data base clients a two genome package. The mouse
genome is expected to be invaluable for interpreting the human
genome, and Venter said on Monday that Celera would finish
sequencing it by the end of the year.

MARKET PLACE: A MARQUEE FOOD-TOBACCO DEAL, WITH LAWSUIT FEARS
LURKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NABISCO) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pursuit of tobacco companies as public enemies
has now produced the following:
</P>
<P>
   One tobacco company, Philip Morris, gets to buy a food company,
Nabisco, at a relatively low price.
</P>
<P>
   Another tobacco company, R.J. Reynolds, gets about $1.5 billion
in cash as a sort of litigation gift.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders who used to control the food company get less
than they might have received, because of fear that class-action
litigation may yet bankrupt the tobacco companies. Still, they are
doing much better than before Carl C. Icahn put Nabisco into play.
</P>
<P>
   The complex transaction by which Philip Morris, the nation's
largest cigarette company, will buy Nabisco _ a company that used
to be part of a company that owned Reynolds, the No. 2 cigarette
maker _ is a monument to the fear that class-action suits will
drive the tobacco companies into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   That is the part of this arrangement that gives the deal its
most unusual aspect: the gift of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in
cash to R.J. Reynolds. That reflects the possibility that Nabisco
Group Holdings, as the former corporate parent of Reynolds, may
have a residual liability for Reynolds debts if Reynolds is driven
into bankruptcy by tobacco litigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was one company for which that residual liability would be
unimportant: Reynolds itself. It is taking on no additional risks
by guaranteeing its own debts. And it will clear $1.4 billion to
$1.5 billion just by giving that guarantee, assuming that the deal
is completed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, that might outrage owners of Nabisco
Group Holdings stock, who by accepting an offer of $30 a share are
effectively agreeing to take 16.7 percent less than the value of
their company's assets, based on the $55 a share being paid to the
shareowners of Nabisco Holdings, the food unit. But there are not
likely to be many complaints, since the shareholders will be
receiving more than the stock has traded for in recent years _ and
more than three times the price in the open market only a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual corporate structure for Nabisco stemmed from a long
series of corporate machinations. First, R.J. Reynolds acquired
Nabisco in 1985. In 1989, the new company, RJR Nabisco, was taken
private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The public was allowed back into RJR Nabisco in 1991, when stock
was sold in an initial public offering at a price well above its
current value.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis got out of the company in 1994 by trading much
of its stake for ownership of Borden, an underperforming food
company. In 1995, with litigation pressure growing on tobacco
companies, RJR Nabisco sold a minority stake in Nabisco Holdings to
the public. If the idea was to show that the parent company ought
to have a higher stock price, it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, RJR Nabisco spun off its ownership of R.J.
Reynolds to its shareholders. The parent company was renamed
Nabisco Group Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   After that spinoff, an owner of one share of Nabisco Group
Holdings effectively owned 0.655 share of Nabisco Holdings, the
food company. But that parent company also faced the possibility of
being held liable if R.J. Reynolds was unable to pay its bills. The
size of the discount reflected just how worried investors were.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the spinoff, the discount was 22 percent. But the
discount deepened to nearly 60 percent early in February. Then
Icahn became involved, setting off the process that culminated in
the latest deal, which was well received on Wall Street Monday.
Philip Morris shares rose $3.50, to $27.125; Nabisco Group Holdings
added 93.75 cents, to $26.50; Nabisco Holdings rose $1.125, at
$52.75; and Reynolds gained $1.50, to $28.375.
</P>
<P>
   Now Philip Morris will own a huge food company, composed of its
old Kraft and its new Nabisco units. It plans to sell a minority
stake in that to the public. When that happens, it will become
clear that Philip Morris, like RJR Nabisco before it, is worth less
than the sum of its parts. Then, Wall Street will start talking
about how to realize the value of that food operation.

VERA ATKINS, SPYMASTER FOR BRITISH, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Britain, Switzerland, Romania)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the
legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to
sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings,
Sussex. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Atkins was widely
believed to have inspired the character of Moneypenny in the James
Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice
Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is
said to have been the model for ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkins' steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who
had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two
were a far cry from Moneypenny's lovestruck mooning over the
elusive Bond. Atkins' heart was with her 400 secret agents. She
stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into
France.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a
little worse than 1 in 4, Atkins pushed to be assigned to
investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and
brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had
been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far
from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret
service money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not just abandon their memory,'' she said. ``I decided
we must find out what happened to each one, and where.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration
camp and poring over records. ``I was probably the only person who
could do this,'' she said. ``You had to know every detail of the
agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant,
Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She
always shuddered at Hoess' reaction to her suggestion that 1.5
million people had been killed in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' he said, as if offended. ``It was 2,345,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and
went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her
mother's last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne
and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and
her just as perfect manners would come in handy later.
</P>
<P>
   At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations
Executive, which Winston Churchill set up ``to set Europe ablaze''
through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after
victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ``It was the
equivalent of 15 divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler said, ``When I get to London I am not sure who I shall
hang first _ Churchill or that man Buckmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster's assistant,
Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   The spymasters headed the unit's F section, for France. They
began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two
chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a
general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could
pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a
50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits were a remarkable cross-section _ bankers and
playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had
insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding
that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French
British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where
they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando
course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and
explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed
by parachute training near Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up
their cover stories by going over and over their false identities
and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to
live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were
given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs,
letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception
committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded
personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality,
described by The Times of London as a ``sledgehammer,'' pervaded
the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television
documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the
brisk shout of a French expletive.
</P>
<P>
   One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, ``Road
to Resistance,'' (Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his
falling in love _ again. ``Oh, the bloody English!'' she said. ``We
never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate,
and that is that.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some
heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents
were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in
ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So
did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled
out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the
George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its
title from her first name.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to
keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a
Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by
an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see
France.

SPORTS COLUMN: DON'T SQUASH ALL SUSPENSE WITH A WALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The greatest baseball team of the 20th century and all time, as
the New York Yankees have often been called the last two
championship seasons, is suddenly running scared of the Toronto
Blue Jays and a couple of small-market teams with cut-rate
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken less than half a season for an organization that
methodically won the World Series three of the last four years to
shudder at the possibility of competing for its rightful place in
the playoffs against teams from that former Class AAA outpost, the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   How pathetically unbecoming for a team with the Yankees' pride
and pedigree to be portrayed as shouting from a rooftop for someone
to come save them from the White Sox, from David Wells, from the
Junior-less Mariners and the financially challenged A's, who two
summers ago considered Rickey Henderson their most productive
player and, gulp, veteran leader. Don't look now, Boss, but your
homeys from Tampa are only eight and one-half games behind you.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's become apparent that the Yankees may have to sweat
to survive September, the city chorus has taken up George
Steinbrenner's ``do-something'' cue and began calling for the kind
of acquisition that won't mean anything unless the pitching gets
straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   If what we have seen from David Cone and Roger Clemens is all
there is, then the Yankees should save those young prospects for
the pitchers' sale that is sure to come. Otherwise, it will soon be
the 1980s all over again, when pitching was as sparse &UR;  &LR; as parking,
and Steinbrenner will be starting his new television network with a
$120 million payroll and the Bronx chapter of the Cleveland Indians
as his main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Until this all works itself out, Yankee fans should sit back and
enjoy, for a change, some regular-season ballgames that, you know,
mean something. They're in Detroit this week and Tampa this weekend
and their mission, though paling compared to Tom Cruise's, is to
put some distance between themselves and .500.
</P>
<P>
   People around New York can't seem to believe the Yankees are in
this unenviable position so close to the _ gasp! _ All-Star break.
Out of first place. Out of the playoffs, if they were to begin
today.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a cause for celebration that there is new blood
flowing in the American League, not an excuse to spend another $20
million and further distort the imbalance that already exists
between big and small markets. Remember this: when the Braves were
beset with injuries last year, they toughed them out, and played
inspiring ball down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, how many regular-season series weren't
just showcases for a team already penciled into a division title or
the wild-card berth? As wonderful a team as the Yankees have been,
the Mets reminded us last year that the regular-season struggle is
still what makes baseball great, and what separates it from the
other team sports. It can't be coincidence that the more the
regular season has become a formality, the more World Series
ratings have declined.
</P>
<P>
   If Yankee fans believe this team should not have to actually
scratch and claw anymore during the regular season, then they are
as spoiled and unrealistic as the owner. Steinbrenner has a payroll
that exceeds $90 million. For that kind of investment, they are
apparently supposed to settle the issue of the postseason by late
May and allow Joe Torre to work on his October rotation for the
next four months.
</P>
<P>
   Except it doesn't always work out that way, as the disappointed
people in Baltimore and Los Angeles could tell you, and thank
goodness for that. Over the last couple of years, the Orioles and
Dodgers have been the last vestiges of hope that you can't buy the
championship, and the only reasons to not picket America's
ballparks until Bob Costas becomes commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Steinbrenner if he sneered at Juan Gonzalez's asking
price. If he wants Sammy Sosa, he's probably going to get him, one
way or another. Too bad. Assuming the pitching improves _ and if it
doesn't, this whole issue is moot _ it would be nice to see the old
gang in a hot summer race.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, add a solid lefty bat. Get another quality
starter. Nobody will object. But you can tell from the snippiness
coming out of the clubhouse from typically sanguine sources such as
Joe Torre and Derek Jeter that the proud Yankees are tired of
hearing how much they need Sosa or Gonzalez to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that Jeter and O'Neil and even Knoblauch are
scared by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Oakland A's, or by the
prospect of a real playoff race. Not nearly as much as Steinbrenner
often sounds. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an achievement that represents a pinnacle of
human self-knowledge, two rival groups of scientists said on Monday
that they had deciphered the chemical book of life that defined the
human organism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are learning the language in which God created
life,'' President Clinton said at a White House ceremony attended
by members of the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' leaders, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera
Genomics, and Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute, praised each other's contributions
and signaled a spirit of cooperation from now on, even though the
two efforts will remain firmly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome consists of two sets of 23 giant DNA molecules,
or chromosomes, with each set _ one inherited from each parent _
containing more than three billion chemical units. The successful
decipherment of this vast genetic archive attests to the
extraordinary pace of biology's advance since 1953, when the
structure of DNA was first discovered, and presages an era of even
brisker progress.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the human genome is expected to revolutionize the
practice of medicine. Biologists expect in time to develop an array
of diagnostics and treatments based on the genome and tailored to
individual patients, some of which will exploit the body's own
mechanisms of self-repair. The knowledge in the genome could also
be used in harmful ways, particularly in revealing patients'
disposition to disease if their privacy is not safeguarded, and in
provoking discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The joint announcement is something of a shotgun marriage
because neither side's version of the human genome is complete.
Neither side has sequenced _ that is, determined the order of the
chemical subunits _ the DNA of certain short structural regions of
the genome, which cannot yet be analyzed. Nor can either side
describe the genome's full size or determine the number of human
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement heralds an unexpected truce between the
two groups of scientists who have been racing to finish the genome.
Veering away from the prospect of asserting rival claims of
victory, the two have chosen to report simultaneously their
attainment of different milestones in their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has obtained its 3.12 billion letters of DNA in the form
of long continuous sequences, mostly about 2 million letters each,
but with many small gaps. A less complete version has been reported
by the Human Genome Project, a consortium of academic centers
supported largely by the National Institutes of Health and the
Wellcome Trust, a medical philanthropy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the consortium's leader, said its scientists had
sequenced 85 percent of the genome in a ``working draft,'' meaning
its accuracy will be upgraded later.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of the human genome meet the important goal of
allowing scientists to search them for desired genes, the genetic
instructions encoded in the DNA. The consortium's genome data is
freely available now. Celera has said it will make a version of its
genome sequence freely available at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   In their remarks at the White House, Collins and Venter both
sought to capture the wider meaning of their work in identifying
the eye-glazing stream of A's, G's, C's and T's, the letters in the
genome's four-letter code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' Collins said. Venter spoke of his
conviction from seeing people die in Vietnam, where he served as a
medic, that the human spirit transcended the physiology that is
controlled by the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two genome versions were obtained through prodigious efforts
by each side, involving skilled management of teams of scientists
working around the clock on a novel technological frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring their efforts was the glittering lure of the genome as
a scientific prize, and a rivalry fueled by personal differences
and conflicting agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a genomics pioneer whose innovative methods have at
times been scorned by experts in the consortium's camp, has often
cast himself, not without reason, as an outsider battling a hostile
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium scientists were halfway through a successful
15-year program to complete the human genome by 2005, when Venter
announced in May 1998 that as head of a new company, later called
Celera, he would beat them to their goal by five years.
</P>
<P>
   His bombshell entry turned an academic pursuit into a fierce
race. Collins responded by moving his completion date forward to
2003 and setting this month as the target for a 90 percent draft.
</P>
<P>
   The versions of the human genome produced by the two teams are
in different states of completion because of the different methods
each used to determine the order of DNA units in the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium chose first to break the genome down into large
chunks, called BACs, which are about 150,000 DNA letters long, and
to sequence each BAC separately. This BAC by BAC strategy also
required ``mapping'' the genome, or defining short sequences of
milestone DNA that would help show where each BAC belonged on its
parent chromosome, the giant DNA molecules of which the genome is
composed.
</P>
<P>
   BACs are assembled from thousands of snippets of DNA, each about
500 DNA letters in length. This is the longest run of DNA letters
that the DNA sequencing machines can analyze. A computer pieces
together the snippets by looking for matches in the DNA sequence
where one snippet overlaps another.
</P>
<P>
   But the BACs do not assemble cleanly from their component
snippets. One reason is that human DNA is full of repetitive
sequences _ the same run of letters repeated over and over again _
and these repetitions baffle the computer algorithms set to
assemble the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The stage the consortium has now reached is that all its BACs
are mapped, making the whole genome available in a nested set of
smaller jigsaw puzzles. But the BACs are in varying stages of
completion. The BACs covering the two smallest human chromosomes,
numbers 21 and 22, are essentially complete. But many other BACs
are in less immaculate states of assembly. Many consist of
assembled pieces no more than 10,000 units long, and the order of
these pieces within each BAC is not known.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of the assembled pieces in each BAC now covers 85
percent of the genome. This working draft, as the consortium calls
it, is maybe not a thing of beauty but is of great value to
researchers looking for genes and represents a major
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's genome has been assembled by a different method, called
a whole genome shotgun strategy. Following a scheme proposed by Dr.
Eugene Myers and Dr. J. L. Weber, Celera skips the time-consuming
mapping stage and breaks the whole genome down into a set of
fragments that are 2,000, 10,000 and 50,000 letters long. These
fragments are analyzed separately and then assembled in a single
mammoth computer run, with a handful of clever tricks to step
across the repetitive sequence regions in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The approach ideally required sequencing 30 billions units of
DNA _ ten times that in a single genome. Venter seems to have taken
a considerable risk by starting his assembly at the end of March
this year when he possessed only a 3-fold coverage of the genome.
He has since raised his total to 4.6-fold coverage.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an achievement that represents a pinnacle of
human self-knowledge, two rival groups of scientists said on Monday
that they had deciphered the chemical book of life that defined the
human organism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are learning the language in which God created
life,'' President Clinton said at a White House ceremony attended
by members of the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' leaders, Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera
Genomics, and Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute, praised each other's contributions
and signaled a spirit of cooperation from now on, even though the
two efforts will remain firmly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome consists of two sets of 23 giant DNA molecules,
or chromosomes, with each set _ one inherited from each parent _
containing more than three billion chemical units. The successful
decipherment of this vast genetic archive attests to the
extraordinary pace of biology's advance since 1953, when the
structure of DNA was first discovered, and presages an era of even
brisker progress.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the human genome is expected to revolutionize the
practice of medicine. Biologists expect in time to develop an array
of diagnostics and treatments based on the genome and tailored to
individual patients, some of which will exploit the body's own
mechanisms of self-repair. The knowledge in the genome could also
be used in harmful ways, particularly in revealing patients'
disposition to disease if their privacy is not safeguarded, and in
provoking discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The joint announcement is something of a shotgun marriage
because neither side's version of the human genome is complete.
Neither side has sequenced _ that is, determined the order of the
chemical subunits _ the DNA of certain short structural regions of
the genome, which cannot yet be analyzed. Nor can either side
describe the genome's full size or determine the number of human
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement heralds an unexpected truce between the
two groups of scientists who have been racing to finish the genome.
Veering away from the prospect of asserting rival claims of
victory, the two have chosen to report simultaneously their
attainment of different milestones in their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has obtained its 3.12 billion letters of DNA in the form
of long continuous sequences, mostly about 2 million letters each,
but with many small gaps. A less complete version has been reported
by the Human Genome Project, a consortium of academic centers
supported largely by the National Institutes of Health and the
Wellcome Trust, a medical philanthropy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the consortium's leader, said its scientists had
sequenced 85 percent of the genome in a ``working draft,'' meaning
its accuracy will be upgraded later.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of the human genome meet the important goal of
allowing scientists to search them for desired genes, the genetic
instructions encoded in the DNA. The consortium's genome data is
freely available now. Celera has said it will make a version of its
genome sequence freely available at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   In their remarks at the White House, Collins and Venter both
sought to capture the wider meaning of their work in identifying
the eye-glazing stream of A's, G's, C's and T's, the letters in the
genome's four-letter code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' Collins said. Venter spoke of his
conviction from seeing people die in Vietnam, where he served as a
medic, that the human spirit transcended the physiology that is
controlled by the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two genome versions were obtained through prodigious efforts
by each side, involving skilled management of teams of scientists
working around the clock on a novel technological frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring their efforts was the glittering lure of the genome as
a scientific prize, and a rivalry fueled by personal differences
and conflicting agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a genomics pioneer whose innovative methods have at
times been scorned by experts in the consortium's camp, has often
cast himself, not without reason, as an outsider battling a hostile
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium scientists were halfway through a successful
15-year program to complete the human genome by 2005, when Venter
announced in May 1998 that as head of a new company, later called
Celera, he would beat them to their goal by five years.
</P>
<P>
   His bombshell entry turned an academic pursuit into a fierce
race. Collins responded by moving his completion date forward to
2003 and setting this month as the target for a 90 percent draft.
</P>
<P>
   The versions of the human genome produced by the two teams are
in different states of completion because of the different methods
each used to determine the order of DNA units in the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium chose first to break the genome down into large
chunks, called BACs, which are about 150,000 DNA letters long, and
to sequence each BAC separately. This BAC by BAC strategy also
required ``mapping'' the genome, or defining short sequences of
milestone DNA that would help show where each BAC belonged on its
parent chromosome, the giant DNA molecules of which the genome is
composed.
</P>
<P>

500 DNA letters in length. This is the longest run of DNA letters
that the DNA sequencing machines can analyze. A computer pieces
together the snippets by looking for matches in the DNA sequence
where one snippet overlaps another.
</P>
<P>
   But the BACs do not assemble cleanly from their component
snippets. One reason is that human DNA is full of repetitive
sequences _ the same run of letters repeated over and over again _
and these repetitions baffle the computer algorithms set to
assemble the pieces.

SOUTH AFRICAN BASEBALL PLAYER FOLLOWS HIS DREAM TO AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Paul Bell knows that where he is today
_ 19 years old, starting at shortstop for South Africa in the
Olympics and playing professional baseball in Montana, nearly
10,000 miles from home _ has as much to do with timing as talent.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bell been born two or three decades earlier, his dream would
have been unthinkable for a South African, let alone for someone
who, like Bell, is not white. Baseball has never approached the
popularity here of rugby, cricket or soccer. That it is played here
at all comes as a surprise to many South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   But like every sport and every element of life in South Africa,
baseball's evolution was shaped by race, from who was permitted to
play on amateur teams to the international isolation that kept
talented South Africans from playing abroad. Now, several years
into the new South Africa, the once segregated sport is adapting to
new realities and seizing new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, South African baseball is attracting serious
attention from Major League scouts in search of prospects like Bell
and his national squad teammate, Wesley Botha, an 18-year-old white
pitcher from Johannesburg, who signed a minor league contract with
the Atlanta Braves earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, thousands of South African children who had
never picked up a baseball bat or glove have begun playing the
sport as part of an initiative by Major League Baseball that has
brought baseball into hundreds of schools over the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Botha, Bell and the rest of the national baseball
team will compete in the Sydney Olympics, after becoming the first
South African baseball squad to qualify for the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is already trying to prove that he belongs in professional
ball. Flown over by the Yankees in February for a tryout, Bell, who
is colored, as mixed-race people are known here, did not catch on
with the shortstop-stocked Bombers. But he auditioned with several
other teams, including the Milwaukee Brewers, who signed him to a
minor league contract. Bell participated in the Brewers' extended
spring training in Phoenix, and then he was sent to Helena, Mont.,
where the Brewers' rookie league team began play two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that if Helena is to be only a first stop in his
American baseball career, he will have to take his game higher than
he ever had to back home. ``It's much more a part of the culture
here,'' Bell said by telephone. ``No matter how good you are, you
have to work at it, and that's what I'm striving to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For his father Michael, once a promising player himself, for
whom the end of white minority rule and its repressive segregation
came too late, the joy of his son's success is almost
indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It greatly pleases me,'' he said, chuckling at his own
understatement, during an interview in the study of his home here
in Cape Town, surrounded by team photographs, games balls and other
mementos of his days playing for the Varsity Old Boys Club. ``I
don't know what words to use.'' Bell and Botha are neither the
first nor the only South Africans to traverse the Atlantic looking
to make a name on the baseball diamond. Slugger Nick Dempsey spent
a couple of seasons in the Dodgers organization before returning to
South Africa two years ago, and pitcher Tim Harrell is in his
second year with the Dodgers, playing this season for the club's
Single-A team in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell and Botha are arguably the most promising prospects so
far, and their emergence could not have come at a better time.
Major League Baseball is a decade into an effort to make the sport
truly international, and a few years ago, the league trained its
sights on South Africa, where sports were emerging from the
enforced isolation of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa could claim a long, if limited, tradition of
playing baseball, dating back to 1898 when a group of American gold
miners started a team near Johannesburg. More than a century later,
the game is still not widely played here, but where it is, the
leagues are well organized and the players enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the game to be everywhere,'' Paul Archey, Major League
Baseball's vice president for international business operations,
said in a telephone interview. ``Africa being one part of the world
where it's not widely played, South Africa was a natural place for
us to go to develop the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 amateur clubs are active in the country, some
fielding two or three teams, others six or seven. The clubs, which
are strongest in and around Cape Town, include about 30,000
players.
</P>
<P>
   The modest total and the predominance of whites among the
sport's oldest and best players underscores how limited baseball's
reach has been. On the club teams, especially the adult ones, white
players still fill out most of the lineups. Colored players are
represented, especially here in the Western Cape Province, where
they make up most of the all-star team. Blacks remain almost
invisible at the top levels of amateur baseball in South Africa,
with none on the roster of the national team.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
to provide elementary schools here with bats, balls, and, most
important, instruction for physical education teachers, who
typically must learn the game from scratch themselves. Baseball
began its international development program in Australia in 1993,
and then expanded to Britain, Germany and now South Africa. Mexico
and Italy are next. By the end of this year, about 200,000 South
African children, most of them black, will have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball in South Africa is still a long way from where its
backers here and abroad hope someday to see it. ``I think it's only
going to get better,'' said Allard Baird, the Kansas City Royals'
assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Baird spent 10 days in South Africa in April assessing the
quality of play. He came away pleasantly surprised and hired a
part-time scout here. ``We understand that it's going to take
time,'' he said. ``This is not going to be an immediate return on
our investment, but we want to make sure we're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, baseball has been what people here call a
``Cinderella sport,'' barely acknowledged by the press or noticed
by the public. Only the schools, which reach into every distant
corner of this sports-mad nation of more than 40 million people,
have the capacity to change that. Already baseball is taught in 800
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem why it didn't take off in the early years
was because it was not a school sport,'' said Raymond Tew, the head
coach of the national team,
</P>
<P>
   Like so many South Africans who gravitated to baseball, Tew, 50,
started out playing cricket in school. But a chance childhood
encounter with a band of baseball playing missionaries hooked him
on hardball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was good at cricket, but cricket was boring,'' he said as he
took in a recent tournament in the coastal city of Durban.
``Baseball was so much quicker.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Despite growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, before television
arrived in South Africa, Tew saw more American baseball than anyone
could have imagined. Coca-Cola, which sponsored his club team,
arranged for baseball films to be sent from the United States every
few months, featuring everything from the World Series and All-Star
Games to pitching and hitting tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   Often the films were a year or two old, but to Tew and his
teammates, gathered around the projector on a Friday night, it
might has well have been live. ``We never had TV and you never
heard it on the radio, so whatever game we saw, it was like it just
happened,'' he said. ``I got to know all the stars, Whitey Ford,
Roy Campanella. They're the names I grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television's recent arrival, with ESPN among its
offerings, has afforded baseball an opportunity to showcase itself
to the some of the youngsters it hopes to woo. Even broadcast TV is
joining in, with the e.tv network premiering a new weekly program
this season called Baseball Max, which features tips from the pros
and highlights from the previous week's Major League games.
</P>
<P>
   And in a country where soccer jerseys and rugby shirts are the
sports fashion rage, baseball fans show off their allegiances, too.
At the tournament in Durban, a couple of fans wore Yankee caps, one
spectator sported a Mariners jacket and another a White Sox
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   For the 150 or so fans taking in the games at what was the last
big tournament of the season, it was just a day out at the ball
park. With its cinderblock seats, pock-marked backstops and scruffy
infields, Mishi Jones Baseball Park is not Camden Yards. But there
were burgers, franks and beers to buy, balls and strikes to call
and hits and runs to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, of course, would like to see much bigger
crowds, people clamoring to see more American baseball on
television and more Major League merchandise in stores. But
baseball executives, as they chart out the sport's international
expansion, have concluded that success will start with getting
people to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to have a business, we have to have a sport,''
Archey said. ``You can only do so much on entertainment on TV. You
really need to get kids playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So might South Africa some day have a hometown hero to root for
in the Major Leagues, like Hideo Nomo, the Japanese pitcher, or
Graeme Lloyd, the pitcher from Australia?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that star will be Botha or Bell or maybe someone a few
years their junior. As Bell played out the first chapter of his
dream on a field in Phoenix, he liked to think it would be him. He
expected to be overwhelmed, but he held his own, he said. His
father was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played sports all my life, so it was only natural for the
kids to play, but Paul had that natural talent,'' Michael Bell
said. ``He had the killer instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 50 years old, Michael Bell was one of the first players to
cross over from Cape Town's colored baseball leagues, where he had
played for more than 20 years, to join the area's top white league.
That was 1978 and it would be more than a decade before the leagues
would officially unify.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell and a few other colored players who joined the Varsity
Old Boys team helped set the stage for the day this September in
Sydney when Paul Bell will take the field under the flag of South
Africa, a country that not long ago would have denied the father
the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bell sits at home, showing off the Brewers cap his son
sent him, along with a Yankee cap and jacket. He thinks about his
son and in his mind at least plays along with him. Half a world
away, the younger Bell thinks about the days when his father
watched his every play and knows that Dad is watching now, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I'm playing, he's playing with me,'' Paul Bell
said. ``It makes me feel I'm giving him a part of his life he never
had.''

FIRST UNION TO SHUT DOWN MONEY STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abandoning its longtime strategy of growing by gobbling up banks
and financial companies, the First Union Corp. said Monday that it
would close the Money Store lending operation, get out of some
businesses and scale back others.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said the overhaul would reduce earnings by $2.8
billion, most of it stemming from the decision to immediately shut
down the Money Store, a second-mortgage lender pitched relentlessly
in television ads by the retired baseball players Phil Rizzuto and
Jim Palmer. About 2,350 Money Store employees will lose their jobs,
including 360 in New Jersey, where the operation was founded.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, the sixth-biggest bank in the country, bought the
Money Store for $2.1 billion two years ago in one of the last big
purchases in a long string of deals engineered by its former chief
executive, Edward Crutchfield. Now, Crutchfield's successor, G.
Kennedy Thompson, is repudiating much of that growth strategy by
shrinking the company, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., to focus
on its core businesses of banking and brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we're saying we made a bad
acquisition,'' Thompson said, referring to the Money Store. He said
First Union was unlikely to buy any more banks and had no plans for
any significant acquisitions any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of making that reversal is high. First Union said it
would take charges against earnings and reserves for future losses
that would total about $3.8 billion. The savings from the changes
should add back $1 billion, for a net reduction in earnings of $2.8
billion over the next few quarters, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson surprised analysts by projecting that First Union would
earn between 72 and 74 cents a share in the second quarter, before
restructuring charges of at least $3 a share. The consensus
estimate of analysts had been 85 cents a share before the
announcement, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's shares gained 6.25 cents Monday, to $27.875, as
some investors expressed relief that the bank's new management was
taking the painful steps to refocus on its core businesses. The
stock had dropped more than 27 percent in the last three weeks as
fears of bad news spread among investors when the bank stopped
talking about its earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Flannigan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. reduced her
near-term rating on First Union's stock but kept her long-term buy
rating on it. ``This restructuring is really a move by the new
management team to put the missteps of the past behind,'' Flannigan
said. ``We're going to see a great deal more focus, accountability
and financial discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes First Union plans are the sale of its
mortgage-processing operation to Wells Fargo, the sale of its
credit-card business and the cleansing of its loan portfolio by
selling $500 million of nonperforming loans. First Union also plans
to sell or close about 90 bank branches. Mostly in the Southeast
and mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   First Union is closing all 38 of the remaining branches of Money
Store, 12 of which are in New Jersey and New York. Money Store also
has processing operations in the New Jersey towns of Warren and
Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said First Union would set aside $620 million to
``immunize ourselves against further losses'' from the Money
Store's $12 billion loan portfolio. But he said he did not suspect
fraud in the representations that were made by the Money Store at
the time of the sale, nor did he blame the investment bankers from
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. who received an undisclosed fee
from First Union for performing due diligence on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Money Store's advertising-driven lending business had been quite
profitable for the Turtletaub family that ran it until First Union
bought it. But in the late 1990s, as other lenders began competing
for so-called subprime borrowers. Money Store's customers started
repaying their loans early by refinancing them elsewhere. Early
repayment is the bane of lenders like Money Store because it
decreases the value of a loan that the lender, in turn, has
borrowed against to raise money to make more loans.
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lending business has been through a classic
boom-and-bust cycle on Wall Street in the last several years. After
flourishing for a few years, high-risk consumer lending crashed,
sending some lenders into bankruptcy and others into the arms of
acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subprime lending has come full-circle,'' said Marni Pont
O'Doherty, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``A couple of
years ago, Wall Street was falling all over itself to underwrite
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Conseco, a big insurance company, is trying to sell Green Tree
Financial after Green Tree, which specializes in mobile-home loans,
caused huge losses at Conseco. With Green Tree already on the
auction block, First Union recognized that it would have had
trouble finding a buyer for the Money Store and chose to cuts its
losses, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Doherty noted that Conseco's purchase of Green Tree closed on
June 30, 1998, the same day on which First Union completed its
purchase of Money Store.

   Expert debunks arson evidence in Davidian trial.
</P>
<P>
   By MARK ENGLAND
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - An expert witness for the plaintiffs Monday
attacked the government's contention that the Branch Davidians
started the fire that destroyed the sect's complex in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And a surviving Davidian, Marjorie Thomas, described a narrow
escape from the flames to U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr.
and the advisory jury hearing the $675 million wrongful-death
lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, a Chicago investigator who helped write
industry standards for fire investigations, told the plaintiffs'
lead attorney, Mike Caddell, that the government can't prove the
Davidians set fires in three locations simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the government's reliance on an infrared video to
prove arson is ``completely erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been used before,'' Kennedy said. ``It's never been
used since. There's no scientific evidence that you can tell
anything from a FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared video). There is no
literature in fire investigation about using a FLIR.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the government also can't prove that accelerants
were used in the three locations _ dining room, chapel and
southwest corner of the Mount Carmel complex _ where fires seemed
to start simultaneously April 19, 1993, leading to the deaths of
David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Samples were taken from all three areas to test for arson,
Kennedy told Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   A dog trained to alert at the smell of accelerants made 100
alerts going through the rubble of Mount Carmel, Kennedy said.
Thirty hits came back positive for accelerants. Not all three
areas, however, tested positive for accelerants, Kennedy said. The
dining room, for example, tested negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (fire) code is clear,'' Kennedy said. ``If you don't get a
lab test, you don't get a positive for accelerants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy rattled off several explanations for the simultaneous
fires: arson; the leaking of fuel throughout Mount Carmel from the
numerous propane cylinders, many of which were crushed; and the
lack of firewalls, which can cause a fire to race through a
structure's walls.
</P>
<P>
   The fire's cause can only be labeled as undetermined, Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt the plowing of tanks into Mount Carmel
accelerated the fire, Kennedy testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made the fire burn hotter,'' Kennedy said. ``It made the
fire burn faster. Those incursions can't be ruled out as the cause
of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a survivor who suffered third-degree burns on half her
body, gave the court a harrowing description of her escape from the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said she felt the building shake as a tank delivered tear
gas into the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof of the building lifted up and dropped back down,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said she tried to throw out the tear-gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hot,'' Thomas said. ``I made a few attempts. I
was able to throw one out of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas testified that she stood guard the night before the fire.
That prompted government attorney Michael Bradford to ask if she
would have shot an FBI agent trying to enter Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't use the word `shoot,''' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What word would you use?'' Bradford asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protect,'' Thomas replied.
</P>
<P>
   Thick smoke hampered her efforts to escape once the fire
started, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear rushing, screaming, crying, people praying,''
Thomas said. ``... I stopped where I was. I couldn't see anyone. I
didn't know what had happened until it got quiet. I thought maybe
they had found a way out, and I was still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire pushed her back after she entered a hallway leading to the
dining area, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making my way to the dining area, but the flames blocked
my way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire eventually caught up with Thomas, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the jacket I was wearing melting,'' Thomas said.
``By this time, my legs were moving out of control. They were
burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling her way along walls, she got lost, Thomas said. Then she
saw a ``little flicker of light,'' actually daylight, coming from a
room. She entered and escaped through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas denied that the Davidians made suicide plans on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thomas told Bradford there had been a plan to commit
suicide if Koresh died. His body was to be put on a stretcher and
taken outside, accompanied by his wives and children. Grenades
would be taken, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were the grenades going to be used for?'' Bradford asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be used to end our lives,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith instructed the jurors they were only to use that portion
of Thomas' testimony in considering whether the government acted
reasonably in not allowing firefighters to enter Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he expects to wrap up his case today.

PROPONENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S VOIDED BLANKET PRIMARY VOW TO FIND
SUBSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with SCOTUS-PRIMARY) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Supporters of the California blanket primary law that was ruled
unconstitutional Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court say they will
seek passage of a new measure that might be acceptable to the
court, yet still achieve the goal of opening primaries to more
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In blanket primaries there is only one ballot, and voters,
regardless of party, vote for candidates, regardless of party.
Republican and Democratic Party leaders, and other opponents of
such primaries, hailed the court ruling as validation of their
argument that political parties should be disciplined, cohesive
entities with the final say in who can vote in their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Fleischman, executive director of the California Republican
Party, saw the court's decision as recognition that ``our members'
right of association is paramount'' and that blanket primaries
should be consigned to history's trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking for blanket-primary advocates, Nicholas Tobey,
chairman of Californians to Protect the Open Primary, vowed that an
effort would be made to pass a new law ``as soon as our lawyers can
study the court's decision and figure out the course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning to fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Tobey and other advocates read the decision, it did not, at
first glance, make the right of association paramount and close
every door on their effort to open up the voting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly how to write the new law yet, but we
hope to have something new on the books within another year or
so,'' Tobey said. ``Best we can tell, it looks like if you keep
things as nonpartisan as possible and then send the top two
finishers in each contest on to November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana has a system along those lines,'' he added. ``The
main thing is to get more people involved, let them have a say too,
not just Democrats and Republicans, but everybody _ independents
and smaller parties, just everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   California's chief election official, Secretary of State Bill
Jones, a Republican, broke with his party and sided with the
blanket-primary advocates, warning that the Supreme Court decision
would make California, once again, a state that ``the parties
solely control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the parties are afraid of,'' said Jones, who
won office with the help of some Democratic and independent votes.
``The vast majority of their members supported this.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a 1996 ballot initiative in which
Californians overwhelmingly approved the blanket-primary system.
Until then, the state's voters could participate only in their own
party's primary, a system known as a closed primary.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat who, like Jones,
won office with the help of voters outside his party, also broke
with his party on the primary issue, saying that he would do
``everything possible'' to find a substitute blanket primary
system.

CUBAN BOY'S RELATIVES ASK SUPREME COURT TO BLOCK HIS RETURN TO
CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on a court order keeping
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, the Miami relatives of the
6-year-old Cuban boy Monday asked the Supreme Court to block his
return to Cuba pending a formal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If the court denies the request or declines to take up the
issue, Elian Gonzalez will be free to return to Cuba after 4 p.m.
on Wednesday, when a stay ordered by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Atlanta, expires.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, the boy's great-uncle,
asked the Supreme Court for an emergency stay to give the justices
at least two weeks to consider the appeal ``on a very, very fast
timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer working for Lazaro Gonzalez, challenged
the Atlanta court's ruling last week, in which it refused to
reconsider a plea to hold a political asylum hearing for the boy.
The Justice Department and Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
oppose such a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming weight of federal appellate decisions in this
country would have given Elian Gonzalez the absolute constitutional
right to an asylum hearing five months ago,'' Coffey said during a
news briefing in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, the lawyers for the Miami relatives argued
that a few additional weeks' delay in deciding Elian's fate would
be ``a minimal cost in a case with stakes of such magnitude.'' Any
burden to Elian's father ``does not outweigh the truly irreparable
harms'' that would be visited upon the boy if a stay were not
issued, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy received the appeal, which contends
that Elian was denied due process by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The boy was plucked from the waters off
South Florida on Thanksgiving Day after his mother and ten other
Cubans drowned crossing the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez took the boy to his home in Miami and, later,
refused to return him to his father. On April 22, federal agents
seized Elian and reunited him with his father. They have been
living in the Washington area ever since with Gonzalez's wife, the
couple's infant son and several of Elian's Cuban classmates and
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Given the impending deadline, Kennedy is expected to act quickly
on the request, possibly as early as Tuesday. He may handle the
case himself or refer it to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency stay like the kind sought by the Miami relatives is
rarely granted unless there is an outstanding legal problem, legal
experts said. A senior Clinton administration official who is
following the case closely predicted that Elian would return to
Cuba by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Miguel Gonzalez is not taking anything for granted, his
lawyer said Monday, and officials said he has not yet requested the
help of federal marshals or other authorities to prepare for a
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is they're all eager to see their friends and
family,'' said Gregory B. Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If the court order expires on Wednesday, Craig added, ``I don't
think there's going to be a sprint to the airport, but I think, in
a very orderly fashion, they will arrange for their departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials declined to say what sort of a reception might
await Elian in Cuba, where the government of President Fidel Castro
has raised him to the status of a folk hero. One official,
requesting anonymity, merely said that any homecoming would be
handled discreetly, without adding to ``the circuslike atmosphere''
around the boy.

PLAINTIFFS' WITNESS SAYS HE HEARD FELLOW DAVIDIAN SAY `LIGHT THE
FIRE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A member of the Branch Davidians testified on
Monday that he heard a fellow sect member say ``light the fire''
just minutes before their wood-frame headquarters erupted in flames
on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of some 80 sect members, including leader David
Koresh, were later found in the ashes of the headquarters, about 10
miles outside Waco. The fire came 51 days after a Feb. 28, 1993,
gunbattle that erupted when members of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms tried to serve search and arrest warrants on
sect members.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and six Davidians died in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Branch Davidians and their families hope to
convince U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. and an advisory jury
that the government may have contributed to the final fire. They
also hope to prove that FBI agents were negligent in preventing
fire trucks from entering the complex immediately after the fire
started.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar wrongful-death suit entered its second
week on Monday. The plaintiffs may wrap up their case as early as
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped testimony by Davidian Graeme Craddock, presented by
the plaintiffs' attorneys, appeared to support the government's
assertion that the Davidians started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock said he heard fellow Davidian Pablo Cohen say, ``Wait!
Wait! Don't pour it inside. Pour it outside.'' Then he said he
watched as Cohen rushed toward someone pouring fuel in the chapel
of the headquarters, known as Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Craddock said he heard someone yell ``light the
fire.'' When he returned to the chapel, flames were traveling up
the corner wall, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock, however, said he did not actually see anyone light a
fire, nor was he aware of any plans to start a fire or to commit
mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   After the day's testimony, lead plaintiff attorney Michael
Caddell said the plaintiffs believe that the government started two
of three fires and that the Davidians may have then started the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kennedy, a fire investigator hired by attorneys for the 100
or so plaintiffs, said the FBI tanks that destroyed much of the
Davidians' complex couldn't be ruled out as a cause of the fire.
The tanks were used to insert tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   A tank could have cut a fuel line, spreading the propane that
the Davidians used to provide light for their rooms, he said. The
destruction of the walls certainly allowed the wood to burn easier
and added air holes that fanned the flames, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make your kindling, then blow on it,'' Kennedy said.
``It's like starting your campfire out in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy testified that the government's investigation of the
fire was inadequate and that expert conclusions that the Davidians
deliberately started cannot be supported scientifically.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, sect member Marjorie Thomas testified that she
was sitting on the floor in an upstairs bedroom when she began to
feel the heat beneath her. A gap in the wooden beams allowed her to
see the flames, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, thick smoke made it impossible to see, but she
testified that she could hear ``rushing, screaming, crying, people
praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it grew quiet, and Thomas said she was afraid the others
had found a way out without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this time, my legs were moving out of control _ they were
burning,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   A glimmer of daylight allowed her to find a second-floor window
and jump out, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas testified that she never considered suicide. But
government lawyers introduced a sworn statement from a 1994 trial
in which Thomas said that she was once told by Koresh to commit
suicide and that she almost carried out his instructions before he
sent word retracting the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians had a pact that ``if David died, we were to end
our lives,'' Thomas continued in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   She said on Monday that she didn't remember making those
statements and that she was heavily medicated at the time for her
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Davidians also presented videotaped testimony
from Mira Slovak, a contractor who said he called the FBI office
near his home in Ventura County, Calif., about 10 days before the
fire to offer an armored Soviet tank that had been retrofitted with
firefighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI twice asked him to send more information, but he never
received a request for the tank, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the judge gave Caddell permission to read aloud
a portion of a March 7, 1993, memo by FBI negotiator Peter Smerick
warning the FBI commanders in Waco that using tanks could have dire
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we physically attack the compound, and children are killed,
(even by Davidians), we, in the FBI, will be placed in a difficult
position,'' Smerick wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news media, Congress, and the American people (who are
currently applauding our negotiating efforts) will ask questions:
Why couldn't you just wait them out? What threat did they pose to
anyone, except themselves? Why did you cause children to be
killed?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford, who is representing the
government, described the memo as part of a disagreement among FBI
negotiators that looks significant only in hindsight.

GONZALEZ OUT, BUT YANKS' BID FOR SOSA IS ON DECK 
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After acting decisively and boldly in an attempt to
add Juan Gonzalez to their lineup, the Yankees Monday ended their
effort with a whimper. With Gonzalez poised to join them with a
multiyear extension of his contract, the Yankees made a one-year
$12.5 million offer that insured the death of a deal with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were said to have stepped up their effort to get the
Cubs' Sammy Sosa. A person with knowledge of Yankee developments
said talks between the teams heated up Monday, but the Cubs
continued to make a steep request in both quality and quantity of
players.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Yankees did not aggressively negotiate with
Gonzalez's agent heightened suspicion that they had used him to try
to induce the Cubs to reduce their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's true,'' a baseball official said, speaking from
instinct rather than inside information. ``There's no better way of
putting pressure on the other guy than what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Gonzalez initiative has ended, the Cubs seem to
face no viable competition for the Yankees' desire to add a
productive hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees never acknowledged that they agreed last Thursday to
send Ricky Ledee and two minor league players to the Tigers for
Gonzalez, pending Gonzalez's approval, but Monday they issued a
statement saying they had been unable to ``come to terms'' with
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, his agent said Monday, was prepared to waive the
no-trade clause and sign a multiyear contract extension with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Gonzalez had said he would accept the trade but didn't
want to extend his contract beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bronner, the agent, said he informed the Yankees of the
change in his client's position Sunday, but until late Monday
afternoon, just an hour before the 6 p.m. deadline imposed on their
talks, the Yankees had made no offer. Then when they made one,
Bronner said, it was for one year, ``which we already told them we
didn't want; we wanted no extension or a long-term deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronner, speaking by telephone from Chicago minutes after the
deadline had passed, said he twice spoke with George Steinbrenner
just before the deadline and tried to persuade the Yankees'
principal owner to complete the trade without a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Randy Levine, the team president, nor General Manager
Brian Cashman returned calls seeking comment, but the Yankees did
not want to offer Gonzalez the kind of contract the Tigers did
during the winter after they acquired him from the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, Bronner said, offered an eight-year deal for $143
million, including $20 million in the eighth, or option, year,
which either the club or Gonzalez could have exercised. The package
included the potential for an additional $7 million in performance
bonuses based on awards earned by the 30-year-old outfielder, a
two-time American League most valuable player with Texas. He
preferred becoming a free agent instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said he told the Yankees what the Tigers had offered but
also told them ``it didn't have to be the same length.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I said make it something that was economically
equivalent to that.'' But the Yankees, said a person with knowledge
of their thinking, did not want to match the basic structure of the
Detroit package.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said it was in a telephone conversation they had Sunday
morning that Gonzalez changed his thinking about accepting the
trade only if the Yankees dropped their desire to have him sign a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Juan,'' Bronner related, ``and said, `If you want to
go to the Yankees, the idea of going for three months isn't going
to work for either team. They're not going to make a trade on that
basis. The Yankees want a hitter. You can wait to become a free
agent and chances are that position will be filled by someone else
and you won't have the opportunity to go to the Yankees.' So he
said he would consider a multiyear offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said he conveyed that change to Levine later Sunday,
after which Steinbrenner called and ``assured me he wanted Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when Steinbrenner has wanted a superstar, he has
pursued the player himself. In this instance, though, Bronner said
Steinbrenner told him ``his people'' were going to handle the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said he spoke with Levine a couple of times on Sunday,
but received no offer. After several attempts to reach Levine were
unsuccessful Monday, Bronner said, they finally spoke. Bronner
quoted the club executive as saying, ``We've decided we can't match
where Detroit was so we're not going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, though, Levine called with a one-year offer,
but it was too late for Bronner to relay it to Gonzalez, who was on
the field in Cleveland, before the deadline. But, Bronner said, he
knew Gonzalez would not find it acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not found the Cubs' proposed packages for Sosa
acceptable. One person close to the talks said the Cubs initially
wanted seven players for Sosa and pitcher Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the names mentioned were Ledee, who is with the Yankees,
and the minor leaguers Alfonso Soriano, D'Angelo Jimenez, and Alex
Graman, a pitcher who was the Yankees' third-round pick in the 1999
amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, were exploring a trade for Ed Sprague, a
third baseman with San Diego. &QL;

EUROPEAN OFFICIAL OPPOSES WORLDCOM-SPRINT MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO and DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top antitrust officer of the European Commission said Monday
that he would advise the commission to block WorldCom from buying
Sprint unless the companies significantly altered the terms of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In another development in the rapidly consolidating
telecommunications industry, Qwest Communications International's
$57 billion takeover of US West received final federal regulatory
approval Monday, allowing for the closure of a transaction that
nearly fell apart when Qwest considered dropping the deal in favor
of a buyout offer from another company.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Qwest's choice to conclude the deal may come at
the cost of a potentially more lucrative link-up with Deutsche
Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications concern. The German
company entered into, and then abruptly broke off, merger talks
with Qwest earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Apprehension over whether the Denver-based Qwest lost an
opportunity has grown in recent days with signs that regulatory
authorities in Europe could block WorldCom's takeover of Sprint.
That could make the No. 2 and No. 3 American long-distance
companies potential takeover targets for Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's top antitrust officer, Mario Monti, citing his concern
about the amount of Internet traffic the merged telecommunications
WorldCom and Sprint would carry, said Monday that the companies
would have to devise an ``exceptional'' remedy before the
commission's July 12 deadline to win his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lawyers for WorldCom and Sprint continued to meet
with officials from the Department of Justice Monday in an attempt
to salvage the proposed $115 billion deal that they announced in
October, according to people close to the negotiations. Among the
possibilities is the sale of Sprint's long-distance and Internet
businesses, leaving WorldCom with only the Sprint PCS wireless
division.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are worried primarily about the
effect the combination would have on phone rates within the United
States. The Europeans, meanwhile, are concerned about the size of
the companies' Internet businesses, which carry Web traffic between
local phone companies and large service providers like America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Monti, the head of the commission's competition ministry, took a
hard line Monday, saying the companies had failed thus far to make
an acceptable proposal and that the time for such plans has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deadline for remedies is over,'' he said, according to
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   He added that, with its deadline looming, the commission would
consider a new plan only under ``exceptional circumstances.'' He
declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for WorldCom and Sprint declined to comment. Shares of
WorldCom fell 25 cents, to $37.50, while Sprint's stock was down 25
cents, to $59.5625.
</P>
<P>
   For Qwest, the approval from the Federal Communications
Commission Monday came after a review of the company's plan to
divest parts of its long-distance business in 14 states, a
requirement of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Touch America, a
unit of the Montana Power Co., is buying some of Qwest's assets for
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves us in the position to complete this merger,'' said
Matt Barkett, a spokesman for Qwest. ``A deal with another company
would have to come at another time.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason a deal between Qwest and Deutsche Telekom did
not materialize was because US West was opposed to it out of
concern its own takeover by Qwest would not be finalized, a
development which could have led to a drop in the company's share
price. US West, also based in Denver, went so far as to suggest a
protracted legal battle would ensue if Qwest backed out of its
intent to acquire the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans have a hole burning in their pocket, they want to
buy something so badly,'' said Scott Cleland, the managing director
of the Legg Mason Precursor Group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's intentions to create a global network are
well known. And in an effort to expand across the Atlantic, the
company may be seeking to use its stock, which is thought to be
highly valued, as a currency to acquire a large American
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   When the Qwest-US West deal is completed, it will be the first
major combination between large local and long-distance telephone
companies. Shares of Qwest rose 56 cents to $52.9375, while US West
climbed $1.28, to $90.375. The prospects for Qwest remain bright to
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Qwest, it's either acquire or get acquired after it
digests U S West,'' said Andrew Hamerling, a telecommunications
analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``I think Qwest is
terribly attractive to any company seeking to expand.''

INVESTIGATIVE FIRM MAY HAVE WORKED FOR AND AGAINST MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL  (EDS: This story has been added
to The New York Times business front.)
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a Microsoft law firm needed help recently
in tracking down pirates and counterfeiters of the company's
software, it turned to a private investigative firm with a
reputation for coming up with sensitive information for
high-profile clients.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft was taken aback this month by reports that linked
the firm, Investigative Group International, to mysterious efforts
to obtain the trash of a pro-Microsoft trade association in
Washington, D.C., presumably looking for documents that would
embarrass the company as it fought a high-stakes antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said Monday that they had had no idea that
the firm was effectively playing both sides of the street in
working for and against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre and inappropriate that they would accept a
Microsoft anti-piracy assignment while getting paid to attack the
company with cash-for-trash tactics,'' said Vivek Varma, a
Microsoft spokesman. ``It seems an obvious conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigative Group International, based in Washington, has been
in the spotlight before, most recently when it performed
investigative work for President Clinton, including research on
Paula Jones, one of the president's accusers.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, the firm's chairman, Terry
Lenzner, said he could not remember whether Microsoft was a client.
``I'll have to check that,'' he said. ``I can't confirm we've
worked for Microsoft or any other client that hasn't been publicly
identified, but I'll look into it.'' Lenzner would not comment on
reports that his company had been investigating trade organizations
and research groups sympathetic to Microsoft. And he would not say
whether his firm had taken or paid for trash as part of such an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said its involvement with Lenzner's company began in
March, when a Microsoft law firm, Preston Gates &AMP; Ellis, retained
the company's Los Angeles office to help hunt down pirates and
counterfeiters. The firm was hired to order software and computers
and check to see if the software was legitimate, and to search
public records for evidence of dummy companies that the
counterfeiters frequently hide behind. When they found illegal
activities, they were to notify the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, the Lenzner firm and Microsoft were linked
in an altogether different connection. On June 1 and 6, a woman
identifying herself as Blanca Lopez offered to pay a cleaning crew
to hand over trash from the office of the Association for
Competitive Technology, a pro-Microsoft trade group in Washington,
according to documents from the company that manages the
association's office space. The incident was first reported by
Wired.com and The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The documents said the woman had gained entry to the building
using keys from another tenant. The tenant, Upstream Technologies,
appears to be a dummy corporation that rented the office only last
month. And the person named on a credit application for the
property, Robert Walters, has been identified in the past as an
agent for the Lenzner firm.
</P>
<P>
   A receptionist at the Lenzner firm's Washington office told a
caller Monday, ``Mr. Walters is not employed here but I can get a
message to him.'' Phone calls to Walters over the weekend and
Monday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Lenzner firm has been known to pay for or take trash on
occasion, according to a person familiar with its methods. He said
the firm had used the tactic in ``four or five'' of the 8,000 or so
cases it has investigated.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the firm had a policy of taking trash only if a
lawyer had reviewed the tactic and deemed it legal and if the
client who retained the firm had approved the actions.
</P>
<P>
   Who might have retained Lenzner's firm in an anti-Microsoft
effort is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   The trash-buying attempt at the technology association failed,
and the woman extending the offer has not been located. But
embarrassing documents from other pro-Microsoft groups have found
their way into the press in recent months, and at least two of the
groups say the documents may have been on stolen computers.
</P>
<P>
   One case involves documents that were the basis for an article
in The New York Times last September. It said that newspaper
advertisements presented as independent views backing Microsoft in
the antitrust case had actually been paid for by Microsoft. The
Times said documents showing the connection between Microsoft and
the group placing the ads, the Independent Institute, had been
provided by a Microsoft adversary associated with the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   David Theroux, president of the Independent Institute, a
free-market policy institute in Oakland, Calif., said he believed
that the documents ``were surreptitiously taken'' but ``we just
don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been through our dumpster,'' he said, ``or maybe
someone hacked into our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the intrigue, Theroux said two company laptops were
stolen from the office on June 18, 1999. He said the police
concluded that the theft appeared to be a ``professional job'' by
someone who cased the offices earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not claiming these laptops were how the information was
obtained,'' Theroux said, but he said he thought copies of the
documents were on the laptops.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Marty Reiser, a spokesman for the Citizens for
a Sound Economy, a free-market lobbying firm, said laptops were
taken from its Washington office on three occasions between
September and December. A fourth laptop was taken from its Iowa
office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Reiser said the laptops might have had information showing
Microsoft among the organization's donors _ information that later
appeared in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fairly certain there is something going on out there and
we need to be more careful,'' he said. ``It's still all very
coincidental, but who knows?''

SAMPRAS IS UNVEILING HIS OUTSPOKEN SIDE ON SPANIARDS' BOYCOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Maybe it is easier speaking from the top of
the men's draw, but Pete Sampras had little sympathy for the
boycott by Alex Corretja and Albert Costa, both of whom withdrew
from Wimbledon after being snubbed by the All England Club's
seeding system.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event to ignore the tour
rankings and create its own seedings. But if, say, the French Open
chose the same route, then the clay-court awkward Sampras could be
left with a tougher draw as a lower-seeded player _ if he was
seeded at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' response to such a situation is simple: just play.
``You know if I didn't get seeded at the French, I'd go out there
and try to do well to prove to the event that I'm worthy of being
seeded,'' said Sampras, whose best finish at the French Open was as
a semifinalist in 1996. ``You really try to rise above it instead
of being a little childish about it and going home. It's a bit
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' fault-finding with Corretja and Costa came as a bit of
a surprise considering the criticism he has received in the past
for his light tennis schedule, spotty commitment to the Davis Cup
team and noncommitment to play in the Olympics. Usually, Sampras is
more reserved in his critiques of his fellow players. But he seems
more open these days, more at ease with who he is. &UR;  &LR;  To illuminate
this further, he was asked just how he proposed to his fiancee,
Bridgette Wilson. Was he a romantic at the moment of truth?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me,'' Sampras said to a chorus of laughs. ``I'm not
so boring after all.'' Gloss Is Not a Problem
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kournikova's omnipresence inside London's tube _ adorning
posters that reveal her in a sports bra with the slogan: ``Only the
balls should bounce'' _ has only added to the hype and frenzy
surrounding the tour's It Girl.
</P>
<P>
   There is resentment by some players toward so much attention
being given to a player who has yet to win a title on the tour. But
with an eye for fashion, and love for attention-getting outfits
herself, Serena Williams dismissed those who see Kournikova as all
gloss and no game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with Anna,'' Williams said. ``I get along
with her just fine. What's the problem? I don't see a problem with
what she's doing. I don't even see what she's doing. She's just
being herself. It seems like everyone has a problem with it.''
Enjoying the Perks
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis has had her ups and downs on the grounds of the
All England Club, but she still enjoys the yearly luxuries of being
a past winner (1997). With the pedigree of Wimbledon champion, she
gets ownership of a members' badge. That is as good as the key to
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``A better parking lot,'' Hingis said, outlining her perks with
a smile. ``And you get, like, two tickets every year till you
die.'' No Excuses
</P>
<P>
   Vince Spadea's celebration Monday was Greg Rusedski's low
moment. Although he was born in Canada, Rusedski has adopted
Britain as his home. Despite having the crowd behind him, he could
not extend Spadea's record losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Like Spadea, Rusedski has struggled. Almost inexplicably, he has
been tinkering with his serve even though at around 130 miles an
hour it is one of the best in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any excuses,'' Rusedski said. ``It's
just not going very well at the moment.''  &QL;

SPADEA SNAPS HIS WRIST, AND HIS 21-MATCH DRY SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A series of match points led Vince Spadea
from his abyss only to turn into trapdoors that teased his tortured
psyche. But hour after hour, he survived the jabs at his shaken
confidence and the windburn generated from Greg Rusedski's serve.
Set after set, Spadea ignored the isolation of playing on Court 1
in front of the flag-waving Britons cheering their own and propped
up his crumbling faith.
</P>
<P>
   He just kept talking to himself between each point, lunging for
desperate lobs while tumbling on the seat of his pants and fending
off doom by relying on the one element of his game that hadn't
deserted him during his tour-record 21-match losing streak. Once
the 19th-ranked player in the world, the free-falling Spadea still
had that lion tamer's snap in his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   As the five-set match inched four minutes in front of the
four-hour mark Monday, Spadea whipped a forehand from the baseline
that darted in on Rusedski. On Spadea's fifth match point, the
10th-seeded Rusedski could only block a backhand volley long. At
that instant, Spadea raised his fists and tilted his head toward
the drab skies like a farmer celebrating the end of a drought.
</P>
<P>
   On a first day of Wimbledon that refused to fade quietly into
the night, Spadea's losing streak was snapped just before dark, at
9 p.m. Even the crowd, which supported the British transplant
Rusedski, clamored to its feet in wild applause after the 6-3, 6-7
(5), 6-3, 6-7 (8), 9-7 victory that gave Spadea his first breath of
success since October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it doesn't ever come until the time when you're not
ready for it,'' said Spadea, who had 31 unforced errors to
Rusedski's 52. ``Then all of the sudden, you're like, `Oh, my gosh,
what's happened to me?' But it was outrageous. I thought I won 16
times, man. I felt like freaking. It's been a rough year, a rough
patch in my life in tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea was just part of confidence reclamation day. Just before
Wimbledon was christened with a drizzle that stopped play for 1
hour 45 minutes, No. 1-seeded Pete Sampras shook loose the
tightness in his back and dispatched Jiri Vanek, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
Regrouping from her first-round exit a year ago, the top-seeded
women's player, Martina Hingis, put away Angeles Montolio, 6-1,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sometimes you have to _ you're searching for something,''
said Hingis, who was unfocused and flustered in a brief split with
her mother this time last year. ``You have to find your line. You
have your own ideas, your own mind. Sometimes you have to
experience things. People go to school and do worse things than
what I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was painted as the Williams sisters' arrival. Then
both vanished from sight as a Grand Slam duo after dominating the
U.S. Open. Monday, the fifth-seeded Venus Williams and her
eighth-seeded sister, Serena, looked healed from their springtime
injuries as they advanced to the second round with straight-set
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Serena was the less polished of the two in her first match since
mid-April. She labored against her Swedish opponent, Asa Carlsson,
in a 15-minute first game to hold serve, but swiftly regained her
confidence in a 6-3, 6-2 victory. With blond streaks in a mane
bound into a ponytail by a feathery tie, she looked at ease in an
environment she once believed was too stuffy for her style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did feel that way, I tell you one thing, I don't feel
that way now,'' Serena Williams said. ``I feel free. I can breathe.
I can breathe freely. This is really my surface. I play a fast
game. I can't believe it if I ever felt that way. I should be
dominating here.''
</P>
<P>
   She just might. But this wasn't a day marked by the way the
stars cruised, but about the tension created once the tarps were
peeled off the grass to clear space for two players who have been
mental wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   On Court 1, there was the anguished Spadea. On Center Court,
there was the Web site darling Anna Kournikova. Opposite
10th-seeded Sandrine Testud, Kournikova was trying to silence the
cynics who chide her glam-girl status. She was trying to stop a
yearlong ranking slide that left her unseeded at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   It was closing in on 8 p.m. when the rubbernecking between
Spadea's match and that of Kournikova bordered on ridiculous. At
the same minute, Spadea and Kournikova had match points.
Kournikova, who had frittered away service in the second and third
sets with nervous double faults and timid ground strokes, finally
composed herself. On Kournikova's fourth match point, Testud sent a
backhand into the net that allowed Kournikova to escape with the
upset, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   One hour later, Spadea finally tucked away his last match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents left,'' said Spadea, a resident of Florida. ``They
saw the draw and said, `Vince, man, good luck, but I don't know if
that will help you.' They're in Miami right now, on the Internet,
breaking the keyboard.''

PROMOTER TESTIFIES HE PAID IBF TO LIFT BAN ON SOUTH AFRICAN
FIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Cedric Kushner, the boxing promoter who grew up
in South Africa, told a jury in federal court Monday that he had
initially begun paying bribes to the leaders of the International
Boxing Federation in 1987 to get the sanctioning organization to
lift its ban on ranking boxers from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Without rankings from the IBF, Kushner said, the boxers he
represented could not qualify for lucrative televised bouts and
title fights.
</P>
<P>
   He said the IBF executive committee had met informally in 1987
to hear the plea of one of his black African boxers, who sought to
have the federation, which is based in East Orange, N.J., overturn
its policy of ignoring South African fighters because of the
country's racially restrictive apartheid system.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Kushner said, the IBF agreed to recognize and rank
black and white South African boxers and their bouts in the United
States. Kushner said he paid the IBF rankings chairman at the time,
Colin Douglas Beavers, $10,000 after the vote and continued to give
him payments of from $2,500 to $10,000 three or four times a year
until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said he had made the payments to Beavers in cash in the
belief that they were being shared with other leaders of the
sanctioning group. Asked by Jose Sierra, an assistant United States
attorney prosecuting the case, why he continued to make payments,
Kushner said he did so on the advice of Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know how it works,''' Kushner said. `` `They
could vote to change it back.' The sense was that what you paid for
didn't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner's testimony came at the start of the 10th week of the
bribery and racketeering trial of Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, the
founder and president of the boxing federation, and his son and
aide, Robert Lee Jr., 38. The two men are charged with extorting
$338,000 from fighters and their managers over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, like the promoter Bob Arum and the boxing manager
Roland Jankelson, told jurors that he made the payments to Beavers
with the understanding that he was representing Lee, whom Beavers
referred to constantly as ``the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kushner began his testimony, the graying, heavyset promoter
described his rise from a sixth grade education in Cape Town,
through a period as a merchant seaman and a Ferris wheel operator
in Asbury Park, N.J., to relative fame and fortune in the 1970s as
a promoter of rock concerts featuring the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood
Mac, Queen, the Grateful Dead and Joni Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 he began dabbling in boxing promotion. He said he had
reached out to the newly created IBF to try to alter the
international status of South African boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other promoters and managers who have testified at
the trial said that their payments to Beavers and other IBF leaders
were for specific actions by the group to favorably rate their
fighters. Kushner presented his payments as part of a broader
lobbying effort to improve the atmosphere in the United States for
South African boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was double punishment for the fighters who got no
opportunity in their own country and couldn't get any opportunity
elsewhere,'' said Kushner, who said he represented black and white
South African boxers at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said he arranged for Welcome Ncita, a black South
African flyweight, to present to the IBF executive committee the
plight of black fighters, who were forced to train without
gymnasiums and used milk cartons for gloves because ``they could
not afford proper gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever give cash to anyone of the IBF officials besides
Beavers?'' Sierra asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Kushner said, adding that he had alluded to meeting with
Beavers in some conversations with Lee as a way of indicating to
Lee that he had made some payments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had done that, Kushner said: ``I was giving the
money to make Lee happy, not Beavers. If Bob was happy, more was
going to happen.'' &QL;

SUPREME COURT TACKLES MOBILE PHONE PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday agreed to decide whether
people, including journalists, may be sued for disclosing the
contents of telephone calls that were illegally intercepted and
recorded by someone other than conversation participants.
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted a case from Pennsylvania that is expected to
help define the balance between the First Amendment right to
disseminate information, and state and federal wiretapping laws
intended to prevent people from illegally intercepting private
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania case involved a tape recording made illegally
of a mobile phone conversation that was later given to a radio
station, which broadcast it repeatedly. The case is likely to
affect a similar lawsuit brought by a Republican member in the U.S.
House of Representatives against a Democratic member for disclosing
a taped mobile phone conversation among Republican leaders about
the House ethics investigation of former Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to hear the case was one of many actions
Monday as the justices moved to conclude their term this week. The
court also agreed to revisit a North Carolina case to see if race
played too large a role in how a Congressional district was
created.
</P>
<P>
   The wiretap case involved contract negotiations between the
teachers union and the school board in the Wyoming Valley West
School District. A teacher who was president of the union was
talking on her mobile phone with the union's chief negotiator and
said that if school board members did not budge from their offer,
the teachers were going to ``blow off the front porches'' of their
homes. An opponent of the teachers union said he found a tape
recording of the conversation in his mailbox and gave it to a radio
station, which broadcast it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the union opponent nor the radio station was involved in
intercepting or taping the conversation, according to the court
record. The federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled 2-1 that
wiretapping laws could not be extended to the defendants because
that would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will have particular significance for news
organizations and will almost certainly bear on a lawsuit brought
by U.S. Rep. John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, against Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, a Florida couple taped a mobile phone
conversation in which Gingrich, Boehner and other House Republicans
were discussing matters related to Gingrich's ethics case. The
couple gave the tape to McDermott, who passed it on to the House
ethics committee. The New York Times and several other news
organizations published transcripts of the conversations. An
appeals court in the District of Columbia had ruled 2-1 that the
Boehner suit could go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania cases are Bartnicki vs. Vopper (99-1687) and
United States vs. Vopper (99-1728).
</P>
<P>
   The court also agreed to hear the appeal of a Texas woman who
was arrested, handcuffed and jailed because she and her two
children did not use seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Texas woman, Gail Atwater, contend the arrest
and jailing violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections
against unreasonable search and seizure by the police. .
</P>
<P>
   Texas law gives police the discretion to make arrests for
routine traffic violations, except for speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater was booked and placed in a cell for about an hour before
she appeared before a magistrate and paid a $50 fine, the maximum
penalty for the offense. The case is Atwater vs. Lago Vista
(99-1408).
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to consider once again how much the issue of
race may be used in drawing lines for a congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves North Carolina's 12th District, which has been
represented since 1992 by Melvin Watt, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court ruled that the 1992 boundaries were so
extraordinary as to be unconstitutional, the district was redrawn
in 1997 by the state General Assembly. Nonetheless, the new plan
was challenged as relying too heavily on race, and a three-judge
appeals court agreed, saying District 12 remained ``an
impermissible and unconstitutional racial gerrymander.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James B. Hunt of North Carolina, defending the new
boundaries, has argued that race was not the primary consideration
and that blacks make up only 46 percent of registered voters in the
redrawn district.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Hunt vs. Cromartie (99-1864) and Smallwood vs.
Cromartie (99-1865).
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court also set aside an appeals court ruling that
let public school students in an Alabama county lead group prayers
at graduations, assemblies and sports events.
</P>
<P>
   The justices told a federal appeals court in Atlanta to review
the case in light of a school-prayer decision announced last week
in a Texas case. In that ruling, the court said prayer in public
schools must be private and that such prayers at high school
football games violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Alabama enacted a law requiring public schools to allow
student-initiated prayer at ``compulsory or noncompulsory'' school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Michael Chandler vs. Siegelman (99-935)
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court rejected the appeal of a white supremacist in
Illinois who said the state bar committee that denied him a law
license violated his free-speech rights. The court rejected Matthew
Hale's arguments that Illinois had used ``orthodox religious and
political beliefs to which (an aspiring lawyer) must subscribe as a
condition of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, of East Peoria, a leader of the segregationist World
Church of the Creator, was denied a law license last summer, even
though he graduated from Southern Illinois University's law school
and passed the state bar exam. State bar officials noted that he
had ``dedicated his life to inciting racial hatred,'' and said that
``he cannot do this as an officer of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Hale vs. Committee on Character and Fitness,
99-1349.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to consider when a criminal defense
lawyer's failure to challenge a sentencing error should result in a
ruling that the defendant did not have adequate legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves Paul Glover, former vice president and general
counsel of Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers
Union, who was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy charges.
Glover has argued that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing
because his lawyer failed to challenge a sentence that was up to 21
months longer than he should have received.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Glover vs. U.S., 99-8576.

LUCIEN LAURIN, THE TRAINER OF SECRETARIAT, IS DEAD AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucien Laurin, who trained Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown
winner who was perhaps the fastest thoroughbred that ever raced,
died Monday at a hospital in Miami. Laurin, who lived in Key Largo,
Fla., was 88.
</P>
<P>
   He trained 36 stakes winners, he won an Eclipse Award as horse
racing's leading trainer in 1972 and he was inducted into the
Racing Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1977. But Laurin,
a former jockey who spent more than 40 years as a trainer, achieved
overriding fame as the man who saddled the charismatic chestnut
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1971, Laurin became the prime trainer for
Meadow Stable in Virginia. ``He had retired before I hired him,''
Penny Chenery, who bred and raced Secretariat, recalled. ``His son,
Roger, was training for me, but he moved to the Phipps family. He
said, `My dad will help you out.' I called him `my temporary
trainer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin had already captured a Triple Crown race, saddling
Amberoid, the winner of the Belmont Stakes in 1966. When he arrived
at Meadow Stable, Riva Ridge was in the process of becoming the
2-year-old champion. In 1972, Laurin saddled Riva Ridge to
victories in the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But Riva Ridge would always be second best to the handsome and
powerfully built Secretariat, who was a 2-year-old when Riva Ridge
was dominating the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Chenery would remember what happened when Secretariat was beaten
the first time he raced. ``Laurin kicked a chair across the box and
said, `Damn, he never should have been beaten.' Then I knew Lucien
thought he was a great horse.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin and his fellow French-Canadian, the jockey Ron Turcotte,
teamed up for five Triple Crown victories _ the two by Riva Ridge
and then Secretariat's epic 1973 season when he became the first
Triple Crown winner since Citation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby in record time, captured the
Preakness Stakes and then turned in one of the most memorable
performances in sports history when he captured the Belmont Stakes
by 31 lengths in 2 minutes 24 seconds, the fastest mile and a half
ever run on a dirt course in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As Chenery remembered the moment: ``When the race began, Lucien
said: `Oh my God, Ronnie, you're going too fast. This is a mile and
a half.' And then, when it was clear Secretariat had passed all the
other horses, Lucien said, `For God's sake, Ronnie, don't fall
off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin broke into racing as a jockey, winning 161 races in
Canada, including the 1935 King's Plate aboard Sir Michael. He
achieved moderate success as a jockey in New England, but then his
career almost came to an end. He was banned for life in 1938 when
stewards at Narragansett Park in Rhode Island found a buzzer _ a
device that can spur a horse with an electric shock _ in Laurin's
jacket before the start of a racing card.
</P>
<P>
   Racing authorities rejected Laurin's contention that someone had
slipped the device into his jacket while he was playing cards in
the jockeys' room.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin got a job exercising horses at Alfred Vanderbilt's
Sagamore Farm, rode briefly after the suspension was lifted in
1941, then turned to training the following year in New England,
working for Reginald Webster. He later trained for A.B. Hancock Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin resigned as trainer for Meadow Stable in 1976 but
returned to racing in 1983 as trainer and part owner of Evergreen
Stable.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his ride on Secretariat in the Kentucky Derby,
Turcotte remembered the faith that Laurin showed in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the paddock at the Derby that day, Laurin asked me, `Do you
really think he can go a mile and a quarter?' And I told him, `Yes,
but he hasn't proved it to me.' I told him, `I don't want to push
him, let him relax and gallop along.' Laurin told me, `You ride him
to the best of your knowledge, you won't be second-guessed.' He
gave me confidence. Instead of making me tense, he made me relax.
If he puts pressure on me, God knows what happens.'''
</P>
<P>
   What happened were victories at Churchill Downs that day, at
Pimlico in the Preakness and then at Belmont Park in the Belmont
Stakes that catapulted Secretariat to horse racing greatness and
Laurin to a niche as one of the sport's foremost trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could do everything,'' Laurin once said of Secretariat, who
died in 1989 at age 19. ``There was never a horse like him.'' &QL;

CHELSEA CLINTON TO DO SOME CAMPAIGNING WITH HER MOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton had her second City Hall news
conference in four days Monday, but this time she brought with her
a slight young woman who listened quietly on the edge of the crowd:
Chelsea Clinton, her 20-year-old daughter, who said she would be
campaigning on and off with her mother this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be seeing some of me,'' Clinton said shyly to reporters
who suddenly noticed her standing in their midst. She added that
she finished her junior year at Stanford University two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   As brief as they were, Clinton's words were nonetheless rare
comments from a daughter whose parents have aggressively shielded
her from the press for most of the seven and a half years that the
family has lived in the White House. She rarely appeared at her
father's side during his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the second time that Clinton has appeared in public
with her mother since the first lady began running for the Senate.
The first time was at Mrs. Clinton's campaign announcement speech
in February at the State University of New York in Purchase, where
Chelsea also appeared as a baby in a campaign video about her
mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   And although the news conference was called to publicize the
plight of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel _ and also
to put the Democratic Senate candidate in the same picture frame as
Malcolm Hoenlein, the conservative and influential Jewish leader _
one of the first questions to Mrs. Clinton was about her daughter's
plans to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to be coming and going as she chooses,'' Mrs.
Clinton replied. ``I believe in permitting her to make those
decisions. And you'll see her sometimes, which will be a delight
for me, and that's all I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Clintons' daughter has moved slowly but
increasingly into more of a public role. Last week, she stood in
for the first time for her mother at a White House arrival ceremony
for King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Although Mrs. Clinton, who was
campaigning in New York, made it to Washington in time for the
state dinner, it was her daughter who stood by the president's side
and formally welcomed the king and his sister, Princess Lalla
Meryem, as a 21-gun salute and a trumpet fanfare sounded on the
South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Clinton accompanied her father on a trip to South
Asia, and stood in for her mother at a formal arrival ceremony at
the presidential palace in New Delhi. Last summer, she vacationed
with her parents in the otherwise sleepy Finger Lakes resort town
of Skaneateles, N.Y., and was mobbed by reporters when she ventured
downtown to the library.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, her most conspicuous public role was to
walk between her parents, holding their hands, as they left the
White House for a summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard in August
1998 immediately after her father's public admission that he had
had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. While on the Vineyard, she
surfaced a few times in public, poised and gracious.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference Monday, Clinton and her mother went
separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton appeared at the news conference with Hoenlein, the
executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
Jewish Organizations. She termed the trial of the Jews in Iran a
``miscarriage of justice'' and called upon the government to
release them, including a 17-year-old boy.

TWO LEADING ONLINE GROCERS MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peach has been bagged.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland-based HomeGrocer.com, whose peach-decorated delivery
trucks have become a fixture on the streets of Seattle, was sold
Monday to rival Webvan Group Inc. in a stock deal valued at about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings together two of the leading online grocery
stores and positions the company _ to be known as Webvan Group _ as
a powerhouse in the overnight delivery of food, liquor, electronics
and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger combines the strengths of the two premier online
shopping and delivery companies both with the capabilities to
deliver the last mile of e-commerce,'' said George Shaheen, chief
executive of Foster City, Calif.-based Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   Both HomeGrocer.com and Webvan have been burning through cash as
they attempt to expand their distribution network, build brand
recognition and change the way consumers shop for everything from
fruits and vegetables to diapers and dog food. But as the two
companies spent heavily to attract customers, investors lost
patience with consumer e-commerce companies. That has caused
consolidation in the online grocery market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Safeway Inc. invested $30 million in GroceryWorks.com
while Dutch supermarket chain Royal Ahold NV spent $73 million to
bail out struggling Peapod Inc. Westwood, Mass.-based Streamline
Inc., which is backed by Nordstrom and others, announced last month
that it hired an investment bank to explore its financing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is out there with a big bag of money handing out cash
to B2C (business-to-consumer) companies,'' said Peter Swan, an
analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco. ``So to a
certain extent this merger is a function of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, with more than 4,200 employees and 264,000
customers, will have operations in nine markets with plans to
expand into four new cities by the end of the year. By merging
upcoming expansion schedules in Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,
Chicago and Bergen County New Jersey, Webvan will be able to save
between $200 million and $300 million in operational costs and $20
million to $30 million in headquarter and marketing costs. It will
also be able to compete more aggressively against brick-and-mortar
competition such as Albertsons Inc. and Safeway, both of which have
made moves onto the Internet in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the merger both companies had to expend money to win
customers from brick-and-mortar alternatives and then each had to
spend money to win the customer from each other,'' said Shaheen.
``Total spend now can be more directed on brick-and-mortar
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possible cost savings, Wall Street reacted
negatively to the news, sending shares of both companies down more
than 14 percent. Webvan fell $1.41 to close at $7.31 while
HomeGrocer.com lost $1.22 to close at $6.88. Both companies have
lost nearly half of their value since issuing shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably surprised the market,'' said HomeGrocer.com Chief
Executive Mary Alice Taylor, commenting on the dip in the stock
prices. ``There is still some digesting of what it means and how it
plays out. But this deal just makes good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   With the capital markets emphasizing profitability and the large
supermarket chains getting more serious about Internet initiatives,
HomeGrocer.com`s Taylor said the merger was a ``no-brainer.'' The
former Federal Express executive who was recruited to lead
HomeGrocer.com in September said the deal came together after
George Shaheen gave her call about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George picked up the phone, gave me call and said: `What do
you think?,' '' said Taylor. ``And that is really what got the ball
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will not have a management role in the new company,
said it was premature to discuss layoffs at HomeGrocer.com's
Kirkland headquarters. Executives at Webvan said they have made no
decisions about headcount, although it would be looking at
``eliminating headquarter redundancies.'' Plans to open a
350,000-square-foot distribution center in Kent this October are
still on track, said a Webvan spokesman. Meanwhile, the
HomeGrocer.com distribution facility in Renton will be shut down
and employees, most of whom work in delivery and grocery picking,
will be transferred to the new building.
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies Monday touted their similarities, they
have taken alternative paths in the online grocery war. Founded in
an old Bellevue warehouse by three Canadian entrepreneurs,
HomeGrocer.com has focused on quickly moving into markets and
establishing brand recognition. It currently operates seven
warehouses in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Diego and Dallas
and processes about 2,300 orders per day. Delivery trucks park
directly at the warehouses and then in midmorning begin
transporting orders to customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webvan, formed by Borders Books founder Louis
Borders, has attempted to build massive automated warehouse
facilities in the 300,000-square-foot range. Using what it calls a
spoke-and-wheel approach, the company transports goods by
semi-truck trailer to smaller distribution hubs where items are
then offloaded onto vans. Drivers deliver goods in a 30-minute
window, compared to 90 minutes at HomeGrocer.com. The company does
not bill itself as an online grocery store, but rather as a last
mile e-commerce provider, delivering everything from patio
furniture to DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned the possibility of combining the two
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen, who will remain chief executive of Webvan, said
bringing together the two companies will ``be quite seamless'' and
will ``dovetail very nicely and smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online retailer, Seattle's Amazon.com, will
be following the merger closely. Amazon holds a 21.6 percent stake
in HomeGrocer.com and has expressed interest in combining its
retailing operation with delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't to a place yet where Webvan is a direct threat to
Amazon. Amazon is seeing that and didn't want it to come up and
bite them,'' said Adam Hamilton, a research analyst with McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in the late third quarter or early
fourth quarter. Webvan will pay 1.076 shares, or about $7.86, for
each HomeGrocer.com share. Jim Barksdale, partner of The Barksdale
Group and an early investor in HomeGrocer.com, will join Webvan's
board of directors.

Woods towers over PGA Tour at midway point
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   What we know about the PGA Tour at the midpoint of the 2000
season is that nobody beats Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he might lose the odd tournament. But in the long haul, he's
so far removed from the pack these days that it's senseless to even
speculate on who might be his most legitimate challenger. There
isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   He's too talented, too strong, too long, too driven and too
smart to have any peers right now.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he reminds people from a generation older than Woods
of another young stud who already had lapped the field the moment
he arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things he's doing now are the same things Jack Nicklaus
was doing when he started out,'' says Butch Harmon, Woods' swing
coach who, at 56, has been around long enough to know what it was
Nicklaus was doing in the early '60s. ``Jack came out and was
instantly better than everybody else. And he worked hard to make
sure he stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Watson adds: ``He's raised the bar. And Tiger is the only
one who can jump over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victories continue to pile up. Woods has five of them in
2000, and getting 10 official wins this year is certainly within
his reach, something that hasn't been done since Sam Snead won 11
times in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   But the records don't mean much to Woods. He's merely in this
game for one reason _ to gauge himself against the best. And that
means using Nicklaus as a yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' 18 major championships are the ultimate goal for
Woods. The Golden Bear's 70 tour victories would be next.
</P>
<P>
   Woods already has three majors at age 24. Nicklaus also had
three at the same point in his life.
</P>
<P>
   But staying power is going to determine whether Woods can keep
pace. It won't be easy. Nicklaus averaged a major win each year
starting in 1965. He also finished second in majors 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Woods knows what is in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to try to keep getting better,'' he says.
``Mentally, that won't be a problem. I've always been strong
mentally. Hopefully, I won't have any major physical problems,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' dominance has overshadowed a number of wonderful story
lines this year on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Woods, the success of Phil Mickelson, Jesper
Parnevik and Hal Sutton would be the toast of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's performance is perhaps the most uplifting. After a
terrible run in the '90s when his golf game and personal life went
through deep depressions, he has built both back to a wonderful
level.
</P>
<P>
   He, wife Ashley and 1-year-old twin girls are the picture of
happiness, and Sutton's golf game is bulldog tough. He may not be
hitting the ball to the moon like Woods, but Sutton's staring down
of Woods during the Players Championship was the most riveting
moment in the sport this year, save for the U.S. Open blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, meanwhile, had openly lamented about not being
involved in the Mercedes Championships at the start of this year.
That tournament is only for winners from the previous year, and in
'99 Mickelson saw a streak of six consecutive years with at least
one win come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's won three times in 2000, and he, like Sutton, went
head-up against Woods and came out on the plus side when he won at
the Buick Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   As for Parnevik, he has done wonders this year, producing three
wins with his game and countless upset stomachs with his pants,
which run from putrid to nauseating in their color schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But remember this about Parnevik: He has become the dominant
European player in the states. He's better than Sergio Garcia. He
plays a full U.S. schedule, unlike Colin Montgomerie. And he's even
surpassed Fiji's Vijay Singh in international rankings. Singh was
the biggest foreign money-winner on tour last year, finishing
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss Sweden, especially during the summer,'' Parnevik said.
``But I want to play golf against the best, and that means playing
a lot in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing a lot against Woods.

WATER POLO TEAM READY FOR TUNEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ Tony Azevedo has spent his entire life
asking his father water polo questions.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ricardo Azevedo, Tony's father and former coach at Wilson
High in Long Beach, Calif., who first put his son in the pool with
a water polo ball in hand. It was Ricardo, who is now the men's and
women's coach at Long Beach State, who taught Tony the skills that
have made the younger Azevedo one of the country's best in the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Ricardo who, at least until recently, has patiently
fielded every question _ no matter how big or small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I come home these days, I have 10 more questions to
ask him,'' said 18-year-old Tony, who will be heading to Stanford
in the fall. ``I think I drive him crazy sometimes. He keeps
telling me to settle down, relax and everything will take care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions, by the way, mainly concern what to expect when
Azevedo and his teammates on the U.S. National Water Polo team get
on a plane in September for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to sleep at night, take a nap or have some
free time, it's on my mind,'' Tony said. ``It's something I've
dreamed about forever.''
</P>
<P>
   However, before that dream gets under way, the U.S. team has to
finish some work. Included in that work are five days of workouts
per week that are packaged in two-a-day sessions and can total as
much as six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The training, however, will take a back seat for the next six
days while the U.S. team takes part in a pre-Olympic dress
rehearsal known as the UPS Cup at the U.S. National Aquatic Center
in Los Alamitos.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which also includes Olympic squads from
Australia, Croatia, Yugoslovia and Italy and a team of U.S.
collegiate stars known as Team UPS, will begin at 6 p.m. today with
Croatia playing Team UPS and end with the title game at 3 p.m.
Sunday.

By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years ago, Kobe Bryant stood at a podium at
Lower Merion (Pa.) High and announced he would declare for the NBA
draft rather than accept a college scholarship to Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash was immediate. During the following few weeks,
Bryant was criticized, ridiculed and berated for shunning college
for the NBA. One national publication questioned the tactics and
motives of his parents, accusing them of vicariously living through
their gifted 17-year-old son rather than tending to his best
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pete Sampras quietly dropped out of Palos Verdes
(Calif.) High after his junior year to join the pro tennis tour.
Not a word was said. Two years later, the 19-year-old Sampras
became the youngest men's champion in U.S. Open history and
everyone applauded. Sampras never finished high school, let alone
college, and no one seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was vindicated this year when he and Shaquille O'Neal
powered the Lakers to their first NBA title in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Sampras and Bryant traveled similar paths to
stardom and success, yet their decisions were met with decidedly
contrasting reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke and I can't understand it,'' said Sonny Vaccaro,
an Adidas shoe executive. ``Every day kids leave high school to
play pro baseball or tennis and no one says anything. But a kid
goes from high school to the NBA or leaves college early for the
NBA and it's a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   !ital!Big issue? This year alone, 29 underclassmen and two high
school players are eligible for Wednesday's NBA draft. Last year,
22 players left early, and 28 came out the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Some are players you've never heard of and probably never will.
They range from college dropouts with desperate dreams to
beer-drinking frat brothers who fax their name to the NBA on a
dare.
</P>
<P>
   But many who have come out early developed into NBA stars,
including Vince Carter, Rasheed Wallace, Bryant and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim. These are losses that concern the NCAA, which is
afraid that the never-ending, ever-growing exodus of impact
freshmen and sophomores will dilute its talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, college fans followed the career arc of great
players such as Larry Bird, James Worthy and Michael Jordan,
witnessing their growth from freshmen to experienced juniors and
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the most recognizable players leave after their
first and second years, making it difficult for the NCAA to
cultivate stars. Consider: If Bryant had gone to Duke and stayed
all four years, he and former North Carolina star Vince Carter, now
with the Toronto Raptors, could have met in a titanic Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they were making millions for themselves and the NBA
while the Final Four consisted of no-names outside of experienced _
but hardly star- struck _ Michigan State, the eventual champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it's a problem,'' said Purdue coach Gene Keady. ``And
we need to come up with something to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   u u u
</P>
<P>
   Critics of players leaving school early _ or not going to
college at all _ insist players are risking an education for fool's
gold. The danger, they say, is that players find out too late that
they aren't meant for the NBA, and by the time they do, they have
nothing to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high school player declares for the NBA draft, he
forfeits his college eligibility. College players can return to
school if they aren't satisfied with their draft status but only if
they haven't signed with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers might be surprised to know that all but two of the
10 players who skipped college over the last five years made it in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a good ratio, it's a great one,'' said Vaccaro.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers aren't as good for college players who declare as
underclassmen. Last year 10 of the 22 American underclassmen went
undrafted; the year before, 12 weren't chosen.
</P>
<P>
   But that stat is misleading. For every Carter or Wallace leaving
early, there are guys such as Albert White and Adam Roberts, who
weren't highly regarded college players, let alone pro prospects.
The fact that they never made it isn't a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Kevin Garnett made immediate impacts, and over the
next few years guys such as Tracy McGrady, Jermaine O'Neal, Al
Harrington and Rashard Lewis _ all of whom spurned college and
landed jobs in the NBA _ will make their mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impresses me is how polished some of these guys are,''
said Tom Nissalke, a former NBA and ABA coach and now a Utah Jazz
broadcaster. ``It's not the same as it was a few years ago. These
kids play AAU ball year-round and travel all over. In a way they're
already professionals or semiprofessionals by the time they leave
high school. I'm impressed not just with their talent but their
maturity level.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissalke offers a unique perspective. He was the head coach of
the Utah Stars in 1974 when Moses Malone went from Petersburg (Va.)
High straight to the pros. Malone wasn't as socially advanced as
Garnett or Bryant, but physically he was more than ready to step
in. In his first year, Malone averaged 18.8 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrific from the very start,'' Nissalke said. ``He
just wasn't a very sophisticated person at that point. But
nowadays, these kids travel all over the country and people have
been giving them things since they were 12 years old. It's totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent success rate could eventually lead to trouble.
Kids see Bryant and Garnett flourishing in the NBA and they think
they can do the same. It doesn't help that their egos are stroked
by summer- and travel-league coaches with questionable motives,
many of whom try to latch onto young players, hoping for a big
payday later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens now is you've got juniors in high school rather
than in college already thinking about how quickly they can get to
the NBA,'' said San Diego State coach Steve Fisher, who coached the
Fab Five at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA coach Jim Harrick, now at the University of Georgia,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have a double-double and they come back saying, 'Hey
coach, I'm ready to go to the NBA. I'm outta here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For some _ such as Carter, Garnett and Bryant _ it's the right
decision. All three were confident they were ready. But others base
the choice on potential riches rather than ability.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, who left Michigan State in 1979 after his
sophomore year, counsels young basketball players on leaving early.
He's concerned some athletes focus on the wrong factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the part of being poor and trying to take care of
your family,'' Johnson said. ``But can you take care of them for a
long time or is this gonna be a short-range thing, because a lot of
these guys won't get drafted. It's not no shoo-in just because
you're coming out. I was a shoo-in, I already knew I was gonna be
number one. But you can't equate me to other guys. It's a whole
different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the relatively new phenomenon of high school players and
college underclassmen declaring for the draft grows, so will the
number of players who don't make it. The NBA is aware of the
danger, but legally it is handcuffed. Since the league can't
prevent someone from making a living, it just hopes players are
wise enough to gauge their ability honestly.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, who will be there to pick up the pieces when
things don't work out? ``It's a risk they take, no question about
it,'' said Jack Ramsay, a former NBA coach and general manager.
``And it's a harsh lesson to learn if it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   u u u
</P>
<P>
   If a kid averages 30 points at a small school in rural Kansas,
he thinks he can do the same at Indiana University. The inner-city
point guard with the nifty cross-over dribble is convinced he's the
next Allan Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them both and they'll tell you they'll be in the NBA
someday, convinced by their high school success and the people
around them feeding their egos.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they get to college _ !ital!if they get that far _
they think they're ready for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch a guy in the NBA on TV and they have no perspective
of how tough it really is,'' said James Hodges, who has played
professional basketball overseas for seven years. ``They see a guy
hitting a jump shot and they think they can do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges has carved out a nice career since leaving
Wisconsin-Whitewater University in 1992. By keeping things in
perspective and not overestimating his ability, he's been able to
make more money than most of his college buddies, buy a nice house
and car. He's amazed at how many players oversell themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear it all the time, see it all the time,'' Hodges said.
``So many of these guys think they should be in the NBA. The
problem is a lot of them went to a big school and they had alumni
people and boosters telling them they'll be in the league after
college. But the reality is most of these guys have no idea what it
takes to play at that level. They have absolutely no concept.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Nissalke spoke to a college basketball team as a
favor to its coach, a good friend. Nissalke urged the players to
focus on their education and the importance of having a back-up
plan should basketball not work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on that night, I had dinner with the coach and I asked
him what kind of reaction I got from his players,'' Nissalke said.
``He just sort of laughed and said, 'They all thought you were
crazy,' Everyone of those kids was convinced they'd eventually play
in the NBA. And as I recall, not one of those guys really ever had
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   u u u
</P>
<P>
   Why does anyone care if kids go from high school to the NBA or
leave college early for the potential riches of pro basketball? Why
is that an issue and not the hundreds of kids who report directly
from high school graduation to minor-league baseball or kids who
play pro tennis as teen- agers?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of hypocritical when you think about it that way,''
said Sacramento Kings executive Jerry Reynolds, a former NBA coach
and general manager. ``In the small town I grew up in Indiana, if
you had offered any of the fellas a hundred bucks and a new glove
to sign a pro contract to play minor-league baseball, I'll bet
everyone of them would have done it. I would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because college baseball and tennis are not
high-profile sports. College basketball, on the other hand, is
extremely popular. For selfish reasons, it makes sense that a UCLA
basketball fan would want his favorite players to stick around all
four years, increasing the chances the Bruins will win big.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro can appreciate that. Just don't disguise your selfish
reasoning by insisting you're more concerned about the players'
education or that the talent pool will dry up, leaving college
basketball to a bunch of 6-foot YMCA rejects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to camps all the time where there are 200 or 300
fantastic players,'' Vaccaro said. ``Basketball is like a
never-ending stream of trout fish. There are great players all over
and there's plenty to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   College basketball better hope so.

IN TRENTON, $21.5 BILLION BUDGET IS APPROVED IN COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Appropriations committees in the Assembly and
Senate Monday unanimously approved a proposed New Jersey budget of
$21.5 billion, an increase of nearly 10 percent from the spending
plan signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which awaits floor votes in both houses on Thursday,
includes another record surplus, 870 million, and $228 million more
in spending than Gov. Christine Todd Whitman requested in January.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $122 million, roughly twice as much as a year ago,
consists of lawmakers' gifts to their districts _ from $3,000 for
an electronic speed-monitoring device for Bethlehem Township to $3
million for unspecified redevelopment projects in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the budget bill, however, is a $45 million sum
requested by Whitman for aid to inner-city school districts. The
governor's spokesman, Pete McDonough, said lawmakers were expected
to appropriate that money on Thursday in a last-minute rush of
supplemental spending measures for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But that $45 million expense will reduce the surplus anticipated
for next year's budget to $825 million, well below the $850 million
Whitman has set as a minimum for New Jersey to maintain its strong
bond rating, McDonough said. That, in turn, means that the governor
will use line-item vetoes to cut at least $25 million in spending,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman will have until midnight Friday to announce her
line-item vetoes in time for the new fiscal year. But she cannot
unilaterally increase any spending, so the value of any items she
rejects will inflate the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the proposed budget authorizes spending
$21,480,950,000 in state revenue _ a 9.7 percent increase from last
year's budget law _ and $8,000,437,000 from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $228 million in additions to the budget since January,
McDonough said the governor had asked for $85 million in extra
school aid, but that lawmakers had come up with the other $143
million.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Whitman said she was concerned
about the level of ``discretionary'' spending included in the
budget but acknowledged that demands from constituents were hard to
resist in times of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a lot of nice projects out there,'' she said.
``When you have money coming in, people say, `Well why can't you
spend it? Why not do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers have relied on the booming economy to justify
their liberal spending on pet projects, Leonard Lance, the
Republican chairman of the Assembly's budget committee, sounded a
note of caution. He said income tax receipts had risen drastically
over the last four years but were ``likely to be slightly less
dramatic than in the red-hot late 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   People earning more than $100,000 a year account for 78 percent
of the state's income taxes, Lance said, and much of their earnings
in recent years has come from bonuses, capital gains or investments
instead of from salaries. ``When the economy matures, as soon as
two years from now, perhaps, that income, which is heavily
dependent on Wall Street, may not be as great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, the ranking Democrat on the budget
committee, called the size of the state budget ``unimaginable'' and
raised concerns about the state's debt burden, which will require
$1.5 billion in interest payments next year. But she signed the
bill along with the 10 other committee members, praising increases
for additional human services caseworkers and for reversing cuts in
aid to nursing homes.

HUMBERTO GORDON, 72, LEADER OF SECRET POLICE UNDER PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Humberto Gordon, who commanded the Chilean secret police
for seven years in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, died on
June 15 in his house near Santiago. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had a heart attack while under house arrest, The
Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   After having led the secret police, Gordon was a member of the
junta that controlled Chile from 1973 to 1990. Pinochet made Gordon
head of the secret police in 1980, after leftist guerrillas had
stepped up their activity. Then, as Pamela Constable and Arturo
Valenzuela wrote in ``A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet''
(1991, Norton), Gordon ``launched an all-out campaign to infiltrate
an destroy the radical left.''
</P>
<P>
   An official report has said that more than 3,000 people were
killed in the Pinochet era and that 1,000 have not been accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon died, he had retired from the army and had been
indicted in connection with the homicide of Tucapel Jimenez, a
well-known union leader. A judge had linked the slaying to the
secret police. But Gordon contended that he and his force had no
connection with the case. He had also been indicted in connection
with four other killings.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez was found slain in his car in 1982. He had been
repeatedly shot in the face, and his throat had been slashed. For
years, the case was tied up in courts by a judge with close ties to
the military, which contended that a carpenter had fatally stabbed
Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   But a Chilean munitions clerk told a court in Paris that he had
issued the murder weapons in Jimenez's slaying to four agents from
the secret police. The agents were set free, for lack of
incriminating evidence, after after a trial that brought out
information about a secret police plot to demolish opposition labor
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon married Maruja Maturana, who survives him. They had a
daughter.

EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT'S REAFFIRMATION OF THE MIRANDA
DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-MIRANDA) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the decision in
Dickerson vs. United States in which the Supreme Court held that
the core principles of the 1966 Miranda ruling may not be overruled
by Congress. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority
opinion; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the dissent. Boldface words
should be set in italics, which is how they appear in the original.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Chief Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   In Miranda vs. Arizona, we held that certain warnings must be
given before a suspect's statement made during custodial
interrogation could be admitted in evidence. In the wake of that
decision, Congress enacted (Section) 3501, which in essence laid
down a rule that the admissibility of such statements should turn
only on whether or not they were voluntarily made. We hold that
Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this court, may not be
in effect overruled by an act of Congress, and we decline to
overrule Miranda ourselves. We therefore hold that Miranda and its
progeny in this court govern the admissibility of statements made
during custodial interrogation in both state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   We begin with a brief historical account of the law governing
the admission of confessions. Prior to Miranda, we evaluated the
admissibility of a suspect's confession under a voluntariness test.
The roots of this test developed in the common law, as the courts
of England and then the United States recognized that coerced
confessions are inherently untrustworthy. Over time, our cases
recognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a
confession be voluntary to be admitted into evidence: the Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination and the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the middle third of the
20th century our cases based the rule against admitting coerced
confessions primarily, if not exclusively, on notions of due
process. . . . The due process test takes into consideration ``the
totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the
characteristics of the accused and the details of the
interrogation.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   We have never abandoned this due process jurisprudence, and thus
continue to exclude confessions that were obtained involuntarily.
But our decisions in Malloy vs. Hogan and Miranda changed the focus
of much of the inquiry in determining the admissibility of
suspects' incriminating statements. In Malloy, we held that the
Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause is incorporated in the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus applies to
the States. We decided Miranda on the heels of Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   In Miranda, we noted that the advent of modern custodial police
interrogation brought with it an increased concern about
confessions obtained by coercion. Because custodial police
interrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures the
individual, we stated that ``even without employing brutality, the
`third degree' or (other) specific stratagems, custodial
interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades
on the weakness of individuals.'' We concluded that the coercion
inherent in custodial interrogation blurs the line between
voluntary and involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk
that an individual will not be ``accorded his privilege under the
Fifth Amendment not to be compelled to incriminate himself.''
Accordingly, we laid down ``concrete constitutional guidelines for
law enforcement agencies and courts to follow.'' Those guidelines
established that the admissibility in evidence of any statement
given during custodial interrogation of a suspect would depend on
whether the police provided the suspect with four warnings. These
warnings (which have come to be known colloquially as ``Miranda
rights'') are: a suspect ``has the right to remain silent, that
anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he
has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot
afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any
questioning if he so desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted 3501. That
section provides, in relevant part:
</P>
<P>
   ``(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States
or by the District of Columbia, a confession shall be admissible in
evidence if it is voluntarily given. Before such confession is
received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of
the jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness. If the trial
judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shall
be admitted in evidence and the trial judge shall permit the jury
to hear relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness and shall
instruct the jury to give such weight to the confession as the jury
feels it deserves under all the circumstances.

TWO LEADING ONLINE GROCERS MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peach has been bagged.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland-based HomeGrocer.com, whose peach-decorated delivery
trucks have become a fixture on the streets of Seattle, was sold
Monday to rival Webvan Group Inc. in a stock deal valued at about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings together two of the leading online grocery
stores and positions the company _ to be known as Webvan Group _ as
a powerhouse in the overnight delivery of food, liquor, electronics
and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger combines the strengths of the two premier online
shopping and delivery companies both with the capabilities to
deliver the last mile of e-commerce,'' said George Shaheen, chief
executive of Foster City, Calif.-based Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   Both HomeGrocer.com and Webvan have been burning through cash as
they attempt to expand their distribution network, build brand
recognition and change the way consumers shop for everything from
fruits and vegetables to diapers and dog food. But as the two
companies spent heavily to attract customers, investors lost
patience with consumer e-commerce companies. That has caused
consolidation in the online grocery market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Safeway Inc. invested $30 million in GroceryWorks.com
while Dutch supermarket chain Royal Ahold NV spent $73 million to
bail out struggling Peapod Inc. Westwood, Mass.-based Streamline
Inc., which is backed by Nordstrom and others, announced last month
that it hired an investment bank to explore its financing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is out there with a big bag of money handing out cash
to B2C (business-to-consumer) companies,'' said Peter Swan, an
analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco. ``So to a
certain extent this merger is a function of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, with more than 4,200 employees and 264,000
customers, will have operations in nine markets with plans to
expand into four new cities by the end of the year. By merging
upcoming expansion schedules in Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,
Chicago and Bergen County New Jersey, Webvan will be able to save
between $200 million and $300 million in operational costs and $20
million to $30 million in headquarter and marketing costs. It will
also be able to compete more aggressively against brick-and-mortar
competition such as Albertsons Inc. and Safeway, both of which have
made moves onto the Internet in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the merger both companies had to expend money to win
customers from brick-and-mortar alternatives and then each had to
spend money to win the customer from each other,'' said Shaheen.
``Total spend now can be more directed on brick-and-mortar
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possible cost savings, Wall Street reacted
negatively to the news, sending shares of both companies down more
than 14 percent. Webvan fell $1.41 to close at $7.31 while
HomeGrocer.com lost $1.22 to close at $6.88. Both companies have
lost nearly half of their value since issuing shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably surprised the market,'' said HomeGrocer.com Chief
Executive Mary Alice Taylor, commenting on the dip in the stock
prices. ``There is still some digesting of what it means and how it
plays out. But this deal just makes good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   With the capital markets emphasizing profitability and the large
supermarket chains getting more serious about Internet initiatives,
HomeGrocer.com`s Taylor said the merger was a ``no-brainer.'' The
former Federal Express executive who was recruited to lead
HomeGrocer.com in September said the deal came together after
George Shaheen gave her call about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George picked up the phone, gave me call and said: `What do
you think?,' '' said Taylor. ``And that is really what got the ball
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will not have a management role in the new company,
said it was premature to discuss layoffs at HomeGrocer.com's
Kirkland headquarters. Executives at Webvan said they have made no
decisions about headcount, although it would be looking at
``eliminating headquarter redundancies.'' Plans to open a
350,000-square-foot distribution center in Kent this October are
still on track, said a Webvan spokesman. Meanwhile, the
HomeGrocer.com distribution facility in Renton will be shut down
and employees, most of whom work in delivery and grocery picking,
will be transferred to the new building.
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies Monday touted their similarities, they
have taken alternative paths in the online grocery war. Founded in
an old Bellevue warehouse by three Canadian entrepreneurs,
HomeGrocer.com has focused on quickly moving into markets and
establishing brand recognition. It currently operates seven
warehouses in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Diego and Dallas
and processes about 2,300 orders per day. Delivery trucks park
directly at the warehouses and then in midmorning begin
transporting orders to customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webvan, formed by Borders Books founder Louis
Borders, has attempted to build massive automated warehouse
facilities in the 300,000-square-foot range. Using what it calls a
spoke-and-wheel approach, the company transports goods by
semi-truck trailer to smaller distribution hubs where items are
then offloaded onto vans. Drivers deliver goods in a 30-minute
window, compared to 90 minutes at HomeGrocer.com. The company does
not bill itself as an online grocery store, but rather as a last
mile e-commerce provider, delivering everything from patio
furniture to DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned the possibility of combining the two
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen, who will remain chief executive of Webvan, said
bringing together the two companies will ``be quite seamless'' and
will ``dovetail very nicely and smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online retailer, Seattle's Amazon.com, will
be following the merger closely. Amazon holds a 21.6 percent stake
in HomeGrocer.com and has expressed interest in combining its
retailing operation with delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't to a place yet where Webvan is a direct threat to
Amazon. Amazon is seeing that and didn't want it to come up and
bite them,'' said Adam Hamilton, a research analyst with McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in the late third quarter or early
fourth quarter. Webvan will pay 1.076 shares, or about $7.86, for
each HomeGrocer.com share. Jim Barksdale, partner of The Barksdale
Group and an early investor in HomeGrocer.com, will join Webvan's
board of directors.

 WASHINGTON: the circumstances. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness
shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the
giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between
arrest and arraignment of the defendant making the confession, if
it was made after arrest and before arraignment; (2) whether such
defendant knew the nature of the offense with which he was charged
or of which he was suspected at the time of making the confession;
(3) whether or not such defendant was advised or knew that he was
not required to make any statement and that any such statement
could be used against him; (4) whether or not such defendant had
been advised prior to questioning of his right to the assistance of
counsel; and (5) whether or not such defendant was without the
assistance of counsel when questioned and when giving such
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence or absence of any of the above mentioned factors
to be taken into consideration by the judge need not be conclusive
on the issue of voluntariness of the confession.''
</P>
<P>
   Given 3501's express designation of voluntariness as the
touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warning
requirement and the instruction for trial courts to consider a
nonexclusive list of factors relevant to the circumstances of a
confession, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress
intended by its enactment to overrule Miranda. Because of the
obvious conflict between our decision in Miranda and 3501, we must
address whether Congress has constitutional authority to thus
supersede Miranda. If Congress has such authority, 3501's
totality-of-the-circumstances approach must prevail over Miranda's
requirement of warnings; if not, that section must yield to
Miranda's more specific requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The law in this area is clear. This court has supervisory
authority over the federal courts, and we may use that authority to
prescribe rules of evidence and procedure that are binding in those
tribunals. However, the power to judicially create and enforce
nonconstitutional rules of procedure and evidence for the federal
courts exists only in the absence of a relevant act of Congress.
Congress retains the ultimate authority to modify or set aside any
judicially created rules of evidence and procedure that are not
required by the Constitution. But Congress may not legislatively
supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution.
This case therefore turns on whether the Miranda court announced a
constitutional rule or merely exercised its supervisory authority
to regulate evidence in the absence of Congressional direction.
Recognizing this point, the Court of Appeals surveyed Miranda and
its progeny to determine the constitutional status of the Miranda
decision. Relying on the fact that we have created several
exceptions to Miranda's warnings requirement and that we have
repeatedly referred to the Miranda warnings as ``prophylactic,''
and ``not themselves rights protected by the Constitution,'' the
Court of Appeals concluded that the protections announced in
Miranda are not constitutionally required.
</P>
<P>
   We disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion, although we
concede that there is language in some of our opinions that
supports the view taken by that court. But first and foremost of
the factors on the other side that Miranda is a constitutional
decision is that both Miranda and two of its companion cases
applied the rule to proceedings in state courts to wit, Arizona,
California and New York. Since that time, we have consistently
applied Miranda's rule to prosecutions arising in state courts. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda opinion itself begins by stating that the court
granted certiorari ``to explore some facets of the problems of
applying the privilege against self-incrimination to in-custody
interrogation,  &UR; and to give concrete constitutional guidelines for
law enforcement agencies and courts to follow &LR; .'' In fact, the
majority opinion is replete with statements indicating that the
majority thought it was announcing a constitutional rule. Indeed,
the court's ultimate conclusion was that the unwarned confessions
obtained in the four cases before the court in Miranda ``were
obtained from the defendant under circumstances that did not meet
constitutional standards for protection of the privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional support for our conclusion that Miranda is
constitutionally based is found in the Miranda court's invitation
for legislative action to protect the constitutional right against
coerced self-incrimination. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the
point where the warnings have become part of our national culture.
While we have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have
undermined their doctrinal underpinnings, we do not believe that
this has happened to the Miranda decision. If anything, our
subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the Miranda rule on
legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision's core
ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the
prosecution's case in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of the Miranda rule is that statements which
may be by no means involuntary, made by a defendant who is aware of
his ``rights,'' may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defendant
go free as a result. But experience suggests that the
totality-of-the-circumstances test which 3501 seeks to revive is
more difficult than Miranda for law enforcement officers to conform
to, and for courts to apply in a consistent manner. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We conclude that Miranda announced a constitutional rule that
Congress may not supersede legislatively.

   FROM THE DISSENT &QC;  By Justice Antonin Scalia
</P>
<P>
   Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of
judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will
doubtless greet today's decision as a paragon of moderation, since
it declines to overrule Miranda vs. Arizona. Those who understand
the judicial process will appreciate that today's decision is not a
reaffirmation of Miranda, but a radical revision of the most
significant element of Miranda (as of all cases): the rationale
that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury vs. Madison (1803) held that an act of Congress will not
be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the
Constitution of the United States. That was the basis on which
Miranda was decided. One will search today's opinion in vain,
however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what
3501 prescribes _ the use at trial of a voluntary confession, even
when a Miranda warning or its equivalent has failed to be given _
violates the Constitution. The reason the statement does not appear
is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd,
inasmuch as 3501 excludes from trial precisely what the
Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but
also that justices whose votes are needed to compose today's
majority are on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is
not a violation of the Constitution. And so, to justify today's
agreed-upon result, the court must adopt a significant new, if not
entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law. As the
court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can
be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the
Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision
of this court that announced a constitutional rule. As I shall
discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in
the context of this case is that this court has the power, not
merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it
regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the
states. That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power,
and it does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only a small step to bring today's opinion out of the
realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning:
The court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that
Miranda is a constitutional decision, that Miranda is
constitutionally based, that Miranda has constitutional
underpinnings, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm
today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by Miranda
warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the
United States. It cannot say that, because a majority of the court
does not believe it. The court therefore acts in plain violation of
the Constitution when it denies effect to this act of Congress. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   It was once possible to characterize the so-called Miranda rule
as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the
statute here before us permits _ the admission at trial of
un-Mirandized confessions _ violates the Constitution. That is the
fairest reading of the Miranda case itself. The court began by
announcing that the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial
custodial interrogation, itself a doubtful proposition. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Miranda was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the
fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core
premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the
right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have
an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial
interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion. Moreover,
history and precedent aside, the decision in Miranda, if read as an
explication of what the Constitution requires, is preposterous.
There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding
that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who
already knows all of the rights described in the Miranda warning,
is anything other than a volitional act. And even if one assumes
that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing
even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent,
it cannot conceivably require the right to have counsel present.
There is a world of difference, which the court recognized under
the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in Miranda, between
compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from
foolishly doing so of his own accord. Only the latter (which is not
required by the Constitution) could explain the court's inclusion
of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be
knowingly and intelligently waived. Counsel's presence is not
required to tell the suspect that he  &UR; need &LR;  not speak; the
interrogators can do that. The only good reason for having counsel
there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he
 &UR; should  &LR; not speak.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is
likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules that courts must
exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without
interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on
his right to remain silent or initiated by police after the suspect
has expressed a desire to have counsel present. Nonthreatening
attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial
decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart
the product of anything other than the suspect's free will. Thus,
what is most remarkable about the Miranda decision _ and what made
it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional
interpretation in the Marbury tradition _ is its palpable hostility
toward the act of confession per se, rather than toward what the
Constitution abhors,  &UR; compelled  &LR; confession. The Constitution is
not, unlike the Miranda majority, offended by a criminal's
commendable qualm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity. For
these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the
Miranda dissents and in the subsequent works of the decision's many
critics, any conclusion that a violation of the Miranda rules
 &UR; necessarily  &LR; amounts to a violation of the privilege against
compelled self-incrimination can claim no support in history,
precedent or common sense, and as a result would at least
presumptively be worth reconsidering even at this late date. But
that is unnecessary, since the court has (thankfully) long since
abandoned the notion that failure to comply with Miranda's rules is
itself a violation of the Constitution.

 WASHINGTON: the Constitution. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the court today acknowledges, since Miranda we have
explicitly, and repeatedly, interpreted that decision as having
announced, not the circumstances in which custodial interrogation
runs afoul of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment, but rather only
prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled
self-incrimination. Of course the seeds of this prophylactic
interpretation of Miranda were present in the decision itself. In
subsequent cases, the seeds have sprouted and borne fruit: The
court has squarely concluded that it is possible _ indeed not
uncommon _ for the police to violate Miranda without also violating
the Constitution. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is simply no longer possible for the court to conclude, even
if it wanted to, that a violation of Miranda's rules is a violation
of the Constitution. But as I explained at the outset, that is what
is required before the court may disregard a law of Congress
governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court. The court
today insists that the decision in Miranda is a ``constitutional''
one; that it has ``constitutional underpinnings,'' a
``constitutional basis'' and a ``constitutional origin''; that it
was ``constitutionally based''; and that it announced a
``constitutional rule.'' It is fine to play these word games; but
what makes a decision ``constitutional'' in the only sense relevant
here _ in the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by
Congressional legislation such as 3501 _ is the determination that
the Constitution  &UR; requires &LR;  the result that the decision announces
and the statute ignores. By disregarding Congressional action that
concededly does not violate the Constitution, the court flagrantly
offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and
arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of
the people.
</P>
<P>
   The court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by
misdescribing these post-Miranda cases as mere dicta. The court
concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that
supports the view that Miranda's protections are not
constitutionally required. . . . The second way the court seeks to
avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim
responsibility for reasoned decision making. It says: ``These
decisions illustrate the principle not that Miranda is not a
constitutional rule but that no constitutional rule is immutable.
No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the
various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and
the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a
normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they
assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of various
circumstances, they can be modified; they assuredly can. The issue
is whether, as  &UR; mutated  &LR; and  &UR; modified, &LR;  they must  &UR; make sense. &LR; 
The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents
this court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving
thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits
or offends its collective fancy. And if confessions procured in
violation of Miranda are confessions compelled in violation of the
Constitution, the post-Miranda decisions I have discussed do not
make sense. The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a
violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution. If,
for example, as the court acknowledges was the holding of Elstad,
the traditional fruits doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases
(that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be
excluded from trial) does  &UR; not &LR;  apply to the fruits of Miranda
violations; and if the reason for the difference is not that
Miranda violations are not constitutional violations (which is
plainly and flatly what Elstad said); then the court must come up
with some  &UR; other &LR;  explanation for the difference. (That will take
quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is  &UR; not  &LR; clear on the
face of the Fourth Amendment that evidence obtained in violation of
that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it is clear on
the face of the Fifth Amendment that unconstitutionally compelled
confessions cannot be used.) . . .
</P>
<P>
   Today's judgment converts Miranda from a milestone of judicial
overreaching into the very Cheops' Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx
would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance. In imposing its
court-made code upon the states, the original opinion at least
asserted that it was demanded by the Constitution. Today's decision
does not pretend that it is and yet still asserts the right to
impose it against the will of the people's representatives in
Congress.

   MONEY IN MAY
</P>
<P>
   Big money continues to roll into the Republican Party. Data
released Monday show that in May the party and its committees
raised $12.2 million in soft money. That brought the party's
fund-raising total for the 2000 election to $106 million. The
Democratic soft-money totals have not yet arrived at the Federal
Election Commission. But data that include some of May's
fund-raising has the Democratic soft-money total at $86.4 million.
Republicans received many checks in the $200,000 and over level,
with most coming from Texans and Californians, according to Public
Disclosure Inc., a company that tracks campaign contributions.
Texans with open checkbooks were David Saperstein of Five S capital
($250,000), J. Virgil Waggoner of Sterling Chemicals ($250,000) and
Richard D. Kinder of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ($240,000). As a
group, the other big givers were from Oregon, especially timber
companies. Their combined contributions to Republicans came to $1.3
million.

   LETTER HELPS OPPONENT
</P>

   To help the Democrats pick up one of the six seats they need to
regain control of the House, Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver
sent out a fund-raising letter in March on behalf of Ken Toltz, the
Democrat challenging Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo, a freshman Republican
from Colorado's Sixth District. But the letter, which urged
financial support for Toltz, a businessman in his first run for
office, and characterized Tancredo as ``a right-wing extremist,''
has helped raise more than $50,000 for Tancredo. His campaign
mailed the same letter to Republican loyalists, hoping that other
things Webb had to say, like, ``This race could decide the majority
in Congress,'' might work to Tancredo's advantage. So far, it has.
``And we're not finished yet,'' said Dave Pearson, Tancredo's
campaign manager. ``Money is still coming in.''

ABC NAMES ITS BOXING ANALYST PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC named Alex Wallau, one of its longest-serving executives,
who also is be the network's boxing analyst, to the position of
president of the ABC Television Network on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau will be responsible for most of ABC's business and
programming divisions, including news, entertainment and sports. He
succeeds Patricia Fili-Krushel, who left ABC three months ago to
become chief executive of the consumer division of Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau, who has served as interim president since the departure
of Fili-Krushel, will report to Robert Callahan, the president of
the ABC Broadcast Group. Previously Wallau had been president of
ABC's administration and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau said Monday he would retain the duties of that job. ``I'm
not replacing myself in that position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau also said he would continue to serve as the on-air
analyst for boxing matches covered by ABC Sports, a role he has
performed since 1986. ``I do enjoy it,'' Wallau said. ``I find
boxing to be a good metaphor for being president of a network.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that ABC broadcasts few boxing events now. Wallau
did the commentary on a match on June 17, but that was the first he
had done in more than a year. And he said ABC Sports had no other
boxing matches scheduled at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   What is scheduled for Wallau is a move from New York to Los
Angeles. As with other senior positions in ABC's management, the
job of president was moved to Los Angeles after the network became
part of the Walt Disney Co., which is in Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said the necessity to move to Los Angeles was one
factor in her decision to leave ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau said Monday, ``This does mean a move to the West Coast,
and I'm looking forward to that, even though I'm a New Yorker and I
know I'll be moving back someday in my dotage.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he would be in New York frequently since so many
of the network's divisions, including news, sports, and advertising
sales, would continue to be based in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau expressed confidence in the current leaders of ABC's
programming division, and singled out the entertainment division
under Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun for being ``ahead of the pack''
in the current trend toward reality shows imported from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed confidence that ABC's hit game show, ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,'' would continue to ``have great impact.'' The
show is being expanded to four nights a week starting in the fall.

MUMMY'S CT SCAN AN EYEOPENER FOR MUSEUM RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Nellie,'' the Burke Museum's resident Egyptian
mummy, slid through a wrap of red laser light into the white vault
of the University of Washington's high-speed CT scanner.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant 2,000 years of mystery fell away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's CT scan, a first for both the mummy and the medical
center, revealed missing bones, a healthy set of teeth, a better
guess on her age, and a few other surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data we got is just overwhelming,'' said Laura Phillips,
the Burke's archaeology collections manager. The museum asked for
the CT scan to help figure out a strategy for preserving the mummy,
which has become more fragile from years on display.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Burke has owned the mummy since 1902, no one knew
much about what was underneath the elaborate linen wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have guessed that the mummy is the remains of a
non-royal adolescent woman who lived during the Ptolemeic period
between 305 and 34 B.C., a period that concluded with the reign of
Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scan today shows all the growth plates were fused, so she
probably died as an adult,'' said Dr. Udo Schmiedl, the University
of Washington radiology professor who read the CT scan. He and the
museum staff hope that the 800 or so images collected during the
scan will yield additional information about how ``Nellie'' lived
and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her teeth were in remarkably good condition,'' said Phillips.
That could indicate she died at a relatively young age.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also learned that someone had inserted a metal rod
into the chest cavity to stabilize the body. And there may be other
modern materials, such as plaster or rubber, filling out her chest
cavity.
</P>
<P>
   The new materials were most likely added during investigations
in 1916 and 1962, when museum staff rummaged through the mummy's
remains for gold and amulets, said Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   What they found instead were two water lily bulbs, symbols of
immortality, that were wrapped inside the mummy's chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   The museum still has the lily bulbs, along with the bones that
were removed during those investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the data gathered Monday added to the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   One leg, for example, is shorter than the other, and researchers
are puzzled over a dense substance in the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear yet whether it was put there during the
embalming, or was part of later efforts to stabilize the mummy,''
said Linda Roundhill of Arts and Antiquities Conservation in
Woodinville, Wash., the expert hired to do the mummy's
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, the gender of the mummy is still a guess.
Generations of schoolchildren have known her as ``Nellie,''
apparently nicknamed after Nellie Cornish, founder of the Cornish
College of the Arts here.
</P>
<P>
   The museum hopes to X-ray the pelvic bone, which was removed
earlier, to settle the question of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the earlier probes, everyone involved in Monday's CT scan
took care not to disturb the mummy.
</P>
<P>
   The mummy arrived near dawn in an unmarked gray funeral company
van, driven by Bill Metcalf of Wiggen &AMP; Sons Funeral Home &AMP;
Crematory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought her over the right way,'' said Metcalf, who watched
solemnly while medical technicians and museum staffers readied the
mummy for her ride into a 21st century version of a sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   First she was lifted gently out of a powder blue coffin box,
then laid on the gliding platform in front of the ``square donut''
that houses the X-ray tubes, detectors and electronics. Technicians
used laser beams to center her exactly in the field of the
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   As the scan progressed, the distinct image of a skull appeared,
and the small crowd of medical staff who had gathered to see the
unusual patient suddenly hushed. The crowd murmured remarks as each
new anatomical landmark appeared in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was just the gray-shaded image of her toes on the
screen, like a footprint fading in sand.
</P>
<P>
   Frany Backus, granddaughter-in-law of Manson Backus, the
University of Washington regent who donated the mummy to the museum
nearly a century ago, watched the images unfold from a front-row
perch next to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Friends raised more than $27,000 for the conservation project
and presented the money to the museum as a gift in Frany Backus'
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people will be struck by the contemporariness of her
life,'' said Backus, 85, who wore a purple hat for Monday's
occasion. ``Still, after 2,000 years, she has an influence, and
she's expanding the minds of people who see her.''

RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FORMING BIOLOGY STUDY CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three large New York research institutions will form
a $160 million biology research center, paid for in part with a
donation from an anonymous patron.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a venture by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, Rockefeller University and the Weill Medical College of
Cornell University, is the latest of several efforts among major
New York medical and research centers to collaborate on large
scientific projects.
</P>
<P>
   Joint projects, anathema in New York research circles only a few
years ago, have become increasingly necessary as the cost of such
work has skyrocketed and as the work has become too complex for
most centers to undertake on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The new joint initiative, known as the Tri-Institutional
Research Program, is expected to be announced Tuesday. It is to
consist of shared laboratories and equipment and will recruit
faculty members from all over the country in the next five to 10
years to conduct research that will focus on chemical,
computational and cancer biology.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, although not the largest to a medical institution, is
especially substantial for an anonymous donor.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, New York's medical schools, hospitals and research
institutions have guarded their own research. States like Maryland
and California, on the other hand, have invested more public and
private funds in the development of biological research and product
development and have reaped huge financial and intellectual
rewards.And New York, once the the biggest recipient of federal
grants, has slipped to third. Not a single New York research
institution was chosen to participate in the human genome
sequencing project, whose results were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these three institutions had done this 10 years ago,'' said
Arnold Levine, president of Rockefeller University, ``we might have
been one of the centers in which genome sequencing would have
occurred. We have now found that we must collaborate to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major collaborations have been announced in the last few
years by New York's medical research centers. One is the New York
Structural Biology Center, a consortium of 10 medical institutions
using magnets to study molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, the Academic Medicine Development Co., was formed
a few years ago with 34 institutions around the state for joint
purchases and research. Among its projects is a $12 million cancer
study that will track the health habits of 300,000 residents.
Another is the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York, which
works with manufacturers on drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome project has raised the bar for all medical
researchers and pushed them to collaborative efforts to advance
scientific research, leaders from the three institutions in the new
venture said Monday. ``Having the chance to interact more easily
with neighboring colleagues is a tremendous boon,'' said Harold
Varmus, president of Sloan-Kettering.

DEVELOPMENT THREATENS HUDSON RIVER VALLEY, GROUP WARNS
</HEADLINE>
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ The Hudson River Valley, with its lush
views and rich cultural landscape, has become one of the most
endangered historic sites in the country because of encroaching
development by electrical utilities and other industries, the
nation's largest privately run preservation group warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit group
based in Washington, chose the verdant, 125-mile stretch from New
York City to Albany for its annual list of most endangered places
for the first time since it began compiling it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the fact that there was such a large threat,'' said
Richard Moe, president of the trust. ``This could amount to a
reindustrialization of the Hudson Valley and undo a lot of the
progress that has been made if development isn't checked.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 11 historic sites were chosen for this year's list,
culled from more than 100 nominated by environmentalists and local
government officials. The preservation group said Monday that
several proposed power plants, along with growing suburban sprawl
along the Hudson River, threatened to pockmark the serene landscape
made famous by the 19th-century painters of the Hudson River
School.
</P>
<P>
   A power plant in Athens, for instance, would tower over Olana,
the home of the painter Frederic Edwin Church. Gov. George Pataki
approved plans this month for the $500 million plant.
</P>
<P>
   Another half-dozen power plants have been proposed for the
region in the next few years, as well as a growing number of
superstores and several factories, including a $300 million cement
plant in Greenport. A Wal-Mart superstore has been proposed for a
site across from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde
Park.
</P>
<P>
   While some environmentalists and advocacy groups have opposed
these projects, Pataki and many business leaders have argued that
development will bring economic relief to a region that has been
struggling since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Reinfurt, vice president of the Business Council of New
York State, a lobbying group that represents 5,000 companies,
dismissed the suggestion that the Hudson Valley has become
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, industry is indeed part of the heritage of the
Hudson Valley, and quite frankly, we're delighted to see the return
of the steel cranes in Albany and elsewhere,'' he said. ``There is
a modest growth, but certainly not growth that threatens, in any
way, our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Pataki, said the governor has
worked to protect the natural resources of the Hudson Valley at the
same time that he has pushed economic development. For instance, he
said, the state has spent more than $256 million to clean and
protect the Hudson River since Pataki took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McKeon said, the governor appointed a task force to
study development issues in the valley and elsewhere around the
state. But several environmentalists and advocacy groups said
Monday that the state had not done enough to limit development
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmland is being consumed at an alarming rate, urban
sprawl is moving up the Hudson like a wave, and big-box retail
stores are being built on the outskirts of towns and sapping the
vitality of our villages and urban centers,'' said Ned Sullivan,
executive director of Scenic Hudson, an advocacy group.

RULING ON N.J. HATE CRIME LAW `SLAP IN FACE,' RESIDENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With SCOTUS-HATE-CRIME)  By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mattie Harrell pointed to the second story of her gray stucco
house to a handful of pockmarks gouged out by bullets in 1994 _
indelible evidence that when she and her family moved that year to
the outskirts of Vineland, N.J., they were not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   After five incidents of gunfire in five months, Harrell said she
and and her family _ the first African-Americans in the
neighborhood _ felt some sense of justice later that year when the
police arrested Charles Apprendi Jr., a pharmacist who lived about
a mile away on the same street.
</P>
<P>
   A judge, invoking New Jersey's hate crimes law, determined that
Apprendi had been motivated by racial bias and sentenced him to 12
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court, after hearing an appeal of
Apprendi's case, struck down a part of that law, saying that only a
jury can decide whether a crime is motivated by bias.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell, who continues to live with her three children in the
house on Chestnut Street, said the gunfire had caused her family
tremendous pain _ pain that was renewed by the high court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tore the whole family up,'' she said after learning the
court decision Monday. ``We will never be the same. Today is a slap
in the face as far as being a minority goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm with an unlawful
purpose and unlawful possession of a bomb, which would have brought
him a sentence of 5-10 years. But prosecutors asked for a harsher
penalty under the state hate crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court said it was
unconstitutional for the judge to have ruled that the offense was a
hate crime. New Jersey officials, however, said that with
legislative fine-tuning, the 10-year-old law could be modified to
pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders said they
would change the law to reflect the decision, which struck down
only part of the state's Ethnic Intimidation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph O'Neill, said, ``The bias crime law
carries a social stigma, a stigma that you're a racist. I think
that deserves a decision by someone's peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi has served five and a half years of his sentence and is
now in a halfway house, his lawyer said. He was not available for
comment. O'Neill said his client would go before a jury for a new
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gochman, a deputy state attorney general who represented
New Jersey before the Supreme Court, said she believed that there
were two other New Jersey cases in which defendants had received
longer sentences because a judge had found them guilty of bias
crimes. They will also have to return to the trial court for new
sentences.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: THE COURT REAFFIRMS MIRANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed one of the finest
legacies of Chief Justice Earl Warren's era _ the court's Miranda
ruling of 1966, which requires police to advise suspects of their
rights before beginning an interrogation. Seven members of the
court chose to uphold Miranda's constitutional vitality, and the
majority decision was written by one of the court's more
conservative members, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. That should
help discourage future efforts to portray Miranda's sensible
safeguards against coercion as an extreme and extraconstitutional
``milestone of judicial overreaching,'' which is how Justice
Antonin Scalia sought to depict them in a dissent joined by Justice
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose from an appellate court ruling in Virginia last
year. That court said that courts were no longer obliged to exclude
evidence in federal cases when the police neglect to remind
suspects that they have a right to have a lawyer present and to
remain silent, and that any statement they make can be used against
them _ a legal incantation that most viewers of television crime
shows can recite by heart. The appellate decision rested on an
obscure 1968 law providing that a confession is admissible as long
as it is ``voluntarily given'' in light of ``all the
circumstances'' _ regardless of whether the suspect was read his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But as the court has now ruled, the core principles of Miranda
are grounded in the Fifth Amendment's privilege against
self-incrimination and the 14th Amendment's promise of due process.
Thus Congress cannot undo it. As the chief justice noted,
``Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this court, may not
be in effect overruled by an act of Congress.'' In declining the
invitation to overrule Miranda, the court also said that a
departure from precedent required extraordinary circumstances not
present in the case at hand. The court confessed that it might not
have imposed the Miranda rule were it addressing the issue for the
first time. Nevertheless, it wisely decided against tampering with
a rule that has added an important measure of consistency and
fairness to police work, and has ``become part of our national
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In another important ruling on Monday, the court invalidated
California's ``blanket'' primary. Under this system, Californians
were given a single ballot from which they could choose a candidate
from any party, regardless of their own party affiliation. The
court found this system to be a violation of the parties' rights of
association _ that is, each party's right to control its nominating
process. The question of whether the associational rights of
political parties should take precedence over the state's
countervailing First Amendment interest in encouraging broad voter
participation is a closer call than the court's 7-to-2 split
suggests. The political parties have a strong interest in defining
their identity. But the nomination process is not a private matter,
but an integral part of the system for choosing government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The court studiously avoided applying its ruling to the 20
states that use a less drastic form of open primary to choose
candidates, so the new ruling is unlikely to be the last word on
the matter.

VOTE IN ZIMBABWE SHOWS OPPOSITION MAKING BIG GAINS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs for writethru.)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Supporters of the opposition party cheered
and danced on Monday as election results from the weekend's
parliamentary elections showed their fledgling party making
unprecedented gains on the governing party that has dominated
Zimbabwe for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The final result was unclear, but with more than three quarters
of the vote in Tuesday from counting stations across the country,
tallies quickly established that the nine-month-old party had
become a powerful opposition force in Zimbabwe _ a feat considered
unimaginable just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For years, President Robert Mugabe's governing party has
controlled all but three seats in Parliament. But the new
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, easily
surpassed that figure, winning 48 seats and claiming lopsided
victories in urban districts, where voters have been squeezed by
skyrocketing inflation and deepening unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the early returns, it appeared that the governing party
would likely maintain its majority as it carried 51 mostly rural
districts, where the party's support has traditionally been
strongest. Mugabe was also guaranteed 20 appointed seats, giving
him at least 71 seats in the 150-member Parliament. The local
chiefs elect 10 members.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results reflected nothing short of seismic
realignment in the political landscape here, laying bare the
weaknesses of the governing party and of its chief, Mugabe, 76, an
aging leader who has been widely viewed as unassailable for nearly
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   And the vote also demonstrated the unexpected power of an
energized, urban electorate that shook off the political apathy of
recent years and carried its frustrations directly to the ballot
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have wanted the landslide in the urban areas to have
extended to the rural areas, but no matter what the climate will
never be the same here again,'' Ian Makone, an official in the
MDC's election directorate, said in an interview early this
morning. ``It's never going to be the one party system that it was.
That's a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts predicted the votes would continue to split
along urban and rural lines for the 120 parliamentary seats that
were up for election as the counting continued through the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had contended all along that they would
maintain their majority, but they publicly acknowledged that for
the first time they had misjudged the mood and needs of people in
the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not being swept away by these elections, but we're
getting a kind of wake-up call,'' said Jonathan Moyo, the spokesman
for the governing party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front, known as ZANU-PF. ``They're doing better
than I expected them to. It's a reality check for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and party officials had campaigned heavily on the pledge
that they would make good on their promise to redistribute fertile
land, which is still mostly owned by a tiny white minority here.
They supported the invasions of hundreds of white-owned farms by
black squatters and were widely blamed for condoning a campaign of
intimidation and violence that left at least 26 people dead, most
of them opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the message clearly had little appeal for urban voters, who
had grown weary of fuel shortages, corruption and unfulfilled
promises. And here in the capital and in the second-largest city,
Bulawayo, people flocked in droves to the new party that promised
an improved economy and clean government.
</P>
<P>
   There were casualties on both sides. The losers included Morgan
Tsvangirai, the leader of the MDC; Dumiso Dabengwa, Mugabe's
minister of home affairs; and Emmerson Mnangagwa, the justice
minister. All three lost their seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The first results, which had been expected on Monday afternoon,
trickled in slowly in the evening. In a nation where elections have
been characterized by voter apathy in recent years, about 60
percent of the more than 5.8 million registered voters cast ballots
during the polls on Saturday and Sunday, and election officials
were quickly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnout was just too large, overwhelming,'' Tobaiwa
Mudede, the Registrar General, said this afternoon. ``They have not
started counting.''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation waited anxiously, the officials spent hours
checking ballot boxes and ballot slips for any evidence of
tampering or election rigging. Angry young supporters of the
opposition grumbled suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, observers from the European Union had condemned
Mugabe's party, accusing it of supporting the violence and
intimidation that marred the run-up to the vote last weekend. And
on Monday, the government quickly deployed police officers around
the country to prevent any outbreaks of violence and urged the
public to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   The observers made it clear that the two days of peaceful voting
had done little to allay the concerns spawned by months of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calls for peaceful campaigning and efforts to restrain party
supporters, including war veterans, were often ambiguous,'' said
Pierre Schori, the head of the European Union observer mission.
``Overall, the conduct of the government has failed to uphold the
rule of law and compromised law enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the night reportedly passed peacefully, with most
people glued to televisions and radios, waiting nervously for
results to come in. It was the first time since blacks won majority
rule in 1980 that an opposition party had challenged the governing
party in every district.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the first time in nearly two decades that many voters
had gone to sleep without knowing for sure what the morning's
election result would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long night, a long wait,'' Makone said
yesterday. ``We're going to be very strong in the urban areas. But
it's going to be a nail-biting experience.''

ANGELS EXPECT GLAUS TO GET BACK AT IT TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Troy Glaus, after starting the first 73 games, missed
his second consecutive game Sunday with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia again said he held out the third baseman
as a precautionary measure and expects him to play tonight when the
Anaheim Angels open a critical three-game series in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who leads the Angels with 24 homers and 57 runs scored,
had a light workout before Sunday's game with hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher, but Scioscia said he didn't consider letting Glaus pinch
hit to test it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have (batting practice),'' Scioscia said. ``I didn't
think it was wise to throw him out there after he sat for a few
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Downplaying it: Darin Erstad, with 16 homers, is just three
shy of his career high, but he doesn't get too excited about his
first-half power surge. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I had 18 at the All-Star break _ check the
numbers,'' said Erstad, who extended his hitting streak to 11 games
Sunday with two singles. ``I ended up with 19. Yeah, the home runs
are up, but I'm not going to concern myself with that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting a chance: Two seldom-used pitchers performed well in
mop-up duty Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Pote, making his first appearance in 16 days, allowed two
hits, an unearned run and struck out three in 1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Turnbow, the right-hander the Angels acquired through
the Rule V draft _ which requires them to keep him on the
big-league roster all season _ allowed a homer to Jay Canizaro, the
first batter he faced, and then allowed just one more hit and no
runs in three innings. Turnbow walked four and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie, who pitched a scoreless ninth inning, has allowed
one earned run in his last 13 innings. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A HISTORIC CHANCE FOR CONSERVATION

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   The most important land conservation bill in many years is now
before the United States Senate, and time is running out. The bill,
which passed the House in May by a resounding margin despite the
opposition of the House Republican leadership, would set aside
nearly $3 billion a year, most of it guaranteed, to buy parks and
open space, provide wildlife protection and restore damaged
coastlines. The House bill was largely the handiwork of two members
who rarely agree on anything _ California's George Miller, a
Democrat and staunch conservationist, and Alaska's Don Young, a
Republican who has been fighting environmentalists for most of his
career but who, on the verge of retirement, has done a a surprising
about-face.
</P>
<P>
   A similar burst of bipartisan harmony will be necessary to get
the bill through the Senate before the political campaign swings
into high gear and makes meaningful legislation all but impossible.
If they can reconcile their differences, senators as diverse in
philosophy as Frank Murkowski of Alaska, who often tangles with
environmentalists, and the more liberal Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico
can both emerge as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will not impose new taxes. For its financing it relies
on the same mechanism that has underwritten the government's main
land acquisition program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, for
35 years _ royalties from offshore oil production, mainly in the
Gulf of Mexico. These royalties now amount to about $4 billion
annually, of which three-fourths would be applied to this bill.
There is an interesting symmetry here _ dollars raised by depleting
one natural resource would be used to protect others.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill would help cities develop parks and
recreation areas, compensate state and local governments for lost
tax revenue when they buy land from private owners, and offer
incentives for improving habitat for endangered wildlife. But it is
the two main sections of the bill that most concern the
administration, which generally supports the measure, and are most
at issue in the Senate. One section would beef up the Land and
Water Conservation Fund by dividing $900 million between the
federal government and the states to buy ecologically valuable
land. The other section would provide $1 billion in aid to states
like Louisiana and Alaska, ostensibly to restore coastal areas
damaged by offshore drilling operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sections need work. As presently written, neither the House
nor Senate version guarantees funding for federal purchases under
the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is the only part of the
bill where funding is not guaranteed, reflecting the bias of many
Western senators and property rights advocates against further
enlargement of public lands. This must be fixed. Some of the most
important public purchases in recent years _ protecting Yellowstone
National Park and buying up the Headwaters redwood forest, for
example _ have been federal projects.
</P>
<P>
   The coastal provision, meanwhile, is flawed by loose language
that could actually allow states to build the kind of
infrastructure projects like roads and port facilities that ruined
the coastlines in the first place. This is exactly what the bill
should not allow. In Louisiana, for example, the roads, pipelines
and navigation channels built by the offshore oil industry have
created havoc in the Mississippi Delta, where fisheries are
declining and wetlands are disappearing at a rate of 20,000 acres a
year. The language must be tightened to insure that the money is
earmarked exclusively for restoration purposes with strict federal
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   These fixes would turn what is now an ambitious bill into a
measure of lasting consequence.
