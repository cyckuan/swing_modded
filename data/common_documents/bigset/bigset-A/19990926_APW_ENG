<HEADLINE>  Evidence of E. Timor Torture Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The device found Sunday in a military  
barracks was crude, but no doubt effective: two teaspoons attached 
with tape to a chunk of wood and two wires. One wire ran to an 
electrical plug, the other presumably to a torture victim. 
</P>
<P>
	As Indonesian troops depart East Timor and hand over control to  
the international peacekeepers who arrived Sept. 20, evidence of 
torture -- and executions -- is slowly mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of two men, who U.N. officials said apparently had  
been executed, were exhumed Saturday from graves in Tibar, a hamlet 
seven miles east of the capital Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, a headless body was found in a water well.  
Locals said 20 more bodies may also be inside. Nearby, in what 
residents said was a torture chamber, there were bloody trails 
where victims, still alive, were allegedly hung on meathooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The discoveries add weight to calls for the United Nations to  
send forensic specialists to investigate alleged atrocities in East 
Timor for a possible international criminal tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	But their task will be daunting. Officials in East Timor say  
evidence is being lost to decomposition and fires allegedly being 
set by departing Indonesian soldiers. There also have been 
unconfirmed reports of bodies dumped at sea and the limbs of other 
torture victims thrown into sewers to make identification 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed in East  
Timor in recent weeks as militiamen -- backed by elements of the 
Indonesian military -- rampaged through the territory in retribution 
for East Timorese voting overwhelmingly Aug. 30 for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has long been accused of human rights abuses in the  
half-island territory, particularly against pro-independence rebels 
and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence leaders claim torture, by electric shock and other  
means, was used frequently by Indonesian troops on suspected 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bodies that were exhumed Saturday before video cameras  
were found by international police officers and a doctor working 
for the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, which oversaw the 
ballot and was forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said Sunday that evidence  
suggested the men had been executed: one man had been stabbed 
upward through the chin, the other shot through the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need for an investigation by proper forensic experts who  
can examine the evidence we found is very urgent,'' Wimhurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff of the multinational force, said  
it does not have the capacity or the mandate to fully investigate 
reported atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	The head on the peacekeeping force, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove,  
said Sunday he has asked the commander of Indonesian forces in East 
Timor to hold soldiers suspected of war-crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the ones alleged to have been involved in some of the  
worst present crimes ... are on their way out of the province, and 
we've asked for those people to be investigated and if necessary 
held where they are at the moment, which I understand may be 
Kupang,'' in West Timor, Cosgrove told Australian television. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was hopeful action would be taken.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is world interest in these events ... it is in the great  
advantage of Indonesia and the Indonesian military to get to the 
bottom of these allegations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Market To Limit Share Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Fearful of panic-selling on the Taipei  
Stock Exchange, officials said Sunday night they will impose 
emergency limits on how far shares can fall in reaction to the 
killer earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been closed since the quake struck Tuesday. It  
reopens Monday, and analysts expect a steep dive in prices on 
concerns about economic fallout from the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said individual shares temporarily  
will be allowed to fall by no more than 3.5 percent each day -- half 
the usual daily limit of 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiu said the new limits will ``ensure that market order can be  
sustained.'' The emergency measure will last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that Taiwan's 1999 economic growth will be cut  
to around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent. Interest rates and unemployment could rise as the island 
struggles to bounce back from the quake that killed more than 2,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said information about the quake's impact on  
Taiwan's listed companies is still sketchy, making it difficult for 
investors to make informed decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiu said Taiwan's ``comparatively vigorous'' economy can soon  
recover from problems brought on by the quake. He urged investors 
to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This short-term move will pass quickly,'' he said. ``It will  
not go so far as to cause any panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors around the world are most concerned about the quake's  
impact on Taiwan's crucial semiconductor industry. Manufacturers 
here make 10 percent of the world's chips and about 80 percent of 
the ``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor makers did not suffer much physical damage at  
their plants. They are located mostly in northern Taiwan, far from 
the quake's epicenter in the central part of the island. But power 
blackouts kept them out of business last week and it remains 
unclear how soon they can be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will need to recalibrate the sensitive manufacturing  
equipment, and even if the plants get back into business in the 
next few days, the companies will have lost at least a week's worth 
of production. That could lead to supply glitches in the global 
computer industry, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Loroupe Sets Women's Marathon Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Aided by three male pacesetters, Kenya's Tegla  
Loroupe broke her world record in the women's marathon by four 
seconds Sunday, winning the Berlin Marathon in 2 hours, 20 minutes, 
43 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to win,'' the 4-foot-10, 88-pound Loroupe said.  
``I didn't expect the record. I was so tired around the (halfway) 
mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe had set the previous mark of 2:20:47 at Rotterdam,  
Netherlands, on April 18, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Her record gave the Berlin Marathon the fastest times in history  
for men and women. Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa set the men's record 
of 2:06:05 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe, a two-time New York City Marathon winner, was about 30  
seconds off her Rotterdam pace at 21.7 miles of the 26.2-mile race. 
She was having problems with her left leg and with fatigue. Then, a 
downhill slope to the finish helped her. 
</P>
<P>
	She reached 24.8 miles only three seconds off her best mark and  
started a final kick that had thousands cheering near the finish 
line in downtown Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago, I ran the last 10 kilometers in practice, so I  
knew exactly where I was,'' Loroupe said. ``The crowd really helped 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a race that attracted about 26,500 runners, Kenya's Josephat  
Kiprono won the men's division race with the third-fastest time in 
history, 2:06:44. He ran alone for most of the second half of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	His only challenge came when Japan's Takayuki Inubushi closed  
within five seconds of him at 21.7 miles. The little-known Inubushi 
then fell back and wound up second at 2:06:57, the fifth-fastest 
ever and a Japanese record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the Japanese was going to catch me, but I knew I had  
enough in reserve,'' Kiprono said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiprono's time is topped only by that of da Costa and South  
African Gert Thys, who clocked 2:06:32 Feb. 14 at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Samson Kandie was third at 2:08:34 and Morocco's Hicham  
Chatt fourth at 2:09:56. 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe, the dominant women's marathoner in recent years, had  
said she wanted to set the record in her Berlin debut and was 
hoping to crack the 2:20 barrier. She ran out front with her three 
Kenyan pacemakers from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	With the three men calling out splits and running ahead as a  
shield when headwinds blew on some streets, Loroupe was 90 seconds 
ahead of her Rotterdam pace early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But she ran into trouble just after the halfway point, where she  
was timed in 1:06:04, gradually falling behind her previous world 
record pace until regaining her speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marleen Renders of Belgium, the 1998 champion, finished second  
at 2:23:58, a national record. Russia's Svetlana Zakharova was 
third at 2:27:07. 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe had been given the entry No. 219, as in 2:19:00, with  
both organizers and the Kenyan hoping she would become the first 
woman to break 2:20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry I didn't run 2:19,'' Loroupe said. ``I tried so hard  
but it didn't work. But now I know I can run 2:19.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe collected $28,000 for winning and another $100,000 for  
the record.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Underwood Found Bleeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins defensive end Dimitrius  
Underwood was found on a city street Sunday, bleeding from a neck 
wound that police described as a life-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was cut. We're still investigating the nature of the  
injury,'' said Sgt. Linda Doherty-Wright, a Lansing police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood disappeared from the Minnesota Vikings training camp  
after one day this summer. When he was found he talked of giving up 
football for the ministry but signed with the Dolphins after being 
released by Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty-Wright said police discovered Underwood lying on a  
street about two blocks south of the state capitol in downtown 
Lansing about 12:45 p.m. The site was near a park and a library and 
about a block from the business district. 
</P>
<P>
	He was taken to Sparrow Hospital for surgery. WLNS-TV reported  
he was in stable condition, but a hospital spokeswoman declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing police said Underwood had been arrested Saturday night  
and released on bond, but said it had no information on what the 
charge was because he had not been arraigned. A message was left at 
the home of Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III. WLNS-TV and WSYM-TV 
reported that Underwood had been arrested on a charge of failing to 
pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has 17-month-old twins who live with their mother in  
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was arrested about 7 p.m. Saturday and taken to the  
Ingham County Jail in Mason. About 10 p.m., an unidentified woman 
posted his $500 bond. But he declined to leave immediately, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stayed up in the jail about an hour after the bond was  
posted, and we had to kick him out,'' Ingham County Sheriff Gene 
Wrigglesworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Kay Van Ellis told the newspaper that the woman who  
bailed him out waited 45 minutes, then went home and returned about 
11:45 p.m. and left with Underwood. She said that Underwood had 
been deep in conversation with another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Free Press reported that Underwood was shirtless when he was  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Dimitrius has been admitted to Sparrow Hospital, and  
we will be getting additional information about him tomorrow,'' 
Dolphins vice president of media relations Harvey Greene said. 
``Our hopes foremost are about his health, but until we have 
additional information, it would be premature for the club to 
comment on his situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were not scheduled to play this weekend and Greene  
said all the players had the weekend off. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was taken with the 29th overall pick in the draft by  
Minnesota out of Michigan State, but he disappeared from the 
Vikings' training camp after one practice. He considered a career 
in the ministry after leaving the Vikings, and they released him 
Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	He was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams passed  
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings, and he's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the 
first season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during an exhibition game  
and missed several weeks of practice. He was expected to begin 
working out again this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Nick Saban said he was deeply concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and our prayers are with Dimitrius and we hope  
for a full recovery,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Backs Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday  
he will recommend President Clinton sign a $288.9 billion defense 
bill, satisfied about resolving concerns over a new nuclear weapons 
agency and a department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last week overwhelmingly agreed to the changes, which  
came in response to months of allegations about Chinese espionage 
at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was in a defense bill that raises military  
pay and offers a 4.4 percent across-the-board increase in Pentagon 
spending, including more money for military housing and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that the troops get their pay raise and ... this  
is an important national security bill,'' Richardson said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can interpret the provisions so there are clear  
lines of responsibility and the secretary is in charge and we 
protect our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would set up a separate, semiautonomous agency  
within the Energy Department -- the National Nuclear Security 
Administration -- to oversee the government's nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization plan grows from months of controversy about  
lax security at the Energy Department and the alleged theft by 
China of nuclear warhead secrets from the labs, dating back 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents believe the new agency would streamline control over  
nuclear weapons programs and provide increased accountability for 
security and counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has argued that the new agency would be given too  
much autonomy and would interfere in security and 
counterintelligence improvements he already has made in response to 
Chinese espionage concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House on Thursday signaled a willingness to approve  
the bill after Clinton heard from key GOP senators and met with 
Richardson. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the time there had been 
no formal decision about signing the measure, but ``we're going to 
continue to work through this.'' That still was the case Sunday, 
the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Decorum Breaks Down At Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The staid 72-year tradition of the Ryder  
Cup could not hold up to a 45-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
	When Justin Leonard sank the putt that would win the cup,  
decorum broke down. Most of the seven American players, caddies and 
some officials stormed the green to embrace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people lining the fairway and leaning over the back  
of the bleachers on the 16th hole cheered riotously. 
</P>
<P>
	And then a strange and awkward silence overcame those on and  
around the green of the 17th hole. A realization that Jose Maria 
Olazabal still had to putt, still had a chance to equal Leonard. 
Mark O'Meara told his teammates and the others to get off the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd quieted, and Julie Crenshaw, wife of team captain Ben  
Crenshaw, sat down and began to cry, first out of respect for the 
shattered gentlemanly tradition of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry they got on the green,'' she said to Jarmo Sandelin,  
a European team player. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too much,'' he said with a frown and a shake of his  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Europeans later agreed, expressing anger that  
the Americans and their wives ran across Olazabal's line when he 
still had a 25-foot putt that could change the outcome. He missed 
to seal his team's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans quickly collected themselves after the  
celebration, slightly embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think those things happen on a golf course anywhere,''  
Olazabal said. ``You show respect for your opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, who was heckled throughout the tournament by  
fans, was outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not believe what I saw on the 17th green,'' the  
Scotsman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Crenshaw apologized and said the storming of the green was  
inappropriate. Tom Lehman apologized, too -- partially. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was over-exuberance, no question about it. It wasn't a good  
thing. Sometimes you get carried away,'' he said. ``But the 
Europeans celebrated a lot at Valderamma. Today it was their turn 
to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Olazabal missed, the crowd roared again. A few hands were  
shaken, and Davis Love III pulled the flagstick from the hands of a 
jubilant caddie and put it back with a look of irritation. Payne 
Stewart and Montgomerie were still to play the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard looked stunned as he moved on to 18, followed by most of  
the American players and wives. Julie Crenshaw and her husband, who 
also was crying, found each other heading for the 18th and 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will look back often on the moment. And the  
Europeans will not forget it either, all of them because of the 
defeat and some for the Americans' reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the most disgusting thing I've ever seen,'' Sam  
Torrance of England, a former Ryder Cup player, told Sky 
Television. ``This is not sour grapes. ... Tom Lehman calls himself 
a man of God. His behavior today has been disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Americans' celebration, Julie Crenshaw had  
gotten a glimpse of the hard feelings. She had gone up to O'Meara 
after he sank a putt on 17, and she got a glare from his opponent, 
Padraig Harrington, who was probably going to be conceded an 
18-inch putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harrington didn't have to putt. The hole was over, but it was  
a good reminder that we have to behave properly even under such 
intense circumstances,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might have been too much to ask, even at The Country  
Club, a founding member of the United States Golf Association and 
one of the nation's most exclusive clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the players later climbed out of the windows of the  
third floor of the men's locker room and onto a porch below to 
spray champagne on fans and sing the national anthem with them.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Sunday's Ryder Cup Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- A look at play Sunday, the final day of  
the Ryder Cup: 
</P>
<P>
	 *Big comeback:* The biggest final day comeback win in Ryder Cup  
history was clinched not when Justin Leonard sunk a long putt on 
17, but when Jose Maria Olazabal missed his. 
</P>
<P>
	 *The way to win:* American players won the first six matches  
Sunday, igniting the comeback from an 8-4 deficit. The final tally 
on the day was 8 1/2-3 1/2 points, giving the United States a 14 1/2-13 1/2 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Shot of the day:* Leonard's putt that went into the hole and  
touched off a premature celebration by U.S. players and their wives 
and girlfriends. They ran out on the green to embrace Leonard and 
it took several minutes before Olazabal could putt again. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Big comeback:* Leonard was 4-down when he won the 12th hole,  
and he won the next three holes to get even. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Payday:* There was none for the U.S. team, despite protests  
earlier. Each player got a $5,000 stipend to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Biggest Win:* Davis Love III's 6 and 5 win over France's Jean  
Van de Velde was the biggest margin of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	 *What's next:* The 2001 Ryder Cup will be held at The Belfry in  
England. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quotable:* ``I might have rang up the bomb squad, I guess.'' --  
European captain Mark James on how to stop the American surge.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Open Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Monday after  
finance officials from major industrialized nations expressed 
concern over the Japanese currency's rapid rise. Tokyo stocks 
rebounded slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.60 yen, up 1.18 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 104.17 yen on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 43.47  
points, or 0.26 percent, to 17,015.20 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 454.03 points, or 2.62 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's advance followed the weekend  
meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven industrialized 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, the G-7 countries said in a statement that  
they ``shared Japan's concern about the potential impact of the 
yen's appreciation for the Japanese economy and the world 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials believe that the yen has strengthened too  
much and could derail a budding economic recovery. A higher yen 
makes it harder for Japanese exports to compete in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has bought dollars in its currency markets several times  
this summer to curb the yen's gains, but without success. As 
recently as May, the greenback bought more than 124 yen, but the 
dollar since has fallen about 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the expression of shared concern at the Washington  
meeting, Japan could still not get a clear pledge from other G-7 
members for joint action to weaken the surging yen. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reiterated at an IMF  
meeting in Washington on Sunday that Japan needs to continue steps 
to promote domestic demand-led growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.32 yen, up from  
109.55 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher as investors welcomed  
the dollar's rise after a weekend meeting of finance ministers and 
central bankers from the G-7 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 includes the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy,  
Canada, France and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei shed a total of 1,061.06 points over the past two  
sessions on worries about the continued strengthening of the yen 
and sharp falls in U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,279.33 points, down 39.26, or 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 16.61 points, or 1.16 percent, to 1,447.03. 
The TOPIX closed down 48.86 points, or 3.3 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7000 percent. Its price 
rose 0.17 point to 100.17.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Tells GOP To Nominate Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan relented not an inch Sunday on  
foreign policy views criticized by fellow Republican presidential 
hopefuls and made a modest proposal for the GOP to end his 
dalliance with the Reform Party: nominate him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Buchanan chastised members of both parties --  
``especially the Republicans'' -- for being ``braying donkeys of 
interventionism.'' He said the United States should apologize to 
Russia for the ``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, the West today is making the same mistakes in  
Europe that he wrote about in a new book, ``A Republic, Not an 
Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are repeating the errors that led to World War II, and for  
heaven's sake, stop it before World War III,'' Buchanan said on 
``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book entered the national political debate last week  
because of its questions about the United States' entry into World 
War II against Nazi Germany. It said Adolf Hitler's Third Reich was 
no threat to the United States after 1940, and Allied guarantees to 
Poland brought war to the continent and gave the Soviet Union's 
communist government two extra years to prepare for Germany's 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rivals Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Steve  
Forbes have questioned Buchanan's writings in highly critical 
terms. McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's departure 
from the party. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Buchanan said he needs at least three more weeks  
before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a candidate for the Republican nomination, but I'm  
clearly thinking about going for the Reform Party nomination,'' 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the Republicans could keep him in the GOP, Buchanan  
said with a laugh: ``They could offer me the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runner George W. Bush said in an interview Friday that he  
wants Buchanan to remain Republican, although he disagreed with his 
opinion that the German threat to the United States ended after 
Hitler lost the Battle of Britain in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading GOP senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said the  
Republicans are paying too much attention to Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we ignored Pat,'' Specter said, ``that would be the  
best course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan predicted the notice his book has gotten would aid his  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may have hurt (me) in some quarters, of people who don't  
understand or who believe that Pat Buchanan is pro-Hitler or 
something like that. But overall, I think it is going to help'' by 
energizing his most loyal followers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed that ``the perception has been created, and it is  
false,'' that he is in some ways soft on Hitler. The perception 
``is rooted in malice and ignorance and not in a single line in 
that book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the book, which he described on CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' as ``a boring, scholarly work on foreign policy,'' was 
meant to sound an alarm to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reduce our commitments to fight in all these  
ridiculous little places around the world. We need to rebuild the 
military to where it was when Ronald Reagan had it,'' he said on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he said, ``we need to let nations know clearly, if you  
fool with the United States, you have had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said expanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic and  
Hungary was a mistake. It violated commitments, made as late as the 
Bush administration, that NATO would not extend to Eastern Europe 
if Russia left the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We double-crossed the Russians,'' Buchanan said.  
</P>
<P>
	As president, Buchanan said, he would offer Russia a deal:  
promise to leave alone the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia, and NATO will not expand farther eastward.

<HEADLINE> Air Jammer Shortage Strains Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHIDBEY ISLAND NAVAL AIR STATION, Wash. (AP) -- In the stifling  
heat of Saudi Arabia, Cmdr. Dave Woods tried to cool his jets until 
June 22, the expected end of his Navy Prowler aircraft squadron's 
duty in the desert and the start of a family vacation after 
returning to Whidbey Island. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not to be: The order came for Woods and his crews to  
extend their stay, an indication of how stretched the Pentagon is 
in some combat specialties -- electronic warfare, in Woods' case. 
</P>
<P>
	He makes no complaint despite trading time on California's Lake  
Shasta for an extended stay at Prince Sultan Air Base, flying extra 
missions to help enforce a ``no fly'' zone over southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also is stretched thin in other areas, from Air  
Force crews for AWACs radar planes that direct air battles and U-2 
spy planes, to spare parts supplies. These shortages are forcing 
the military, in the Prowler's case, for example, to order stopgap 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes there just aren't enough of them,'' says Cmdr. Herb  
Arnold, the chief staff officer for Whidbey's Electronic Attack 
Wing, which deployed virtually all of its Prowlers during the NATO 
air war against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler is the military's only airborne jammer of both radar  
and communications. It is essential to ensuring the safety of 
fighters, bombers and other planes within range of anti-aircraft 
forces like the Russian-made SA-6 surface-to-air missiles that 
threatened NATO aircraft during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Designated the EA-6B and built by Northrop Grumman Corp., the  
Prowler has the basic frame of the now-retired A-6 attack plane, 
with the addition of a rear cockpit and its electronics gear. The 
plane, which no longer is in production, also is equipped to fire 
HARM missiles that home in on air defense radars. 
</P>
<P>
	With the advent of stealth technology in the 1980s, the Pentagon  
figured it would have less need for jammers because the new-era 
fighters and bombers were to be virtually invisible to enemy 
radars. That has not proved true, however, as the air war in Kosovo 
this year showed. Even B-2 bombers, making their combat debut with 
the world's most advanced stealth technology, got jammer support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've learned that stealth is not going to be  
enough,'' says Fred May, a Boeing Co. engineer who is technical 
director of the company's bid to build a new-generation stealth 
fighter for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculate this futuristic fighter, known as the Joint  
Strike Fighter, could take on the electronic warfare role when the 
Prowlers retire in about 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stealth works a lot better'' if it is supported by jamming,  
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Navy is sinking hundreds of millions of  
dollars into a major upgrade of the Prowler to give it new wings 
and more powerful jamming. The Navy also is bringing back into the 
active fleet some of the planes it ``retired'' earlier this decade. 
There are 96 Prowlers flying now, and the Navy expects to raise 
that to 104 by the end of the year. Just a few years ago there were 
only 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of the squeeze on Prowlers:  
</P>
<P>
	--Early in NATO's airstrikes, a Prowler squadron operating from  
Turkey to support enforcement of the ``no fly'' zone over northern 
Iraq was pulled to help in Kosovo. The Air Force then temporarily 
suspended patrols in the north of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Whidbey contingent of Prowlers was so pressed for crews in  
April that instructors from the base's Electronic Attack Weapons 
School were deployed -- an extraordinary step. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those instructors, Lt. Chuck Sparks, teaches the art of  
electronic jamming, which is the Prowler's central function. Sparks 
and so many colleagues shifted to Aviano Air Base in Italy for NATO 
duty that the weapons school had to cancel a 10-week course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a ripple effect throughout the fleet,'' Sparks says, by  
delaying the advancement of new crews. On the other hand, the 
real-war experience gave him a fresh view of the tactics he 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
	--To relieve the pressure on Prowler squadrons, the Pentagon for  
now has dropped its plan to base one squadron in Saudi Arabia for 
``no fly'' zone enforcement over southern Iraq. That means a single 
carrier-based squadron in the Persian Gulf is providing support 
both for Navy and Air Force fighter patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kosovo showed, military leaders failed to anticipate an  
increasing demand for electronic warfare even as American air power 
is perhaps at its pinnacle in terms of precision and global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon dug a hole for itself when it retired its entire  
fleet of Air Force EF-111 electronic jammers after the Gulf War, 
leaving the Navy and Marines to shoulder most of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy's 14 active duty Prowler squadrons -- all based on  
Whidbey Island at the eastern entrance to the Strait of Juan de 
Fuca -- and the four Marine Corps squadrons at Cherry Point, N.C., 
are overtaxed; the strain is felt by the men and women who fly and 
maintain the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' squadron, designated VAQ-132 and nicknamed the Scorpions,  
normally deploys aboard aircraft carriers. But in April, the 
Prowlers went to the remote Saudi desert in order to fill a gap. 
</P>
<P>
	The squadron was scheduled to stay a maximum of 56 days. Then  
the return date was put in limbo, which left squadron members 
wondering when they would get back home for a summer break. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the hardest part,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also under strain are members of a specialized group of Prowler  
technicians who maintain and repair the electronic transmitters 
carried in pylons beneath the Prowler's wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer Catherine Holthaus, a single parent, spent 21 of  
the past 36 months deployed to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere keeping 
the Prowlers ready to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too much'' time away from the responsibilities of home  
life, says Holthaus.

<HEADLINE> Opposition: Yemen Vote Fraudulent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- Yemen's presidential election was marred by  
vote tampering and inflated government figures of how many people 
voted, opposition groups charged on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote ended in the overwhelming re-election of President Ali  
Abdullah Saleh. The Higher Election Committee said 66 percent of 
the registered electorate of 5.6 million people cast ballots, with 
96.3 percent voting for Saleh and 3.7 percent for his only 
opponent, Najeeb Qahtan al-Shaabi. 
</P>
<P>
	But polling stations across the country were relatively quiet  
during Thursday's election -- the country's first direct 
presidential polls -- and opposition parties said far fewer 
registered voters actually participated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Witnesses told us that hundreds of underage people were made  
to vote, that ballots were marked for people that weren't there, 
and that some people voted more than once,'' Jarallah Omar, a 
spokesman for the opposition Yemen Socialist Party, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A female election committee member from the central province of  
Dhamar said only a couple of women showed up to vote at the polling 
station she staffed. Men and women vote separately in Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toward the end of the day, my colleague took the remaining  
ballots, stamped them and marked them for Ali Abdullah Saleh, and 
then marked one for Al-Shaabi as a token,'' said Latifa, only her 
eyes visible through slits in her head-to-toe black veil. She did 
not want to be identified any further. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Abdullah Barakat, head of the Higher Elections  
Council, dismissed fraud allegations. ``We heard of no such 
reports,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of opposition groups boycotted the elections,  
claiming they were a farce put on to give a semblance of democracy. 
Saleh and Al-Shaabi -- a little-known politician from Saleh's own 
party -- were the only nominees out of a field of 30 to win the 
approval of the parliament, which is dominated by the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite criticism of the elections, however, many Yemenis felt  
that just holding them was a step forward in this conservative 
nation of 17 million largely illiterate people. Many credit Saleh 
with bringing democracy -- something rare in the Arabian Peninsula -- 
to their nation and with unifying North and South Yemen in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Sunday, Saleh praised Yemen's voters for  
participating in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank everyone who voted, whether it was for me or for my  
opponent,'' Saleh said. ``This is a democratic right that all 
Yemenis should exercise.''

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong aftershock rocked Taiwan today,  
killing three people, injuring 58 others and collapsing several 
buildings weakened by the killer quake that struck six days 
earlier. People donned motorcycle helmets and huddled in safe, open 
spaces after the 8 a.m. aftershock, which registered a 6.5 
magnitude. Rescue teams from the original quake, which had a 7.6 
magnitude and killed more than 2,000 people, had to temporarily

a seven-hour battle between left-wing inmates and guards at an 
Ankara prison today, the Anatolia news agency reported. Guards at 
Ulucanlar prison were searching for weapons and trying to transfer 
some prisoners when the fighting began. Turkish police have little 
control over the country's overcrowded prisons and it is not 
uncommon for inmates to have weapons and cellular phones. Last

<HEADLINE> Scientists Study Weight of Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associated Press Wrter    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A Macaroni penguin weighs 11 pounds, more or less.  
</P>
<P>
	More or less is precisely the question that interests Kate  
Barlow of the British Antarctic Survey, who is taking a 
custom-designed penguin weigh-bridge to the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	By weighing penguins as they move between the nest and the sea,  
she aims to collect data on how much food the birds carry back to 
their chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``From that, we can work out how much krill it takes to raise a  
penguin chick,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barlow plans to arrive in November on Bird Island, a small  
bit of land off South Georgia Island at about 55 degrees south 
latitude, 8,000 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the world's population of 5 to 6 million breeding  
pairs of Macaroni penguins raise their chicks on South Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the birds are still plentiful, the British Antarctic  
Survey has noted a long-term decline. Numbers at Bird Island are 
down about 50 percent since 1976, but the cause has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to find out what factors affect the penguin  
populations and how the numbers of penguins relate to environmental 
changes, whether these be natural or influenced by human activities 
in the southern ocean,'' Barlow says. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, we want to know how much food parents bring back  
to their chicks in the colony, how often they feed them and so 
on,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have been weighing penguins by catching one, putting  
it in a bag and hanging it on a scale. The new scale is intended to 
be much less disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 penguins on Bird Island have been tagged. The scale  
reads the tag and logs data on each bird that happens to cross it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird has to stand still to get an accurate weight, so the  
scale includes a small step up for the penguins, to make them 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Macaroni penguins, which stand 28 inches tall, come to the  
breeding colony in late October. Each pair produces two eggs, but 
only one will hatch after an incubation period of 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
	When the chick is young, the father guards the nest and the  
mother swims out to collect food. Later, both penguins share in 
feeding the chick. On average, only a third of the breeding pairs 
is successful in raising a chick, the British Antarctic Survey has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Young birds won't start breeding until they are at least 5 years  
old. 
</P>
<P>
	Data on weight won't immediately explain why Macaroni penguin  
numbers have been declining. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, we're trying to collect as much information  
about the breeding biology of the penguin,'' Ms. Barlow says. 
``It's an ongoing development, and we'll see what kind of data we 
get from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scale was tested on African penguins at Banham Zoo in  
eastern England, but Ms. Barlow says dealing with the large wild 
population on Bird Island probably will require a few adjustments.

<HEADLINE> Group Helps Those Seeking Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Elke Baezner's expression grows tender as she  
recalls the agonized lives she has helped end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very emotional and difficult time,'' Baezner, president  
of Exit, Switzerland's self-described ``organization for humane 
death,'' says of the six terminally ill patients she has helped 
commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been drawn into an intimate relationship; you've heard  
confessions and shared secrets,'' she says. ``It's not like a 
factory conveyor belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland is the only country that permits non-doctors to  
assist in suicides. Exit's ``companions in death,'' headed by a 
retired pastor, last year helped 120 incurably ill people commit 
suicide with an overdose of barbiturate and sent manuals to 
hundreds more with advice on how to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Netherlands, which allows assisted suicide and looks  
set to become the first nation to legalize ``mercy killings,'' 
stipulates such acts should be carried out only by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Swiss deaths are unpublicized because Exit insists  
on its members' right to ``die with dignity'' and shuns the 
headline-grabbing methods of the American right-to-die activist Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	A Michigan court earlier this year sentenced Kevorkian to 10-25  
years in prison for second-degree murder for injecting a man 
suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with deadly drugs. Kevorkian 
then released a video of the death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Oregon is the only state that allows  
physician-assisted suicide, under strictly defined circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are relieved that we can work within our laws and wish that  
other industrialized countries had similar possibilities so 
Kevorkian-type cases could be avoided,'' says Baezner, the 
53-year-old manager of a hotel boutique. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss law provides for prosecution of people with a ``selfish''  
motive who help others kill themselves, but it doesn't provide 
penalties for anyone else who assists in suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	So Exit operates in a legal gray area. Under strictly defined  
circumstances, its ``companions in death'' are able to procure a 
fatal drug overdose from sympathetic doctors for a member who has 
been diagnosed as terminally ill and has repeatedly asked to die. 
</P>
<P>
	But the companions are permitted only to hand the lethal  
cocktail to the person seeking to die. They may not put the drug to 
the person's lips, administer an injection or turn on an 
intravenous drip. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is not without controversy. Despite Exit's insistence  
that it observes the law to the letter, a study by researchers at 
Basel University raised questions about whether all the group's 
suicide cases have been incurably ill. It cited a case of an 
elderly man reported by Exit to have terminal lung cancer but 
recorded by the coroner as suffering from bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Baezner says that all six suicides she assisted were with  
terminally ill patients. Each death, she said, was peaceful, 
dignified and quick. 
</P>
<P>
	After each death, Exit volunteers notify police and provide a  
detailed written account with dates, times and witnesses, she says. 
No Exit member has ever been prosecuted, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	However, authorities decided Exit overstepped the limits late  
last year and stopped it from supplying an overdose to a 
30-year-old chronically depressed woman. The woman, who hasn't been 
identified, said she had suffered from incurable depression for 
nearly 10 years and had failed in several suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	After consultations with the woman's parents, Exit's chief  
``companion in death,'' Werner Kriesi, a priest for 20 years, 
agreed to help her kill herself. But police intervened and took the 
woman to a psychiatric clinic. Under heavy medication, she was 
released six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I am suffering from is no kind of normal depression. It's  
a gradual disappearance in personality,'' she said in a subsequent 
interview with the newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. ``My heart is still 
beating, but that's all. You can't live like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to escape from the monster that I've become.''  
</P>
<P>
	A former Exit president quit over the case and doctors argued  
that depression can be treated, but Baezner declines to discuss 
specifics of the case while Exit conducts an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
	She says each case needs individual consideration.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are some psychiatric cases which are so advanced that  
you can't forbid these people to die,'' she says. ``If we know that 
the person will throw himself off the roof or in front of a train, 
then we have a responsibility to them and their families -- but also 
to the neighbors and the train driver.''

<HEADLINE> Loroupe Sets Women's Marathon Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Tegla Loroupe set a women's world record in  
winning the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, beating her own mark by four 
seconds in a highly orchestrated race with three pacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan sprinted to the finish in 2 hours, 20 minutes and 43  
seconds on a cool, cloudy day. She broke her record of 2:20.47 set 
in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on April 18, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berlin Marathon now has the fastest times ever for men and  
women, with Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa setting the men's mark of 
2:06.05 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe, a two-time Boston Marathon winner, was making her  
Berlin Marathon debut and had said before the race she was going 
for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to win,'' she said. ``I didn't expect the  
record anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She ran out front with three Kenyan pacemakers from the start.  
With the three men calling out splits and running ahead as a shield 
when headwinds blew, Laroupe was 90 seconds in front of ahead of 
her Rotterdam pace early on. 
</P>
<P>
	Laroupe was almost 30 seconds off her Rotterdam pace after 21  
miles. She was fatigued and troubled by an ailing left leg before 
getting as assist from a downhill run to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Marleen Renders of Belgium, who won last year, finished second  
in 2:23.58 and Russia's Svetlana Zakharova was third in 2:27.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Laroupe earned $28,000 for the victory and another $100,000 for  
her world best. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Kenyan, Josephat Kiprono, running alone for the second  
half of the race, captured the men's race with the third fastest 
time in history of 2:06.45. 
</P>
<P>
	His only challenge came when Takayuki Inubushi of Japan closed  
within five seconds after 21 miles. Inubushi finished in 2:06.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the Japanese was going to catch me, but I knew I had  
enough in reserve,'' Kiprono said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Samson Kandie was third in 2:08.34

<HEADLINE> Patriots Defeat Giants 16-14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots are unbeaten and  
unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not even good yet,'' strong safety Lawyer Milloy said  
after a 16-14 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday night. 
``The way we're winning games is not to our liking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots joined Tennessee as the only NFL teams with 3-0  
records, yet their combined margin of victory is seven points. And, 
for the first time this season, they didn't need Drew Bledsoe and 
Adam Vinatieri to lead them to victory in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback and the kicker did their work earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	The score was 7-7 at halftime before Vinatieri kicked field  
goals of 38 and 19 yards in the third quarter and 41 yards in the 
fourth. Bledsoe completed 10 of 13 passes for 110 yards on those 
three drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make things easier on ourselves. We can play better  
than we've played these first three games,'' Bledsoe said. ``To get 
where we want to be, we have to play closer to our potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the Giants (1-2) did on defense. One week after  
losing 50-21 to Washington, they trailed by just two points after 
Kent Graham's second touchdown pass of the game, a 1-yarder to Tiki 
Barber with 1:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ben Coates recovered the onside kick and New England ran  
out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week we were blown out,'' New York coach Jim Fassel said.  
``This week we tried to control things. Our approach this week was 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots were under no illusions that the Giants would be  
the pushovers they were against the Redskins, who scored on their 
first three possessions. New England punted on its first three. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't anticipating scoring 50 points,'' Patriots fullback  
Tony Carter said. ``We knew it was going to be a rough game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They moved the ball well when they scored, but it's not an  
unstoppable offense,'' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said. 
``I haven't seen one yet that is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when their drives stall, the Patriots have Vinatieri. He is  
7-for-7 on field goal attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winning margin again,'' New England coach Pete Carroll  
said. ``He's been rock solid for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, the Giants allowed only a 1-yard scoring run  
by Terry Allen in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the offense only scored on its first possession of the game,  
a 6-yard pass from Graham to a wide-open LeShon Johnson, and on its 
last possession. After Johnson scored, the Giants turned the ball 
over on punts on their next five series and on downs the next time 
they got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played better this week but we need to keep it in  
perspective,'' Graham said. ``It's a 16-game season. We just have 
to work each game to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Barber scored, New England had held its opponent scoreless  
in the second half for the second straight week after a victory was 
far from certain at halftime. One week earlier, the Patriots scored 
on four of their five second-half possessions to beat Indianapolis 
31-28 after trailing 28-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants nearly went ahead after Vinatieri's 19-yarder had  
given the Patriots a 13-7 lead with 1:32 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ball at the Patriots 40-yard line, linebacker Tedy  
Bruschi swatted away a pass into the end zone intended for Pete 
Mitchell. On the next play, though, Bruschi nearly turned into a 
goat as he threw the ball at guard Luke Petitgout after Graham was 
sacked. 
</P>
<P>
	An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave the Giants a first down  
at the 40, but the drive stalled when Graham's 3-yard pass to 
Barber left them 5 yards short of a first down at the New England 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Daluiso's 41-yard field goal attempt on the next play went  
wide left with 9:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't appreciate the guy kicking me and lost my head. My  
emotions were high,'' Bruschi said. ``I dodged a bullet when they 
missed the field goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri's successful kick from the same distance, 41 yards,  
with 3:12 to go provided the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* Left tackle Bruce Armstrong tied John Hannah's Patriots  
record of 183 starts. ... Strahan, who had 29 sacks over the past 
two seasons, was shut out for the third straight week. The Giants 
sacked Bledsoe just once. ... Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn played 
his first game since 1997. He sat out all last season with a knee 
injury and the first two games this season with a hamstring injury. 
... The Patriots are 16-4 in their last 20 home games. ... Terry 
Glenn had five catches for 95 yards, the first time he was held 
under 100 this season. He had seven catches for 113 yards in a 
30-28 win over the New York Jets and seven for 122 against the 
Colts. ... It was the first NFL game this season without a 
turnover.

<HEADLINE> Japan Creating New Breed of Robots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The arena comes alive with cheers and shouts when  
the referee signals for the bout to begin. Pushing and shoving, the 
wrestlers try furiously to drive each other toward the edge of the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just like a real sumo tournament -- except the wrestlers are  
robots. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, a global leader in industrial robotics, is now turning  
out mechanical marvels that walk, talk and even swim -- placing a 
new focus on robots that serve more as companion or entertainer 
than servant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robots used to just do work,'' says Fumio Kasagami, a robotics  
engineer at the machinery-maker Daihen Corp. ``Now, they're 
communicating with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robots have been widely used in Japanese manufacturing since the  
1970s, about a decade after the technology was introduced here from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there were 710,000 industrial robots being used in  
Japan, nearly 60 percent of the world's total. Today, even with the 
nation's flagging economy, a majority of industrial robots used 
worldwide are still made here. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``bots'' are by no means reserved for the factory assembly  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Robot competitions featuring everything from wrestling robots to  
computerized, maze-running ``mice'' have become the latest craze 
among teen-agers and tech-junkies. Robocon Magazine, a bimonthly 
publication listing contests and construction techniques begun last 
year, claims a circulation of 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese harbor good feelings about robots,'' Hitoshi  
Matsubara, chief researcher at the national Electrotechnical 
Laboratory, wrote in a recent book on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of that is the huge popularity of cartoons about robots  
and the booming sales in recent years of electronic pets like the 
Tamagotchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as cuddly, robot pets are seen by many as having  
several distinct advantages over the real thing: They never soil 
the carpets, instance, and if they die they can always be rebooted. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsubara foresees a future in which humanoid robots serve not  
only as nurses, maids and bodyguards, but as ``partners who will 
play and talk with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, that future seems not far away.  
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Science and Technology Corp., a semiprivate research  
organization, has announced a 77-inch-tall bot that can dance, beat 
a drum and learn other movements by ``watching'' through a pair of 
camera eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. has released a programmable pooch, and two other  
companies have made furry, computerized cats. Scientists at 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have come up with a lifelike robot 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Daihen has even introduced a computer-controlled robotic jester  
that tells jokes for money at an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	The new robots often are the whimsical spinoffs of research  
projects aimed at more serious applications. 
</P>
<P>
	But Masahito Fujita, who works in the Trade Ministry's  
industrial machinery department, says the creation of more 
lifelike, intelligent robots is a step toward making machines 
capable of tough tasks that now only humans can do -- such as caring 
for the elderly and performing dangerous rescue work. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is still churning out new and improved industrial robots.  
</P>
<P>
	They're getting smaller -- like an ant-sized robot used for  
exploring pipes -- and are more precise and sensitive enough to work 
with soft substances. ``We've even got a robot that can pick up a 
block of tofu,'' Fujita says. 
</P>
<P>
	Advances in computers have been a major factor in the current  
popularization trend. Computers and computer parts have become 
cheaper and better, allowing companies to experiment more and to 
get robots out of the factory and into the public marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has been helping. Last year, it spent $8.8  
million on robot research and development. In addition to urging 
schools to teach robotics, the government this spring held a robot 
demonstration at the residence of the speaker of Japan's lower 
house of Parliament, with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the future, technology will support Japan,'' said Tetsuhisa  
Shirakawa of Tokyo's Science and Technology Agency. ``We have to 
get young people interested in science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	More and more kids are competing in robot competitions. Kids  
like the members of the Robot Club at Tokyo's Machida Technical 
High, last year's champions in the All-Japan Robot Sumo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The club's nine members spent every day of their summer vacation  
training and honing their robots, sometimes staying to practice 
until late at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning a contest with a machine you made yourself -- that  
feels really good,'' says Makoto Onuki, a senior.

<HEADLINE> Marshall QB Shines on Sore Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Chad Pennington didn't need a trainer,  
doctor or coach to tell him he could play on a sore leg. 
</P>
<P>
	History and a hit from Temple's LeVar Talley on the game's  
second play took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
	His arms wrapped around Pennington's jersey, Talley lifted  
Marshall's quarterback along the sideline and slammed him to the 
turf Saturday night. The home crowd gasped and fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington got up slowly but returned to the huddle without a  
limp to discover his pass went for 20 yards and a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw three more completions on the 72-yard drive, including  
the first of his three touchdowns in No. 17 Marshall's 34-0 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington was coaxed to the sideline for good near the end of  
the third quarter, but not before finishing with 406 yards on 
26-for-36 passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering Chad didn't practice but one day this week, there  
was a question whether or not he'd even play,'' Marshall coach Bob 
Pruett said. ``He played in pain. That's the reason he is a great 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overcoming obstacles has been the signature of the Mid-American  
Conference's career passing leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Pennington was called upon as a third-string freshman  
when two others got hurt. He led Marshall to the Division I-AA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The next season he was redshirted in favor of a veteran  
transfer, but returned in 1997 to hook up with Randy Moss and bring 
Marshall its first bowl appearance in five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year, Pennington got a severe groin pull in the  
conference championship game against Toledo but led a 
fourth-quarter comeback that gave Marshall its second straight 
league title. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington is responsible for a third of Marshall's 105  
victories in the 1990s, the most in any decade for a Division I-A 
or I-AA program. 
</P>
<P>
	So when it came to risking further injury to a sore thigh and  
planting foot Saturday, watching from the sideline against winless 
Temple wasn't an option for Pennington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trainers have done a really good job of keeping the  
swelling down and getting this leg back where it needs to be,'' 
Pennington said. ``Part of football is playing with pain and taking 
hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington completed 11 of his first 12 passes and also ran for  
a first down on fourth-and-inches from the Marshall 30. The sneak 
kept alive a second-quarter drive which resulted in Pennington's 
47-yard TD toss to running back Llow Turner for a 21-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington completed passes to 10 different receivers. Nate  
Poole, who led the way with career highs of 10 catches and 179 
yards, said he enjoyed the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight was a good feeling. After a while, I didn't even have  
to think about my routes,'' Poole said. ``It was like when your 
mother cooks dinner. She just puts it on the table and you eat. 
I've never felt like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall rolled up 593 yards in offense in going to 4-0 for the  
third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (0-4) fell apart after quarterback Mac DeVito, making his  
first career start, was injured on the second series and did not 
return. The Owls were held scoreless for the third time in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, no position is playing well. The offensive line  
got whipped,'' Temple coach Bobby Wallace said. ``Defensively, it's 
hard to play when the other side is not contributing any.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Announces New Debt Relief Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund, under  
mounting pressure in the wake of a Russian corruption scandal, put 
in place a major new debt relief initiative Sunday and announced 
efforts to speed internal reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	All the activity around the annual meetings of the 182-nation  
IMF and the World Bank was aimed at damping criticism the two giant 
lending agencies failed to coordinate programs and badly mismanaged 
the recent global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF and World Bank officials, at the first-ever joint meeting of  
the two agencies' policy setting committees, pledged in a statement 
to support ``deeper, broader and faster debt relief'' for the 
world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coordinated effort will provide debt relief to 36 of the  
world's poorest nations. It is intended to erase up to $100 billion 
in debt, allowing the countries to commit scarce resources to 
poverty, health and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today our duty is to the neediest in the world -- the 30,000  
young children who will die every day of preventable diseases; the 
200 million men and women in avoidable poverty whose lives are 
ruined by hunger and the constant struggle to survive,'' said 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, chairman of the 
IMF's Interim Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF policy-makers also were reviewing a list of recommendations  
pushed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to tighten 
controls over the agency's multibillion dollar loan programs to 
countries in economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The American proposals include requirements for outside audits  
of central banks in nations receiving IMF loans and a greater 
ability for the IMF to penalize countries found lying about their 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is hoping the reforms will deflect  
the heavy criticism from congressional Republicans since reports 
last month of a wide-ranging investigation into allegations of 
massive laundering of Russian money through accounts at the Bank of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``A changed IMF is needed for the changed world that we now  
have. We have made a good start in many areas, but much more needs 
to be done,'' Summers told IMF policymakers in a speech on Sunday 
spelling out proposed reforms intended to ensure IMF resources are 
not misused. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, told  
reporters that while he would comply with the added disclosure 
requirements to the IMF, the data should not be released publicly. 
``It's like a health check between a doctor and a patient,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have said that no evidence has been uncovered so  
far that IMF money was part of the billions being investigated in 
the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded debt relief, to be financed in part by revaluing 14  
million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves at market prices, would 
provide an extra $50 billion in debt relief on top of $30 billion 
pledged in the mid-1990s under a program known as the Highly 
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of stringent performance standards, only four countries  
have received any relief under the program -- Uganda, Bolivia, 
Guyana and Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program eases some requirements which, Brown said,  
should allow three-fourths of the eligible countries, many in 
sub-Saharan Africa, into the program by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief advocates, who enlisted the support of a diverse  
group of religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, generally 
praised Sunday's developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement will translate into more kids in school, better  
health care and a chance for some of the poorest countries in the 
world to participate in the world economy,'' said Seth Amgott, a 
Washington spokesman for Oxfam International, a private aid agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstacles still remain. For example, the debt relief will  
require substantial pledges from wealthy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to helping fund the $80 billion in debt relief  
covered by the HIPC initiative, individual nations will be expected 
to cancel another $20 billion in their overseas development loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration last week asked Congress for nearly  
$1 billion as the U.S. share of this program over the next four 
years. But France and Japan are balking at a proposed formula for 
their share of the debt relief. They contend it imposes too great a 
burden because they have extended far more loans to poor countries 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF and World Bank meetings, which will conclude on  
Thursday, also will review new initiatives designed to prevent or 
at least better cope with Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	On that front, German Finance Minister Hans Eichel on Sunday  
urged accelerated efforts by the IMF and World Bank to help 
countries strengthen their financial sectors. Many of the countries 
hurt by the Asian crisis were found to have weak bank regulation.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of a woman  
wrongly imprisoned for her husband's murder, killed the competition 
with $23.7 million in ticket sales to debut atop the weekend box 
office, according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top movie, the Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue  
Streak,'' dropped to No. 2 with $13.2 million. The Bruce Willis 
ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained at No. 3 in its eighth 
weekend with $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major debuts opened weakly. The somber  
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams as a widower who cheers 
up fellow Jewish ghetto residents with fake reports of Allied 
victories over the Nazis, was eighth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' stars Ashley Judd as a woman out for revenge  
against her husband, who faked his own death and framed her for 
murder. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Judd's parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The film takes its title from the legal precept that a defendant  
cannot be tried twice for the same crime. From the filmmaker's 
loose interpretation, it means Judd already has been punished for 
her husband's murder and now can hunt him down and kill him without 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea resonated with audiences in the same way the premise of  
Robert Redford's ``Indecent Proposal'' did, said Wayne Lewellen, 
distribution president for Paramount, which released ``Double 
Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?  
That's a simple, quick concept that's easy to grasp,'' Lewellen 
said. ``I think people were drawn to the concept that she could 
shoot her husband on Main Street and they couldn't do anything to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a female lead and Jones essentially reprising his tracker  
role from ``The Fugitive,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' was a ``date-action 
movie that had appeal to both sexes,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which tracks movie ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' the summer's box office surprise, has taken in  
$225.1 million and moved ahead of ``Aladdin'' as Disney's 
second-highest grossing film behind ``The Lion King,'' which made 
$312 million. Edging past ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Sixth Sense'' also 
climbed into the top 20 all-time moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Blue Streak,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $8.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``For Love of the Game,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty, $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stigmata,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Stir of Echoes,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Jakob the Liar,'' $2.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mumford,'' $2 million.  
</P>

	10. ``Runaway Bride,'' $1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Prevents Flu Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An inhaled prescription drug being  
introduced next month is nearly 80 percent effective in keeping 
family members from getting the flu bug when a relative brings it 
home, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, called Relenza, is a powder spray inhaled through  
the mouth that has already been proven to reduce the duration of a 
bout of flu by a day or two. The study released Sunday shows it 
also cuts the chances of catching the flu from an ill relative by 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is the first of a new class of anti-viral medicines  
that are effective against both major strains of the disease, known 
as influenza A and B. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are a major step forward,'' said Dr. Frederick  
Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. ``The 
latest data show that they clearly work for prevention, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved in July by the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration and is made by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. The company says 
the drug will be on drugstore shelves Friday. The wholesale cost 
for enough to treat one bout of flu will be $37. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden presented the latest data at a meeting of the American  
Society of Microbiology, as well as a report on another drug that 
is the first to shorten a bout of the common cold. Glaxo Wellcome 
paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the  
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is the best 
way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help when 
people fail to get the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, youngsters bring home the flu to their parents and  
siblings from school and day care. The latest experiment was 
intended to see if family members could be protected by taking 
Relenza at the first sign of flu in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 975 families with school-age children volunteered to  
participate in the study. Between December and March, 337 of these 
families had a case of flu. The sick person and the rest of the 
family were randomly assigned to get either the drug or a 
look-alike dummy spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 4 percent of the folks in the families getting Relenza  
came down with the flu, compared with 19 percent in the untreated 
comparison families. Even when they did get sick, their disease 
appeared to be far milder. Flu in the Relenza-treated family 
members typically lasted three days, compared with about six days 
in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important aspect of the drug that could reduce the  
burden of influenza,'' said Dr. William Craig of the University of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza will be the first of a new class of flu medicines known  
as neuraminidase inhibitors to reach the market. However, 
Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, a similar medicine in pill form, is 
expected to be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to these medicines is that they must be started  
within the first day or two of symptoms to have any effect on the 
disease. Most people don't call their doctor at the first twinge of 
flu's body ache, and they probably could not get an instant 
appointment, even if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said drug companies will have to convince both physicians  
and patients to look at flu differently, now that medicines are 
available to both treat the disease and prevent it. For instance, 
he said doctors may eventually become willing to prescribe the 
drugs over the phone without seeing patients if they report typical 
flu miseries during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report to the conference Sunday, Hayden described the  
results of a study of pleconaril, an experimental medicine for the 
common cold. The medicine was developed by Viropharma Inc. of 
Exton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested it on 1,024 people and found that it shortened  
the length of a typical moderate-to-severe cold from 14 days to 
10 1/2. They looked at various measures of a cold's severity, 
including the number of tissues used. Their count: Pleconaril 
reduced the number of tissues needed by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Expects Tough Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last week, stocks tumbled under a staggering  
weight of bad news. The dollar was declining. A handful of 
companies said their profits were in trouble. And Microsoft's 
president deflated enthusiasm for beloved technology stocks, even 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	This coming week, none of that bad news is likely to improve.  
While some investors are likely to view the battered market as a 
fine place for bargain-hunting, many market analysts expect another 
rough week on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell a total of  
524.30 points, tumbling more than 200 points in two separate 
sessions. The plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, or 9.2 percent, 
below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also fared poorly. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which lists most of the world's leading technology 
companies, lost 129.21 points over the course of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The tumble surprised few Wall Street analysts. In recent weeks,  
even as the Dow and the Nasdaq hit new records, many market 
watchers remained troubled about signs of ill health in the market. 
Above all, analysts worried that the strong performance of the 
Dow's blue-chip stocks and technology leaders like Intel and 
Microsoft wasn't shared by the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the market lost its last bastion of strength.  
Semiconductor stocks tumbled Wednesday, a day after an earthquake 
hit Taiwan, a major production center for the chips and components 
used in computers. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Thursday, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer sent the  
market spinning by telling reporters he believes technology stocks 
are too pricey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' he said at a conference of the Society of American 
Business Editors and Writers. ``I would put our company and I would 
put most companies in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic factors that drove stocks lower last week haven't  
disappeared. The dollar lingers near its lowest levels against 
Japan's yen since 1996. Investors also remain worried that the 
Federal Reserve at its Oct. 5 meeting will raise interest rates for 
the third time this year to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate  
profits as borrowing costs escalate. That can make bonds, with 
their guaranteed rate of return, more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar could be another menace. Some of the worst market  
declines in history have come in October, from the 1929 crash that 
launched the Great Depression to the 554.26-point drop on Oct. 27, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary time of year,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief  
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co in Kansas City. ``By 
September or October, you know where a company's fundamentals are 
for the year, and a lot of investment managers make their buy and 
sell decisions based on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts see at least two potential benefits from last  
week's sharp selloff. Some economists feel the market's decline 
could convince the Fed that an interest rate increase isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past week's stock market slide has virtually ensured the  
Fed will not move in the direction of another rate hike,'' said 
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has voiced concern over the lofty  
levels of the stock market, and said last month that the Fed would 
keep an eye on the market. Last week's selloff, some analysts 
reason, could convince the Fed that the stock market, at least, has 
not reached inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors could seize the chance to buy stocks at their  
new, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an overdue opportunity to shake out some of the  
market's excesses,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist 
at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York. ``There will be a point for some 
good buying opportunities. It's still a bull market.''

<HEADLINE> Nike Launches $15 'World Shoe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Trying to tap the big and booming pool of  
consumers in developing nations, Nike has launched the ``World 
Shoe,'' which come as cheap as $15 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
	The canvas shoes are aimed at markets in Asia, Africa and Latin  
America and have been on sale for several weeks in China, Malaysia, 
the Philippines and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike officials say it's too early to tell how the shoes are  
doing. But the company said sales could hit $150 million next year, 
then grow well beyond that. By comparison, Nike sold $200 million 
worth of its successful Tuned Air sneakers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoe is part of a major new company strategy to expand  
into relatively poor areas of the world where Nike does little 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Those regions hold legions of consumers; 3 billion people live  
in Asia alone. And as those populations grow larger and richer, the 
company hopes they'll develop into loyal Nike customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to position it as a premium but attainable for an  
(everyday) athlete in the market,'' said Margaret Mager, a Goldman 
Sachs analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to avoid being elitist ... they want to be a brand  
for the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, where footwear can come as cheap as $3 a pair, the $15  
basic World Shoe is a midpriced offering, said Tony Balfour, the 
company's general manager for the Asia Pacific region. That makes 
it the Asian equivalent of the approximately $60 midrange athletic 
shoes that are at the low end of Nike's U.S. offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoes won't be distributed in the United States or other  
developed markets, Balfour said. Nike doesn't want to take sales 
away from its more advanced and expensive shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics, who say Asian workers that make Nikes are  
underpaid, have pointedly noted that the laborers can't buy the 
shoes they make. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike acknowledged that while the World Shoe will be more  
affordable, many people in developing nations still won't be able 
to pay $15 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it should at least triple the potential market for Nikes  
in Asia, Balfour said. Right now, the Asian market is dominated by 
local brands and shoes manufactured by Bata, a giant Canadian 
manufacturer that is a partner with Nike on some products. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoe is actually a family of shoes: four models geared  
toward running, basketball, soccer and cross training. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoes have a simple, clean design, Balfour said, with canvas  
uppers surrounding the foot in one color, adorned with the 
trademark Nike swoosh in a contrasting color. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoes have rubber soles with a waffle pattern, taking  
Nike back to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bowerman, Nike co-founder, developed the sole in 1971 by  
pouring rubber on his wife's waffle iron. The resulting lightweight 
sole put Nike on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, (manufacturers) have been able to literally  
drag old equipment from the back of factories and use that'' to 
make the World Shoes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its fiscal year 1999, which ended May 31, Nike sold $455  
million of shoes in Asia, less than 9 percent of its total footwear 
sales.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Extradition Hearing Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After nearly a year of legal wrangling, a  
magistrate begins hearing evidence Monday in the extradition case 
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, wanted by Spain for alleged human rights 
abuses during his 17-year rule in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, expected to last five days, will focus on  
extradition law: whether Deputy Chief Magistrate Ronald Bartle 
agrees that the charges against Pinochet are extraditable crimes, 
that Spain has jurisdiction and that the legal paperwork is in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean government has acknowledged that 3,197 people died  
and about a thousand others disappeared during Pinochet's 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	But the case against the 83-year-old Pinochet, launched by  
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon in October, has proved complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon, who had been investigating the alleged killings of  
Spanish citizens during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship, wanted to 
try the general on charges of genocide, kidnapping, torture and 
terrorism -- international crimes, he said, that could be prosecuted 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Pinochet -- who has lived under guard since his  
arrest Oct. 16 -- argued that as a former head of state, he had 
immunity. And in March, Britain's House of Lords rejected all the 
charges except those of torture and conspiracy to torture after 
1988, the year an international law against torture came into 
effect in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon has since added dozens of post-1988 torture allegations  
to bolster his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights campaigners are undaunted by the apparent legal  
setbacks. ``The major legal hurdle to Pinochet's prosecution was 
overcome when the House of Lords ruled that he has no immunity,'' 
said Reed Brody of the New York-based group Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, arrested in a London hospital where he was recovering  
from spinal surgery, has only appeared once in court -- for his 
initial arraignment -- and will not attend the extradition hearing 
at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he will have to be present when Bartle gives his  
ruling, which could come at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bartle approves the extradition, Pinochet's lawyers may  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	After all legal options are exhausted, Home Secretary Jack Straw  
must ultimately approve or reject Spain's extradition request. 
Straw, who has decided until now to let the case proceed, promised 
to ``consider the extradition case afresh,'' if need be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean government has campaigned vigorously against  
Pinochet's arrest, calling it an issue of national sovereignty. 
Pinochet supporters have called for him to be released because of 
his age and failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks published Sunday, Chile's foreign minister said  
Pinochet will not give up the fight against extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that his lawyers will present all the appeals that  
are necessary so that Pinochet does not go to Spain,'' Juan Gabriel 
Valdes said in an interview published in leading Spanish daily El 
Pais. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Pinochet came close to expressing regret  
over abuses committed while in power. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to Chile on the 26th anniversary of his bloody  
1973 coup against the elected Marxist president Salvador Allende, 
Pinochet wrote, ``The pain of those who suffered was not alien to 
me in the past, nor now. I lament all the situations of 
belligerence and acts of violence that caused them.''

	Russia Considers Chechen Ground War  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military on Sunday warned it  
may launch ground operations against Islamic militants in Chechnya 
while warplanes bombed the Chechen capital for a fourth day, 
pounding industrial and communications facilities. ``The main aim 
of all the plans is to eliminate the bandits'' and ``to create a 
considerably deep security zone around Chechnya,'' said Russian 
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. The militants are separatists who

	Lawmakers Debate Budget, Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today it is  
tough but possible to fashion a budget without tapping Social 
Security funds. But House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said that 
was impossible under the GOP plan, and lawmakers should hold a 
budget summit with the White House. Both the White House and 
Congress are committed to fencing off the Social Security fund. But 
Republicans reject the White House proposal to raise revenues by 
increasing cigarette taxes and Democrats say Republicans are 
resorting to gimmicks -- such as declaring year 2000 census funding 
to be emergency spending -- to balance the books.

	Conn. Law Targets Dangerous Gunowners  
</P>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Starting next month, Connecticut police  
will be allowed to confiscate guns from anyone determined to be an 
immediate danger to himself or others. In order to seize a gun, 
there must be evidence that the person recently tortured animals, 
threatened to kill himself or others or acted violently. A police 
investigation must conclude there is no other way to keep the 
person from doing harm, and a warrant must be issued by a judge. 
Lawmakers in other states say the focus on prevention is the law's 
strength. Critics say the law tramples the Second Amendment and 
fear it could lead to unwarranted searches and seizures.

	Indonesia Limits Access to Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	SURUBAYA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian military and  
pro-Indonesian militias have been limiting outsiders' access to 
East Timorese refugees in neighboring West Timor -- raising 
questions about the refugees' plight and making it nearly 
impossible to detail allegations of human rights atrocities by the 
militias. The dearth of information from the refugee camps is in 
sharp contrast to other recent refugee crises. Minutes after ethnic 
Albanians escaped Kosovo, they were detailing atrocities. While 
foreign aid workers are having trouble reaching the refugees, one 
senior Jakarta-based UNICEF official said her staffers were hearing 
stories of gang rape, executions and forced recruitment into the 
militias.

	Study: Drug Helps Prevent Flu Spread  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --A prescription nasal powder spray being  
introduced next month is nearly 80 percent effective in keeping 
family members from getting the flu bug when a relative brings it 
home, according to a new study. The medicine, called Relenza, is an 
inhaled powder that has already been proven to reduce the duration 
of a bout of flu by a day or two. Relenza was approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration last summer and is made by Glaxo 
Wellcome, Inc. The company says the drug will be on drugstore 
shelves Friday. The wholesale cost for enough to treat one bout of 
flu will be $37.

the Big Island of Hawaii to recover bodies this morning, said Bruce 
Butts of the Hawaii County Civil Defense. No details were released

	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Despite a 10-6 deficit going into the  
final round, the Americans responded with a comeback, winning the 
Ryder Cup for the first time since 1993. The Americans overwhelmed 
Europe in the first six matches, closing all of them out before the 
17th hole. Even David Duval, who referred to the Ryder Cup as an 
exhibition, showed how much it meant by repeatedly shaking his 
fists and cupping his hand to his ear, asking the gallery for even

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Profits Said To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler chairman Juergen Schrempp said the  
company will post improved profits for 1999 despite the departure 
announced last week of one of the American stars of the 
trans-Atlantic merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``DaimlerChrysler's results are not produced from one single  
manager, but rather from an entire management team and its 
coworkers,'' Schrempp told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper in 
an interview published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earnings in each one of our five operating business units will  
be above the year-earlier figure,'' Schrempp said. ``We stick to 
our statement that our profit will outpace sales growth this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview comes two days after the announcement of a board  
shakeup at DaimlerChrysler, including the departure of Thomas 
Stallkamp, the president of the Chrysler division. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp, a 19-year Chrysler veteran, was credited with helping  
Chrysler shed billions in costs, and was expected to help the 
German side do the same. His early retirement and other board 
changes were seen as a move by Schrempp to consolidate his control 
over the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Schrempp noted that although only five of the  
14 remaining seats on the management board are held by Americans, 
the two sides are equally represented in the passenger car areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much regret that with a reduction one loses very good  
people,'' he said. ``But the important thing is that we agreed in 
the board on this structure. We are sure: We now have the most 
powerful team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the integration team led by Stallkamp will now be  
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The integration is completed,'' he said. ``We are now one  
company.''

<HEADLINE> Syracuse Moves to National Rankings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse still hasn't found a replacement  
for quarterback Donovan McNabb and probably won't this year. Thanks 
to its stalwart defense, it hasn't mattered much. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday against West Virginia, the defense provided the  
spark and the offense got the job done as Syracuse (3-1) held on 
for a 30-7 win over the Mountaineers (1-3) in the Big East opener 
for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen moved into the national rankings for the first  
time this year at No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the somewhat lopsided score, the game was much closer  
and really wasn't decided until the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The key play came as the Mountaineers, trailing 17-7, were  
poised to score. But as redshirt freshman tailback Avon Cobourne 
neared the goal line, Syracuse linebacker Clifton Smith stuck his 
helmet into the ball and caused a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was huge,'' said Syracuse lineman Duke Pettijohn, who  
scooped up the ball and returned it to the 39-yard line. ``They 
were on the 5-yard line and about to score. They had a lot of 
momentum and that took the air out. After that play, I think they 
gave up. They had the momentum figuring they were gonna score, and 
then they were like, `It's over now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For Smith, it was a banner day. He became the first freshman to  
start on either offense or defense in coach Paul Pasqualoni's nine 
years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to come up with that play, I felt very good,'' said  
Smith, who was in on two tackles. ``I was fortunate to have that 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, sophomore Madei Williams and redshirt freshman Troy  
Nunes alternated at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, it was Nunes who shone. He scored on a 24-yard  
option keeper early in the second quarter, then hit Pat Woodcock 
with a 22-yard touchdown pass with 13 seconds remaining in the half 
for a 17-7 lead after another costly fumble by the Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who played well in an 18-13 loss to No. 4 Michigan  
last week, got his first start on Saturday and faltered. Although 
he rushed for 50 yards, he was tackled for a safety on Syracuse's 
second possession, was intercepted once, and completed just 1-of-5 
passes for 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offense really has to do a better job of stepping it up  
and not letting the defense carry us,'' Williams said. ``That's 
what they did. They only gave up three points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We both know the whole game plan,'' added Nunes, who was  
9-for-13 for 102 yards and rushed for 36 yards. ``We're just trying 
to get some pride back in this offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia scored all of its points in the first half -- two  
safeties and a 23-yard field goal by Jay Taylor. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback Marc Bulger was unable to play in the second half 
because of an injury to his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly aren't very lucky,'' West Virginia coach Don  
Nehlen said. ``We push that touchdown in, we have the momentum 
going and everything. Just unbelievable. And then Marc got hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger, 9-for-14 for 85 yards, was replaced by sophomore Brad  
Lewis, who finished 8-for-14 for 64 yards and two interceptions, 
the second by strong safety Ian McIntosh, who returned it 48 yards 
for the game's final points.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A month into the college football season, the Pac-10 Conference  
has cornered the market on startling results. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few weeks there were astounding nonconference  
losses, including Arizona State's 35-7 shocker at New Mexico State 
and Arizona's 34-point loss at Penn State in the Pigskin Classic. 
On a Saturday, when eight Top 25 teams tumbled, the Pac-10 was 
anything but predictable: 
</P>
<P>
	--USC's David Newbury missed three field goals -- two in OT -- and  
Josh Frankel, Oregon's third kicker, hit a 27-yarder as the Ducks 
beat the Trojans 33-30 in a game lasting 4 hours, 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great moment in my life,'' Frankel said. In the  
ensuing celebration, a fan crashed into Frankel's kicking knee and 
may have caused ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joe Borchard replaced injured starter Todd Husak and threw five  
TD passes, including a league-record 98-yarder to Troy Walters, in 
Stanford's 42-32 win over UCLA. Walters had nine catches for a 
school-record 278 yards and three TDs. Stanford, by the way, is 3-0 
in the league after opening the season with a 52-point 
nonconference loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's results knocked the Trojans (2-1, 0-1) and Bruins  
(2-2, 0-1) from the Top 25, leaving No. 25 Oregon (3-1, 1-0) as the 
Pac-10's only ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
	It also left Oregon State (3-0, 0-0) -- looking for its first  
winning season since 1970 -- as the Pac-10's only undefeated team. 
The Beavers, idle on Saturday, open league play at USC next week. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of furious finishes, including No. 7 Tennessee's 17-16  
last-minute win over Memphis and East Carolina's 27-23 comeback 
over No. 18 Miami, the Pac-10, naturally, topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pullman, Wash., Keith Smith's desperation 42-yard TD pass to  
Bobby Wade with no time left gave Arizona a 30-24 victory over 
Washington State. Replays appeared to show the ball hit the turf 
before Wade had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	In the one game matching Top 25 teams, No. 4 Michigan beat  
Wisconsin 21-16 as Tom Brady threw two TD passes and the Wolverines 
dented Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy chances by holding him to 88 
yards -- none in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to hold him to less than 80,'' Michigan  
linebacker Ian Gold said, ``but 88's not bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne needs 1,105 yards in his final seven games to beat Ricky  
Williams' I-A career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches told me not to get frustrated, that we were going  
to get 1- or 2-yard runs,'' he said. ``So I just tried to keep 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was: No. 1 Florida State 42, North  
Carolina 10; No. 2 Penn State 45, Indiana 24; No. 3 Florida 38, 
Kentucky 10; No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M 23, Southern Mississippi 6; No. 6 
Nebraska 40, Missouri 10; No. 10 Georgia 24, Central Florida 23; 
No. 11 Purdue 31, Northwestern 23; No. 12 Ohio State 34, Cincinnati 
20; No. 13 Kansas State 35, Iowa State 28; No. 14 Michigan State 
27, Illinois 10; No. 15 Texas 62, Baylor 0; No. 16 Mississippi 
State 17, South Carolina 0; No. 17 Marshall 34, Temple 0; No. 21 
Alabama 35, No. 20 Arkansas 28; and No. 24 Virginia 45, BYU 40. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, it was No. 8 Virginia Tech 31, Clemson 13. 	
</P>
<P>
                            *CLOSE CALLS 	
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 7 Tennessee 17, Memphis 16    	
</P>
<P>
	At Knoxville, Tenn., Tee Martin's 15-yard TD pass to Cedrick  
Wilson with a minute left saved the Volunteers (2-1) from dropping 
out of the national title race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I would take one point or 50 points, whatever we  
could get done,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said . ``I didn't know 
they would take me literally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis (1-3), 31-point underdogs, held Jamal Lewis to 45 yards  
on 16 carries. In '96, Memphis upset Tennessee 21-17 and knocked 
them out of the title chase. 
</P>
<P>
 *No. 10 Georgia 24, Central Florida 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At Athens, Ga., Javier Beorlegui missed an extra point attempt  
with 5:21 left, and the Bulldogs (3-0) escaped with a win. Vic 
Penn's TD pass to Page Sessions brought the Golden Knights (0-4) 
within a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Florida, 28-point underdogs, got the ball back and made  
it to the 'Dawgs 20 but two penalties, including a questionable 
offensive pass interference call, knocked the Knights out of 
field-goal range. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 11 Purdue 31, Northwestern 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., with Purdue at its 1-yard line and a  
one-point lead with under seven minutes to play, Drew Brees threw a 
99-yard TD pass to Vinny Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest play in Purdue's 112 years of football gave the 	
Boilermakers (4-0) their 10th straight win, the school's longest 
streak since an 11-game run from 1928-30. Brees was 32-of-50 for 
405 yards and three TDs.	
</P>
<P>
                     *Washington 31, Colorado 24 	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, another intriguing Pac-10 game saw Huskies coach  
Rick Neuheisel get his first win, 31-24 over Colorado, the school 
he used to coach, on Marques Tuiasosopo's 9-yard TD pass with 3:17 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
                            *COMEBACKS   	
</P>
<P>
                   *East Carolina 27, No. 18 Miami 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At Raleigh, N.C., the Pirates (4-0) produced one of their  
biggest wins with a rousing comeback from a 20-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	With East Carolina down 23-3 early in the third quarter, Jamie  
Wilson ran for two TDs before David Garrard's 27-yard TD pass to 
Keith Stokes with 4:51 left sealed the upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates were supposed to play the game at home but were  
unable to return to Greenville for more than a week because of 
flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of tension from the long week,'' Pirates coach  
Steve Logan said, ``but we turned that tension into passion in the 
second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 13 Kansas State 35, Iowa State 28    	
</P>
<P>
	At Ames, Iowa, David Allen's 94-yard punt return for a TD and  
Adam Helm's 1-yard score with 2:34 left helped the Wildcats (3-0) 
rally from a 21-point, first-half deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky enough to pull it together in the second half,''  
K-State LB Travis Litton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' winning TD capped the biggest comeback in Bill Snyder's  
11 seasons as the Wildcats' coach.

<HEADLINE> Tide Turns Focus Back to Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- It was the exact same situation as last  
week. Alabama, clinging to a lead with only seconds left to play, 
found itself in the northeast corner of the end zone defending a 
desperation pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Louisiana Tech made the play and beat the Crimson  
Tide 29-28. The loss knocked Alabama out of the Top 25 and sent the 
program into turmoil -- athletic director Bob Bockrath was ousted 
and coach Mike DuBose was put on a seemingly day-to-day status. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, Alabama broke up the play and held on for a  
35-28 win over No. 20 Arkansas (2-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference). 
</P>
<P>
	And just like that, the Tide were back in the rankings at No.  
21, and DuBose got a temporary reprieve from the calls for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who is fighting an uphill battle in the wake of a sexual  
harassment scandal and the athletic department's shakeup, wouldn't 
make the win about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think of it in those terms, as being  
personal,'' DuBose said. ``The key to being a football team is 
one-mindedness, singleness of purpose. When you start thinking of 
personal wins, it starts to become that `me, my and mine' 
mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arkansas, DuBose said the Tide (3-1, 2-0) played as one.  
Five different players scored touchdowns, seven players caught 
passes and two had more than 100 receiving yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly, Alabama beat a Top 25 opponent for the  
first time in three years and stayed in contention for the SEC West 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one was all about the kids, their heart and their  
attitude,'' Alabama defensive coordinator Ellis Johnson said. ``It 
says a lot about them. And it says a lot about Mike DuBose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the off-the-field controversy was Alabama's most sound  
game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Tide committed six turnovers -- Arkansas scored  
25 points off them -- they were successful in opening up the offense 
and got their best defensive performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Andrew Zow overcame three interceptions for 225  
yards and a pair of touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Milons had a career-high seven catches for 109 yards,  
including a 35-yard touchdown, and threw a 66-yard touchdown pass 
on a flanker reverse to Jason McAddley, who had a career-high 101 
yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Alexander, who lost two fumbles, still rushed for 165  
yards on 34 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown run to push 
his season total to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you've got five different players scoring touchdowns,  
you're a better team,'' Alexander said. ``When the ball gets spread 
out like that, the defense gets scattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's offensive line, which was manhandled in last year's  
42-6 loss to Arkansas, shined this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The holes they gave (Alexander), the slowest back in America  
could've gotten through,'' Razorbacks linebacker Jamel Harris said. 
``Shoot, I was a high school back. I could've gotten through them. 
Their offensive line did a heck of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes to show there's more to this team than Shaun  
Alexander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alabama's defense held the Razorbacks to 64 yards  
rushing and harassed quarterback Clint Stoerner all day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoerner, who was sacked once and pressured seven times, had  
little time to set up and find open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this has to feel good for coach DuBose, a lot of people  
were down on him,'' Alabama left tackle Chris Samuels said. ``I 
told him in the locker room that we won this game for him. There's 
been a lot of pressure on his back.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Flooding Fuels Hog Lots Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEULAVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- About a dozen of Rabon Maready's  
neighbors and corporate partners donned rubber boots and waded into 
belly-deep water to gather the rotting corpses of hogs swept from 
their pens by Hurricane Floyd's flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the 1,000 pigs Maready kept at this backwoods site  
drowned when 9 inches of rain in eight hours sent the Northeast 
Cape Fear River surging into his hog houses. Others that survived 
have managed to dodge the people who try rounding them up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want a hog left in these woods,'' said Maready, an  
accountant in coveralls who reduced his workload 10 years ago to 
labor outdoors over hogs and flocks of turkeys. ``It's a 
disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state agriculture department estimated last week that Floyd  
killed 30,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the loss of livestock, the havoc wreaked by Floyd  
in the nation's No. 2 hog-producing state has added to the 
simmering battle between the industry and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say the flooding made their worst fears come  
true: waste from enormous hog farms has contaminated ground and 
surface water. The high water burst one waste lagoon near here, 
spilling more than 2 million gallons of oxygen-depleting waste into 
a waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are certainly paying for our mistakes,'' said Molly  
Diggins, director of the North Carolina chapter of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``No level of preparation would have prevented the tragedy, but  
we could have done far more to prevent the loss of life, the 
environmental damage and property loss,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers see it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It ain't nobody's fault but Mother Nature,'' said Jamie Dail,  
27, who owns and tends 11 billets for swine he raises under 
contract with Murphy Family Farms, the local company that became 
the nation's No. 2 pork producer by introducing mass production 
techniques to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's rainfall flooded the waste lagoon for his hogs to the  
top of its 7-foot-high retaining wall before the water receded. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Cohen, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers  
Council in Washington, noted the floods also washed out municipal 
sewage plants and poultry and cattle farmers. Pesticides, 
industrial chemicals and petroleum products all have been detected 
in the muddy soup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody from the pork industry would ever suggest there would  
not be some environmental ramifications from this storm,'' Cohen 
said Friday. ``For some of these groups, the issue of hogs in North 
Carolina is just obsessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While researchers have yet to propose an affordable alternative  
for waste lagoons, Gov. Jim Hunt called this year for phasing out 
the lagoons over the next 10 years. Taxpayers would help farmers 
switch from lagoons to other forms of waste disposal under his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	One measure Diggins would like to see is moving potential  
pollution sources like municipal sewage plants, animal waste 
lagoons and junkyards out of flood plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Dail said that would not have saved his animals. A survey needed  
for a government-backed loan last spring determined that his land a 
mile from the river wasn't in a flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dail lost more than 90 percent of his 2,500 piglets that were 8  
to 10 weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It don't bother me that the pigs had died. It's how they died  
that bothers me,'' Dail said. ``I don't like to see nothing suffer. 
Burning and drowning is something that I'd like to see nothing die 
from.''

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of a woman  
wrongly imprisoned for her husband's murder, killed the competition 
with $23.7 million in ticket sales to debut atop the weekend box 
office, according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top movie, the Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue  
Streak,'' dropped to No. 2 with $13.2 million. The Bruce Willis 
ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained at No. 3 in its eighth 
weekend with $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major debuts opened weakly. The somber  
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams as a widower who cheers 
up fellow Jewish ghetto residents with fake reports of Allied 
victories over the Nazis, was eighth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' stars Ashley Judd as a woman out for revenge  
against her husband, who faked his own death and framed her for 
murder. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Judd's parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The film takes its title from the legal precept that a defendant  
cannot be tried twice for the same crime. From the filmmaker's 
loose interpretation, it means Judd already has been punished for 
her husband's murder and now can hunt him down and kill him without 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea resonated with audiences in the same way the premise of  
Robert Redford's ``Indecent Proposal'' did, said Wayne Lewellen, 
distribution president for Paramount, which released ``Double 
Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?  
That's a simple, quick concept that's easy to grasp,'' Lewellen 
said. ``I think people were drawn to the concept that she could 
shoot her husband on Main Street and they couldn't do anything to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a female lead and Jones essentially reprising his tracker  
role from ``The Fugitive,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' was a ``date-action 
movie that had appeal to both sexes,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which tracks movie ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' the summer's box office surprise, has taken in  
$225.1 million and moved ahead of ``Aladdin'' as Disney's 
second-highest grossing film behind ``The Lion King,'' which made 
$312 million. Edging past ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Sixth Sense'' also 
climbed into the top 20 all-time moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Blue Streak,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $8.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``For Love of the Game,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty, $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stigmata,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Stir of Echoes,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Jakob the Liar,'' $2.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mumford,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Runaway Bride,'' $1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Richelmi Wins Cyprus Motor Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Jean Pierre Richelmi of Monaco, driving a  
Subaru Impreza, won the three-day Cyprus Motor rally Sunday, 
leading all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave him 200 points and eighth place in the European  
Championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Richelmi won eight of the first 11 special speed stages along  
twisting dirt mountain roads during the first two days. He won only 
one more of the 17 special stages, but finished with a 2-minute, 
35-second lead over Cypriot Andreas Tsouloftas in a Mitsubishi 
Lancer, who was second. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Championship leader, Enrico Bertone of Italy,  
driving a Renault Megane, was dogged by suspension problems and a 
puncture. He finished seventh, but still retained the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was staged over 650 miles. Forty-two of the 82 cars  
that started Friday were forced to withdraw.

	IMF Announces New Debt Relief Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund, under  
mounting pressure in the wake of a Russian corruption scandal, put 
in place a major new debt relief initiative today and announced 
efforts to speed internal reforms. All the activity around the 
annual meetings of the 182-nation IMF and the World Bank was aimed 
at damping criticism that the two giant lending agencies failed to 
coordinate programs and badly mismanaged the recent global 
financial crisis. The new coordinated effort will provide debt 
relief to 36 of the world's poorest nations. It is intended to 
erase up to $100 billion in debt, allowing the countries to commit 
scarce resources to poverty, health and education programs.

	Wreckage of Hawaiian Plane Spotted  
</P>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The wreckage of a sightseeing  
airplane missing overnight with 10 people on board was spotted 
today on Mauna Loa Volcano. Searchers flying over the area found 
the debris at an elevation of about 10,000-foot on the 
mountainside, said Marilyn Kali, a spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Transportation. They did not see any immediate 
indication whether there were any survivors, she said. Rescuers 
were attempting to reach the spot by helicopter.

	Buchanan Not Backing Down  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan relented not an inch today on  
foreign policy views criticized by fellow Republican presidential 
hopefuls. At the same time, Buchanan chastised members of both 
parties for being ``braying donkeys of interventionism.'' He said 
the United States should apologize to Russia for the 
``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into central Europe. And, he 
said, the West today is making the same mistakes in Europe that he 
wrote about in his new book. ``We are repeating the errors that led 
to World War II, and for heaven's sake, stop it before World War 
III,'' Buchanan said on ``Fox News Sunday.''

	Evidence Found of E. Timor Torture  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- As Indonesian troops depart East Timor,  
evidence of torture and executions is slowly mounting. The bodies 
of two men, who U.N. officials said apparently had been executed, 
were exhumed yesterday from graves in Tibar, seven miles east of 
the capital Dili. Earlier in the week, a headless body was found in 
a water well. Locals said 20 more bodies may also be inside. The 
discoveries add weight to calls for the United Nations to send 
forensic specialists to investigate alleged atrocities in East 
Timor.

	Russians Bomb Chechnya Again  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes returned to the skies  
over the Chechen capital for a fourth day today, bombing an already 
heavily damaged industrial district, and Russia's defense minister 
suggested that ground operations could be launched against 
militants in the breakaway republic. Up to now, the military has 
seemed to favor an air war that would keep Russian casualties to a 
minimum.

	Tough Week Expected on Wall Street  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many market analysts expect another rough week  
on Wall Street starting tomorrow. Last week, the Dow Jones 
industrial average fell a total of 524.30 points. The plunge left 
the Dow 9.2 percent below its record close set Aug. 25. Still, 
analysts see one potential benefit from last week's sharp selloff. 
They feel the market's decline could convince the Fed that an 
interest rate increase isn't necessary.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of a woman  
wrongly imprisoned for her husband's murder, killed the competition 
with $23.7 million in ticket sales to debut atop the weekend box 
office, according to estimates today. ``Blue Streak,'' dropped to 
No. 2 with $13.2 million and ``The Sixth Sense'' remained at No. 3 
in its eighth weekend with $8.5 million. ``Sixth Sense'' has taken 
in $225.1 million to reach the top 20 all-time moneymakers.

	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The Americans team today staged a  
comeback in the Ryder Cup that was simply unbelievable. Justin 
Leonard rolled in two long birdie putts, the last one completing 
the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history and keeping that 17-inch 
gold chalice in America for the first time since 1993. The 
Americans faced a 10-6 deficit going into today's final round. No 
team had ever come back from more than two points on the last day.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 60th homer this  
afternoon, adding his name to a couple more record book categories. 
McGwire's solo shot in the eighth inning off Cincinnati's Scott 
Sullivan made him the third player to hit 400 homers in a decade. 
Chicago's Sammy Sosa hit No. 60 eight days earlier, becoming the 
first ever to hit 60 twice. McGwire joined him at the 60-60 mark 
and moved to within one of Sosa for the major league lead.

<HEADLINE> 10 Die in Hawaii Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- A sightseeing airplane with 10 people  
aboard crashed high on the flanks of the Mauna Loa Volcano. There 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane was totally demolished, just like a plane would be  
if it went into rocks at a high rate of speed,'' said Doug Lentz, 
spokesman for the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue crews reached the remote spot on the Big Island of Hawaii  
to recover bodies Sunday morning, said Bruce Butts of the Hawaii 
County Civil Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were released on the victims. The Red Cross was  
working with the tour company, Big Island Air, to notify relatives, 
Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Island Air notified Kona International Airport at 7:20 p.m.  
Saturday that its plane was overdue with a pilot and nine 
passengers, said Marilyn Kali, a spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had taken off from the airport at 4:30 p.m. Saturday  
for a tour of the island's Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a shock to us,'' said Roy Mann, Big Island Air's  
director of operations. ``It just simply hurts. Our hearts and our 
prayers go out to all those families that have been impacted by 
this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann declined to release any information about the passengers  
except to say they were tourists. He also declined to name the 
pilot but said that person had more than 10,000 hours of flight 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain was one of two owned by  
Big Island Air, a 14-year-old tour company based in Kailua-Kona on 
the western side of Hawaii Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a good part of the island is inaccessible by car, air  
tours are a popular way to see the island and its active Kilauea 
Volcano. Helicopters and small planes fly near the bubbling summit 
and then over nearby valleys to see rainbows and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a highlight of most people's vacation tours,'' Mann said.  
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard helicopter had searched unsuccessfully for the  
plane late Saturday, said Lt. Commander Jack Laufer of the Coast 
Guard Rescue Center in Honolulu. The weather was clear with some 
ground fog, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search resumed at daybreak and the wreckage was spotted at  
the 10,000-foot elevation on the northeast slope of the 13,677-foot 
volcano, Kali said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was found on a jagged patch of lava, Lentz said.  
</P>
<P>
	The type of lava flow at the site is ``very jagged and rough,''  
Lentz said. ``It can eat up boots and it's very difficult to work 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Fire Department helicopter landed near the crash site about 6  
a.m. and reported no signs of survivors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were being recovered from the site and flown by  
helicopter to Hilo on the eastern coast of the island.

<HEADLINE> United States 6, Brazil 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan each scored  
two goals Sunday as the United States overwhelmed Brazil 6-0 in an 
exhibition game that was rematch of the women's World Cup 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Parlow and Danielle Fotopoulos added goals and Kristine  
Lilly had three assists to help the United States improve to 
100-8-8 in five years under coach Tony DiCicco. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also was the 22nd of 1999 for the Americans, tying  
the 1998 team for most in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike America's 2-0 shutout of Brazil in the World Cup  
semifinals on July 4, Sunday's game had little suspense. Even 
without leading scorer Mia Hamm (strained hamstring) and goalkeeper 
Briana Scurry (hip twinge), the United States controlled the game 
from the opening kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett beat three Brazil defenders to open the scoring in the  
29th minute, and MacMillan followed five minutes later on a bizarre 
sequence that started when Brazil goalkeeper Andreia was whistled 
for illegally picking up the ball after receiving a pass from a 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	While several Brazil players, including Andreia, argued with  
American referee Sandy Hunt, Lilly grabbed the ball and made a 
quick pass to MacMillan for what amounted to an empty net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians had limited scoring chances and were outshot  
15-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the second for the United States since its  
captivating run to the World Cup title this summer. The Americans 
beat Ireland 5-0 in Foxboro, Mass., on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 people watched that game, and the attendance  
Sunday at Mile High Stadium was 25,099. Several fans brought 
tablecloth-sized American flags and a handful of girls dyed their 
hair red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the game was an exhibition, both teams treated it like  
something bigger, combining for four yellow cards and countless 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan and Brazil defender Fanta argued briefly after getting  
tangled up early in the second half. They will get a chance to 
resume the conversation next month during the four-team U.S. 
Women's Cup '99.

<HEADLINE> Tide Turns Focus Back to Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- It was the exact same situation as last  
week. Alabama, clinging to a lead with only seconds left to play, 
found itself in the northeast corner of the end zone defending a 
desperation pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Louisiana Tech made the play and beat the Crimson  
Tide 29-28. The loss knocked Alabama out of the Top 25 and sent the 
program into turmoil -- athletic director Bob Bockrath was ousted 
and coach Mike DuBose was put on a seemingly day-to-day status. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, Alabama broke up the play and held on for a  
35-28 win over No. 20 Arkansas (2-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference). 
</P>
<P>
	And just like that, the Tide were back in the rankings at No.  
21, and DuBose got a temporary reprieve from the calls for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who is fighting an uphill battle in the wake of a sexual  
harassment scandal and the athletic department's shakeup, wouldn't 
make the win about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think of it in those terms, as being  
personal,'' DuBose said. ``The key to being a football team is 
one-mindedness, singleness of purpose. When you start thinking of 
personal wins, it starts to become that `me, my and mine' 
mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arkansas, DuBose said the Tide (3-1, 2-0) played as one.  
Five different players scored touchdowns, seven players caught 
passes and two had more than 100 receiving yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly, Alabama beat a Top 25 opponent for the  
first time in three years and stayed in contention for the SEC West 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one was all about the kids, their heart and their  
attitude,'' Alabama defensive coordinator Ellis Johnson said. ``It 
says a lot about them. And it says a lot about Mike DuBose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the off-the-field controversy was Alabama's most sound  
game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Tide committed six turnovers -- Arkansas scored  
25 points off them -- they were successful in opening up the offense 
and got their best defensive performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Andrew Zow overcame three interceptions for 225  
yards and a pair of touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Milons had a career-high seven catches for 109 yards,  
including a 35-yard touchdown, and threw a 66-yard touchdown pass 
on a flanker reverse to Jason McAddley, who had a career-high 101 
yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Alexander, who lost two fumbles, still rushed for 165  
yards on 34 carries. He also had a 12-yard touchdown run to push 
his season total to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you've got five different players scoring touchdowns,  
you're a better team,'' Alexander said. ``When the ball gets spread 
out like that, the defense gets scattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's offensive line, which was manhandled in last year's  
42-6 loss to Arkansas, shined this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The holes they gave (Alexander), the slowest back in America  
could've gotten through,'' Razorbacks linebacker Jamel Harris said. 
``Shoot, I was a high school back. I could've gotten through them. 
Their offensive line did a heck of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes to show there's more to this team than Shaun  
Alexander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alabama's defense held the Razorbacks to 64 yards  
rushing and harassed quarterback Clint Stoerner all day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoerner, who was sacked once and pressured seven times, had  
little time to set up and find open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this has to feel good for coach DuBose, a lot of people  
were down on him,'' Alabama left tackle Chris Samuels said. ``I 
told him in the locker room that we won this game for him. There's 
been a lot of pressure on his back.''

<HEADLINE> Law Targets Dangerous Gunowners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Before Columbine High School, before the  
Atlanta day trader offices, before the Jewish community center in 
Los Angeles, there was Matthew Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, the 35-year-old accountant went on a suicidal  
shooting spree in his offices at the Connecticut Lottery 
headquarters. Four people died before Beck put the gun to his own 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers reacted with one of the toughest gun-seizure laws on  
the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting next month, Connecticut police will be allowed to  
confiscate guns from anyone determined to be an immediate danger to 
himself or others. The law is rooted in the notion that rampages 
such as Beck's are preceded by a detectable descent into madness. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the law tramples the Second Amendment and fear it  
could lead to unwarranted searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the standards for seizing guns are so high the  
law will seldom be used. 
</P>
<P>
	From both sides, Connecticut's law -- apparently the first of its  
kind -- is attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Legally seizing a gun will require more than suspicion, said  
state police Lt. Robert Kiehm. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be evidence that the person recently tortured  
animals, threatened to kill himself or others or acted violently. A 
police investigation must conclude there is no other way to keep 
the person from doing harm, and a warrant must be issued by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also requires a hearing within 14 days to determine  
whether the gun should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need probable cause just to begin an investigation,''  
Kiehm said. ``But it gives police officers the power to take some 
proactive steps instead of waiting for something to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck had threatened to kill his bosses at the lottery several  
days before the rampage. His co-workers were so nervous, one 
started bringing a gun to work for his own protection, said Rep. 
Michael Lawlor, the law's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new law, if those co-workers had ``called the cops and  
said Beck was talking about guns and making threats, something 
could have been done before the shooting happened,'' Lawlor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun-rights advocates argue that allowing police to take weapons  
from people who haven't done anything wrong violates their 
Constitutional right to bear arms 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't forfeit your rights just because you might do  
something bad,'' said Dennis Fusaro, director of state legislation 
for Gun Owners of America. The National Rifle Association declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also could lead to illegal searches, said Rep. Richard  
Tulisano. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now police can say, `We saw you kick a dog peeing on your  
petunias, so now we could go in your house and look for guns 
because you might be dangerous,''' Tulisano said. ``What happens if 
they're looking for guns and they find drugs? This law becomes the 
basis for which people could invade your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in other states say the focus on prevention is the  
law's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois Rep. Tom Dart, a Chicago Democrat, said he plans to  
introduce a similar Illinois proposal in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that frustrates me is that when they're pulling  
bodies out of a house, neighbors are telling the police 'Yeah, the 
guy who shot them was nuts -- we all knew that,''' Dart said. ``But 
everyone says that there's nothing that they could have done to 
stop the shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Duke, a Yale University law professor, said he doubts the  
law would have prevented Mark O. Barton from killing nine people at 
two brokerage firms in Atlanta in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``What guy who wants to shoot somebody is really going to be  
deterred because his pet weapon has been confiscated?'' Duke asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lawlor said the new law could stop people like Benjamin  
Smith, the white supremacist who killed two people and wounded nine 
during a two-state shooting spree targeting Jews, blacks and 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's criminal record and reputation for passing out hate  
literature could have prompted police to take action, Lawlor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of this law is not so much that police will seize  
your guns,'' Lawlor said. ``It gives police a system to investigate 
a person who poses a threat. If the police never confiscate a 
person's guns, they can at least look into the person's behavior 
and perhaps prevent a tragedy by intervening.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Announces New Debt Relief Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund, under  
mounting pressure in the wake of a Russian corruption scandal, put 
in place a major new debt relief initiative Sunday and adopted a 
number of internal reforms aimed at improving the agency's 
management of future crises. 
</P>
<P>
	All the activity around the annual meetings of the 182-nation  
IMF and the World Bank was aimed at damping criticism the two giant 
lending agencies failed to coordinate programs and badly mismanaged 
the recent global financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF and World Bank officials, at the first-ever joint meeting of  
the two agencies' policy setting committees, pledged in a statement 
to support ``deeper, broader and faster debt relief'' for the 
world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coordinated effort will provide debt relief to 36 of the  
world's poorest nations. It is intended to erase up to $100 billion 
in debt, allowing the countries to commit scarce resources to 
poverty, health and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the chairman  
of the IMF's policy setting Interim Committee, said the group had 
approved a recommendation to revalue 14 million ounces of the IMF's 
gold reserves to market prices to support the debt effort. He said 
a number of countries had also stepped forward Sunday with new 
pledges of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let it be said of this historic meeting that those to whom the  
world's greatest wealth has been given are joined with those 
burdened down by the world's greatest debt,'' Brown told reporters 
at a crowded news conference at the end of Sunday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was forced to drop plans to sell gold on the open  
markets because of strong opposition from the mining industry, 
which feared the sales would further depress world gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further effort to bolster market prices, central bank  
officials from 15 European nations issued a joint pledge Sunday 
agreeing to limit their own future gold sales to levels already 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	On the reform front, the IMF approved adoption of a new code of  
good practices the agency will use to monitor countries' efforts to 
provide markets with accurate and timely information on key 
economic statistics such as their financial reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF policy-makers also promised to accelerate work on other  
reform proposals. Among those are proposals pushed by the United 
States for the IMF to tighten audit controls over its multibillion 
dollar loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is hoping these reforms will deflect  
the heavy criticism from congressional Republicans since reports 
last month of a wide-ranging investigation into allegations of 
massive laundering of Russian money through accounts at the Bank of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``A changed IMF is needed for the changed world that we now  
have. We have made a good start in many areas, but much more needs 
to be done,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told IMF 
policy-makers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, told  
reporters that while he would comply with the added disclosure 
requirements to the IMF, the data should not be released publicly. 
``It's like a health check between a doctor and a patient,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have said that no evidence has been uncovered so  
far that IMF money was part of the billions being investigated in 
the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded debt relief, to be financed in part by revaluing 14  
million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves at market prices, would 
provide an extra $50 billion in debt relief on top of $30 billion 
pledged in the mid-1990s under a program known as the Highly 
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of stringent performance standards, only four countries  
have received any relief under the program -- Uganda, Bolivia, 
Guyana and Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program eases some requirements which, Brown said,  
should allow three-fourths of the eligible countries, many in 
sub-Saharan Africa, into the program by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief advocates, who enlisted the support of a diverse  
group of religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, generally 
praised Sunday's developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement will translate into more kids in school, better  
health care and a chance for some of the poorest countries in the 
world to participate in the world economy,'' said Seth Amgott, a 
Washington spokesman for Oxfam International, a private aid agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstacles still remain. For example, the debt relief will  
require substantial pledges from wealthy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to helping fund the $80 billion in debt relief  
covered by the HIPC initiative, individual nations will be expected 
to cancel another $20 billion in their overseas development loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration last week asked Congress for nearly  
$1 billion as the U.S. share of this program over the next four 
years. But France and Japan are balking at a proposed formula for 
their share of the debt relief. They contend it imposes too great a 
burden because they have extended far more loans to poor countries 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF and World Bank meetings, which will conclude on  
Thursday, also will review new initiatives designed to prevent or 
at least better cope with Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	On that front, German Finance Minister Hans Eichel on Sunday  
urged accelerated efforts by the IMF and World Bank to help 
countries strengthen their financial sectors. Many of the countries 
hurt by the Asian crisis were found to have weak bank regulation.

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Woos Women, Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- California Republicans are taking steps  
to attract support from women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans always talk about reaching out to women and  
minorities at their biannual convention, but last year's 
devastating elections saw every Republican but two swept out of 
statewide office as many minorities and women voted Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	That added a sense of urgency to the task, and the GOP took  
concrete action on several fronts at its gathering here over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They held one seminar after another on how to reach out to  
specific minority groups, including Hispanics, Asian Americans and 
blacks. The party chairman, John McGraw, convened a private meeting 
in his hotel with Hispanic community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Party activists formed a special political action committee that  
will help finance black candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Others unveiled a new effort to showcase women Republicans to  
those outside the party fold. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rank-and-file passed a resolution Sunday that calls on  
the party to take specific actions to address through legislation 
issues of concern in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution calls on the party to make ``urban reinvestment  
and inner-city development a top priority in the year 2000 and 
beyond'' and to educate party members on urban issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of brothers and sisters who've known me all my life  
questioning my blackness because I'm a Republican,'' said Shannon 
Reeves, head of Oakland's National Assocation for the Advancement 
of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party has got to begin to articulate some  
issues in our community,'' he said at a workshop on how the GOP can 
win the black vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who ran unsuccessfully for Oakland mayor last year and  
spearheaded the ``Urban Reinvestment Resolution,'' said in an 
interview that the measure was an effort to ``get the party on the 
record that inner-city communities are going to be a top 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of Republicans met in July at Lake Tahoe to devise  
a package of specific steps the party will seek. Party leaders 
declined to release a draft containing the initiatives, but Reeves 
said he hoped it would lead to legislation on minority business 
development and access to capital and charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Madrid, who ran a session on courting Hispanic and other  
``nontraditional'' GOP voters, said focus groups in California and 
Texas showed many minorities have an aversion to his party. 
</P>
<P>
	That illusrated the need for strategies that ``softened the  
electorate'' by highlighting values shared by candidates and 
minorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Angie Wiederrich, an expert on women's voting patterns, said the  
party must target specific groups of women receptive to the GOP 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young women are not going to be Republican voters,'' she said.  
``The Gen-X generation does not identify with a lot of issues in 
the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, the growing number of women who own businesses is  
cause for hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiederrich cited an August poll by Public Opinion Strategies,  
which found abortion ranks 24th among issues of concern to women. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, her listeners at a workshop questioned how the party  
should play the abortion issue, which again loomed large at the 
weekend convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The topic is so divisive in the California GOP that a moderate  
wing of the party held a breakaway convention of its own during the 
weekend to protest, among other things, the state party's staunch 
oppostion to the procedure.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Melissa Joan Hart says she's planning an unusual  
form of revenge against a certain New York nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate the doorman; he never lets me in,'' Ms. Hart says in

the unnamed nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got turned away the other day and I was like, `You know,

<HEADLINE> Phillies OK Payroll Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed  
Wade said Sunday that club ownership has given him the go-ahead to 
spend money this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	How much, and whether it will make a difference, was uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	Wade came out of a meeting with ownership Friday ``with what I  
would describe as significant payroll flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be a $60 million, $65 million or $70  
million payroll club,'' Wade said. ``We're not getting there in 
this circumstance, but what we are doing is getting to the point 
where we've got the kind of maneuverability I think we can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies, headed for their 12th losing season in 13 years,  
entered the season with the fourth-lowest payroll in the National 
League -- $30.36 million. Philadelphia was a season-high 13 games 
above .500 on Aug. 6 and in the hunt for the NL wild card, but lost 
29 of the next 36 games to plummet out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling, a frequent critic of the team's frugality,  
reacted cautiously to the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something a lot of guys have been waiting to hear,''  
Schilling said. ``I can't imagine they'd lie about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, an annual Cy Young Award contender who has played on  
one winning team in eight seasons in Philadelphia, issued an 
ultimatum early in the season: Spend money on free agents, or trade 
me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, we've never made a significant impact on  
the free agent market,'' Schilling said. ``It'll be interesting to 
see what happens. It's exciting news, obviously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly believe that with the talent that we have here, if  
a couple of pieces get filled we have a legitimate chance to 
contend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Mike Lieberthal caused a stir last week when he joined  
Schilling in criticism of management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think we have the team to play .500 baseball,''  
Lieberthal said. ``We don't have the pitching to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constrained by ownership's payroll ceiling, Wade tried to  
improve the team last winter with several low-budget moves. He 
acquired Ron Gant and Jeff Brantley from St. Louis, but the deal 
was contingent on the Cardinals paying more than $5 million of the 
$11 million left on Gant's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant had a productive year. Brantley, penciled in as the team's  
closer, missed most of the season with a shoulder injury.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Football Assistant Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia was breathing a sigh of relief,  
having escaped with a one-point win over Central Florida, when 
tragic news spread across campus: assistant coach Pat Watson was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old offensive line coach suffered a massive heart  
attack at his home about 8:15 p.m. Saturday, only four hours after 
Georgia's 24-23 victory. He was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where 
he died at 9:41 p.m., said school spokesman Claude Felton. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia (3-0) struggled against 28-point underdog Central  
Florida, benefiting from a missed extra point and two crucial 
penalties against the Golden Knights in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the game seems like a trivial issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a sad time for our football program,'' coach  
Jim Donnan said Sunday. ``It was a difficult night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 players showed up at the hospital after Watson was  
transported there by ambulance, Donnan said. On Sunday morning, the 
entire team gathered at the Butts-Mehre athletic complex to meet 
with the coaches and staff. Counselors and ministers were on hand 
to help the team deal with its grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat has meant a lot to me personally through the years,'' said  
Donnan, who had known Watson since they were on the staff together 
at North Carolina in 1974. ``He was not only a great father and 
person, he was the epitome of what an old ball coach ought to be. 
He was the first guy at the office, the last one to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held Tuesday at Prince Avenue Baptist  
Church in Athens. A native of Mississippi, Watson will be buried 
Thursday at Pine Hill Cemetery in Enterprise, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Watson's second season with the team. He joined  
Georgia's staff in March 1998 as a defensive ends coach, moving 
over to Chris Scelfo's spot as offensive line coach when Scelfo 
left in December to become the head coach at Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I think we need to come together as a team,''  
offensive guard Reggie Stargill added. ``It's hard to handle a 
situation like this. It's real hard to deal with on your own. We've 
been getting a lot of good support from coach Donnan and the other 
people on the staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Adkins, who also works with the offensive line as well as  
tight ends, will take over Watson's duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson began his coaching career at the collegiate level 32  
years ago as a graduate assistant at North Carolina in 1967. He 
went on to assistant coaching slots at Furman (1969), Mississippi 
State (1970-71), North Carolina (1972-77), Virginia Tech (1978-86), 
Georgia Tech (1987-91 and 1995-96) and Texas (1992-94). 
</P>
<P>
	During his initial stint at Georgia Tech, he was part of Bobby  
Ross' staff when the Yellow Jackets went undefeated and shared the 
national title in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meridian, Miss., native was an offensive lineman at  
Mississippi State from 1961-64. Watson spent two years in the 
Canadian Football League before beginning his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Freddie, and children, Jane and Cal.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Condemns Virgin Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor on Sunday asked Catholics  
to join him in condemning a painting of the Virgin Mary embellished 
with a clump of elephant dung, while civil rights activists 
defended the Brooklyn Museum of Art's right to show the piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, meanwhile, reiterated his pledge to cut  
all $7 million of city funding to the museum -- one-third of its 
budget -- unless the painting is pulled from an exhibit scheduled to 
open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by what appears to be an attack not only on our  
blessed mother ... but one must ask if it is not an attack on 
religion itself and in a special way on the Catholic Church,'' said 
O'Connor in his weekly sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor did not name the mayor, but said he was ``grateful to  
city officials,'' adding: ``It is their right, if not their duty, 
to express themselves on such matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor urged his listeners to write to the museum: ``You might  
want to express your deep sadness at this disrespect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But New York Civil Liberties Union director Norman Siegel said  
the mayor's threats to cut the funding ``violates the First 
Amendment. His assertion that New York City can withdraw all funds 
for the museum based on a single exhibition that he finds offensive 
illustrates a serious misunderstanding of the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel, who discussed the controversy Sunday as a speaker at St.  
Mary's Episcopal Church in Harlem, later said by phone that 
government funding may not legally be withdrawn because public 
officials dislike particular works. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have an obligation to provide funding to the arts  
but once you do, you can't defund a museum solely because public 
officials are displeased with the expression of the art,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn Museum's director, Arnold Lehman, has not publicly  
said what he will do, but he has a reputation for standing firm on 
matters of artistic expression. Directors of other museums have 
been noticeably silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chill in the air because people are afraid of the  
mayor, but if he wins this one there are huge consequences to 
artistic expression,'' Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, meanwhile, defended his funding threat at a news  
conference at a new riverfront park in the West Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the First Amendment that supports horrible  
and disgusting projects,'' Giuliani said. ``If you're going to use 
taxpayers' dollars, you have to be sensitive to the feelings of the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One passerby heckled him as ``Adolf Giuliani!'' and another  
shouted: ``Get your hands off our museums!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' depicts Mary with dark  
skin, African features and flowing robes. It features a shellacked 
clump of elephant dung and two dozen cutouts of buttocks from 
pornographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist, Chris Ofili, 30, a black Catholic who was born in  
England and lives there, has said he used the pornographic images 
because classical images of Mary are often sexually charged. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told Salon magazine in February: ``Elephant dung in  
itself is quite a beautiful object.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls placed Sunday to two New York art dealers who represent  
Ofili and messages left at his London residence were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili began using elephant dung during a six-week stay in  
Zimbabwe. He is now famous for using the material -- which he gets 
from the London Zoo -- in virtually all his artwork. In 1998, he won 
Britain's prestigious Turner Prize, a $33,000 award for artists 
under 50.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Surge Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices nationwide surged more than  
1 1/2 cents in the past two weeks because crude oil prices continue to 
increase, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average nationwide as of Friday was $1.3341, up  
1.63 cents per gallon from a Sept. 10 survey, said Trilby Lundberg, 
who directs the Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-cent-a-gallon dip, however, occurred in the West, which  
continues to recover from a gas shortage prompted by Northern 
California refinery fires in the spring, Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price hike in most areas resulted from crude oil prices that  
have jumped by more than $1.20 per barrel, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lundberg survey showed a national average price for self  
service regular unleaded gasoline of $1.2817. Mid-grade unleaded 
was $1.3803 and premium unleaded was $1.4652. 
</P>
<P>
	For full service regular unleaded, the survey showed the average  
price was $1.6112 with mid-grade at $1.6976 and premium at $1.7720. 
That compares with average prices in the West on Friday of $1.3876 
for self-serve regular, falling from $1.4311 on Sept. 10, Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's Bay Area still reports the nation's highest  
average prices, Lundberg said. Self-serve regular unleaded was 
$1.5813, compared with $1.6315 on Sept. 10, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has the nation's lowest average price with self-serve  
regular unleaded at $1.1151 and the Midwest showed a price hike 
higher than the national average, rising from $1.2356 on Sept. 10 
to $1.2763 on Friday, Lundberg said.

<HEADLINE> Radio: Israel Tests Anthrax Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli army is testing an anthrax  
inoculation on its troops, Israel radio reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The army was testing the vaccine on an undisclosed number of  
soldiers, assessing possible use on citizens if Israel faced an 
emergency situation in the event of a biological war, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The army spokesman had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Israel fears that countries such as Iraq might attack with  
anthrax-laced missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated  
animals. It can be produced as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause 
death within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	It never has been used in combat, but there are fears that  
renegade nations or terrorist groups may use it as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military is in the process of vaccinating all of its  
active-duty and reserve forces against the biological agent.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unable to keep pace with George W. Bush's  
fund-raising juggernaut, former Vice President Dan Quayle has 
decided to drop out of the 2000 presidential race, The Associated 
Press learned today. Quayle will announce his intentions at a news 
conference tomorrow in Phoenix, Arizona, said a senior campaign 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Quayle has been 
running a debt since early in the campaign. Bush, the two-term 
Texas governor, has raised more than $50 million -- five times his 
nearest challenger.

	Russia Considers Using Ground Troops

<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- While warplanes bombed the Chechen capital  
for a fourth day, the Russian military on Sunday warned it may 
launch ground operations against Islamic militants. Russia has 
massed armored forces on the Chechen borders, but military analysts 
say the force is too small to mount a full-scale invasion of 
Chechnya. Until now, the military has favored an air war that would 
keep Russian casualties to a minimum. The militants are separatists 
who want to form an independent Islamic nation in what is now 
southern Russia.

interviewed militia members in West Timor, told The Associated 
Press that they were awaiting the order retake the province and 
were prepared to attack. The militias, backed by Indonesian troops, 
launched a terror campaign in the province after residents voted in 
favor of independence in a referendum on Aug. 30.

agency and a department reorganization. Congress last week 
overwhelmingly agreed to the changes, which came in response to 
months of allegations about Chinese espionage at the nation's 
nuclear weapons laboratories. The reorganization was in a defense 
bill that raises military pay and offers a 4.4 percent 
across-the-board increase in Pentagon spending, including more 
money for military housing and hardware.

<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Ten people aboard a sightseeing  
airplane died when the craft crashed high on the flanks of the 
Mauna Loa Volcano. ``The plane was totally demolished, just like a 
plane would be if it went into rocks at a high rate of speed,''

<HEADLINE> 10 Die in Hawaii Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- A sightseeing  
airplane crashed high on the flanks of the Mauna Loa Volcano, 
killing all 10 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews combing a jagged patch of lava recovered the bodies of  
nine people from Saturday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon Sunday, the body of the 10th victim had not  
been found. The search for the remaining victim was expected to 
continue at daybreak Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of the pilot and passengers have not been  
released. At least some of the victims in Saturday's crash were 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane was totally demolished, just like a plane would be  
if it went into rocks at a high rate of speed,'' said Doug Lentz, 
spokesman for the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might take dental work to identify some of the bodies.''  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. It was not  
known whether there was a distress call. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board investigators also were  
scheduled to arrive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain operated by Big Island  
Air was reported overdue at Kona International Airport at 7:20 p.m. 
Saturday, said Marilyn Kali, spokeswoman for the state Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard helicopter searched unsuccessfully for the plane  
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii County Fire Department resumed the search just before  
daybreak Sunday, reaching the crash site at the 10,500-foot 
elevation of the 13,677-foot volcano at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had taken off from the airport at 4:30 p.m. Saturday  
for a tour of the island's inactive Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea 
volcanoes. Its last contact with the flight control tower was at 
5:21 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a shock to us,'' said Roy Mann, Big Island Air's  
director of operations. ``It just simply hurts. Our hearts and our 
prayers go out to all those families that have been impacted by 
this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann declined to release any information about the passengers.  
He also declined to name the pilot but said that person had more 
than 10,000 hours of flight experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The local American Red Cross chapter was working with Big Island  
Air to notify family members and set up a service center at King 
Kamehameha's Kona Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was one of two owned by Big Island Air, a 14-year-old  
tour company based in Kailua-Kona. The eight-seater was built in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a good part of the island is inaccessible by car, air  
tours are a popular way to see the island and its active Kilauea 
Volcano. Helicopters and small planes fly near the bubbling summit 
and then over nearby valleys to see rainbows and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a highlight of most people's vacation tours,'' Mann said.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane was found on a rough patch of lava known as a`a, Lentz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can eat up boots and it's very difficult to work in,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saturday night crash was Hawaii's worst since Oct. 28, 1989,  
when an Island Air DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed on the island of 
Molokai, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1974, there have been five fatal air crashes within the  
park, killing 43 people.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Market To Limit Share Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Fearful of panic-selling on the Taipei  
Stock Exchange, officials said Sunday night they will impose 
emergency limits on how far shares can fall in reaction to the 
killer earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been closed since the quake struck Tuesday. It  
reopens Monday, and analysts expect a steep dive in prices on 
concerns about economic fallout from the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said individual shares temporarily  
will be allowed to fall by no more than 3.5 percent each day -- half 
the usual daily limit of 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiu said the new limits will ``ensure that market order can be  
sustained.'' The emergency measure will last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that Taiwan's 1999 economic growth will be cut  
to around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent. Interest rates and unemployment could rise as the island 
struggles to bounce back from the quake that killed more than 2,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said information about the quake's impact on  
Taiwan's listed companies is still sketchy, making it difficult for 
investors to make informed decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiu said Taiwan's ``comparatively vigorous'' economy can soon  
recover from problems brought on by the quake. He urged investors 
to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This short-term move will pass quickly,'' he said. ``It will  
not go so far as to cause any panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors around the world are most concerned about the quake's  
impact on Taiwan's crucial semiconductor industry. Manufacturers 
here make 10 percent of the world's chips and about 80 percent of 
the ``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor makers did not suffer much physical damage at  
their plants. They are located mostly in northern Taiwan, far from 
the quake's epicenter in the central part of the island. But power 
blackouts kept them out of business last week and it remains 
unclear how soon they can be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will need to recalibrate the sensitive manufacturing  
equipment, and even if the plants get back into business in the 
next few days, the companies will have lost at least a week's worth 
of production. That could lead to supply glitches in the global 
computer industry, experts say.

<HEADLINE> White House Budget Summit Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the country's fiscal year nearly over,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert says Republicans can still come up 
with a 2000 budget that doesn't raid Social Security surpluses. 
Democrats disagree and want their opponents to sit down with the 
White House to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend not to dip into the Social Security trust fund,''  
Hastert, R-Ill., said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' But 
``it's hard work to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, also appearing on  
CBS, said the GOP approach to a budget that doesn't touch Social 
Security was already a failure, and they would need $30 billion 
from the Social Security fund to meet spending demands being put 
forth by both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of sitting down with the president and us and coming  
up with a consensus budget, they have been following this faulty 
budget and it's just wasted time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fiscal year begins Friday with Congress yet to send the  
president nine of the 13 annual spending bills. The White House has 
threatened to veto seven of those measures, mainly out of 
opposition to low spending levels for administration priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said Congress this week would pass a measure to extend  
government funding for three weeks to provide more time to complete 
the spending bills and avoid a repeat of the 1995-96 budget 
shutdowns. President Clinton is expected to approve the extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the White House and the GOP-led Congress say they are  
committed to protecting the Social Security trust fund in the new 
era of budget surpluses, but they are far apart on how to do that. 
Republicans reject White House proposals to increase tobacco taxes 
and close corporate loopholes to meet new spending demands, and the 
White House won't accept GOP attempts to trim social spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressures to increase spending for education, veterans, defense  
and the farm crisis have more than consumed the estimated general 
budget surplus of $14 billion next year, tempting some to tap the 
$147 billion Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to do everything that we possible can to ensure  
that we don't raid the Social Security surplus,'' said House Rules 
Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' But he noted that ``we have faced this year many 
disasters, Kosovo, other expenditures that were unanticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he was ``happy'' to sit down with President Clinton  
to work out differences, but only after Congress had passed all the 
spending bills. Republicans generally were not eager to negotiate a 
huge budget settlement with Clinton, who is regarded as having 
bested them in similar negotiations last year and who just vetoed 
their most prized legislation, the $792 billion tax cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic that the Republican leadership -- and I'm talking  
specifically about the Tom DeLays -- hate President Clinton so much 
that they refuse not only to talk with him, but any of his 
Democratic representatives,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., on 
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, R-Texas, the third-ranked House Republican, is an  
outspoken critic of the president.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 10, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers finally won the AL  
West on their own, and they did it in grand style. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro hit Texas' second grand slam in as many games,  
powering the Rangers to a 10-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics 
on Sunday that clinched their third division title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time Texas put itself over the top. In 1996  
and '98, the Rangers learned they were champs during games they 
eventually lost. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ryan Christenson grounded out to end the game, Rusty  
Greer, Tom Goodwin, Juan Gonzalez, Royce Clayton and Mark McLemore 
locked arms and jumped around in a circle around second base. A 
flag was unfurled in center field reading: ``Texas Rangers 1999 AL 
West Champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland came to The Ballpark needing a big weekend to remain in  
contention for the playoffs. Instead, the A's were outscored 32-11 
and ran their losing streak to four, their highest since late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland's wild-card hopes are dim as Boston's magic number  
dropped to two despite the Red Sox losing 8-5 to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Zeile, whose grand slam helped Texas clinch a tie Saturday,  
seemed to put this game away with a two-run homer that capped a 
four-run fifth inning and knocked out Oakland starter Kevin Jarvis 
(0-1). 
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, Palmeiro added the final touch when his 46th  
homer of the year drilled the right-field foul pole and ricocheted 
onto the field. McLemore danced home from third base with his arms 
raised as the Rangers reached double figures in runs for the third 
straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro, who upped his RBI total to 146, calmly trotted the  
bases and accepted congratulations from teammates without much fuss 
after his third grand slam of the year. The crowd of 38,656 
remained on their feet until he climbed to the top step of the 
dugout and waved his batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	Esteban Loiaza (9-5) worked out of his only jam in the third and  
lasted seven innings in his best outing in a month. Loiaza, who had 
lost four of his last five starts, allowed one run, four hits and 
struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was hardly ever in doubt as Greer sent Jarvis' ninth  
pitch back through the pitcher's legs for an RBI single and a 1-0 
lead. Gonzalez also singled home a run in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi's RBI single got Oakland within 3-1 in the fourth,  
but the Rangers rallied for four in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's first triple of the year drove in the first run, then  
he scored on a throwing error by second baseman Randy Velarde when 
Palmeiro got trapped in a rundown while trying to steal second. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pitches later, Zeile hit his 24th homer into the left-field  
stands not far from where his grand slam landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis, recalled from Triple-A Vancouver before the game to make  
his first big-league start since August 1997, gave up six runs -- 
five earned -- and nine hits over 4 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Grieve hit a two-run homer in the eighth for Oakland.  
</P>
<P>
	This was the second time the Rangers clinched a title at home.  
They also did it in 1996, but in a bizarre way: they were in the 
13th inning of a 15-inning loss to the Angels when they got word 
that second-place Seattle had lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Texas came off the field after the eighth inning of a  
15-4 loss in Seattle to learn that Anaheim had lost, sealing the 
division crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have played the New York Yankees in both postseasons  
and are 1-6. The teams are on pace to meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* This is the second time this season the Rangers have hit  
grand slam in consecutive games. They had never done it before this 
year. ... Oakland is on its biggest losing streak since dropping 
six straight June 23-29. ... Palmeiro's homer was Texas' 222nd of 
the year, breaking the team record set in 1996. ... Vancouver, 
Oakland's top minor-league team, won Triple-A World Series in five 
games over Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Sleep Deprivation, Alcohol Compared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Too little sleep can slow you down as much as  
too many drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a Stanford University study of people  
with mild to moderate sleep apnea: people whose breathing stops 
several or even dozens of times an hour, interrupting their sleep 
without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 million Americans have the problem but fewer than 2  
million of them have been diagnosed, according to the American 
Sleep Apnea Association's Web site. The undiagnosed figure may be 
as high as 25 million, according to Stanford's Sleep Disorders 
Clinic and Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	People known to have apnea did as poorly on a test of reaction  
time as people who were too drunk to drive a bus or truck in 
California, said Dr. Nelson B. Powell of the Stanford center. 
</P>
<P>
	On three of seven measurements, they did worse than people too  
drunk to drive at all in California and other states where the 
legal test is a blood alcohol content of .08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said he wanted to underscore the dangers of driving while  
sleepy, whether or not it's because of apnea. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times have you or anybody you've known been nodding  
off at the wheel, or said, `Gee, I've got to roll the window down 
or turn the music louder'?'' he said. ``I'd bet every driver, at 
one time or another has driven too tired. We know it's wrong but we 
still do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell presented his study Sunday at the annual convention  
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 
Foundation, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful study,'' said Dr. Regina Walker, an  
associate professor of otolaryngology at Loyola University in 
Chicago. ``It is an extremely well-thought-out, well-controlled, 
prospective study that is looking at something I think is of great 
significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 80 volunteers and 113 people with apnea. The  
volunteers' average age was 29; 56 percent were women. In contrast, 
81 percent of the apnea patients were men, and their average age 
was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	However, statistical analysis ruled out age and gender as  
reasons for the difference, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the people took a 10-minute test of reaction speed,  
pushing a button to turn off a randomly set light. After four tests 
to get their baseline reaction time, the comparison group started 
drinking 80-proof alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	They were tested three more times as they kept drinking. Their  
blood alcohol count averaged .05 percent at the first retest, .08 
percent at the second and .083 at the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California and several other states for anyone  
with a blood-alcohol content of more than .04 percent to drive a 
bus or truck, and .08 is considered legal proof of driving drunk in 
16 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to simple reaction times, analysts looked at six  
mathematical permutations, such as the means of the 10 fastest and 
of the 10 slowest times. 
</P>
<P>
	The apnea patients, whose breath stopped about 29 times an hour  
while they were asleep, did worse on all seven measurements than 
the drinkers did on their first re-test, and worse on three of them 
than those who were legally drunk.

	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers overwhelmingly ratified  
a new contract with Ford Motor Co., and announced it will now begin 
negotiations with DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said 4,923 of about 13,330 Ford

</P>
<P>
	``This is a major accomplishment for the Ford section of our  
union,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW said it would negotiate next with DaimlerChrysler, and  
set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. Oct. 5. Hargrove said he saw no 
reason why the union would strike at DaimlerChrysler. But he added 
that DaimlerChrysler would have to agree to Ford's promise to tell 
its non-unionized suppliers not to interfere in union drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said that includes DaimlerChrysler's Freightliner  
heavy-truck division and Magna International Inc. Both own 
factories that the CAW has been unsuccessful in organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like everything else in business. There are certain rules  
you have to follow, and worker democracy is one of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was less optimistic about a deal with General Motors  
Corp. The union held a three-week strike against GM in 1996, and 
Hargrove said relations were still shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an incredible amount of problems at GM that we have to  
face,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in the United States, the United Auto Workers was  
expected to release the results of a vote on its tentative contract 
with DaimlerChrysler today. Talks between GM and the UAW continued 
this weekend. No deal was expected until after the DaimlerChrysler 
vote.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw's Ryder Cup Strategy Works  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Ben Crenshaw could barely contain  
himself as the good news kept coming in on his radio. He stood at 
the ninth fairway rooting on Tiger Woods, and it got even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Duval is just decimating him. Just decimating him,''  
Crenshaw said as he listened to updates on that match. ``It's 
unbelievable. We're sky high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods had just chipped in to win the hole before, while Andrew  
Coltart was somewhere in the trees searching for a lost ball. Duval 
was 6-up through eight holes, and Americans were leading six of 
seven matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday rout was officially on.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time Justin Leonard made sure it was over, the Ryder Cup  
belonged to the United States once again and thousands of fans were 
celebrating among the fairways of The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the greatest moment in golf right now,'' Hal Sutton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw's decision to send his best players out first proved to  
be his best of the week as the Americans won early and won big, 
putting the U.S. team back in a Ryder Cup many had assumed was long 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard's 45-footer on the 17th hole was the shot that would  
give the Americans the cup, but it was actually won earlier as the 
roars kept building and thundered across the hills of this Boston 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to win the first four matches and we not only did  
that but we won the first six,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``Not only 
that, we dominated them. We had such momentum on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first four Americans out were Tom Lehman, Hal Sutton, Phil  
Mickelson and Davis Love III. They were supposed to get hot early 
and set the tone for the remaining eight players. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked perfectly. All four were leading when the big American  
1-2 punch, Duval and Woods, joined the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost mystical,'' Crenshaw said. ``When we watched  
those four groups go out there, that's what we needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James said his team was outplayed, not  
outmaneuvered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out screeching,'' he said. ``That's what you've got  
to do in this game, ride a streak. And they rode the streak 
remarkably well today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was making the turn in his match with Jesper Parnevik when  
he looked at the scoreboard on the ninth hole and realized what was 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and every match ahead of me was at least 3-up,''  
Duval said. ``We were just trying to show them some American 
firepower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roars seemed to be coming from every corner of The Country Club  
as the lead kept building and, suddenly, there appeared to be some 
chance of erasing a 4-point deficit and making the biggest comeback 
in Ryder Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans listening on portable radios excitedly relayed news of each  
American triumph to each other and every shot by a U.S. player was 
greeted with cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods pumped his fist after chipping in at No. 8. Love  
celebrated his 6 and 5 wipeout of France's Jean Van de Velde. 
</P>
<P>
	And Duval walked calmly down the 10th fairway as Crenshaw  
approached in a cart with his fists up, screaming encouragement at 
him. When Duval didn't acknowledge him, Crenshaw turned the cart 
around and shouted at Duval again, finally getting a nod in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen such firepower going out in the first six  
groups,'' Crenshaw said. ``It ignited everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the first six matches going to Americans, the victory  
wasn't theirs yet. The United States had a 10-8 lead, but needed 4 1/2 
more points to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Pate and Jim Furyk provided two of them, with Furyk  
beating Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia 4 and 3 and Pate wining a 
point from Miguel Angel Jimenez, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It came down to needing half a point, and the Americans got it  
from the most unlikely place. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard was 4-down to Olazabal when he made an 8-foot par putt  
on 12 to trim the lead. He had a look of steely determination on 
his face as Tom Lehman walked up to him on the 13th fairway and 
urged him on. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard promptly won the next three holes, then sank the long  
putt on 17 that made the Americans winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, who predicted the night before that fate might play a  
part in a big American win, kissed the ground in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to believe in fate sometimes,'' Crenshaw said. ``These  
guys felt too good about their game and they believed too much to 
lose.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Town Marks Films Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Thirty years later, people here are  
still excited about going cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good for Greenfield,'' said Dale Yount, who was mayor  
of this small southwestern Iowa town in 1969 when it provided the 
backdrop for a Hollywood film by Norman Lear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold Turkey'' told the fictitious story of a town's crusade to  
stop smoking in order to win $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Greenfield celebrated the 30th anniversary of the  
movie's filming. Greenfield, population 2,000, is about 50 miles 
southwest of Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 1,200 people -- many of them wearing ``Cold  
Turkey'' buttons and T-shirts -- lined a parade route in the town. 
Greenfield's movie theater replayed the film four times during the 
day and not a cigarette could be found on the warm, sun-splashed 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lear, who wrote, directed and produced the movie, was in town  
for the festivities, along with some of the cast: Dick Van Dyke, 
Jean Stapleton and Tom Poston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iowa and Greenfield could not have been warmer. This is a very  
huggable community. I've always divided people into wets and drys. 
Drys don't hug well,'' Lear said Saturday. ``Greenfield and Iowa -- 
they are wet people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield became Eagle Rock, Iowa, for the movie. As the story  
goes, the town had been in a steady decline ever since a nearby 
military base closed. An Air Force official offered the town a 
deal: Fix up Eagle Rock, give it better schools, stores and 
hospitals, and the Pentagon would get a weapons manufacturing plant 
to move there and bring some life back to the depressed burg. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation seemed hopeless until the Rev. Clayton Brooks,  
played by Van Dyke, heard of a tobacco company's publicity stunt: 
Any town whose entire population could quit smoking for a month 
would win $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lear's movie left the message that sometimes what goes into  
people's lungs is less important than what comes out of their 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The funny thing is, it's more timely today than it was then,  
that movie,'' Van Dyke said. ``I think Norman was ahead of his time 
in predicting what was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debby Manning grew up in Greenfield and at age 17, was cast as a  
picketer in the movie. She remembers holding up a sign reading, 
``Help save us from ourselves'' and earning $210 for an hour's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Cold Turkey'' experience gave Lear the confidence he  
needed to produce one of the most influential television programs 
to ever hit the American airwaves -- ``All in the Family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network executives were concerned that the tale of a grouchy  
bigot and his dingbat wife wouldn't play well in the country, where 
they thought the masses weren't astute enough to get the humor. But 
Lear knew better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Filming 'Cold Turkey' in America's heartland taught me a lot  
about how smart and sophisticated the so-called 'silent majority' 
really was, and laid the foundation for the television shows that I 
created in the 1970s,'' Lear said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's festivities ended with a bonfire fueled by cigarette  
cartons and a ceremony for some 20 townspeople who gave up smoking 
for good during the filming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's wonderful that you're burning up those  
cigarettes,'' Stapleton said. ``Young people take notice. Don't 
ever start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although none of the actors or Lear smoke now, they admitted  
that the vice was hard to kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me six years after being here to quit smoking, but you  
stopped right away, didn't you Norman?'' Van Dyke asked Lear during 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stopped on the plane home -- cold turkey,'' Lear said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I was never able to do that. I was wearing the patch and  
chewing the gum,'' Van Dyke quipped.

<HEADLINE> Senators See New Value in Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that he has discovered aerobic exercise,  
Charles Grassley has a new cause to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, the Iowa  
Republican has a Capitol Hill soapbox from which to advance it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Grassley is only at the hearing-holding stage now, he's  
looking for ways to make older Americans more active. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we can encourage seniors to exercise, we should,''  
said Grassley, 66. ``If I'm an older poster boy for exercise, I'll 
accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley held a committee hearing Sept. 14 on seniors and the  
benefits of exercise. The following morning, he ran in an annual 
three-mile race for members of the federal government and the 
media, the SGMA Capital Challenge, underwritten by the Sporting 
Goods Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The final tally showed Grassley placed second in the 60-plus  
team captains category, with a time of 27 minutes, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	But this places him first among 60-plus members of Congress who  
were team captains. That's not a formal category, but it's not a 
bad showing for a self-described nonathlete who only started 
running last fall. ``Under any circumstances, I would not have 
expected to have won anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Grassley disputes any implication that this category was a  
Washington-style narrow definition that manages to fit one senator. 
``I passed Lugar, Cochran and Slade Gorton,'' he said, referring to 
Senate colleagues Richard Lugar of Indiana, Thad Cochran of 
Mississippi and Gorton of Washington, all Republicans. ``And there 
were House members over 60 and federal agency heads over 60.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His standing in the race is an example of how hard work pays  
off, Grassley said. He started by running and walking less than a 
mile, and now runs two miles a day, every day he is in Washington 
and many of the days he is in Iowa, Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and other experts who testified at his committee  
hearing outlined reasons he and other older Americans should keep 
active. 
</P>
<P>
	People who are fit live longer, said Dr. Terrie Wetle, deputy  
director of the National Institute on Aging. One study found that 
unfit men ages 60 and over who became fit had death rates 50 
percent below those who remained unfit, she said. Another study 
found that physically active older people had twice the likelihood 
of sedentary counterparts of living the rest of their lives without 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes little if any equipment or staffing to help seniors  
improve, Wetle said. Studies have found activities such as walking 
or gardening for as little as 30 minutes a day on most days can 
make an aerobic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only good health but good policy results from encouraging  
seniors to be active, Dr. James F. Fries of Stanford University 
School of Medicine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Programs to keep seniors active would save the government about  
five times as much as they would cost in Medicare expenses, Fries 
said. And it would cost Medicare no more than $100 per person per 
year to do the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it would require a change in the law to make Medicare  
change its focus to prevention, because Medicare is now mandated 
primarily to pay for treatment. The researcher also called for more 
research to promote new methods to encourage activity among older 
people and for reviews to make sure the new methods work. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraging exercise is one goal of a new bill aimed at having  
Medicare's administrators focus more on prevention. However, the 
measure sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D.-Fla., and James Jeffords, 
R.-Vt., aims primarily at establishing such prevention benefits as 
screening for high blood pressure, glaucoma and osteoporosis, 
counseling for tobacco cessation, and hormone replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would cost about $5 billion over 10 years, but it  
would create savings that would more than cover the costs, Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the price tag could create a fight in Congress. Graham did  
not expect to push the program through this year. ``It's going to 
be an uphill fight for anything in the remaining weeks of the 
current Congress,'' he said. ``This may have a better chance when 
the Congress comes back after the new year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Grassley encourages exercise, he doesn't want the  
federal government to shoulder any new costs to pay for it. He 
wants health maintenance organizations to do it instead. HMOs 
already are increasing their wellness programs, and ``it doesn't 
cost the taxpayers any more because we aren't paying for it,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Maintains Campaign Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWANZEY, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he isn't  
changing strategies in his campaign for the 2000 Democratic 
presidential nomination, despite polls that show rival Bill Bradley 
gaining on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaking up sun and support from 300 or so folks at a pond-side  
picnic, Gore brushed off a question about the polls as if it were a 
fly buzzing around the apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I'm not taking any vote for granted,'' Gore  
told The Associated Press. ``This is going to be a hard, tough 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One picnic-goer, Randy Filiault of Keene, said his wife is a  
Gore supporter, but he hasn't made up his mind yet, in part because 
he's not convinced Gore is electable. Polls also show Gore trailing 
the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bradley and Gore have touched on the issues equally  
well, but Gore has to overcome the perception that he's 
unelectable. I think that perception has helped Bradley,'' Filiault 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his arrival, Gore joined in a volleyball game for a few  
minutes before launching into his campaign speech. 
</P>
<P>
	With his wife, Tipper, by his side, he sounded broad themes of  
``expanding the definition of human dignity'' by reaching out to 
people with disabilities and others who face discrimination because 
of their race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he listed some of his goals, including a higher minimum  
wage, smaller school class sizes, broader access to preschools and 
more organizational power to labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations, he said, should have less  
power over people's lives and medical needs. ``They don't have a 
right to play God,'' Gore said. ``These decisions ought to be made 
by doctors and nurses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Gore didn't talk about was Bradley. In the AP interview  
after his speech, Gore denied a report in Time magazine that his 
campaign is beginning to orchestrate attacks on the former New 
Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Gore's supporters have criticized Bradley's  
past support of school vouchers that would give parents tax money 
to use for private schools and his proposed policy that would allow 
declared homosexuals to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't said the first word about him. I haven't even  
mentioned his name,'' Gore said Sunday. ``I'm concentrating on 
presenting a positive vision.''

<HEADLINE> IRL-CART Talks Apparently Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Hopes for a possible unification of the Indy  
Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams open-wheel series 
were all but dead Sunday following a statement by IRL founder Tony 
George. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of negotiations, George said the IRL would  
``continue to move forward under current rules and regulations that 
are in effect through the 2004 season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said he sees no reason to unite his all-oval series,  
which has struggled for a major sponsorship since its formation in 
1996, with 21-year-old CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``In recent months, there has been much discussion and debate  
about the future direction of open-wheel racing, specifically about 
a series of discussions that have been conducted between 
representatives of CART and the Indy Racing League,'' he said. 
``While we will continue to communicate as open-wheel racing 
organizations, it is important to clarify that both of our 
organizations are moving forward with our schedules for the 2000 
season and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speaking for the Indy Racing League, we are continuing to plan  
for race dates and sponsorships for the future. Our engine 
specifications through the 2004 season were announced in November 
1998, new chassis will be ready this November, our new 3.5-liter 
engine is already being tested, and we are going forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indy Racing League will continue to operate as an  
independent body and will not be merging or otherwise unifying with 
CART.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART team owners Barry Green, Bobby Rahal and Derrick Walker, as  
well as CART president and CEO Andrew Craig, have met with George 
several times since March to try and unite the two series. Green 
said George's current stance was another step backward for 
open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess negotiations have come to a screaming halt,'' Green  
said Sunday in Houston, where his team finished 1-2 in a CART 
street race. ``I think Tony is confused about what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing. I told Tony in one of our early  
meetings that we owe it to open-wheel racing to put this thing 
together. A few weeks ago, it looked like we had this worked out. I 
don't know what happened, but the only way I'd do this again is if 
you convince me he's really interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL has 11 races at eight tracks, all ovals, this year,  
while CART has a 20-race schedule divided among ovals, road courses 
and temporary street circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	CART, which hasn't competed in the Indianapolis 500 since 1995,  
has been well-funded by sponsors and draws well at road and street 
circuits, but it has watched most of its oval-track crowds steadily 
diminish. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the IRL's events have been poorly attended, with the  
Indy 500, which draws about 400,000 spectators, a major exception. 
</P>
<P>
	But George, who also is president of the Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, said that doesn't warrant the compromises that CART has 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the ones that feel an urgency to get back  
together,'' said George, who was attending this weekend's IRL's 
race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. ``They're the ones who need 
Indy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said, ``CART initiated contact with Tony George and with  
representatives of the IRL last March and has led the process since 
in an attempt to unify the sport for the benefit of the fans. We 
regard this as time well spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking to the future, CART enjoys the benefit of being the  
clear market leader in open-wheel racing in North America. ... It 
is from this leadership position that we will grow the sport, with 
our focus being clearly set on how we compare and perform relative 
to the overall market for sports entertainment properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major obstacle dividing the two groups is the different  
engines they use. The IRL runs normally aspirated engines produced 
by Oldsmobile and Nissan, and has a cheaper fixed price on cars 
than CART, which uses turbocharged engines and cars that are three 
times more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors has won every IRL race since 1997 with its  
Oldsmobile Aurora engine.

<HEADLINE> Braves 10, Expos 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- John Smoltz won for the first time in more than  
a month and Atlanta clinched its eighth straight division title 
with a 10-0 win over the Montreal Expos on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's seventh straight win, coupled with the Mets' 3-2 loss  
in Philadelphia, wrapped up the NL East for the Braves with one 
week left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez's three-run double capped a five-run first off  
Jeremy Powell (3-8) and Smoltz (10-8) did the rest from there. 
Perez added a solo homer in the eighth to make it 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz allowed six hits in eight innings to win for the first  
time since Aug. 24 against Cincinnati. Smoltz, who was 1-6 in his 
previous 15 starts, also went 2-for-3 with a double and was also 
hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Williams went 3-for-4 with a three-run homer, his 16th,  
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams led off the game with a single and was caught stealing  
by Powell. Keith Lockhart then singled, Chipper Jones walked and 
Ryan Klesko singled to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Jordan followed with a two-run single to make it 2-0.  
Andruw Jones walked and Perez hit a one-hop double to the wall in 
right-center to clear the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell allowed eight runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3 innings.  
</P>
<P>
	The Expos had baserunners in each of the first seven innings but  
none advanced beyond second base, including Michael Barrett and 
Vladimir Guerrero who doubled off Smoltz in the second and fourth, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* At 99-57, the Braves need just one more win to become the  
fourth team in major league history -- along with the 1929-31 
Philadelphia Athletics, 1942-44 St. Louis Cardinals, and 1969-71 
Baltimore Orioles -- to win at least 100 games in three straight

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 60th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reaching No. 60 was a lot harder on Mark  
McGwire and took a lot longer the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire added his name to a couple more record book categories  
Sunday by hitting his 60th homer during the St. Louis Cardinals' 
7-5 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	His solo shot in the eighth inning off Scott Sullivan made him  
the third player to hit 400 homers in a decade. Babe Ruth had 467 
in the 1920s and Jimmie Foxx had 415 in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all this stuff will hit me when I'm retired,'' McGwire  
said. ``Obviously it's very meaningful to me. When I retired I can 
sit back and think of all I've accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't think that another 60-homer season would be on the  
list. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has had to cope with a sore back and groin in September  
and has been asked repeatedly about another home run race with 
Sammy Sosa since spring training. McGwire finished with 70 last 
season, four more than Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipping from a bottle of water in his dressing cubicle in the  
subdued Cardinals clubhouse, McGwire said this season has been more 
difficult than his record-setting 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a nice year,'' he said. ``Then again, it's been  
probably one of the most difficult years I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent much of it chasing Sosa, who hit his 60th eight  
days earlier in Chicago and became the first to reach that level 
twice. McGwire trails Sosa by one homer for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left Cincinnati stuck at 59 homers earlier this month,  
Sosa said he never expected to hit 60 again this season. The same 
went for McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd get there again,'' McGwire said. ``To have  
two people do it in two consecutive years is pretty amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't think we could do it again -- myself  
included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he did last year on his way to 70, McGwire hit No. 60  
off the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, McGwire hit No. 60 off Dennys Reyes, keeping him just  
ahead in his two-man home run race with Sosa. The Cubs outfielder 
occasionally caught up with but couldn't surpass McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40,000 fans Sunday showed up hoping to see the Reds win and  
McGwire hit only his second career homer in Cincinnati. McGwire 
flew out to the warning track in his first at-bat, then homered in 
the eighth, drawing applause from the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a hug from manager Tony La Russa when he rounded the  
bases and reached the dugout. Afterward, La Russa was so upset by 
the Cardinals' loss that he couldn't talk about or enjoy McGwire's 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think right now it's possible,'' La Russa said. ``He's  
the second man to do it twice. That's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was noteworthy that he got No. 60 in Cincinnati, the place  
where he's been more of a punch-and-Judy hitter than a home run 
king. He finally got his first career homer at Riverfront 
Stadium/Cinergy Field last July 22, connecting off reliever Danny 
Graves in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is 7-for-39 with four singles, a double and two homers  
in 51 plate appearances in Cincinnati, a span that includes the 
1988 All-Star game and the 1990 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	His homer Sunday extended his record for homers in a two-season  
span to 130. It was the 517th homer of his career.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Study Weight of Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associated Press Wrter    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A Macaroni penguin weighs 11 pounds, more or less.  
</P>
<P>
	More or less is precisely the question that interests Kate  
Barlow of the British Antarctic Survey, who is taking a 
custom-designed penguin weigh-bridge to the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	By weighing penguins as they move between the nest and the sea,  
she aims to collect data on how much food the birds carry back to 
their chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``From that, we can work out how much krill it takes to raise a  
penguin chick,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barlow plans to arrive in November on Bird Island, a small  
bit of land off South Georgia Island at about 55 degrees south 
latitude, 8,000 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the world's population of 5 to 6 million breeding  
pairs of Macaroni penguins raise their chicks on South Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the birds are still plentiful, the British Antarctic  
Survey has noted a long-term decline. Numbers at Bird Island are 
down about 50 percent since 1976, but the cause has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to find out what factors affect the penguin  
populations and how the numbers of penguins relate to environmental 
changes, whether these be natural or influenced by human activities 
in the southern ocean,'' Barlow says. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, we want to know how much food parents bring back  
to their chicks in the colony, how often they feed them and so 
on,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have been weighing penguins by catching one, putting  
it in a bag and hanging it on a scale. The new scale is intended to 
be much less disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 penguins on Bird Island have been tagged. The scale  
reads the tag and logs data on each bird that happens to cross it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird has to stand still to get an accurate weight, so the  
scale includes a small step up for the penguins, to make them 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Macaroni penguins, which stand 28 inches tall, come to the  
breeding colony in late October. Each pair produces two eggs, but 
only one will hatch after an incubation period of 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
	When the chick is young, the father guards the nest and the  
mother swims out to collect food. Later, both penguins share in 
feeding the chick. On average, only a third of the breeding pairs 
is successful in raising a chick, the British Antarctic Survey has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Young birds won't start breeding until they are at least 5 years  
old. 
</P>
<P>
	Data on weight won't immediately explain why Macaroni penguin  
numbers have been declining. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, we're trying to collect as much information  
about the breeding biology of the penguin,'' Ms. Barlow says. 
``It's an ongoing development, and we'll see what kind of data we 
get from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scale was tested on African penguins at Banham Zoo in  
eastern England, but Ms. Barlow says dealing with the large wild 
population on Bird Island probably will require a few adjustments.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Drops Out of Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle will drop out  
of the Republican presidential race, after determining that he 
can't compete with George W. Bush's juggernaut, The Associated 
Press learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle will announce his intentions at a news conference Monday  
in Phoenix, Ariz., said a senior campaign official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure winnows the GOP field to eight major Republican  
candidates, and will increase speculation about the finance and 
political health of the remaining contenders. Conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting the GOP to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quayle official said the former vice president decided to  
quit this weekend, after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and 
campaign manager Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The braintrust determined that Quayle could not raise enough  
money to compete deep into the primary season, even if he fared 
well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reality just hit home that this wasn't to be,''  
said former Sen. Dan Coats, a fellow Indiana Republican and Quayle 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he won in New Hampshire, where to you go from there,''  
asked Coats. ``You don't have the funds ... and you're up against a 
candidate who can outspend you 100-to-1 if he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the two-term Texas governor, has raised more than $50  
million -- five times that of his nearest challenger. Quayle has 
been running a debt since early in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander  
and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire dropped out of the GOP primary 
contest earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president is not expected to endorse a candidacy  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their October finance statements that will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time competing with 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole is  
aggressively trying to raise money to compete against Bush. Her 
situation may be even more precarious, given the fact that she is 
courting the same moderate and establishment Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quayle source said the former vice president has no regrets  
about his campaign, and leaves buoyed by a recent national poll 
that showed him with 9 percent of the vote -- a distant second to 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, however, has been unable to break out of the second-tier  
of candidates in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is still convinced he good fare well -- even win -- the New  
Hampshire primary. But even so, the concentrated primary calendar 
would give him little time to raise enough money 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle entered the race on April 14 in his hometown of  
Huntington, Ind., saying he wanted to rebuild American values after 
``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 1992, the 
former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of political 
gaffes and controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and 
I'm still here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme in his announcement 
speech, betting that primary voters will reward him for casting a 
spotlight on the family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle pitched a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut, billing it  
as a boon to middle-income families. He also portrayed himself as 
the best qualified potential commander-in-chief, recalling his 
participation in White House war councils. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president was always considered a long shot for  
the nomination despite his popularity among grass-roots activists 
and his strong organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he 
misspelled the word in a classroom full of school children. That 
and other miscues turned the vice president into a punch line for 
countless jokes, cementing for many American the perception that 
Quayle was ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came to realize that the primary calendar and Bush's huge  
bank account were two obstacles that he would never be able to 
surmount. And, the source said, Quayle thought it would be wrong to 
ask supporters to donate money to a campaign that couldn't go all 
the way.

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Woos Women, Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- California Republicans always talk about  
reaching out to women and minorities at their biannual convention, 
but this year they're getting serious about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's devastating elections saw every Republican but two  
swept out of statewide office as many minorities and women voted 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	That added a sense of urgency to the task, and the GOP took  
concrete action on several fronts at its gathering here over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They held one seminar after another on how to reach out to  
specific minority groups, including Hispanics, Asian Americans and 
blacks. The party chairman, John McGraw, convened a private meeting 
in his hotel with Hispanic community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Party activists formed a special political action committee that  
will help finance black candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Others unveiled a new effort to showcase women Republicans to  
those outside the party fold. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rank-and-file passed a resolution Sunday that calls on  
the party to take specific actions to address through legislation 
issues of concern in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution calls on the party to make ``urban reinvestment  
and inner-city development a top priority in the year 2000 and 
beyond'' and to educate party members on urban issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of brothers and sisters who've known me all my life  
questioning my blackness because I'm a Republican,'' said Shannon 
Reeves, head of Oakland's National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party has got to begin to articulate some  
issues in our community,'' said Reeves, who ran unsuccessfully for 
Oakland mayor last year, during a workshop on how the GOP can win 
the black vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Madrid, who ran a session on courting Hispanic and other  
``nontraditional'' GOP voters, said focus groups in California and 
Texas showed many minorities have an aversion to his party. 
</P>
<P>
	That illustrated the need for strategies that ``softened the  
electorate'' by highlighting values shared by candidates and 
minorities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Shares Plunge on Taiwan Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Shares plunged on the Taipei Stock  
Exchange early Monday, driven by fears that last week's killer 
earthquake would rock the economy and take a toll on corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips tumbled by 2.7 percent in the first few minutes of  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 396 companies falling -- including the crucial  
high-tech manufacturers. Only 50 stocks were up, mainly of 
companies that sell materials like cement and glass that will be 
needed to rebuild devastated towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had sought to contain any panic-selling,  
announcing temporary measures late Sunday to place emergency limits 
on how far shares can fall in any one session for the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said shares would be allowed to fall  
no more than 3.5 percent a day -- half the usual daily limit of 7 
percent -- to ``ensure that market order can be sustained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Stock Price Index, a barometer of Taiwan's biggest  
listed companies, was down 214.68 points to 7,757.46 shortly after 
trading began. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had been closed since Tuesday, when Taiwan was jolted  
by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people 
and damaged the island's export-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that Taiwan's 1999 economic growth will fall to  
around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent. Interest rates and unemployment could rise as the island 
struggles to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said information about the quake's impact on  
Taiwan's listed companies is still sketchy, making it difficult for 
investors to make informed decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiu said Taiwan's ``comparatively vigorous'' economy can  
quickly recover from problems brought on by the quake. He urged 
investors to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This short-term move will pass quickly,'' he said. ``It will  
not go so far as to cause any panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors around the world are most concerned about the quake's  
impact on Taiwan's crucial semiconductor industry. Manufacturers 
here make 10 percent of the world's chips and about 80 percent of 
the ``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics companies fell 3.2 percent in early Monday trading,  
with many high-tech heavyweights down by 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The big losers included the island's No. 1 chip maker, Taiwan  
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and Taiwan's top personal computer 
maker, Acer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Taiwan needing to rebuild many wrecked towns and  
cities, investors saw promise in construction and material 
companies. Cement makers were up by 6.8 percent, glass companies 
rose by 6.4 percent and steel manufacturers were up 5.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor makers suffered little physical damage at  
their plants, located mostly in northern Taiwan far away from the 
quake's epicenter in the central part of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Power cuts, though, kept them out of business last week, and it  
was unclear how soon they would be able to resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run utility, Taiwan Power Co., said Monday that  
electricity at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, Taiwan's 
version of Silicon Valley, was back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big industrial customers were getting 85 percent of their  
power, but many will continue to face temporary outages of four 
hours in the evening, Taipower said. 
</P>
<P>
	TSMC, the big chip maker, said half of its production equipment  
was in operating order, and it has sold some chips that had been in 
the pipeline before the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it takes time to recover to normal output,'' TSMC  
spokesman Y.C. Huang said in a statement. ``We will try our best to 
achieve this goal as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in semiconductor plants needed to recalibrate the  
sensitive manufacturing equipment. Even if the plants get back into 
business in the next few days, the companies will have lost at 
least a week's worth of production. 
</P>
<P>
	That could lead to supply glitches in the global computer  
industry, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Nike Launches $15 'World Shoe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Trying to tap the big and booming pool of  
consumers in developing nations, Nike has launched the ``World 
Shoe,'' which come as cheap as $15 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
	The canvas shoes are aimed at markets in Asia, Africa and Latin  
America and have been on sale for several weeks in China, Malaysia, 
the Philippines and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike officials say it's too early to tell how the shoes are  
doing. But the company said sales could hit $150 million next year, 
then grow well beyond that. By comparison, Nike sold $200 million 
worth of its successful Tuned Air sneakers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoe is part of a major new company strategy to expand  
into relatively poor areas of the world where Nike does little 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Those regions hold legions of consumers; 3 billion people live  
in Asia alone. And as those populations grow larger and richer, the 
company hopes they'll develop into loyal Nike customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to position it as a premium but attainable for an  
(everyday) athlete in the market,'' said Margaret Mager, a Goldman 
Sachs analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to avoid being elitist ... they want to be a brand  
for the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, where footwear can come as cheap as $3 a pair, the $15  
basic World Shoe is a midpriced offering, said Tony Balfour, the 
company's general manager for the Asia Pacific region. That makes 
it the Asian equivalent of the approximately $60 midrange athletic 
shoes that are at the low end of Nike's U.S. offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoes won't be distributed in the United States or other  
developed markets, Balfour said. Nike doesn't want to take sales 
away from its more advanced and expensive shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics, who say Asian workers that make Nikes are  
underpaid, have pointedly noted that the laborers can't buy the 
shoes they make. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike acknowledged that while the World Shoe will be more  
affordable, many people in developing nations still won't be able 
to pay $15 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it should at least triple the potential market for Nikes  
in Asia, Balfour said. Right now, the Asian market is dominated by 
local brands and shoes manufactured by Bata, a giant Canadian 
manufacturer that is a partner with Nike on some products. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoe is actually a family of shoes: four models geared  
toward running, basketball, soccer and cross training. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoes have a simple, clean design, Balfour said, with canvas  
uppers surrounding the foot in one color, adorned with the 
trademark Nike swoosh in a contrasting color. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Shoes have rubber soles with a waffle pattern, taking  
Nike back to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bowerman, Nike co-founder, developed the sole in 1971 by  
pouring rubber on his wife's waffle iron. The resulting lightweight 
sole put Nike on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, (manufacturers) have been able to literally  
drag old equipment from the back of factories and use that'' to 
make the World Shoes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its fiscal year 1999, which ended May 31, Nike sold $455  
million of shoes in Asia, less than 9 percent of its total footwear 
sales.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of a woman  
wrongly imprisoned for her husband's murder, killed the competition 
with $23.7 million in ticket sales to debut atop the weekend box 
office, according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top movie, the Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue  
Streak,'' dropped to No. 2 with $13.2 million. The Bruce Willis 
ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained at No. 3 in its eighth 
weekend with $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major debuts opened weakly. The somber  
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams as a widower who cheers 
up fellow Jewish ghetto residents with fake reports of Allied 
victories over the Nazis, was eighth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' stars Ashley Judd as a woman out for revenge  
against her husband, who faked his own death and framed her for 
murder. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Judd's parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The film takes its title from the legal precept that a defendant  
cannot be tried twice for the same crime. From the filmmaker's 
loose interpretation, it means Judd already has been punished for 
her husband's murder and now can hunt him down and kill him without 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea resonated with audiences in the same way the premise of  
Robert Redford's ``Indecent Proposal'' did, said Wayne Lewellen, 
distribution president for Paramount, which released ``Double 
Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?  
That's a simple, quick concept that's easy to grasp,'' Lewellen 
said. ``I think people were drawn to the concept that she could 
shoot her husband on Main Street and they couldn't do anything to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a female lead and Jones essentially reprising his tracker  
role from ``The Fugitive,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' was a ``date-action 
movie that had appeal to both sexes,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which tracks movie ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense'' has taken in $225.1 million and moved ahead of  
``Aladdin'' as Disney's second-highest grossing film behind ``The 
Lion King,'' which made $312 million. Edging past ``Ghostbusters,'' 
``Sixth Sense'' also climbed into the top 20 all-time moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Blue Streak,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $8.5 million.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Europe Team Angry at US Celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The European Ryder Cup team was outraged  
by the U.S. team's celebration of Justin Leonard's putt that all 
but won the tournament for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Leonard sank the 45-foot shot, most of the seven U.S.  
players, along with several caddies, officials and wives, stormed 
the green to embrace him as thousands of fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal, however, still had a 25-foot putt with a  
chance to equal Leonard. He watched as the group ran across his 
line on the 17th green, hugging and hollering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans quickly collected themselves after the  
celebration, slightly embarrassed. Then Olazabal missed the shot, 
sealing his team's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was very sad to see. It was an ugly picture to  
see,'' Olazabal said. ``You can cheer your own team as much as you 
want but just show some respect for the opponent. As simple as 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, who was heckled throughout the tournament by  
fans, said he couldn't believe what he saw Sunday. Jesper Parnevik 
also said such breakdowns in decorum were unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should just not ever happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Torrance of England, a former Ryder Cup player, told Sky  
Television in London: ``It's about the most disgusting thing I've 
ever seen. This is not sour grapes. ... Tom Lehman calls himself a 
man of God. His behavior today has been disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman said the excitement overtook him and the others. Steve  
Pate remained off the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably wish we all would have jumped up and down in place  
instead of running to the side of the green,'' Lehman said. ``But 
I'm not going to apologize for being excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European team captain Mark James said he did not hold his  
American counterpart, Ben Crenshaw, responsible and expected no 
apology. Crenshaw offered one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do apologize sincerely,'' he said. ``There wasn't any call  
for that. The celebration started spilling over and it really was 
not something that we need to be proud of, and we've apologized. 
... We're truly sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard took some of the blame, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I shouldn't have run off the green,'' he said. ``And I do  
apologize for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal offered a conciliatory note as the post-tournament  
interviews were ending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all want to congratulate the American team,'' the  
Spaniard said. ``We are not trying to find any excuse on the words 
that we mentioned about the way they behaved on 17.''

<HEADLINE> Elections To Test Mexico Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A growing movement to unite Mexico's  
opposition parties was put to the test Sunday in the border state 
of Coahuila, where a broad opposition coalition was battling the 
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party for the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The election comes two months after a similar coalition  
decisively beat the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in 
another state. It also comes as national leaders of Mexico's two 
top opposition parties are negotiating on a possible national 
alliance for the 2000 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But opinion polls ahead of the Coahuila vote did not look good  
for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The PRI, which has always governed Coahuila, was leading the  
coalition by 52 percent to 24 percent, according to a poll 
published Monday by the Coahuila daily newspaper Palabra. The Sept. 
10-12 poll of 1,200 state residents had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Coahuila, which stretches along the Texas border from the Big  
Bend area almost to Laredo, has 1.3 million registered voters. They 
will also choose a state legislature and 38 mayors. Results were 
not expected before late Sunday or early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated electoral reforms in recent decades have made Mexican  
elections more fair and competitive. The PRI has seen its poll 
numbers fall to about 40 to 45 percent nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	That's still much higher than the preference for any other  
party. Opposition parties can top the PRI in some states, but none 
is a major force by itself throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on an opposition coalition for the presidential  
race are scheduled to resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	They stalled on Wednesday when National Action party leaders  
balked at a proposal for a national primary. National Action fears 
a primary could be manipulated by the Democratic Revolution party, 
which had to cancel its own internal leadership vote earlier this 
year after party members accused one another of fraud.

<HEADLINE> Church Mulls Cell Tower in Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA. Va. (AP) -- A financially struggling church is  
considering a deal with Ma Bell: Allow AT&AMP;T to build a 
130-foot-tall cross with a cellular phone tower concealed inside 
and First Christian Church will get $18,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a godsend, from our perspective,'' said the Rev.  
Tim Mabbott, the church pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would represent almost 10 percent of the church's  
annual budget and help put the church back on solid footing. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the church's neighbors, the proposed cross is a  
troubling sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have anything against the church,'' said Michael  
Cassidy, who lives directly behind First Christian. ``The church 
has been wonderful to this neighborhood. We believe in the church, 
but we don't believe in the encroachment of AT&AMP;T in a residential 
neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T usually places cell phone equipment on existing buildings,  
but about 15 percent of the time that isn't possible, said Alexa E. 
Graf, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The company initially approached Alexandria's First Baptist  
Church, she said, but the Baptists were not interested in hiding 
the equipment in their steeple. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are debating what we are going to do,'' Ms. Graf said. ``If  
the community opposition stays as strong as it is right now, we are 
going to have to rethink our other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is not what Mabbott wants to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, First Christian was on the verge of closing its  
doors. The church was running an annual deficit and the aging 
congregation considered selling its land to a neighboring 
retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very valuable piece of property and there was some  
talk of selling it to raise money and moving out to an area with 
more young children and families,'' Mabbott said. ``But we decided 
to give it another try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For longtime church member Betty Pratt, the debate over the cell  
tower boils down to common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the people who came up here the other day and were upset  
about this had cell phones,'' Ms. Pratt said. ``I don't know where 
they think those signals are going to bounce off of. They have got 
to bounce off something. You know the tower has to go someplace and 
we might as well get the benefit of it.''

<HEADLINE> E.Carolina Rewarded for Perseverance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- After a week in its home-away-from-home,  
East Carolina was rewarded for its perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina, forced to spend a week on the road waiting for  
the effects of Hurricane Floyd to subside, mounted a fourth-quarter 
rally and knocked off Miami 27-23 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped a week in which the No. 19 Pirates (4-0) had to spend  
a week in Columbia, S.C., where they beat the University of South 
Carolina the previous weekend. That was one week in a motel, with 
trips to the mall, the movies and a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly's desperation  
fourth-down pass sailed out of bounds to secure the victory, the 
Pirates let their emotions show in a variety of ways. Some ran 
around in celebration, others thrust their fists into the sky, 
while a few more simply fell on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the reality of what Floyd has done to coach Steve  
Logan's bunch of football nomads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some aftermath to contend with,'' Logan said. ``I've  
got 18 to 20 players that are displaced. We've got to get them 
re-situated, and in the meantime, we've got to prepare for a 
football game this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for this week's game was tough enough. Logan and his  
team used the indoor and outdoor facilities at South Carolina to 
prepare for the 18th-ranked Hurricanes. Because the situation in 
Greenville changed every day, the Pirates switched the game from 
their home field to North Carolina State's Carter-Finley Stadium, 
some 85 miles to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, it appeared that the makeshift arrangements  
took their toll on the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina committed two turnovers, seemed to be a little out  
of rhythm on offense and unable to wrap up on defense. Throughout 
the game, Kelly escaped the Pirates and scrambled for big gains. 
Reserve running back Clinton Portis ran through East Carolina for 
147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	At the half, Miami (2-2) built a 20-3 lead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to know what we did at halftime. The only  
thing we did at halftime, I just begged our offense to please not 
turn the ball over any more,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap may have awakened the Pirates, but Miami coach Butch  
Davis said if his team eased up a little, it was wrong to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team should have definitely not gotten complacent at  
halftime,'' Davis said. ``We came into this game knowing that ECU 
was very dangerous entering the game 3-0. They are a talented and 
dangerous team and there should not have been any complacency in 
our locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes pushed the lead to 23-3 on Andy Crosland's  
47-yard field goal with 12:13 left in the third quarter. That's 
when East Carolina took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Wilson, whose earlier fumble led to a touchdown, ran 23  
yards for a score with 9:43 left in the period. Wilson then capped 
an 84-yard drive with an 18-yard touchdown run with 11:59 to play, 
closing the gap to 23-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Miller added a 39-yard field goal with 9:30 left to draw  
the Pirates closer. By then, the Hurricanes showed no semblance of 
the offense that ran up 301 yards through three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina capped the comeback with a 79-yard, 10-play drive  
that ended on David Garrard's 27-yard scoring pass to Keith Stokes 
with 4:51 left. When time ran out, fans ignored pleas to stay off 
the field and tore down both goal posts. Security guards kept the 
poles in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was ready to refute the notion that having had to prepare  
under adverse conditions would have an impact on his team. Miami 
wide receiver Reggie Wayne agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a perfect season already and they would play hard  
to keep it, no matter what the situations are,'' said Wayne, who 
caught a 21-yard scoring pass from Kelly in the first quarter. ``A 
top 10 team's coming in to play them and they're going to play hard 
regardless. We knew they would come out and play hard. In the 
second half, we came out and we didn't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the game at No. 9, the Hurricanes were the  
highest-ranked team East Carolina has ever beaten. Now, reality 
lies ahead and it doesn't necessarily have to do with football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't even there. We didn't even have to deal with many  
of the things that have already been dealt with,'' Logan said. ``I 
told the kids all week to keep counting their blessings and we were 
well taken care of and we had a lot of good times in the hotel. It 
really kind of pulled us together in some ways, although nobody's 
got any underwear.''

<HEADLINE> German Cos. Meet on Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The boards of German utilities Veba  
and Viag met to discuss a $14.6 billion merger to create Europe's 
second-biggest electricity supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the results of Sunday's meeting would be  
announced today in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	But approval of the deal, which would create a European  
conglomerate with interests as diverse as chemicals, 
telecommunications and real-estate management, was seen as certain, 
German media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would become No. 1 in Germany, ahead of RWE AG,  
but still trail Electricite de France in the European power market. 
The French company has been aggressively seeking to expand outside 
France, and German companies have been under pressure to 
consolidate to better compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' proposal reportedly calls for shareholders to  
vote on the merger early next year so the new conglomerate can 
start business by mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also must be approved by the Bavarian state government,  
which owns 25.1 percent of Viag. The state government has said it 
wants to sell its Viag stake by 2003 but also wants to protect the 
20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also requires the approval of antitrust authorities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Funds for Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's supposed to be resting his severely  
strained voice. But President Clinton isn't shying from the road to 
press Congress to approve funds for public school construction and 
raise money for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was traveling today to New Orleans to visit a  
local middle school and give a speech on ``the importance of the 
Congress moving forward on school modernization,'' said White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was addressing two fund-raisers for Rep.  
William Jefferson, D-La., before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was making the trip two days after his doctors diagnosed  
edema of his vocal chords, essentially strain from talking too 
much. They recommended that the president speak only when necessary 
for the next 10 days -- a tough task given Clinton's chatty nature 
and the series of fund-raising appearances awaiting him on the West 
Coast at the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very difficult, given the commitments that he's  
made and the work schedule that he has, to do exactly what the 
doctors have recommended,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is concerned about the hoarseness and his  
ability to continue to make the fine speeches he makes around the 
country. We're going to do our best to make sure we get him the 
rest he needs,'' the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut  
proposal and called on Congress to work with him on achieving a 
compromise over spending priorities before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a visit to Norfolk, Va., days before that veto, the president  
urged Congress to ``leave politics at the schoolhouse door'' and 
embrace his plan for tax breaks to help school districts repair, 
expand and upgrade schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, about 25,000 school buildings -- roughly a third of 
the nation's public schools -- are in need of extensive repairs or 
must be replaced altogether. The GAO estimated that simply 
repairing existing schools would cost $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's bond proposal for school modernization would provide  
$24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over two years, in the idea that 
the amount would make it cheaper for local school districts to 
modernize up to 6,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to census figures, school districts nationwide spent  
$18.7 billion on school construction in 1996, the latest year for 
which data was available. The districts spent $15.9 billion in 1995 
and $14.4 billion in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Sutton a Winner After Ryder Absence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Hal Sutton's successful return to the  
Ryder Cup ended without him hitting a ball into the cup on his 
final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was thrilled, considering he didn't have a chance to take  
a single shot in the previous five Ryder Cups because he failed to 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory Sunday when Europe's Darren Clarke conceded the 16th  
hole gave the United States an early boost, fueling the momentum 
that built until the Americans completed their historic comeback 
for a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dramatic milestone in Sutton's once promising career  
that nose-dived after he played in his second Ryder Cup in 1987. In 
this Ryder Cup, he was the leading scorer for the United States 
with 3 1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a family. This is a team. This is history being made  
today and we all wanted to be a part of that,'' said Sutton, the 
world's 10th-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
	He never lost hope the Americans could regain the Cup despite  
their 10-6 deficit after two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've all got some fight left in us,'' he said after  
Saturday's play. Then he spoke at a team meeting that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only comments last night were if we go down let's go down  
with all our oars in the water,'' he said after his win Sunday. 
``There was no doubt in my mind leaving that meeting we all felt we 
could go out and make a real run at this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton did his part by beating Clarke 4 and 2.  
</P>
<P>
	On the 16th hole, a par 3, Sutton hit his tee shot 20 feet short  
of the cup. And Clarke self-destructed. His first shot went into a 
bunker at the right front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, Hal,'' a fan yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Clarke then blasted his second shot out of the sand and behind  
the green. Then his chip back rolled off the front edge. And then 
he conceded the hole. Sutton simply raised his arm, removed his 
cap, picked up his ball marker and walked off in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' he said. ``It's the greatest feeling I've ever  
had in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans started the day trailing by four with 12 singles  
matches left. No team had ever made up more than a two-point 
deficit entering the final day. But Sutton's win cut the lead to 
10-9 and the United States kept rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to set the pace,'' the 41-year-old Louisianan said.  
``That was the plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton enjoyed plenty of success early in his career, winning  
the 1980 U.S. Amateur, 1983 PGA Championship and seven events in 
his first five years on the tour. In 1985 and 1987, he played in 
the Ryder Cup but totaled just one-half point as the Americans lost 
both tournaments. 
</P>
<P>

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Brian McBride headed in two corner kicks  
within five minutes as the Columbus Crew beat the Miami Fusion 2-1 
in a Major League Soccer game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride got up over defenders to head in a corner from the right  
side by Robert Warzycha in the 76th minute. McBride put the ball 
inside the far post past Fusion goalie Jeff Cassar from 14 yards 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Warzycha found McBride on a corner kick from the left side in  
the 81st minute. This time Cassar came off his line, but McBride 
beat him to the ball and headed it into an open net from 10 yards 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride recently signed a new contract that will keep him with  
the Crew through the 2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion took a 1-0 lead just before halftime after midfielder  
Jeff Bilyk stole the ball from Crew defender Todd Yeagley and 
passed to Eric Wynalda. Wynalda dribbled up the right sideline, 
broke inside and scored on a shot from 23 yards to beat goalie Mark 
Dougherty in the 43rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty had seven saves and Cassar none.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbus is 19-11 and Miami is 11-19.

<HEADLINE>  Turkey Cops Storm Prison, 7 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Seven people were killed and 19 injured in  
a seven-hour battle between left-wing inmates and guards at an 
Ankara prison on Sunday, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards at Ulucanlar prison were searching for weapons and trying  
to transfer some prisoners when the fighting began. Security forces 
fired tear gas at inmates and barricaded roads to the area. No 
other details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish police have little control over the country's  
overcrowded prisons and it is not uncommon for inmates to have 
weapons and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioting quickly spread to six other prisons across the country  
where left-wing inmates took at least 49 prison guards hostage, 
Anatolia reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ankara, security officers stormed the wards of Ulucanlar  
prison to transfer some left-wing inmates loyal to the 
Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front and the Turkish 
Workers Peasants Liberation Army to other prisons and search for 
weapons, Anatolia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates from radical political organizations often run their own  
wards, which they decorate with flags and political posters. They 
have long resisted attempts by prison officials to break up the 
wards by transferring inmates to other prisons where they would be 
put in smaller cells and unable to meet with their comrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, speaking to reporters before his  
departure on a visit to the United States, said the fighting began 
after authorities were informed that prisoners had dug a tunnel to 
escape from the prison.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Hire Former Rockies GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bob Gebhard, who resigned under fire in August  
as general manager of the Colorado Rockies, was hired by the St. 
Louis Cardinals Sunday as special assistant to general manager Walt 
Jocketty. 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming general manager of the Cardinals in 1995,  
Jocketty was Gebhard's assistant in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said Gebhard will work closely with Jocketty on  
day-to-day operation of the team, as well as player evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard was hired by the Rockies in the fall of 1991 -- about 18  
months before the expansion team started play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He built a team long on power, selecting Vinny Castilla in the  
1992 expansion draft, trading for players such as Dante Bichette 
and Andres Galarraga, and acquiring Larry Walker as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colorado has been short on pitching and defense. In their  
seven seasons, the Rockies have won one divisional title and no 
pennants. They entered Sunday 69-86, last in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals won the NL Central and came within a game of the  
pennant in 1996, but have not won since. St. Louis entered Sunday's 
game against Cincinnati with a 72-82 record, fourth in the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard began his professional baseball career as a pitcher,  
playing 11 years, including stints with the Minnesota Twins and 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player-coach for Montreal from 1974-75, was promoted to  
minor league field director in 1976 and later to pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Twins in 1987 as director of player personnel, and  
became a team vice president the following year.

<HEADLINE> NC Flood Victims Thankful for Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- People across eastern North Carolina  
put down their cleaning supplies briefly Sunday to give thanks for 
the help they have received in recovering from Hurricane Floyd's 
deadly flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``God has been so good to us when this happened,'' said Melanie  
Hicks, who had spent the week trying to salvage her Rocky Mount 
uniform business. ``I don't know how people deal without faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the flooded region, church services were held Sunday  
wherever a dry spot could be found, from parking lots to day-care 
centers to shelters for people left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rocky Mount, where nearly a quarter of the town was under  
water at one point and more than 3,000 homes and businesses were 
damaged, some 800 people attended a service in the parking lot of 
the Englewood Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The church was never threatened by the high water, and was able  
to serve as a place where people could donate items, get a hot meal 
or pray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to feed them; we're going to clothe them; we're  
going to give them deodorant, praise God,'' the Rev. Donald Pope 
said in his sermon. ``The most important thing that we can ever 
give them is what happened at Calvary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those at the service was Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., who  
offered thanks for the donations that have poured into the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely amazing to watch how God's children  
respond,'' Edwards said. ``The response both here and all over this 
state has been absolutely heroic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In hard-hit Tarboro, about 50 parishioners of His Majesty Church  
and a group of volunteers from Axton, Va., held a service in the 
lobby of a day-care center, opening with the hymn ``It's All 
Right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, the eight volunteers had helped pull waterlogged  
furnishings out of the church, which had water 9 1/2 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the midst of the storm, God sent us some people, and I  
thank him for giving us these people, because they put a face on 
Christ,'' said Barbara Pittman, whose husband is the bishop of the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	Although water continued to recede Sunday, many rivers remained  
above flood stage and some were not expected to drop below that 
point until Friday. Light showers and thunderstorms were forecast 
for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,790 people remained in shelters Sunday, their homes  
either still inundated or judged unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd killed 47 people in North Carolina, among some 70 who died  
from the Bahamas to New England. Preliminary estimates are that the 
storm caused $70.2 million in housing damage in eastern North 
Carolina, with more than 2,600 homes destroyed or seriously 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide, more than 35,000 people have registered for state and  
federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person has been accused of trying to take advantage  
of the misery left by Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Scott L'Hommedieu, 33, of Fort Myers, Fla., was arrested  
Friday after he allegedly tried to charge $2,980 to clean 
flood-damaged carpets. The work should have cost about $650, said 
Ted Carlton of the state Alcohol Law Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The carpets belong to the Topsail Beach Police Department.

<HEADLINE> Inkster Swings Into LPGA Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Juli Inkster became the 17th member of the  
LPGA Hall of Fame on Sunday, dominating the final round of the 
$800,000 Safeway LPGA Golf Championship to win by six strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, who shot a 2-under 70, led the three-day tournament  
almost from the beginning and finished at 9-under 207. Tina Barrett 
and 1998 U.S. amateur champion Grace Park tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster bogeyed only two holes all day, 14 and 18. She hit her  
approach shot within 12 feet on the final hole, then three-putted. 
She shrugged her shoulders at the gallery, made the putt and 
promptly got a shower of champagne from a group of fellow players. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster won her fifth tournament of the year and first since the  
LPGA Championship in Wilmington, Del., in late June. That was her 
second major of the year, as she also won the U.S. Open. She has 22 
career victories, including five majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Karrie Webb, who missed the cut for only the second time in  
22 tournaments this year, has more 1999 victories than Inkster -- 
six. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, who won $120,000 for first place, was extremely  
consistent on the 6,307-yard Columbia-Edgewater Country Club 
course, even amid windy, cool conditions. She was tied with her 
friend Rosie Jones after Friday's first round, then shot a 70 
Saturday to take a three-stroke lead as the other golfers struggled 
in the unpredictable weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, she birdied Nos. 5, 6 and 7 to pad her lead, and was  
never threatened after that. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Inkster joined Beth Daniel and Amy Alcott in  
qualifying for the Hall of Fame this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett shot a 4-under 68 to follow Saturday's 77 and finish  
tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, who breezed through the Futures Tour to earn her LPGA Tour  
card for next season, finished in the money for the first time this 
year. She played in her fourth and final event of 1999 on a 
sponsor's exemption and earned $64,410 with the tie for second.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Pop and gospel singer Amy Grant says  
movie offers began rolling in after her 1991 music video ``Baby, 
Baby'' but acting never appealed to her until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority either were asking me to play a singer or a  
prairie woman,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
	The timing was good, she said, conceding that she felt  
``creatively flat-lined'' after her recent divorce from singer Gary 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the energy to write. And at that time in life,  
it was good to get in a work setting and not play me,'' she said.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It wasn't the kind of show Michael Andretti  
wanted to put on. Still, finishes of third and seventh for his 
Newman-Haas team in Sunday's Texaco Grand Prix of Houston were 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was just a total embarrassment,'' said Andretti, who  
along with teammate Christian Fittipaldi, crashed and finished in 
the last two positions of last year's inaugural Houston race after 
completing just five laps. 
</P>
<P>
	One of their team sponsors is Texaco, which is headquartered in  
Houston, as well as being the title sponsor of the downtown street 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was huge,'' said Andretti, who took over third place when  
Fittipaldi had to make a late stop for a splash of fuel. ``I'm just 
glad we were able to put on a good show for Texaco and Havoline 
after what happened last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been better, but at least we were running at the  
end this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti's third-place finish, behind Paul Tracy and Dario  
Franchitti, kept him in the battle for third place in the series 
championship. He trails Tracy by 14 points with two races 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all we've got to fight for, but there's still two races  
to win,'' Andretti said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	RAGGED START: For the third time since season, a CART race began  
under a yellow flag because flagman Jim Swintal made an instant 
decision that the leaders were not lined up properly. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Swintal did not wave the green flag until the third lap  
on the downtown street circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I think sometimes CART is trying too hard to make  
things line up just right,'' Andretti said. ``That's not in the 
cards. There's too much on the line these days, and it's so hard to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to say you don't win a race on the start. But that's  
not true nowadays. You can win a race on the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NICE COMEBACK: Fittipaldi, who had missed the previous five  
races with a head injury sustained in a testing crash in Madison, 
Ill., said he had no physical problems in Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never an issue,'' said the Brazilian, who is fully  
recovered from a subdural hematoma -- a collection of blood under 
the skin on his skull. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fittipaldi was disappointed by his seventh-place finish.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to be back for my first race and I'm glad we were  
able to finish, but I'm not here just to finish,'' he said. ``I'm 
here to win races.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NICE RALLY: Team Rahal drivers Max Papis and Bryan Herta  
overcame mid-race problems to charge from behind and finish fourth 
and fifth in Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Papis fell all the way from second to 19th after being assessed  
a stop-and-go penalty by CART for exceeding the 50-mph pit lane 
speed limit by 1 mile an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Herta was also second when he clipped a wall and flattened a  
tire during a restart on lap 19. That sent him back to 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Papis gave credit to his physical trainers in his native Italy  
for helping him get through the heat and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The humidity was difficult and I could not relax for one  
lap,'' he said. ``I had to drive very hard to catch up to the pack. 
I am drained right now, but taking another top five position is 
very good for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herta said, ``It was a wild day for us. But we held in and  
worked hard. It wasn't a bad day for us considering what happened 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough on the drivers today. I think everyone is pretty  
much used up.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Tracy's car is powered by a Honda engine and the  
victory was Honda's 13th in a row on temporary street circuits. It 
was also the 16th consecutive win for Firestone tires in the 
streets. ... Tracy led 85 of the 100 laps, including the final 49. 
That is the most laps led in a single race this season. ... The 
winner averaged 78.960 mph, considerably better than Franchitti's 
winning speed of 66.051 in last year's rain-shortened Houston 
inaugural.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In an effort to modernize, the Mormons are  
changing the name of their monthly women's meeting from 
``homemaking meeting'' to ``Home, Family and Personal Enrichment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change was announced Saturday during the annual meeting of  
the General Relief Society, the main women's organization of The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It goes into effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program teaches women practical skills such as home  
repair and gardening in addition to its tradition of teaching 
quilting, parenting skills and spiritual lessons, said Virginia 
Jensen, first counselor to the presidency of the Relief Society. 
The church recommends its female members attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Relief Society also announced a new declaration emphasizing  
support for the traditional family and an absolute authority of the 
church's all-male priesthood.

<HEADLINE> Driver Killed During Irwindale Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRWINDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Two cars collided at the Irwindale  
Speedway during a race, slamming one of the cars into the wall and 
killing the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Cowherd, 49, of Phoenix, died of head injuries after the  
Saturday night collision in the seventh lap of the 50-lap Speed 
Truck Challenge, track spokesman Doug Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came together, got tangled up and he caught the wall on  
the outside,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowherd was treated by a doctor and paramedics at the track,  
then was taken to Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, Stokes said. 
He was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowherd was married and had three children, ages 27, 25 and 11,  
Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other driver, Shawn Davidson of Mammoth Lakes, Calif., was  
airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital. He was treated in the 
emergency room and released early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The race involved stock racing cars that have fiberglass bodies  
made to look like pickups. Cowherd and Davidson were driving 
Chevrolet S-10 pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatality was the second this year at the newly opened  
speedway. Driver Casey Diemert, 23, died in March while practicing 
for opening night at the track.

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' Art Exhibit on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- In a museum far, far away from the  
interplanetary world of ``Star Wars,'' there are robots, pod racers 
and X-wing fighters at home next to Henri Matisse paintings and 
Arthur Putnam sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it modern art meets George Lucas.  
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``Star Wars: The Magic of the Myth,'' which opened  
this weekend at the San Diego Museum of Art, the first stop on a 
two-year national tour featuring artifacts from all four movies. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of cinematic art and marketing extravaganza, the  
exhibit offers something for the biggest fan to the most ardent art 
lover. For example, an 11-foot production model of an Imperial Star 
Destroyer is flanked by Ralph McQuarrie's pencil sketches and 
watercolor paintings that set the film's tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the idea that `Star Wars' fans who come to see the  
exhibit can learn something about art. ... I bet they could teach 
us a thing or two,'' said museum director Don Bacigalupi. ``People 
who come to see the exhibit probably won't be typical 
museum-goers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He can count on it. An exhibit based on three of the movies  
attracted more than 1 million visitors during 15 months at the 
National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., where it debuted 
in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego show, expected to draw more than 60,000 visitors  
during its three months, is the first to feature props, costumes, 
production models, character sketches and drawings from all four 
movies: ``Star Wars: A New Hope'' (1977), ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' (1980), ``Return of the Jedi'' (1983) and ``Star Wars, 
Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' (1999). 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the expected crush of visitors, tickets are available  
in advance and entrances are timed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not a museum?'' said curator Larry Urrutia. ``The film  
form affects the way we think, the way we act, and `Star Wars' 
changed the way movies were made. What better place to showcase 
that than a museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 5,000-square-foot exhibit, part of the Smithsonian  
Institution Traveling Exhibit Service, turns away from the 
typically sedate museum atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors walk through a darkly lit corridor inspired by the  
hallways of the famed Death Star, the floating space station 
responsible for annihilating whole planets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the hallway, in front of a wall-size painting of  
stars and asteroids, visitors leave behind Earth and enter the 
world of Lucas' outer space imagination: 30 mannequins, 35 
production models and 50 pieces of framed artwork. All are on 
display for perusal while music and video clips from the movies 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's not enough, audio tours narrated by James Earl Jones,  
the voice of Darth Vader, also are available. 
</P>
<P>
	``The models, costumes and creatures play a major role in my  
movies,'' Lucas said in a statement. ``I'm thrilled that the public 
now has the opportunity to examine their artistry in a museum 
setting. And I hope the exhibit will inspire young people who are 
interested in art, science and computer technology to use their 
skills and imagination to create new worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the exhibit, Jabba the Hut, the gigantic slug -- both in  
appearance and personality -- lounges on a rug. Darth Vader lurks 
from behind a glass case. The Wampa Ice Creature, the snow monster 
Lucas added during his special effects update in the 1998 rerelease 
of ``Empire Strikes Back,'' snarls at visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect the museum staff to answer more esoteric  
questions, such as which body part did Luke Skywalker lose in his 
first battle with Darth Vader? (Answer: his hand.) While staffers 
say they've seen the movies, they admit they aren't hardcore fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, they say, they can explain the movie in the context of  
classical mythology, exploring the age-old journey of the hero and 
the battle of good versus evil. 
</P>
<P>
	As for more mundane concerns, they can also produce the latest  
souvenirs that the marketing juggernaut known as ``Star Wars'' has 
spawned. That includes children's toys, video games, and, now, 
museum exhibit posters. They are, of course, available at the 
museum store.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Underwood Found Bleeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins defensive end Dimitrius  
Underwood was found on a city street bleeding Sunday with what 
police describe as a life-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was cut. We're still investigating the nature of the  
injury,'' said Sgt. Linda Doherty-Wright, a Lansing police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	WLNS-TV and WSYM-TV, both in Lansing, reported that he had a  
neck wound. 
</P>
<P>
	She said police discovered Underwood lying on the street at  
12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	He was then taken to a local hospital for surgery. Police would  
not say which hospital he was taken to, but a Dolphins spokesman 
indicated it was Sparrow Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Dimitrius has been admitted to Sparrow Hospital, and  
we will be getting additional information about him tomorrow,'' 
Dolphins vice president of media relations Harvey Greene said. 
``Our hopes foremost are about his health, but until we have 
additional information, it would be premature for the club to 
comment on his situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Sparrow Hospital spokeswoman declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were not scheduled to play this weekend and Greene  
said all the players had the weekend off. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick out of Michigan State this  
year, disappeared from the Minnesota Vikings' camp last month. He 
was later claimed by the Dolphins after the Vikings released him. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings, and he's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the 
first season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during an exhibition game  
and had missed several weeks of practice.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Frees Peso to Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- With a multibillion-dollar International  
Monetary Fund loan deal in pocket, Colombia's government decided 
over the weekend to succumb to market forces and let the nation's 
currency trade freely against the U.S dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The move followed a week of fierce speculation against the peso,  
which over the last twelve months lost nearly 30 percent of its 
value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	It also comes as President Andres Pastrana's government seeks to  
chart a recovery course from Colombia's worst recession since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``From today onwards the peso/dollar rate will be determined by  
market forces,'' Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo told 
reporters in announcing the decision late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week alone, the central bank was forced to sell $400  
million worth of currency to bolster the peso, which weakened 
anyway, closing on Friday at 1,994.49 against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an exchange band mechanism established in 1994, the  
central Bank of the Republic automatically entered currency markets 
to sell dollars in order to keep the peso within a predetermined 
trading range. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's abolition came a day after the announcement in  
Washington of a line of credit from the International Monetary Fund 
worth between $2 billion and $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit is part of an ambitious $7 billion government plan to  
promote economic recovery, combat the illegal drug trade and seek 
an end to Colombia's 35-year civil conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrepo, a member of the central bank's seven-man board of  
directors, said the IMF had not demanded the abolition of the 
exchange band as a condition for the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not yet spelled out terms of the IMF line of  
credit. Customarily, the international lending institution requires 
recipient nations to enact measures promoting economic austerity 
and adhering more closely to free-market forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian peso's decline in value has been blamed on a  
worsening civil conflict and a sagging economy, which has shrunk 
6.7 percent over the last year as unemployment climbed to 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists welcomed Saturday's decision, but said the move came  
too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``The band was a bad mechanism. Colombia should have dismantled  
it five months ago,'' Juan Jose Echevarria, the director of 
Fedesarollo -- a private economic think-tank -- told Radionet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists and business leaders agreed Sunday that the peso may  
weaken to around 2020 against the dollar before settling at around 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Central bank director Miguel Urrutia said Saturday that the  
reserve bank would still intervene in the market if the price of 
the dollar threatened the economy as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Rises by 17 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States rose this week by 17 to 720. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide, 140 were exploring for oil, 580  
for gas, and none were listed as miscellaneous, Houston-based Baker 
Hughes Inc. reported Friday. During the same week last year, 770 
rigs were operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom 
but set several record lows this earlier year, bottoming out at 498 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Louisiana gained  
nine rigs, New Mexico added six, Texas had one more, Oklahoma lost 
two and there were no changes reported in Alaska, California and 
Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks U.S. Aid for Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Once known for his critical views of the  
United States, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit left for Washington on 
Sunday to seek support for Turkey's efforts to rebuild from an 
earthquake that shattered the nation's economic heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	During his five-day day visit, Ecevit hopes to persuade  
President Clinton to press the International Monetary Fund to grant 
loans to Turkey that will pave the way for other international 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7.4-magnitude quake killed more than 15,600 people and left  
600,000 people homeless. It caused $6.5 billion in damage, 
according to World Bank estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has promised to help its longtime ally with  
reconstruction efforts, but there are few details on what the 
United States is likely to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake brought an unusual outpouring of sympathy and aid  
from Turkey's traditional rival, Greece. U.S. officials likely will 
try to capitalize on the warming ties to press for progress in the 
decades-long dispute between the two NATO allies over Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington also is expected to press Turkey to improve its human  
rights record and address issues such as the repeated allegations 
of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has promised to address human rights, but progress on  
Cyprus is likely to be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit, who as prime minister ordered the 1974 Turkish invasion  
after a coup on the island by supporters of union with Greece, has 
shown little willingness to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes without saying that there will be no concessions,'' he  
told the Milliyet newspaper last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey maintains 30,000 soldiers on the northern Turkish side of  
the divided island, which it recognizes as a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
	The invasion sparked a four-year U.S. embargo on military sales  
to Turkey, embittering Ecevit, a leftist politician who had long 
been wary of U.S. intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington also has made it clear that it expects greater  
freedoms for Turkey's 12 million Kurds now that rebel leader 
Abdullah Ocalan is on death row and his guerrilla fighters are 
withdrawing from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has hinted that it may be willing to ease its  
restrictions on Kurdish cultural expressions, but moves in that 
direction are expected to be extremely slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit, for his part, is likely to urge Washington to be  
cautious in supporting Iraqi opposition groups trying to topple 
President Saddam Hussein. Turkey fears that could lead to the 
disintegration of Iraq and pave the way for an independent Iraqi 
Kurdish state bordering areas of Turkey where Kurdish rebels have 
been battling government troops.

	White House Budget Summit Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today it is  
tough but possible to fashion a budget without tapping Social 
Security funds. But his Democratic counterpart said that was 
impossible under the GOP plan, and lawmakers should hold a budget 
summit with the White House. Hastert said the Republican-controlled 
Congress still intended to come up with a budget that does not rely 
on Social Security money. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri said Republicans were heading for a budget that uses $30 
billion of the Social Security surplus.

	IMF Unveils Major Debt Relief Plan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund today put in  
place a major new debt relief initiative and announced efforts to 
speed internal reforms. All the activity around the annual meetings 
of the 182-nation IMF and the World Bank was aimed at damping 
criticism that the two giant lending agencies failed to coordinate 
programs and badly mismanaged the recent global financial crisis. 
The new coordinated effort will provide debt relief to 36 of the 
world's poorest nations. It is intended to erase up to $100 billion 
in debt, allowing the countries to commit scarce resources to 
poverty, health and education programs.

commander of a peacekeeping force said today, as he prepared to 
take control of the province from the Indonesian army. Maj. Gen. 
Peter Cosgrove also called for an accelerated deployment of the 
second half of the 7,500-strong force, amid persistent reports that 
the militias are massing outside the capital to attack the 
peacekeepers. The militias, backed by Indonesian troops, launched a 
terror campaign in the province after residents voted nearly 4-to-1 
in favor of independence in a referendum on Aug. 30.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan relented not an inch today on

parties for being ``braying donkeys of interventionism.'' He said 
the United States should apologize to Russia for the 
``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into central Europe. And, he 
said, the West today is making the same mistakes in Europe that he 
wrote about in his new book. ``We are repeating the errors that led 
to World War II, and for heaven's sake, stop it before World War 
III,'' Buchanan said on ``Fox News Sunday.''

study of people with mild to moderate sleep apnea: people whose 
breathing stops several or even dozens of times an hour, 
interrupting their sleep without their knowledge. About 12 million 
Americans have the problem, according to the American Sleep Apnea 
Association's Web site. People known to have apnea did as poorly on 
a test of reaction time as people who were too drunk to drive a bus 
or truck in California, said Dr. Nelson B. Powell of the Stanford 
center.

champions for a 13-10 victory. Denver became the first defending 
Super Bowl champion to begin a season with three straight losses in 
a non-strike year. Mike Alstott rushed for a career-high 131 yards 
and scored on a 28-yard run in the first quarter for the 
Buccaneers. But in the end, the league's No. 1 defense was the 
difference.

<HEADLINE> Quayle To Drop Out of Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle, the former vice president who  
hoped to overcome long odds and ridicule to step up to the 
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, is giving up his White 
House dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials said Sunday night that Quayle planned to drop  
out of the race today during a Phoenix, Ariz., news conference. 
They called Quayle the latest victim of George W. Bush's GOP 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure winnows the GOP field to eight major  
Republican candidates, and will increase speculation about the 
finance and political health of the remaining contenders. There is 
already turbulence within the nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has made inroads against Bush in  
New Hampshire, is formally kicking off his campaign today. 
Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting 
the GOP to seek the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, who traveled the world when she headed the  
American Red Cross, was planning a speech today to outline her 
foreign policy views. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. They are most likely to pick up Quayle supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's advisers said the former vice president decided to quit  
this weekend after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and campaign 
manager Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The braintrust determined that Quayle could not raise enough  
money to compete deep into the primary season, even if he fared 
well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. Bush, 
a two-term Texas governor and GOP front-runner, has topped $50 
million -- five times that of his nearest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, has been running a debt since early in the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reality just hit home that this wasn't to be,''  
said former Sen. Dan Coats, a fellow Indiana Republican and Quayle 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he won in New Hampshire, where to you go from there?''  
asked Coats. ``You don't have the funds ... and you're up against a 
candidate who can outspend you 100-to-1 if he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reality was harsh for the resilient conservative.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 
1992, the former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of 
political gaffes and controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day 
the then-vice president misspelled the word in a classroom full of 
school children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch 
line for countless jokes, cementing for many American the 
perception that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said during his April announcement speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Already Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire have dropped out of 
the GOP primary contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president is not expected to endorse a candidacy  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their October finance statements, which will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time competing with 
Bush.	   Dole is aggressively trying to raise money to compete against 
Bush. Her situation may be even more precarious, given the fact 
that she is courting the same moderate and establishment 
Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Quayle has no regrets about his campaign and leaves  
buoyed by a recent national poll that showed him with 9 percent of 
the vote -- a distant second to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been unable to break out of the second-tier of candidates  
in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, however. Also in 
those ranks are radio host Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
He is still convinced he could fare well -- even win -- the New 
Hampshire primary. Despite that, the concentrated primary calendar 
would give him little time to raise enough money to capitalize on a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income 
families. He also portrayed himself as the best qualified potential 
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils.

<HEADLINE> Gators Winning the Old-Fashioned Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The team that introduced the wide-open  
passing attack to the Southeastern Conference is suddenly looking 
very retro. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Florida coach Steve Spurrier's beloved vertical passing  
game is still a dangerous weapon. But in Saturday night's 38-10 win 
over Kentucky, it was the musty football traditions of running the 
ball and tough defense that paved the way to an easy win for the 
third-ranked Gators (4-0, 2-0 SEC). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to get out and play some smash-mouth football now  
and then,'' center Corey Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators defense left the pass-happy ``Air Raid'' attack of  
Kentucky's Hal Mumme spinning its wheels. The Wildcats (2-2, 0-1) 
finished with their lowest point total in Mumme's two-plus seasons 
in Lexington, and were under 400 yards in total offense for only 
the fourth time in his 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Gators' 13th straight win over Kentucky and sixth  
straight by double digits. Though 38 points were their lowest 
against Kentucky since a 24-20 thriller in 1993, Florida's 
dominance was no less than in 55-28 and 51-35 wins in 1997 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	With four straight touchdowns in the first and second quarters,  
Florida jumped to a 28-0 lead and took the Commonwealth 
Stadium-record crowd of 70,971 out of the game early. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's secondary, burned by big pass plays in last year's  
loss at Gainesville, mixed things up by adding some zone coverage 
to its usual bump-and-run. The Gators simply shifted to a ground 
attack that was effective even in the absence of starting tailback 
Earnest Graham, who left with a severe thigh bruise on the game's 
second play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big day running the ball,'' said quarterback Doug  
Johnson, who threw for 241 yards and two scores. ``They seemed 
determined to stop the pass. ... The offensive line, you've got to 
give them credit -- they busted open some holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made the running easy for Robert Gillespie and Bo Carroll,  
who combined for three touchdowns and 194 of the Gators' 224 
rushing yards. With eight rushing touchdowns this season, Florida 
already is just one behind last season's total, when the Gators 
ranked 115th in the nation in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't pass for a ton of yards, but we were able to move  
the ball,'' Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Florida's pass defense, which gave up an SEC-worst  
325 yards per game through three games, limited Kentucky 
quarterback Dusty Bonner to 254 yards and no touchdowns on 
36-for-48 passing. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 10 plays of 30 yards or more in three games, the  
defense gave the Wildcats nothing longer than Bonner's 22-yard 
completion to tight end James Whalen Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepest ball Bonner threw -- a second-quarter overthrow of  
wideout Garry Davis -- ended up in the hands of Florida cornerback 
Bennie Alexander, an interception that set up the Gators' third 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a lot of good things in their secondary, disguising  
things,'' Bonner said. ``They're so quick. Sometimes you look and 
they're in single coverage and by the time you throw the ball 
they're in double coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Kentucky rushing for just 63 yards, the Gators added to an  
impressive set of numbers compiled under Spurrier in the 1990s: 
79-1 when holding opponents under 21 points; 57-1 when rushing for 
150 yards or more; and 60-1-1 when holding opponents to less than 
100 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Spurrier, the Gators are 65-0 against unranked teams.

<HEADLINE>  Evidence of E. Timor Torture Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The device found Sunday in a military  
barracks was crude, but no doubt effective: two teaspoons attached 
with tape to a chunk of wood and two wires. One wire ran to an 
electrical plug, the other presumably to a torture victim. 
</P>
<P>
	As Indonesian troops depart East Timor and hand over control to  
the international peacekeepers who arrived Sept. 20, evidence of 
torture -- and executions -- is slowly mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of two men, who U.N. officials said apparently had  
been executed, were exhumed Saturday from graves in Tibar, a hamlet 
seven miles east of the capital Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, a headless body was found in a water well.  
Locals said 20 more bodies may also be inside. Nearby, in what 
residents said was a torture chamber, there were bloody trails 
where victims, still alive, were allegedly hung on meathooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The discoveries add weight to calls for the United Nations to  
send forensic specialists to investigate alleged atrocities in East 
Timor for a possible international criminal tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	But their task will be daunting. Officials in East Timor say  
evidence is being lost to decomposition and fires allegedly being 
set by departing Indonesian soldiers. There also have been 
unconfirmed reports of bodies dumped at sea and the limbs of other 
torture victims thrown into sewers to make identification 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed in East  
Timor in recent weeks as militiamen -- backed by elements of the 
Indonesian military -- rampaged through the territory in retribution 
for East Timorese voting overwhelmingly Aug. 30 for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has long been accused of human rights abuses in the  
half-island territory, particularly against pro-independence rebels 
and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence leaders claim torture, by electric shock and other  
means, was used frequently by Indonesian troops on suspected 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bodies that were exhumed Saturday before video cameras  
were found by international police officers and a doctor working 
for the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, which oversaw the 
ballot and was forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said Sunday that evidence  
suggested the men had been executed: one man had been stabbed 
upward through the chin, the other shot through the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need for an investigation by proper forensic experts who  
can examine the evidence we found is very urgent,'' Wimhurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff of the multinational force, said  
it does not have the capacity or the mandate to fully investigate 
reported atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	The head on the peacekeeping force, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove,  
said Sunday he has asked the commander of Indonesian forces in East 
Timor to hold soldiers suspected of war-crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the ones alleged to have been involved in some of the  
worst present crimes ... are on their way out of the province, and 
we've asked for those people to be investigated and if necessary 
held where they are at the moment, which I understand may be 
Kupang,'' in West Timor, Cosgrove told Australian television. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was hopeful action would be taken.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is world interest in these events ... it is in the great  
advantage of Indonesia and the Indonesian military to get to the 
bottom of these allegations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> USC Loses Starting QB for 6-8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California quarterback Carson Palmer  
will be sidelined a minimum of six weeks with a broken right 
collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a sophomore, was injured two plays before halftime of a  
33-30 triple-overtime loss at Oregon on Saturday night. Oregon's 
Michael Fletcher knocked him out of bounds at the end of a 3-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Palmer will wear a shoulder brace while  
recuperating. He remained in the game for the final play of the 
half before spending the rest of the game on the sideline in street 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Carson Palmer's injury is a big blow to us,'' USC  
coach Paul Hackett said Sunday. ``He was just starting to come into 
his own, beginning to develop and show the improvement a young 
quarterback exhibits from year one to year two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who started USC's final five games last season, was  
9-of-13 for 135 yards in the first half at Oregon, and 39-of-53 for 
490 yards and three touchdowns in the Trojans' three games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 1,755 yards and seven touchdowns with six  
interceptions last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be out for a number of weeks, so Mike Van Raaphorst will  
assume the starting role, with John Fox as the backup and Matt 
Dalton behind him,'' Hackett said. ``Carson will mend fine and be 
ready to go at some point, whether the end of this year or the 
start of next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer won the job from Van Raaphorst after eight games last  
year. Van Raaphorst, a junior, completed 20-of-36 passes for 227 
yards and one touchdown in the second half and overtime periods at 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he played in only three games, Palmer can medically  
redshirt this year and retain his sophomore eligibility in 2000 if 
he doesn't play again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	USC (2-1, 0-1 Pac-10) plays Oregon State (3-0, 0-0) Saturday at  
the Los Angeles Coliseum.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Tells GOP To Nominate Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan relented not an inch Sunday on  
foreign policy views criticized by fellow Republican presidential 
hopefuls and made a modest proposal for the GOP to end his 
dalliance with the Reform Party: nominate him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Buchanan chastised members of both parties --  
``especially the Republicans'' -- for being ``braying donkeys of 
interventionism.'' He said the United States should apologize to 
Russia for the ``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, the West today is making the same mistakes in  
Europe that he wrote about in a new book, ``A Republic, Not an 
Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are repeating the errors that led to World War II, and for  
heaven's sake, stop it before World War III,'' Buchanan said on 
``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book entered the national political debate last week  
because of its questions about the United States' entry into World 
War II against Nazi Germany. It said Adolf Hitler's Third Reich was 
no threat to the United States after 1940, and Allied guarantees to 
Poland brought war to the continent and gave the Soviet Union's 
communist government two extra years to prepare for Germany's 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rivals Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Steve  
Forbes have questioned Buchanan's writings in highly critical 
terms. McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's departure 
from the party. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Buchanan said he needs at least three more weeks  
before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a candidate for the Republican nomination, but I'm  
clearly thinking about going for the Reform Party nomination,'' 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the Republicans could keep him in the GOP, Buchanan  
said with a laugh: ``They could offer me the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runner George W. Bush said in an interview Friday that he  
wants Buchanan to remain Republican, although he disagreed with his 
opinion that the German threat to the United States ended after 
Hitler lost the Battle of Britain in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading GOP senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said the  
Republicans are paying too much attention to Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we ignored Pat,'' Specter said, ``that would be the  
best course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan predicted the notice his book has gotten would aid his  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may have hurt (me) in some quarters, of people who don't  
understand or who believe that Pat Buchanan is pro-Hitler or 
something like that. But overall, I think it is going to help'' by 
energizing his most loyal followers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed that ``the perception has been created, and it is  
false,'' that he is in some ways soft on Hitler. The perception 
``is rooted in malice and ignorance and not in a single line in 
that book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the book, which he described on CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' as ``a boring, scholarly work on foreign policy,'' was 
meant to sound an alarm to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reduce our commitments to fight in all these  
ridiculous little places around the world. We need to rebuild the 
military to where it was when Ronald Reagan had it,'' he said on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he said, ``we need to let nations know clearly, if you  
fool with the United States, you have had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said expanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic and  
Hungary was a mistake. It violated commitments, made as late as the 
Bush administration, that NATO would not extend to Eastern Europe 
if Russia left the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We double-crossed the Russians,'' Buchanan said.  
</P>
<P>
	As president, Buchanan said, he would offer Russia a deal:  
promise to leave alone the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia, and NATO will not expand farther eastward.

<HEADLINE> Canada Auto Workers OK Ford Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers overwhelmingly ratified  
a new contract with Ford Motor Co. on Sunday, and announced it was 
turning to DaimlerChrysler AG for its next deal. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said 4,923 of about 13,330 Ford  
employees voted on the new three-year contract Sunday. About 94 
percent approved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides combined salary and cost-of-living increases  
of 4.5 percent in each of its three years. It also offers a 
one-time signing bonus of $678 and improved pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major accomplishment for the Ford section of our  
union,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW said it would negotiate next with DaimlerChrysler, and  
set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. Oct. 5. Hargrove said he saw no 
reason why the union would strike at DaimlerChrysler. But he added 
that DaimlerChrysler would have to agree to Ford's promise to tell 
its non-unionized suppliers not to interfere in union drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said that includes DaimlerChrysler's Freightliner  
heavy-truck division and Magna International Inc. Both own 
factories that the CAW has been unsuccessful in organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like everything else in business. There are certain rules  
you have to follow, and worker democracy is one of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was less optimistic about a deal with General Motors  
Corp. The union held a three-week strike against GM in 1996, and 
Hargrove said relations were still shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an incredible amount of problems at GM that we have to  
face,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract with Ford also includes:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Increases in basic pensions totaling 25 percent over the next  
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Workers with 30 years of experience would be allowed to retire  
at any age. Those retiring before age 60 would receive a minimum 
$1,898 a month, all of it paid by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Improved benefits for surviving spouses, same-sex partner  
benefits, child care benefits and tuition reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ford must replace any jobs lost to modular suppliers with  
comparable work for its CAW members. 
</P>
<P>
	The average Canadian line worker at Ford earns a base wage of  
about $16 an hour, while skilled workers earn $19 at current 
conversion rates. Similar workers in the United States earn $20.71 
and $24.38 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, talks continued between GM and the United  
Auto Workers this weekend. The UAW is expected to release the 
results of a vote on its tentative contract with DaimlerChrysler on 
Monday. UAW President Stephen Yokich has said the GM contract will 
be finished after the DaimlerChrysler vote.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Hire Former Rockies GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bob Gebhard, who resigned under fire in August  
as general manager of the Colorado Rockies, was hired by the St. 
Louis Cardinals Sunday as special assistant to general manager Walt 
Jocketty. 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming general manager of the Cardinals in 1995,  
Jocketty was Gebhard's assistant in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said Gebhard will work closely with Jocketty on  
day-to-day operation of the team, as well as player evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard was hired by the Rockies in the fall of 1991 -- about 18  
months before the expansion team started play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He built a team long on power, selecting Vinny Castilla in the  
1992 expansion draft, trading for players such as Dante Bichette 
and Andres Galarraga, and acquiring Larry Walker as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colorado has been short on pitching and defense. In their  
seven seasons, the Rockies have won one divisional title and no 
pennants. They entered Sunday 69-86, last in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals won the NL Central and came within a game of the  
pennant in 1996, but have not won since. St. Louis entered Sunday's 
game against Cincinnati with a 72-82 record, fourth in the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard began his professional baseball career as a pitcher,  
playing 11 years, including stints with the Minnesota Twins and 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player-coach for Montreal from 1974-75, was promoted to  
minor league field director in 1976 and later to pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Twins in 1987 as director of player personnel, and  
became a team vice president the following year.

<HEADLINE> Falcons QB Chandler Injured Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler was  
helped off the field with an apparent re-occurrence of a hamstring 
injury during the second quarter of Sunday's game against the St. 
Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was injured without contact with 3:13 to go and the  
Falcons trailing 28-0. After making a couple of pump fakes and 
scrambling, he crumpled to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed last week's game with a hamstring injury  
sustained in the Falcons' season-opening loss to Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pilots To Fly 737s Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- US Airways has ordered its pilots to fly the  
Boeing 737 faster during takeoffs and landings to avoid the type of 
rudder malfunction that is believed to have caused the crash of 
Flight 427 near Pittsburgh in 1994, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing US Airways memos dated this month, the Pittsburgh  
Tribune-Review reported Sunday that the airline told its pilots to 
fly 20 knots, or 23 mph, faster during certain phases of takeoffs 
and landings. Pilots say the added speed gives them more time to 
recognize and correct rudder problems that cannot be fixed at 
slower speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways spokesman David Castelveter declined comment to the  
newspaper. The Arlington, Va.-based airline has a hub at Pittsburgh 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is an acceptance by US Airways that there is a  
problem, and they aren't relying on the mechanical fixes put into 
place,'' said Jim Burnett, a transportation safety consultant and 
former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ``It 
is a needed response ... The plane really shouldn't have been 
certified to fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the NTSB ruled that a rudder reversal most likely  
caused the plane to plummet on Sept. 8, 1994, killing all 132 
people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 is the only commercial jet with a rudder controlled by a  
single hydraulic valve. Other jets have multiple valves that can 
compensate if one jams, as the single valve has been known to do, 
according to the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	An NTSB report released in July lists 112 such ``rudder events''  
in the past two decades, malfunctions ``that could be 
catastrophic,'' the 346-page report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are 3,111 Boeing 737s in use worldwide -- and as  
many as 800 in the air at any given time -- redesigning the rudder 
could cause severe airline disruptions, not to mention the hundreds 
of millions of dollars it would cost Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general with the U.S.  
Department of Transportation who now teaches at Ohio State 
University, said US Airways' edict to speed up its maneuvering 
speeds was certainly prompted by the NTSB investigation of Flight 
427, as well as a 1991 United Airlines crash in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., that killed 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilots I talked to said the change was for safety  
reasons,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the safety board and Seattle-based Boeing have recommended  
maneuvering-speed changes as a precaution, though the Federal 
Aviation Administration has not ordered the change, instead making 
it optional for each airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has ordered other changes, including regular testing of  
rudder-controlled units; the installation of devices that limit 
rudder movement; and replacement of the servo valve, part of the 
rudder's control unit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,  
said increased speeds do not guarantee protection against 
rudder-system failures on a 737, but his organization wants the FAA 
to require the practice if airlines do not voluntarily adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a guarantee that it will overcome the problem,''  
Mazor said. ``It will, at the very least, slow down the onset and 
give the pilot time to take appropriate measures.''

<HEADLINE>  Two Survive 5 Days in Quake Rubble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two brothers were pulled to freedom Sunday  
after 5 1/2 days buried alive in the wreckage of Taiwan's killer 
quake, saying they survived by eating a few apples and playing 
cards in the small space where they were trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the devastation and shattered hopes, Taiwanese were cheered  
by the improbable survival of Sun Chi-kwang, 20, and Sun Chi-feng, 
who turned 26 Wednesday, one day into their 130-hour ordeal in the 
wreckage of a collapsed Taipei building. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were rescued even as powerful aftershocks continue  
to jolt Taiwan. A particularly strong one hit early Sunday, killing 
at least three people on top of more than 2,000 who had already 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Onlookers applauded as the younger Sun, stripped to the waist  
but staying upright and holding a bottle of water he got from 
rescue workers, was lifted to safety by a crane. His brother was 
rushed away on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Liu Luan, heaved with sobs of joy as her sons came  
out alive, speaking so fast she was almost incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept thinking, 'This is not possible, this is not  
possible,''' Liu told reporters at the scene. ``I kept praying for 
them all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were hospitalized in stable condition. Doctors were  
checking them for possible internal injuries or dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are both very clear and conscious of what happened,''  
said Dr. Su Chong-jen, chief of surgery at the hospital where they 
were taken. ``What they need now is rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun brothers had been playing bridge when the 7.6-magnitude  
quake struck in the wee hours Tuesday. The 12-story building they 
were in crumpled, flattening parts of the hotel, offices and 
apartments it contained. The brothers' parents and sister were not 
at home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The two kept up their spirits by continuing their card game  
while they waited in the small space, their doctor said by 
telephone. When their water ran out, they were forced to drink 
their own urine. 
</P>
<P>
	From his hospital bed, Sun Chi-kwang said he even managed to  
give his sibling a birthday gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``My older brother told me that never in my life did I celebrate  
his birthday with him, so I said today I would celebrate with you 
and I gave him my necklace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told TVBS television that while trapped he had ``a very  
strange dream'' in which ``there was someone beside me saying that 
behind the fridge there was a hole from where I could get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was really strange and I told my older brother.  
He asked me what it meant and said fate could not have been talking 
to me, so I went back to sleep,'' Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little later I saw a hole, and indeed it turned out to be a  
big hole,'' he said, referring to the hole rescuers carved into the 
rubble to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency crews worked into the night through a light drizzle in  
hopes of saving more lives in the Taipei building, though they were 
not certain whether anyone else was still alive. The building was 
one of the hardest-hit structures in Taipei, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's aftershock -- a sizable earthquake in its own right --  
brought down some buildings in central Taiwan, the hardest-hit 
region, and cracked walls as far away as Taipei, 90 miles to the 
north. Its magnitude was estimated at 6.8 or 6.5 by different 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershock killed three people, injured at least 58 and  
buried another 20 in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there have been thousands of aftershocks, Sunday's was  
big enough to send frightened people scurrying out of their homes 
to safe, open spaces. Others donned motorcycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody here dares to stay home at night. They all stay in  
tents,'' said university student Lee Wen in the town of Puli, where 
water, electricity and telephone service have yet to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from the new tremor, and more bodies unearthed on Sunday,  
brought the confirmed toll from the quakes to 2,056. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disaster Management Center said 8,667 people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Sunday, Pope John Paul II urged the world to come to  
the aid of Taiwan's earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting pilgrims at his summer residence outside Rome, John  
Paul prayed for the victims and their loved ones. He expressed 
confidence that ``the international community will respond with 
renewed solidarity and ready assistance in the urgent work of 
relief and rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei Stock Exchange, which was closed since the  
earthquake, reopened Monday with stocks sharply down in reaction to 
the disaster. But the initial drop of 2.7 percent was not as steep 
as was feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Sunday night he would  
temporarily impose tighter limits on how far stock prices can fall 
in a single day, to 3.5 percent from the normal 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, President Lee Teng-hui signed a rare emergency  
decree that gives the military increased powers to maintain order. 
The decree, which would supersedes all existing laws for six 
months, still must be approved by legislators.

<HEADLINE> Amy Grant Portrays Blind Cellist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Pop and gospel singer Amy Grant says  
movie offers began rolling in after her 1991 music video ``Baby, 
Baby'' but acting never appealed to her until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority either were asking me to play a singer or a  
prairie woman,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then CBS Entertainment President Les Moonves asked her to  
portray a blind cellist in the Sunday night TV movie ``A Song from 
the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timing was good, she said, conceding that she felt  
``creatively flat-lined'' after her recent divorce from singer Gary 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the energy to write. And at that time in life,  
it was good to get in a work setting and not play me,'' she said.

<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett, whose substantial lead in the  
Winston Cup standings has been shaky of late, left no doubt about 
his status this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who had lost 60 points from a 314-point lead over the  
last month, was a factor for most of the MBNA Gold 400 on Sunday at 
Dover Downs International Speedway. He wound up third behind Mark 
Martin and rookie Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far different finish from the way the weekend began.  
After poor performances in Bristol, Tenn., and Darlington, S.C., 
Jarrett posted only the 38th fastest time Friday in the first round 
of qualifying for this race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he qualified 26th and methodically worked his way  
through then field until at one point only he and Martin were 
viable forces in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's finish -- combined with a fifth-place showing by Bobby  
Labonte, allowed him to gain three points and he leads by 257 
points with seven of 34 races remaining. But points meant little on 
this day to Jarrett, who has been fighting a bad back all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 75 percent better today,'' he said. ``Once I got in and  
got settled it was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett said the therapy he got from the MRO Rehab Center helped  
him a great deal. On Saturday, he had trouble doing anything 
physical. He felt almost normal during the race, but got a reminder 
from time to time on his pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they dropped the jack, that let me know it was still  
there,'' Jarrett said.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOUGH TONY:* Although Tony Stewart failed to add a new line to  
a resume that already makes him looks like the best rookie driver 
in Winston Cup history, he had another stout performance Sunday in 
the MBNA Gold 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many drivers in the race at Dover Downs International  
Speedway, Stewart complained about tires. One bad set cost him a 
chance to win a race he was dominating for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never knew from one set to the next what kind of balance  
you were going to have,'' said Stewart, who praised his crew for 
remaining calm when anger was growing within him. ``They kept their 
cool better than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he wound up second to Mark Martin, and figures to end  
this season with the highest points finish of any rookie. He's 
fourth now. Jody Ridley wound up seventh in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has become such a force that he has finished no worse  
than second in the last three races. He won two weeks ago in 
Richmond, Va., and wound up second a week later in Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORDS AND WORDS:* There wasn't a sound from Brian Whitesell,  
who according to a CNN-SI report Friday would call the shots for 
Jeff Gordon instead of crew chief Ray Evernham. The only voice 
Gordon heard throughout the race was that of Evernham, whom the 
report said will leave Hendrick Motorsports. ... Independent Dave 
Marcis, whose last victory came in 1982, has been known to be 
critical of the new breed of drivers. On Sunday in the MBNA Gold 
400, the target of his words was Chad Little. ``I don't know about 
some of these new guys,'' Marcis said, blaming Little for the 
accident that put him off the track on lap 63. ``Sometimes I think 
they can't see.'' ... Mark Martin won, but car owner Jack Roush 
seemed equally thrilled by the fourth-place finish of Busch Grand 
National ace Matt Kenseth. Next year, he will drive a car co-owned 
by Roush and Martin. ``How 'bout that Matt Kenseth,'' Roush said. 
Martin also was excited by the performance of his protege. ``Just 
give me credit for bringing him up,'' Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Europe Team Angry at US Celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The European Ryder Cup team was outraged  
by the U.S. team's celebration of Justin Leonard's putt that all 
but won the tournament for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Leonard sank the 45-foot shot, most of the seven U.S.  
players, along with several caddies, officials and wives, stormed 
the green to embrace him as thousands of fans roared. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal, however, still had a 25-foot putt with a  
chance to equal Leonard. He watched as the group ran across his 
line on the 17th green, hugging and hollering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans quickly collected themselves after the  
celebration, slightly embarrassed. Then Olazabal missed the shot, 
sealing his team's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was very sad to see. It was an ugly picture to  
see,'' Olazabal said. ``You can cheer your own team as much as you 
want but just show some respect for the opponent. As simple as 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, who was heckled throughout the tournament by  
fans, said he couldn't believe what he saw Sunday. Jesper Parnevik 
also said such breakdowns in decorum were unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should just not ever happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Torrance of England, a former Ryder Cup player, told Sky  
Television in London: ``It's about the most disgusting thing I've 
ever seen. This is not sour grapes. ... Tom Lehman calls himself a 
man of God. His behavior today has been disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman said the excitement overtook him and the others. Steve  
Pate remained off the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably wish we all would have jumped up and down in place  
instead of running to the side of the green,'' Lehman said. ``But 
I'm not going to apologize for being excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European team captain Mark James said he did not hold his  
American counterpart, Ben Crenshaw, responsible and expected no 
apology. Crenshaw offered one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do apologize sincerely,'' he said. ``There wasn't any call  
for that. The celebration started spilling over and it really was 
not something that we need to be proud of, and we've apologized. 
... We're truly sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard took some of the blame, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I shouldn't have run off the green,'' he said. ``And I do  
apologize for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal offered a conciliatory note as the post-tournament  
interviews were ending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all want to congratulate the American team,'' the  
Spaniard said. ``We are not trying to find any excuse on the words 
that we mentioned about the way they behaved on 17.''

<HEADLINE> White House Budget Summit Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Sunday it is  
tough but possible to fashion a budget without tapping Social 
Security funds. But his Democratic counterpart said that was 
impossible under the GOP plan, and lawmakers should hold a budget 
summit with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said the Republican-controlled Congress still intended  
to come up with a budget for the fiscal year beginning Friday that 
does not rely on Social Security money. But with the White House 
and lawmakers from both parties demanding more money for education, 
agriculture and defense, ``it's hard work to do that,'' said 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who appeared  
with Hastert on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said Republicans already 
have lost the battle and were heading for a budget that uses $30 
billion of the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying our doggonedest not to'' use Social Security  
funds, said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
But Dreier, chairman of the House Rules Committee, added: ``We have 
faced this year many disasters, Kosovo, other expenditures that 
were unanticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt said Republicans were wasting time on a budget that was  
largely unacceptable to the White House. The two sides should sit 
down together ``as soon as possible'' to work out a compromise, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress so far Congress has sent the president only four of the  
13 annual spending bills. The White House has threatened vetoes on 
seven of those measures, mainly because of low funding for programs 
the administration regards as priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said Congress will pass a measure to extend federal  
funding for three weeks and avoid a repetition of the 1995-96 
government shutdowns. President Clinton is expected to sign the 
measure so the two sides more time to work out differences. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans have been cool to the idea of another budget  
summit. Clinton largely is seen as having bested Republicans at 
such a summit last year, and Clinton's veto last week of the GOP's 
$792 billion tax cut plan has made relations with Republicans even 
more icy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he was open to talks with the president but his  
first task was to finish up all the budget bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to engage us, he hasn't given any indication,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said after Clinton 
vetoed the tax proposal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 30 years, Washington has dipped into the Social  
Security trust fund to mask the size of budget deficits or, now, 
increase the size of projected surpluses. The estimated surplus in 
fiscal 2000 is $14 billion from the general budget and $147 billion 
from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the White House and Congress are committed to fencing off  
the Social Security fund. But Republicans reject the White House 
proposal to raise revenues by closing corporate loopholes and 
increasing cigarette taxes and Democrats say Republicans are 
resorting to gimmicks -- such as declaring year 2000 census funding 
to be emergency spending -- to balance the books.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Patricia Brous, who rose from volunteer  
to president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of 
Kansas and Mid-Missouri, died Friday after a battle with cancer. 
She was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Brous became a familiar figure as Planned Parenthood responded  
to changes in Kansas and Missouri laws on abortion, including 
annual attempts by the Missouri Legislature to ban state funding 
for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Planned Parenthood Clinic in Kansas City, where no abortions  
are performed, has been the site of many protests by abortion 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the clinic was one of several Planned Parenthood  
centers around the nation that were targets of hoax threats of 
biological weapons exposure, forcing staffs and patients to undergo 
decontamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Brous began volunteering for Planned Parenthood in 1974, then  
served on its board of directors and became the organization's 
development director. She took over as president and chief 
executive officer in 1990.

<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Pat Watson, an offensive line coach for  
11th-ranked Georgia, died Saturday, apparently of a heart attack. 
He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson died a few hours after Georgia's 24-23 victory over  
Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson experienced discomfort at home after the game and was  
taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Wastson's second season with the football team. He  
joined the staff in 1998 as a defensive ends coach. Watson moved 
over to the offensive line this year when Chris Scelfo left for 
Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a coach for 32 years, was a graduate assistant at North  
Carolina in 1967 and was also an assistant at Furman (1969), 
Mississippi State (1970-71), North Carolina (1972-77), Virginia 
Tech (1978-86), Georgia Tech (1987-91 and 1995-96) and Texas 
(1992-94). 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a native of Meridian, Miss., was a lineman at  
Mississippi State from 1961-64 and then played two years in the 
CFL.

</P>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- Oseola McCarty, a onetime washwoman  
who earned widespread recognition after she donated her life 
savings to the University of Southern Mississippi, died Sunday of 
complications from liver cancer. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who lived and worked most of her life in a small,  
wooden-frame Hattiesburg house, saved thousands of dollars she 
earned washing and ironing clothes for others. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned universal acclaim in July 1995 when the university  
announced McCarty had willed $150,000 of her life's savings to 
Southern Mississippi to provide scholarships for deserving, 
financially needy students. 
</P>
<P>
	In donating the $150,000, McCarty said she wanted to give others  
the chance to get an education she never had. She said she had 
dreamed of becoming a nurse, but had to drop out of elementary 
school to care for sick relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Her life changed dramatically after her donation. The woman who  
had spent her entire life in Hattiesburg was honored by President 
Clinton, attracted international media attention and even wrote a 
book espousing her philosophy of simple living. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's gift, willed to the university in an irrevocable trust  
administered by the university foundation, led to a matching 
fund-raising drive that had raised more than $330,000 at the time 
of her death. Donations to the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship 
Fund have already provided scholarships for nine students.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Vote on Mubarak Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Banners and loudspeakers proclaimed the  
virtues of President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday as voters went to the 
polls for a yes-or-no referendum for the Egyptian leader. Most 
voters were expected to back Mubarak, ensuring him a fourth term in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old president, one of Washington's closest Middle  
Eastern allies, was the only candidate in the referendum. In the 
past three referendums, Mubarak received more than 95 percent 
``yes'' ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Results are expected Monday. There was no official word on how  
many of Egypt's 24 million eligible voters cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition groups boycotted the referendum, charging that the  
vote was a sham and urging the president to initiate direct, 
multiparty elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Some also campaigned for people to vote ``no'' on the ballot.  
But the campaign was confined to public statements. Anti-Mubarak 
posters and pamphlets were not visible in the streets, and the 
government did not report any violence during the nine-hour voting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's constitution does not allow for a presidential election.  
Instead, the elected parliament nominates one candidate for the 
referendum. The 454-member house -- dominated by Mubarak's National 
Democratic Party -- chose Mubarak in July. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, state-run vehicles provided free rides for voters.  
They drove past government buildings decked with enormous 
advertisements for the president and banners proclaiming, ``Egypt 
plus Mubarak equals development and stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vehicles carrying loudspeakers drove through the streets  
trumpeting Mubarak's virtues while state television ran programs 
singing his praises. As Mubarak voted with his wife Suzanne and two 
sons in the affluent Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, a crowd chanted 
``Our spirit, our blood, we sacrifice for you, Mubarak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many voters declared genuine support for Mubarak, who is  
respected for his economic accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would sell my children for him,'' said voter Hamid  
Abdul-Fattah. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Hassan Abdullah, pointed to Egyptians wearing gold  
jewelry and carrying mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are Mubarak's achievements,'' Abdullah said.  
</P>
<P>
	But a few people expressed their discontent by declining to  
vote. One local resident, Abdullah Mahfouz, said he would not enter 
a polling station because ``my vote doesn't count.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many opposition parties have urged the lifting of the emergency  
law that has been in force since Mubarak came to power. They call 
for freedom to form political parties and associations, which now 
require the approval of a government committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement published Saturday in the leftist newspaper  
Al-Arabi, a group of 109 prominent opposition figures said Mubarak 
hasn't fulfilled past promises to bring prosperity to the people. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of democracy was ``only meant for propaganda while  
arbitrary trials and arrests of opponents continue,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak rejects political reforms, saying his priority is  
building economic and social stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties have little clout to protest. Civil rights  
groups allege troublesome opposition activists are silenced by 
security services that use strong-arm tactics. The media is largely 
government-controlled and opposition newspapers face the threat of 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak, who was vice president under President Anwar Sadat, was  
first elected president in 1981 after Sadat's assassination by 
Islamic radicals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has pushed forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and  
prodded Libya toward surrendering the two suspects wanted for the 
1988 Lockerbie bombing. On the economic front, he has significantly 
reduced foreign debt, balanced the budget and cut inflation, making 
the country one of the more diverse and open economies in the 
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Spotlight on Cardinals Monday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Steve Young can't remember exactly the first  
time he played on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holy cow! It was awhile ago,'' the San Francisco quarterback  
said. ``One of the early ones I remember was a home game against 
the Bears where we won 41-0 and Mike Ditka threw his gum and hit a 
lady and she sued him. That was a long time ago. I don't know if 
that's the first one, but it was one of the memorable ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When you play in prime time as often as the 49ers, the games  
just blur. The game against Arizona will be San Francisco's 52nd 
appearance on Monday night football, its 27th of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is foreign territory for the Cardinals, who have played  
on Monday night only twice before since moving from St. Louis 11 
years ago. The game is a sellout at 73,014-seat Sun Devil Stadium, 
a rare occurrence in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Leave it to Arizona linebacker Simeon Rice, a man known to  
invent a few words for special occasions, to describe the 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are just going to be jubilated for this game,'' he said.  
``We're going to take that jubilation and feel an ecstasy to the 
hilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for the Cardinals will be to avoid getting too up  
for their chance in the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me it's a lot like a playoff atmosphere, and we were in the  
playoffs last year, so that gives us a little bit of feel of what 
the national glare is,'' Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. 
``Everybody's family and friends at home will see them play. I 
think the intensity level increases because everybody knows that 
everybody is watching them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin admits that with all the Monday night experience of Young,  
Jerry Rice and a few others, the 49ers could have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it probably is an advantage for their core people,  
just like it's an advantage to have played all those games and have 
all those championships,'' Tobin said. ``It's an inner thing that 
they have that you can't take away from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But these are not the 49ers of the past. San Francisco was blown  
out at Jacksonville 41-3 in its season opener, then had to rally to 
beat New Orleans 28-21 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers are 27th out of 31 NFL teams in total offense and 18th  
in total defense. The Saints sacked Young five times and knocked 
him down 16 more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not on all cylinders,'' Young said. ``We're going to  
try to win games however we can while we get our feet under us, 
then like any good team, try to press on through the middle of the 
season and keep getting wins despite the fact maybe we're not 
playing our best football, and then peak at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci, who is 6-0 in Monday night games, is  
considering shuffling his offensive line. Jeremy Newberry, beaten 
repeatedly by New Orleans defensive end Troy Wilson, might move 
from right tackle to guard, with Derrick Deese switching to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Newberry or Deese will have to contend with Arizona defensive  
end Andre Wadsworth, who is coming off the best game of his young 
pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are sixth in total defense in the NFC after a  
strong showing in last week's 19-16 loss at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona offense, however, is another matter. The Cardinals  
are 25th in total offense and 27th in rushing. Jake Plummer has 
thrown seven interceptions and just one touchdown pass and has a 
quarterback rating of 29.1, 96.8 points lower than league leader 
Brad Johnson of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer said the right thumb he sprained during preseason is  
better. He practiced more last week than he did in the first two. 
He's the kind of player who always has done well in the big games, 
and this is the Cardinals' home opener as well as his first 
appearance on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also his first game against the 49ers, the team that passed  
on him in favor of Jim Druckenmiller in the 1997 draft. He is, 
after all, the player that San Francisco vice president and general 
manager Bill Walsh proclaimed the ``next Joe Montana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer figures that a franchise as proud as the 49ers won't  
take kindly to the prospect of falling to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make the statement that they're not quite the old  
49ers when they were dominating and winning the Super Bowl,'' 
Plummer said. ``That's obvious. They haven't been back there in a 
while. But they're a team that still has quality football players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have such a tradition. If you hear people say they're not  
the 49ers of old, they're going to get mad. They're going to come 
out to prove something. They're going to be ready to play.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Announces New Debt Relief Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- World financial leaders have pledged  
accelerated reform to better manage future global economic crises 
while also approving a new initiative to speed easing poor 
countries' crushing debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance ministers and central bank governors attending the  
annual meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank made the commitments after being criticized for 
mismanaging the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil that hammered 
markets worldwide over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	At weekend meetings the finance ministers also urged Russia to  
pursue economic reform and expressed concern that the Japanese 
yen's value against the dollar was moving too high. Japanese 
officials hope the statement will drive down the yen's value in 
world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first-ever joint meeting Sunday of the policy-making  
committees of the World Bank and the IMF, officials pledged 
``deeper, broader and faster debt relief'' for 36 of the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries are expected to spend the $100 billion the new  
initiative makes available on health and education projects instead 
of paying off loans to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let it be said of this historic meeting that those to whom the  
world's greatest wealth has been given are joined with those 
burdened down by the world's greatest debt,'' said British 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, chairman of the IMF's 
policy-making Interim Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved a plan for the IMF to revalue up to 14  
million ounces of its gold reserves in transactions with central 
banks to partly finance the debt initiative. The World Bank also 
will contribute along with the United States and other creditor 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	After opposition from gold-mining countries and U.S. lawmakers,  
the IMF was forced to drop plans to sell gold on the open market, 
where there were concerns prices for the commodity would fall to 
new record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further effort to bolster gold prices, central bank  
officials from 15 nations pledged jointly Sunday they would hold 
their own future gold sales to limits already announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading in Asia today gold prices rose in response to  
the IMF move. 
</P>
<P>
	On the reform front, the IMF adopted a new code of good  
practices that will be used to monitor countries efforts to provide 
markets with timely economic data such as central bank reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hopes these reforms will ease  
criticism of the IMF by congressional Republicans who plan to 
investigate allegations of money laundering of Russian money 
through accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``A changed IMF is needed for the changed world that we now  
have. We have made a good start in many areas, but much more needs 
to be done,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told IMF policy 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have said that no evidence has been uncovered so  
far that IMF money was part of the billions being investigated in 
the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, said he  
would comply with new IMF financial disclosure requirements but the 
data should not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make us perform a strip tease every quarter is a little  
stupid,'' Gerashchenko said. Recommending the data not be made 
public, he told reporters, ``It's like a health check between a 
patient and a doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another reform move, the United States and its six wealthy  
nation partners -- Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy 
-- decided Saturday to set up a new Group of 20 nations to focus on 
world financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which will include both wealthy and developing  
countries, will hold its first meeting in Berlin in December with 
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as chairman 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of 20, which was strongly pushed by the United States,  
is seen by the administration as a way to hold brainstorming 
sessions to come up with more far-reaching financial reform 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the unfolding Russian investigations, this year's IMF  
and World Bank meetings are taking place in an atmosphere markedly 
improved from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a botched devaluation of the Russian ruble and the near  
collapse of a large American hedge fund threatened to push the 
United States and the rest of the world into recession. That 
calamity was avoided in large part because the U.S. economy has 
outperformed expectations, serving as a market for crisis-striken 
Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the trade deficit soaring to an annual rate of $247  
billion, 50 percent higher than last year's record, U.S. officials 
are growing more concerned about the sustainability of that huge 
imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of meetings ends Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Book: Einstein Had Retarded Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new book claims that Albert Einstein's  
illegitimate daughter was born severely retarded, possibly with 
Down syndrome, and died at 21 months after a bout with Scarlet 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
	When the first volume of Einstein's collected papers was  
released in 1987, it showed that he had had an affair while at 
university with a fellow student named Mileva Maric, who later 
became pregnant and gave birth to a child at her parent's home in 
rural Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby, a daughter named Lieserl, was born severely retarded,  
possibly with Down syndrome, according to a new book, ``Einstein's 
Daughter: The Search for Lieserl,'' by Michelle Zackheim, Time 
magazine reported in its current issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Zackheim's book says that Maric was unable to put the girl up  
for adoption and ultimately left her with her parents in the 
Vojovodina region of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Zackheim says she wrote the book because of her curiosity about  
what became of the abandoned child. She said she wanted to find out 
how ``did (Einstein's) daughter feel about being abandoned, 
especially by someone who was so important to the culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of turning up a living heir, the author's research  
led her to a letter Einstein had written to Maric in 1903 that said 
``I am very sorry about what has happened to Lieserl. Scarlet fever 
often leaves some lasting trace behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This clue led Zackheim to deduce that the baby died at the age  
of 21 months from Scarlet Fever. 
</P>
<P>
	The new book is just the latest in a number of revelations about  
Einstein's personal life that have scholars re-evaluating the image 
of the wild-haired, iconoclastic inventor of the theory of 
relativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston University historian Robert Schulmann, director of the  
Einstein Papers Project, told Time that the book's conclusions 
about the child's fate are ``as good as anything I could come up 
with, or anyone else. But it's speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard physicist and Einstein historian Gerald Holton was more  
critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``She worked very hard traipsing through all those Serbian  
cemeteries and came up with nothing.''

<HEADLINE>  E.Carolina Rewarded for Perseverance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- After a week in its home-away-from-home,  
East Carolina was rewarded for its perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina, forced to spend a week on the road waiting for  
the effects of Hurricane Floyd to subside, mounted a fourth-quarter 
rally and knocked off Miami 27-23 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped a week in which the No. 19 Pirates (4-0) had to spend  
a week in Columbia, S.C., where they beat the University of South 
Carolina the previous weekend. That was one week in a motel, with 
trips to the mall, the movies and a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly's desperation  
fourth-down pass sailed out of bounds to secure the victory, the 
Pirates let their emotions show in a variety of ways. Some ran 
around in celebration, others thrust their fists into the sky, 
while a few more simply fell on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the reality of what Floyd has done to coach Steve  
Logan's bunch of football nomads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some aftermath to contend with,'' Logan said. ``I've  
got 18 to 20 players that are displaced. We've got to get them 
re-situated, and in the meantime, we've got to prepare for a 
football game this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for this week's game was tough enough. Logan and his  
team used the indoor and outdoor facilities at South Carolina to 
prepare for the 18th-ranked Hurricanes. Because the situation in 
Greenville changed every day, the Pirates switched the game from 
their home field to North Carolina State's Carter-Finley Stadium, 
some 85 miles to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, it appeared that the makeshift arrangements  
took their toll on the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina committed two turnovers, seemed to be a little out  
of rhythm on offense and unable to wrap up on defense. Throughout 
the game, Kelly escaped the Pirates and scrambled for big gains. 
Reserve running back Clinton Portis ran through East Carolina for 
147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	At the half, Miami (2-2) built a 20-3 lead.

<P>
	``Everybody wants to know what we did at halftime. The only  
thing we did at halftime, I just begged our offense to please not 
turn the ball over any more,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap may have awakened the Pirates, but Miami coach Butch  
Davis said if his team eased up a little, it was wrong to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team should have definitely not gotten complacent at  
halftime,'' Davis said. ``We came into this game knowing that ECU 
was very dangerous entering the game 3-0. They are a talented and 
dangerous team and there should not have been any complacency in 
our locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes pushed the lead to 23-3 on Andy Crosland's  
47-yard field goal with 12:13 left in the third quarter. That's 
when East Carolina took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Wilson, whose earlier fumble led to a touchdown, ran 23  
yards for a score with 9:43 left in the period. Wilson then capped 
an 84-yard drive with an 18-yard touchdown run with 11:59 to play, 
closing the gap to 23-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Miller added a 39-yard field goal with 9:30 left to draw  
the Pirates closer. By then, the Hurricanes showed no semblance of 
the offense that ran up 301 yards through three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina capped the comeback with a 79-yard, 10-play drive  
that ended on David Garrard's 27-yard scoring pass to Keith Stokes 
with 4:51 left. When time ran out, fans ignored pleas to stay off 
the field and tore down both goal posts. Security guards kept the 
poles in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was ready to refute the notion that having had to prepare  
under adverse conditions would have an impact on his team. Miami 
wide receiver Reggie Wayne agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a perfect season already and they would play hard  
to keep it, no matter what the situations are,'' said Wayne, who 
caught a 21-yard scoring pass from Kelly in the first quarter. ``A 
top 10 team's coming in to play them and they're going to play hard 
regardless. We knew they would come out and play hard. In the 
second half, we came out and we didn't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the game at No. 9, the Hurricanes were the  
highest-ranked team East Carolina has ever beaten. Now, reality 
lies ahead and it doesn't necessarily have to do with football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't even there. We didn't even have to deal with many  
of the things that have already been dealt with,'' Logan said. ``I 
told the kids all week to keep counting their blessings and we were 
well taken care of and we had a lot of good times in the hotel. It 
really kind of pulled us together in some ways, although nobody's 
got any underwear.''

<HEADLINE>  E.Carolina Rewarded for Perseverance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- After a week in its home-away-from-home,  
East Carolina was rewarded for its perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina, forced to spend a week on the road waiting for  
the effects of Hurricane Floyd to subside, mounted a fourth-quarter 
rally and knocked off Miami 27-23 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped a week in which the No. 19 Pirates (4-0) had to spend  
a week in Columbia, S.C., where they beat the University of South 
Carolina the previous weekend. That was one week in a motel, with 
trips to the mall, the movies and a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly's desperation  
fourth-down pass sailed out of bounds to secure the victory, the 
Pirates let their emotions show in a variety of ways. Some ran 
around in celebration, others thrust their fists into the sky, 
while a few more simply fell on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the reality of what Floyd has done to coach Steve  
Logan's bunch of football nomads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some aftermath to contend with,'' Logan said. ``I've  
got 18 to 20 players that are displaced. We've got to get them 
re-situated, and in the meantime, we've got to prepare for a 
football game this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for this week's game was tough enough. Logan and his  
team used the indoor and outdoor facilities at South Carolina to 
prepare for the 18th-ranked Hurricanes. Because the situation in 
Greenville changed every day, the Pirates switched the game from 
their home field to North Carolina State's Carter-Finley Stadium, 
some 85 miles to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, it appeared that the makeshift arrangements  
took their toll on the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina committed two turnovers, seemed to be a little out  
of rhythm on offense and unable to wrap up on defense. Throughout 
the game, Kelly escaped the Pirates and scrambled for big gains. 
Reserve running back Clinton Portis ran through East Carolina for 
147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	At the half, Miami (2-2) built a 20-3 lead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to know what we did at halftime. The only  
thing we did at halftime, I just begged our offense to please not 
turn the ball over any more,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap may have awakened the Pirates, but Miami coach Butch

<HEADLINE> Some Nebraskans Re-think Recall Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMORA, Neb. (AP) -- Jesse Spidell cast a disgusted glance at the  
mound of tree branches piled up in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago the Tamora village board would have had the mess  
carted away. The problem is, the village board is no more. It is 
one more victim of a recall, Nebraska's weapon of choice for 
unseating unpopular elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall option exists in various forms all over the United  
States, but Nebraskans seem to have made an art form of it. Soured 
on the mayor? Start a recall petition. Village board member shot 
your dog? Recall. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tamora, the troubles were rooted in a feud between the  
village board president and his father, who didn't like the way he 
was running the town. The fight led to so many recall petitions 
that eventually Tamora people voted 30-6 to dissolve the tiny 
farming community altogether. In 1997 Tamora was officially 
unincorporated and fell under the rule of the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of ridiculous,'' Spidell said on a recent chilly  
morning, standing outside his house surrounded by fields of 
soybeans and milo. ``I'm glad it ain't my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska does not allow for recalls of lawmakers or statewide  
elected officials like the governor and attorney general. But if 
you're lower down the ladder -- school board member, village 
treasurer, town clerk -- watch out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a kind of latent gene in Nebraska citizenry  
that responds to this kind of contrary approach to public 
affairs,'' said University of Nebraska political science professor 
Robert Sittig. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Erickson, assistant secretary of state for elections, said:  
``The way the law currently exists you can recall somebody because 
you don't like the color of socks they're wearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Dodson of Giltner, in east-central Nebraska, gathered 56  
signatures and forced a recall vote of Angela Joyce, a village 
board member. The vote is set for Oct. 19 and a simple majority of 
the village's 290 registered voters will be enough to unseat Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
	She's frustrated, not least because Dodson's reasons are vague.  
``She more or less likes to do things her way and no one else's,'' 
he said to reporters, ``and that doesn't settle well with people 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see if I had done something wrong, but I haven't done  
anything,'' Joyce said. ``I can't really campaign because I have no 
idea what I have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Roca, population 84, village board member Jeff Manske shot  
his neighbor's dog to death because its barking irritated him. 
Three months later, residents voted 34-32 to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	In Omaha, Nebraska's largest city, warehouse worker Stephen King  
launched a recall petition last year against Mayor Hal Daub, mainly 
over his handling of police-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
	King accused Daub of ``blatant arrogance'' but failed to gather  
the necessary 40,000 signatures -- 35 percent of the number of votes 
cast in the mayoral election. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was not unprecedented; in 1987 Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle  
was recalled because of his controversial management style, 
including his firing of the police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The power of recall can be invoked too quickly, Sittig said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They trot it out in the second or third inning of a pretty  
hotly contested fray when maybe it should be reserved for the 
eighth or ninth inning,'' Sittig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall law was pushed through by reformers in the Plains  
states at the turn of the century, when farmers were facing 
economic hardship and there were fears that individuals' rights 
would be trampled by railroads and banks, Sittig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reformers felt that big business had too much of a voice in  
state and local government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The populist spirit has kept the law on the books relatively  
unchanged, and there are about a dozen recall efforts a year. But 
the latest have prompted suggestions that the law be revisited. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal was introduced in the Nebraska Legislature last  
session to restrict recall petitions to cases of elected officials 
who have poor attendance records, neglect their duties or commit 
illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was lambasted by at least one Nebraska newspaper.  
The Hastings Tribune called it the ``Politicians Protection Act of 
1999'' and an ``attempt to subvert Nebraskans' right to participate 
in their governance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though some recall efforts may look silly, most are  
launched because of legitimate concerns, said Erickson of the 
secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Krumland of the League of Nebraska Municipalities complains  
that too many recall drives seem like personal vendettas. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can start recall petitions for any reason,'' Krumland  
said. ``It interferes with officials carrying on their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no village business in Tamora anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	A rusting flag pole sits unused outside the Tamora Town Hall,  
which has been sold and turned into a storage shed and junk yard. A 
derelict 1944 Chevy truck sits next to the village board's former 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamora is now run from Seward, the county seat six miles away.  
Is it governed any better? Spidell says he phoned the garbage 
removal people in Seward about the branches three months ago and is 
still waiting.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Manager Plans To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Lou Piniella wants to end all the speculation  
about his future. He plans to return to manage the Seattle Mariners 
in 2000 despite the retirement of Woody Woodward, his good friend 
and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was worn out by his job, Woodward, 56, announced last  
week he planned to retire, effective Oct. 31, after running the 
Mariners' front office for 11 seasons. Woodward brought Piniella 
here in November 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's departure led to conjecture that Piniella, also 56,  
would leave Seattle, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never said that,'' Piniella said on Sunday before the  
Mariners' final home game of the season. ``I'll be back. I'm under 
contract and I've enjoyed it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella, who managed Cincinnati to a World Series sweep over  
Oakland in 1990, said he was convinced the Mariners owners wanted 
to put a winning team on the field next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been disappointed in the direction we've been headed the  
past couple of years,'' he said. ``To me, the fun part of this job 
is winning. I think you talk to any manager and they'll tell you 
the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning AL West championships in 1995 and 1997, Seattle  
has finished a disappointing third place in its division the past 
two seasons despite the presence of Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have talked to former Toronto and Baltimore GM Pat  
Gillick about replacing Woodward. They plan to interview former New 
York Yankees general manager Bob Watson next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have an important offseason facing them. Both  
Griffey and Rodriguez are under contract through 2000. If the team 
can't re-sign them, it might decide to trade them during the winter 
when their values are at a maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners traded Randy Johnson to Houston as the trading  
deadline ticked away last season rather than lose him as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Piniella wants Griffey and Rodriguez back.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to make every effort to get them signed,'' he said.  
``I think this organization will do that. But at the same time it 
takes two to get something done. I would hope that Alex and Junior 
genuinely want to stay here because the money will be here for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players have said they want to play on a team that will  
contend for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners started this season with a $53 million payroll.  
Piniella said he expected the team to come up with a payroll figure 
for 2000 ``by the middle of October or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Basically, the last few years here, we've gone from  
10th, 11th, 12th in payroll to the 20s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella said he planned to stay out of the selection process of  
the Mariners' new GM. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job basically is to get along with people so I'm not going  
to have any problem one way or the other.''

<HEADLINE> Gators Winning the Old-Fashioned Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The team that introduced the wide-open  
passing attack to the Southeastern Conference is suddenly looking 
very retro. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Florida coach Steve Spurrier's beloved vertical passing  
game is still a dangerous weapon. But in Saturday night's 38-10 win 
over Kentucky, it was the musty football traditions of running the 
ball and tough defense that paved the way to an easy win for the 
third-ranked Gators (4-0, 2-0 SEC). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to get out and play some smash-mouth football now  
and then,'' center Corey Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators defense left the pass-happy ``Air Raid'' attack of  
Kentucky's Hal Mumme spinning its wheels. The Wildcats (2-2, 0-1) 
finished with their lowest point total in Mumme's two-plus seasons 
in Lexington, and were under 400 yards in total offense for only 
the fourth time in his 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Gators' 13th straight win over Kentucky and sixth  
straight by double digits. Though 38 points were their lowest 
against Kentucky since a 24-20 thriller in 1993, Florida's 
dominance was no less than in 55-28 and 51-35 wins in 1997 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	With four straight touchdowns in the first and second quarters,  
Florida jumped to a 28-0 lead and took the Commonwealth 
Stadium-record crowd of 70,971 out of the game early. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's secondary, burned by big pass plays in last year's  
loss at Gainesville, mixed things up by adding some zone coverage 
to its usual bump-and-run. The Gators simply shifted to a ground 
attack that was effective even in the absence of starting tailback 
Earnest Graham, who left with a severe thigh bruise on the game's 
second play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big day running the ball,'' said quarterback Doug  
Johnson, who threw for 241 yards and two scores. ``They seemed 
determined to stop the pass. ... The offensive line, you've got to 
give them credit -- they busted open some holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made the running easy for Robert Gillespie and Bo Carroll,  
who combined for three touchdowns and 194 of the Gators' 224 
rushing yards. With eight rushing touchdowns this season, Florida 
already is just one behind last season's total, when the Gators 
ranked 115th in the nation in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't pass for a ton of yards, but we were able to move  
the ball,'' Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Florida's pass defense, which gave up an SEC-worst  
325 yards per game through three games, limited Kentucky 
quarterback Dusty Bonner to 254 yards and no touchdowns on 
36-for-48 passing. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 10 plays of 30 yards or more in three games, the  
defense gave the Wildcats nothing longer than Bonner's 22-yard 
completion to tight end James Whalen Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepest ball Bonner threw -- a second-quarter overthrow of  
wideout Garry Davis -- ended up in the hands of Florida cornerback 
Bennie Alexander, an interception that set up the Gators' third 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a lot of good things in their secondary, disguising  
things,'' Bonner said. ``They're so quick. Sometimes you look and 
they're in single coverage and by the time you throw the ball 
they're in double coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Kentucky rushing for just 63 yards, the Gators added to an  
impressive set of numbers compiled under Spurrier in the 1990s: 
79-1 when holding opponents under 21 points; 57-1 when rushing for 
150 yards or more; and 60-1-1 when holding opponents to less than 
100 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Spurrier, the Gators are 65-0 against unranked teams.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Blasts Bush Over Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Alan  
Keyes lambasted GOP front-runner George W. Bush on Sunday for 
skipping the California Republican Party convention this weekend, 
charging the Texas governor was ``cowering in the bushes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said the governor passed up the GOP gathering in the  
nation's largest state to attend a Hispanic meeting and the Ryder 
Cup golf tournament in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it kind of strange that somebody whose people keep  
telling us he's got it all sewed up is showing up absent at so many 
important party meetings and has been contriving to try to destroy 
all of the venues of debate that ought to be taking place in this 
season,'' Keyes said at a convention news conference. ``What's he 
afraid of?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the term mediocrity does not apply to Mr. Bush, let him  
come out here and prove it,'' Keyes said. ``Because last time I 
looked, all the money in the world doesn't make you a superior 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Keyes, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole were the only  
presidential candidates to attend the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to convention delegates, Keyes sharply criticized  
Republican voters who were lining up behind candidates they 
perceive as the likely winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are people in this room who will actually and go  
out and stand for the mindless, mediocre equivocators who put our 
principles on the back burner while promising that they will 
achieve everything under the sun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Keyes said his repeated references to unnamed ``mediocre  
equivocators'' was not necessary directed at Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes also predicted that rival Pat Buchanan's possible  
departure from the Republican Party would send conservative 
Republicans into his camp.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Defaults on Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador will default on payment of  
millions of dollars of U.S.-backed debt, President Jamil Mahuad 
announced Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ecuador chose to delay its $98-million interest  
payment on its Brady bond debt for 30 days. It had until Tuesday to 
make the payment or officially become the first country ever to 
default on a Brady bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, were created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of 
the 1980s. They are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised address, Mahuad said his nation would  
only pay interest on the bonds that are not guaranteed by the U.S. 
Treasury Department. He said Ecuador would pay ``a little less than 
half,'' of the $98-million interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	International lenders and creditors have been fixated on  
Ecuador's economy. Although the country does not rank among the 
region's largest economies, some fear a default on the 
once-sacrosanct Brady bonds could spark a tumble in emerging bond 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad asked international lenders and creditors for  
``flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador ``cannot pay its foreign debt on the terms that are  
currently presented,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador had been working on proposals to restructure its entire  
Brady bond debt of $6 billion, and was preparing to present 
strategies for foreign debt restructuring this week during the 
annual International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Jail Disguised As Horse Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Ordered by a judge to relieve inmate  
crowding, the city and county had to face up to their need for a 
new jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid the rolling bluegrass smack in the heart of Kentucky's  
genteel horse country, not just any jail would do. The solution? 
Disguise the lockup as a horse farm. 
</P>
<P>
	As former Vice Mayor Teresa Isaac joked when the $71 million  
project was shown to the city's governing council last year, ``It 
will be the first jail in `Southern Living.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fayette County Detention Center, due to open in May, will  
house 1,200 inmates in a building that incorporates leading-edge 
corrections design: video conferencing capabilities, a ``jail 
within a jail'' assessment center and modular living areas where 
one guard can supervise as many as 40 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that will be visible to travelers on the scenic Old  
Frankfort Pike, leading to some of the world's most famous 
thoroughbred horse farms. Queen Elizabeth II has bought and boarded 
horses in the Lexington area. 
</P>
<P>
	Farms include Three Chimneys, home of 1977 Triple Crown winner  
Seattle Slew and 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver 
Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Passersby will see only a landscaped hill, topped by an  
administration building designed to look like the main house at a 
horse farm, with brick facing and a turreted cupola in the center 
of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	A low stone wall extends to either side of the main building,  
adding to the appearance. The jail itself is behind the hill, laid 
out in a fan shape below the main building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said from the beginning, `This is going to be an asset,'''  
said a Fayette County jailer, Ray Sabbatine, who helped design it. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is so appreciative.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from an architect's perspective, things should look  
like what they are,'' said Allen Swerdlowe, an architect who 
teaches at the Pratt Institute in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want a stadium to look like a stadium, not a shopping  
mall. ... Once you start to mix languages, when a building's form 
defies its function, the character of a building starts to defy its 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less bothered by the jail's facade is Constantine Karalis, who  
also teaches at Pratt and runs a private architectural practice 
that designs jails and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a jail is an unpleasant thought and sight to people, and  
you make it look like a horse farm, then it is a dishonest thing to 
do, but I would call it a misdemeanor, because eventually people 
will know it's a jail anyway,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Heat Hampers Calif. Firefighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters were hampered by heat and  
dry brush as they battled a string of fires still burning in the 
state, but the feared wind gusts that had been forecast Sunday 
never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning-sparked fires have burned more than 60,000 acres of  
northern California's Trinity Alps Wilderness in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had expected wind gusts of 30-40 mph Sunday to  
further fan the flames, but fire information officer Joe Mazzeo 
said Sunday afternoon that the wind hadn't become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of holding our breath up here waiting to see what  
will happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One firefighter suffered a concussion Saturday when he was  
struck by a branch that fell from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central coast, fires that have burned 42,454 acres of the  
Los Padres National Forest near Big Sur were about a quarter 
contained Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Sur-area fires alone have cost more than $27 million to  
fight since they were sparked by lightning strikes Sept. 8.

<HEADLINE> Casey Seals Penn State's QB Platoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- From Arizona to Ann Arbor, lots of  
coaches tried quarterback platoons this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Most coaches finally settled on one guy, and Penn State's Joe  
Paterno seemed unlikely to stick with college football's latest fad 
for an entire year. Through five games now, he has -- and over the 
past two weeks, Kevin Thompson and Rashard Casey have shown why. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Thompson threw a perfect 79-yard pass to lead Penn  
State to a comeback victory over Miami, Casey posted sensational 
numbers -- and even more spectacular plays -- as the No. 2 Nittany 
Lions (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) beat Indiana 45-24 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Casey was the show-stopper,'' linebacker Brandon Short said.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, no one is asking if Paterno is sticking with his  
two-quarterback system. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, Casey found tight end Tony Stewart for 30-  
and 26-yard gains to set up a touchdown and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, he had two TD passes to keep pace with  
Antwaan Randle El, whose touchdown throws kept the Hoosiers (1-3, 
0-1) in the game. First, Casey drilled a pass to Eric McCoo for 20 
yards. Then he threw a well-placed ball to the pylon that Sam 
Crenshaw nabbed for a 9-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the field for all five of Penn State's offensive  
scores, and finished with the best numbers of his career: 13-for-15 
for 196 yards and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rushed for 66 yards on eight carries and one scrambling  
31-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Casey played exceptionally well,'' Paterno said. ``Made some  
things happen. He's that kind of player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who say he's not Penn State's typical quarterback,  
Paterno argues that he's not against a running quarterback, ``if 
you've got somebody who can do it and do it well and not get 
carried away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, he improvises. Couple of times he shouldn't have, but  
he's good enough to get away with it. He's gonna pay a price 
someday when he tries to improvise and doesn't get away with it. 
We've got to live with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that it's easy when the 72-year-old Paterno is watching from  
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Paterno decided to stay with Thompson because he  
worried that Casey did not understand Penn State's offense well 
enough. That changed this offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a good passer. He's always been a very good  
athlete,'' he said. ``That's never been my problem with him. The 
problem has been, he had a tendency to have lapses mentally, to 
make mistakes. He made up his mind this past winter that he was 
going to be a quarterback, not just an athlete who plays 
quarterback. That is what he's doing, and now he's obviously got a 
lot of confidence in himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is 32-for-41 for 519 yards and five touchdowns, with 137  
yards rushing and two more TDs. That offensive production is only a 
few yards shy of Thompson's (43-for-72 for 788 yards). 
</P>
<P>
	``What a luxury it is to have two good quarterbacks,'' Indiana  
coach Cam Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Thompson, if he's unhappy about the time-sharing  
arrangement, he isn't letting on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it takes for our team to win,'' he said. ``Sure, it's  
harder. Anytime you're used to playing a lot and you get in there 
and things don't go your way, you get a little discouraged. But you 
have to go out there and hang tough and wait for your opportunity. 
I'm not a guy who's going to complain.''

<HEADLINE> Democrat Cancels Gore Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new chairman of the Democratic Party had a  
problem: ``I have to be scrupulously neutral,'' Ed Rendell said 
Sunday, but as mayor of Philadelphia he endorsed Vice President Al 
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not help matters that Gore's opponent for the 2000  
Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley, is a long-time 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known Bill Bradley for 20 years, and when he called to  
tell me he was running, I said: `Bill, I'm sorry. ... I wish you 
had called me earlier,''' Rendell said. ``It might have been a 
difficult decision for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When chosen to head the Democratic National Committee, Rendell  
said on ABC's ``This Week,'' he withdrew the endorsement and 
invited Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, to assign a top 
aide to work at the committee with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the vice president understands,'' Rendell said. ``I  
told the president I have to be scrupulously neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell and other senior Democrats appearing on Sunday's  
television news shows depicted the Gore-Bradley matchup as a clash 
of excellent candidates, close on issues but separated by styles. 
</P>
<P>
	``A spirited debate where both candidates show their best side,  
a debate that's positive. ... I think there are some real up sides 
to that,'' Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the down side is, if it goes on a long period of  
time, and both candidates spend a lot of money, we're going to be 
cash poor at the end of that debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, D-Mo., a Gore supporter, said, ``First of all, nobody 
hands you the Democratic nomination. You've got to go out and fight 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, a former congressman from New  
Mexico, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that Gore-Bradley ``is 
going to be a very contested campaign, but the vice president 
nationally is ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in New York, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who endorsed  
Bradley last week. The candidates are neck-and-neck, he said on 
NBC, but he chose Bradley over Gore for a simple reason: ``The 
votes aren't there'' for Gore in a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Bradley supporter, Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota,  
also said the former New Jersey senator is more electable than 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley has a better chance of winning the general  
election,'' Wellstone said, also on NBC. ``I think Bill, for people 
in our country, represents somebody different. ... I think he can 
win this election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Rendell's new job will be to refill the party's treasury  
to finance next summer's general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	That will include a lot of so-called ``soft money,'' unregulated  
contributions from groups designed to promote political parties but 
often used to elect candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole process stinks,'' Rendell said, although he  
acknowledged that he picked up a check for $100,000 Saturday from 
labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to tie one hand behind our back in what I  
think is the most important election in the last 25 years,'' 
Rendell said. ``We're going to be competitive.''

</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Patricia Brous, who rose from volunteer  
to president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of 
Kansas and Mid-Missouri, died Friday after a battle with cancer. 
She was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Brous became a familiar figure as Planned Parenthood responded  
to changes in Kansas and Missouri laws on abortion, including 
annual attempts by the Missouri Legislature to ban state funding 
for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Planned Parenthood Clinic in Kansas City, where no abortions  
are performed, has been the site of many protests by abortion 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the clinic was one of several Planned Parenthood  
centers around the nation that were targets of hoax threats of 
biological weapons exposure, forcing staffs and patients to undergo 
decontamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Brous began volunteering for Planned Parenthood in 1974, then  
served on its board of directors and became the organization's 
development director. She took over as president and chief 
executive officer in 1990.

</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Pat Watson, an offensive line coach for  
11th-ranked Georgia, died Saturday, apparently of a heart attack. 
He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson died a few hours after Georgia's 24-23 victory over  
Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson experienced discomfort at home after the game and was  
taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Wastson's second season with the football team. He  
joined the staff in 1998 as a defensive ends coach. Watson moved 
over to the offensive line this year when Chris Scelfo left for 
Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a coach for 32 years, was a graduate assistant at North  
Carolina in 1967 and was also an assistant at Furman (1969), 
Mississippi State (1970-71), North Carolina (1972-77), Virginia 
Tech (1978-86), Georgia Tech (1987-91 and 1995-96) and Texas 
(1992-94). 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a native of Meridian, Miss., was a lineman at  
Mississippi State from 1961-64 and then played two years in the 
CFL.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit outfielder Juan Encarnacion, bleeding  
profusely, had to be helped from the field after being hit in the 
face by a pitch from Kansas City right-hander Blake Stein on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays taken at Henry Ford Hospital showed he has a fractured

Encarnacion turned his face into the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	A large pool of blood formed on a light blue towel placed under  
Encarnacion's head by trainer Russ Miller. After a few minutes, 
Encarnacion was helped to his feet and rode off the field on the

<HEADLINE> Packers 23, Vikings 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre never gets tired of making  
the extraordinary look like child's play. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre led the Green Bay Packers to another thrilling comeback  
win, hitting Corey Bradford with a 23-yard touchdown pass with 12 
seconds left and giving the Packers a 23-20 victory over the 
Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those touchdown passes, I've dreamed about them a million  
times since I was a kid,'' he said. ``Of course, Corey Bradford 
wasn't in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford's catch capped a 77-yard, 104-second drive led by  
Favre, who beat the Oakland Raiders in Week 1 with a similar 
last-ditch march. It was Favre's 12th fourth-quarter comeback and 
the 15th game-winning drive of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's final pass came on a fourth-and-1 play, and Green Bay  
had no timeouts remaining. Favre said he didn't call a play but 
simply took the snap and threw toward Bradford, who bumped Jimmy 
Hitchcock at the line of scrimmage and ran on a full sprint toward 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a dream, and I was hoping I wouldn't wake up,''  
Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it was a man call, and he beat me,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``I just got beat. I let him in the end zone. I take full 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 6-of-7 on the final drive, hitting Bradford twice and  
Dorsey Levens three times as the Packers (2-1) scored their only 
offensive touchdown of the game against Minnesota's fired-up 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think I saw him catch it,'' said Favre, who ran  
and leaped toward the other end of the field with his arms raised. 
``As I threw it, I knew it was going to be perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Moss caught a 10-yard touchdown pass -- just his second  
reception of the game -- from Randall Cunningham with 1:56 to play, 
giving Minnesota (1-2) a 20-16 lead. Both teams struggled to mount 
sustained offensive drives until the game's fabulous finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota took one last shot at the end zone, but rookie  
defensive back Antuan Edwards made his second interception of the 
game as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who wept after the Oakland win, collapsed onto a sideline  
bench shortly after throwing the final pass and was helped off the 
field by medical staff. He said he almost hyperventilated and was 
simply out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm too tired to cry today,'' he said with a laugh. ``Believe  
me, I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 24-of-39 for 304 yards. Green Bay won for the 32nd  
time in 33 games at Lambeau Field, where Minnesota beat the Packers 
37-24 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss' catch capped a five-play, 80-yard drive for the Vikings.  
With 3:40 to play, Cunningham hit Jake Reed on a short slant at the 
Minnesota 30, and Reed slipped between rookie defensive backs 
Edwards and Fred Vinson and ran half the length of the field before 
Vinson dragged him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had six catches for 108 yards as the Vikings' passing  
struggles continued, but Minnesota ran the ball well. After rushing 
for 71 yards in Minnesota's first two games, Robert Smith had 85 
yards on 21 carries, including runs of 7 and 11 yards on the 
Vikings' last scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Green Bay mostly shut down the Vikings offense that ran  
up 545 total yards in its win at Lambeau last season and compelled 
the Packers to draft three defensive backs, all of whom played 
extensively Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a variety of coverage schemes, Moss had just one catch  
for 3 yards in the game's first 58 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Longwell kicked three field goals, including a 34-yarder  
with 4:25 to play that gave Green Bay a 16-13 lead. Gary Anderson 
had two field goals for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards returned his first NFL interception 26 yards for a  
touchdown when Cunningham tried to throw to Moss in triple coverage 
deep in Vikings territory in the second quarter. The rookie was 
helped along by a massive block from Vonnie Holliday on the return. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota drove 94 yards on its first possession and went up 7-0  
on Leroy Hoard's 5-yard run, but only after the drive stayed alive 
on a personal foul against Packers linebacker George Koonce. Both 
teams then settled into a pattern of long drives that didn't end up 
in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's yesterday's news,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said.  
``They just made a nice play. You can't be surprised about 
anything. Brett Favre made the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes: Reed has back-to-back 100-yard receiving games for the  
Vikings. ... Levens rushed for just 49 yards but had a career-high 
nine receptions for 84 yards. ... Minnesota's 20 points were the 
most the Vikings have scored in a game this season. Last year, 
their lowest output in a game was 24 on their way to an NFL-record 
556 points. ... Longwell is perfect on seven PATs and five field 
goals for Green Bay this season. ... Chris Doleman and Corey Miller 
both played extensively for Minnesota after being signed earlier in 
the week. ... Billy Lyon made his first career start at defensive 
tackle in place of Santana Dotson (stinger). Dotson had played in 
all 114 previous games of his NFL career. Lyon had one of the 
Packers' two sacks and made five tackles.

<HEADLINE> Sleep Deprivation, Alcohol Compared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Too little sleep can slow you down as much as  
too many drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a Stanford University study of people  
with mild to moderate sleep apnea: people whose breathing stops 
several or even dozens of times an hour, interrupting their sleep 
without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 million Americans have the problem but fewer than 2  
million of them have been diagnosed, according to the American 
Sleep Apnea Association's Web site. The undiagnosed figure may be 
as high as 25 million, according to Stanford's Sleep Disorders 
Clinic and Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	People known to have apnea did as poorly on a test of reaction  
time as people who were too drunk to drive a bus or truck in 
California, said Dr. Nelson B. Powell of the Stanford center. 
</P>
<P>
	On three of seven measurements, they did worse than people too  
drunk to drive at all in California and other states where the 
legal test is a blood alcohol content of .08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said he wanted to underscore the dangers of driving while  
sleepy, whether or not it's because of apnea. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times have you or anybody you've known been nodding  
off at the wheel, or said, `Gee, I've got to roll the window down 
or turn the music louder'?'' he said. ``I'd bet every driver, at 
one time or another has driven too tired. We know it's wrong but we 
still do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell presented his study Sunday at the annual convention  
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 
Foundation, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful study,'' said Dr. Regina Walker, an  
associate professor of otolaryngology at Loyola University in 
Chicago. ``It is an extremely well-thought-out, well-controlled, 
prospective study that is looking at something I think is of great 
significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 80 volunteers and 113 people with apnea. The  
volunteers' average age was 29; 56 percent were women. In contrast, 
81 percent of the apnea patients were men, and their average age 
was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	However, statistical analysis ruled out age and gender as  
reasons for the difference, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the people took a 10-minute test of reaction speed,  
pushing a button to turn off a randomly set light. After four tests 
to get their baseline reaction time, the comparison group started 
drinking 80-proof alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	They were tested three more times as they kept drinking. Their  
blood alcohol count averaged .05 percent at the first retest, .08 
percent at the second and .083 at the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California and several other states for anyone  
with a blood-alcohol content of more than .04 percent to drive a 
bus or truck, and .08 is considered legal proof of driving drunk in 
16 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to simple reaction times, analysts looked at six  
mathematical permutations, such as the means of the 10 fastest and 
of the 10 slowest times. 
</P>
<P>
	The apnea patients, whose breath stopped about 29 times an hour  
while they were asleep, did worse on all seven measurements than 
the drinkers did on their first re-test, and worse on three of them 
than those who were legally drunk.

<HEADLINE> NHL Investigating Fight After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The NHL is investigating a fight between  
the Washington Capitals' general manager and several members of the 
Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL spokesman Frank Brown on Sunday confirmed the league was  
looking into the violence that followed Saturday night's 
penalty-filled exhibition game, but he declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitals general manager George McPhee's face was cut and one  
arm of his suit was torn off when he was surrounded and punched by 
Blackhawks players. McPhee gave Chicago coach Lorne Molleken a 
black eye, The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackhawks spokesman Tony Ommen declined to discuss the  
altercation. The Capitals did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State University police, which handled security at the  
game, said it did not make a report and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, won by the Capitals 3-1, included five fights.  
Washington finished with 15 penalties for 61 minutes; Chicago had 
17 penalties for 52 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitals coach Ron Wilson said the Blackhawks were intentionally  
instigating contact with smaller players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't come to play hockey,'' Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
	McPhee confronted Molleken immediately after the game outside  
the Chicago dressing room. He grabbed Molleken, shook him and 
landed a punch, giving the coach a black eye, Chicago defenseman 
Brad Brown told the newspaper. Blackhawks team members then joined 
the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and security guards pulled McPhee from the brawl.  
</P>
<P>
	As McPhee headed back toward the Capitals' dressing room, Brown  
yelled: ``He sucker-punched our coach in the eye,'' The Post 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi College Benefactor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- Oseola McCarty, a onetime washwoman  
who earned widespread recognition after she donated her life 
savings to a Mississippi university, died Sunday. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Southern Mississippi officials said McCarty died  
of complications from liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who lived and worked most of her life in a small,  
wooden-frame Hattiesburg house, saved thousands of dollars she 
earned washing and ironing clothes for others. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned universal acclaim in July 1995 when the university  
announced McCarty had willed $150,000 of her life's savings to 
Southern Mississippi to provide scholarships for deserving, 
financially needy students. 
</P>
<P>
	In donating the $150,000, McCarty said she wanted to give others  
the chance to get an education she never had. She said she had 
dreamed of becoming a nurse, but had to drop out of elementary 
school in order to care for sick relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her life, her thrift and her generosity have inspired  
millions,'' said Southern Mississippi spokesman Bud Kirkpatrick, 
who had worked closely with McCarty in coordinating her personal 
appearances and media interviews since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Her life changed dramatically after her donation. The woman who  
had spent her entire life in Hattiesburg was honored by President 
Clinton, attracted international media attention and even wrote a 
book espousing her philosophy of simple living. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's gift, willed to the university in an irrevocable trust  
administered by the university Foundation, led to a matching 
fund-raising drive that had raised more than $330,000 at the time 
of her death. Donations to the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship 
Fund have already provided scholarships for nine students.

<HEADLINE> Utah's Hornacek Will Play This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Utah Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek will not return  
after next season, and says he would have quit already except the 
lockout-shortened 1999 season gave him a little time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just going to play one more year. That's it,'' Hornacek  
said Friday after being inducted in the Iowa State Hall of Fame. 
``I have played for a long time now, and my kids are getting old, 
and I miss a lot of their sports. It's just time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek, a free agent, still hasn't settled on a deal for the  
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing with Jeff and the Jazz organization is, he always  
was on his own timetable,'' said Kevin O'Connor, the team's vice 
president of basketball operations. ``It's his call. We're thrilled 
to have him as long as he wants to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek was drafted by the Phoenix Suns as a second-round pick  
in 1986, and joined the Jazz from the Philadelphia 76ers in 1994. 
He is seventh on the NBA's career list by shooting 42 percent from 
3-point range and is sixth in free throw percentage at 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old had knee surgery in July, but says he is healthy  
enough to play another two or three years if he wanted to.

<HEADLINE> Former Reagan Aides Criticize Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although former aides say it is overly  
dramatic, a new biography of Ronald Reagan says the former 
president was closer to death when he was shot in 1981 than the 
public was led to believe. 
</P>
<P>
	The former aides told NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday that  
Edmund Morris' account of events surrounding the shooting at a 
Washington hotel on March 30, 1981, contained details of which they 
were not aware. 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea of great drama was really not there as it was  
portrayed,'' said Edwin Meese, Reagan's attorney general. He said 
Reagan ``was still functioning, talking with us'' after being shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Said former advisor Lyn Nofziger, ``I did not get that  
impression that he was on death's bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' authorized biography, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald  
Reagan,'' is due in bookstores this week. Newsweek excerpts 10,000 
words of the book in its current issue, on newsstands today. An 
advance copy was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The book has generated controversy because Morris, frustrated  
after years of being unable to penetrate Reagan's murky persona, 
created a fictional character to help with the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview aired Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Morris said  
he feels he portrayed Reagan ``very, very objectively,'' despite 
having a difficult time pulling personal details and private 
thoughts from the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was truly one of the strangest men who's ever lived,''  
Morris said. ``Every person I interviewed, almost without 
exception, eventually would say, you know, I could never really 
figure him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that group included Nancy Reagan -- and himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy, many years later, admitted that she found parts of him  
mysterious, that she couldn't figure out either,'' Morris said. 
``He's still a mystery to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nofziger discussed the book alongside Meese, Reagan's spokesman  
Marlin Fitzwater and deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver. They and 
other former aides also disagreed with other characterizations in 
the book: that Reagan and his vice president, George Bush, didn't 
get along, that Reagan was ``an airhead'' whose attention waned 
during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	In large measure, Reagan up close looks about the same as he has  
looked to skillful biographers a little farther from the action: a 
man who knew what he believed and wanted, sold it to the people, 
and both for better and worse, ``was not interested in anyone 
else's dreams,'' as Morris puts it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm an open book,'' Reagan said simply when Morris  
tried to plumb his psychological depths. 
</P>
<P>
	The book unwraps an interview with Reagan just as he was about  
to leave office, when, in Morris' opinion, the president was 
exhausted and no longer thinking straight. Yet Reagan spoke with 
the same mix of resolve and callousness that endeared him to fans 
and infuriated critics for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Disdainful of Lyndon Johnson's old worry that a misstep could  
start a nuclear conflagration, Reagan exclaimed that a show of 
military force when needed came with the territory. ``That's part 
of what this job is all about!'' he said. ``How could he have sat 
there, living in fear that somehow he might trigger a war?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the homelessness that marred the economic growth of  
his decade, Reagan said dismissively that ``more than 40 percent of 
them are retarded, mentally deficient people'' who choose that way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan is presented as largely surefooted with Russian President  
Mikhail Gorbachev, despite a long-known episode of breathtaking 
spontaneity at the 1986 Reykjavik, Iceland, summit, when the 
leaders almost talked themselves into giving up nuclear weapons 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	A muddled Reagan is portrayed in the Iran-Contra matter. Morris  
attended a November 1986 session where aides prepared Reagan for a 
news conference where he attempted to explain away the unfolding 
controversy over the gambit to win the release of hostages with 
secret arms sales to Iran -- a news conference later rated a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prep session, Reagan stated the CIA was not involved.  
``Yes, sir, they were,'' Adm. John Poindexter corrected him. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reached no firm conclusions on Reagan's role in the  
illicit transfer of money to the Nicaraguan Contras from the arms 
sales, saying he suspects the president ``did authorize the 
transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of the laws he was 
subverting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes that when the Reagans decided in November 1994 to  
tell the public of the former president's recent diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease, family, friends and doctors impressed upon him 
the need to write the letter himself and in his own handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullen at first, then resigned, Morris said, Reagan shut himself  
in his study and penned the haunting note about ``the journey that 
will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris quotes Nancy Reagan as telling him her husband went  
downhill quickly after that letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan, caring for her husband in California, has so far  
declined comment on material leaked from the book. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Corning Unveils Optical Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- A single strand of optical fiber can handle  
5 million telephone conversations at once, or up to 320 billion 
bits of voice, video or Internet traffic each second. 
</P>
<P>
	In just 15 years, 120 million miles of fiber-optic cable have  
been installed worldwide. That much alone can handle more 
information than all the billions of miles of copper wiring laid 
down over the last century. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, the networks connecting phones and computers might use  
light from end to end in place of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	That dazzling Information Age notion inched closer to reality  
recently with Corning Inc.'s unveiling of two prototypes of a key 
component in this hyper-speed technology: the optical switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning, which invented optical fiber in 1970, said it will soon  
begin selling optical switches aimed at replacing electronic 
counterparts that slow down calls on high-capacity fiber-optic 
grids. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go to a full-blown, transparent optical network, there's a  
lot of things that have to happen ... and this is one step along 
that path,'' said Mark Thomas, an optical components analyst for 
RHK Inc. in South San Francisco, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A few dozen companies are jostling to make headway in the  
optical-switch market. A much bigger step will be creating the 
optical version of a more complex and general-purpose switching 
system known as the cross-connect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corning models are the latest in an emerging variety of  
switches known as reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers that 
operate more flexibly and reliably by working directly with light 
passing through optic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiber optics, coded electrical signals are turned into laser  
light pulses that travel great distances through ultra-pure glass 
fibers and then are converted back to electricity to power 
communications receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	When data has to be rerouted, say from a cross-country grid into  
a slower regional phone network, today's electronic switches must 
convert the laser signals into electricity, redirect them and then 
convert them back into light. Optical devices that divide and 
combine the light signals should perform far more cheaply and 
quickly, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning's products offer ``greater sophistication and high  
reliability,'' said James Frodsham, an optical networks marketing 
manager at Nortel in Ottawa, Canada. ``They are extending the 
vision of the all-optical network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aimed at both long-haul and metropolitan systems, the switches  
could begin to be installed as early as next year, said David 
Charlton, a manager in Corning's optical networking devices unit. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alternative technologies being explored by Corning  
and rivals like Lucent Technologies is the MEMS system -- 
microelectronic mechanical switches that use thousands of 
infinitesimal mirrors to direct light. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in western New York, Corning is the world's leading maker  
of optical fiber. Optical fiber and photonics components now 
account for half its sales.

<HEADLINE> Gore Maintains Campaign Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWANZEY, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he isn't  
changing strategies in his campaign for the 2000 Democratic 
presidential nomination, despite polls that show rival Bill Bradley 
gaining on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaking up sun and support from 300 or so folks at a pond-side  
picnic, Gore brushed off a question about the polls as if it were a 
fly buzzing around the apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I'm not taking any vote for granted,'' Gore  
told The Associated Press. ``This is going to be a hard, tough 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One picnic-goer, Randy Filiault of Keene, said his wife is a  
Gore supporter, but he hasn't made up his mind yet, in part because 
he's not convinced Gore is electable. Polls also show Gore trailing 
the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bradley and Gore have touched on the issues equally  
well, but Gore has to overcome the perception that he's 
unelectable. I think that perception has helped Bradley,'' Filiault 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his arrival, Gore joined in a volleyball game for a few  
minutes before launching into his campaign speech. 
</P>
<P>
	With his wife, Tipper, by his side, he sounded broad themes of  
``expanding the definition of human dignity'' by reaching out to 
people with disabilities and others who face discrimination because 
of their race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he listed some of his goals, including a higher minimum  
wage, smaller school class sizes, broader access to preschools and 
more organizational power to labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations, he said, should have less  
power over people's lives and medical needs. ``They don't have a 
right to play God,'' Gore said. ``These decisions ought to be made 
by doctors and nurses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Gore didn't talk about was Bradley. In the AP interview  
after his speech, Gore denied a report in Time magazine that his 
campaign is beginning to orchestrate attacks on the former New 
Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Gore's supporters have criticized Bradley's  
past support of school vouchers that would give parents tax money 
to use for private schools and his proposed policy that would allow 
declared homosexuals to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't said the first word about him. I haven't even  
mentioned his name,'' Gore said Sunday. ``I'm concentrating on 
presenting a positive vision.''

<HEADLINE> Pressure Changes Sides at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Pressure doesn't carry a passport. It  
has no nationality. It goes wherever it wants, whenever it wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two consecutive Ryder Cup meetings and the first two  
days of a third, pressure sat squarely on the Americans' shoulders, 
pressing down on their aspirations like a pinched nerve. And then 
without warning, in the blink of an eye, it decided to change sides 
and squeeze the competitive life out of somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side of the greatest final-day comeback in Ryder Cup  
history is the greatest collapse. Great enough that European 
captain Mark James resorted to gallows humor to try and paper over 
the hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad we couldn't have rung up a bomb scare to stop  
it,'' he said. ``At least we could have practiced then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took a stunning 8 1/2-3 1/2 win in the singles matches by the U.S.  
side to make the Europeans turn over the cup they brought over on 
the Concorde only a week ago. It was finalized when Spaniard Jose 
Maria Olazabal failed to answer the spectacular 45-putt that Justin 
Leonard rolled through the late-afternoon shadows on the 17th 
green. But in truth, the Euros lost their grip on the small gold 
chalice long before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Just about the stroke of high noon, within seconds of each  
other, Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland and Jarmo Sandelin of 
Sweden both missed putts inside 4 feet. Clarke's, which was for 
par, came at the third hole and put him 1-down to American stalwart 
Hal Sutton. Sandelin, playing just behind those two in the third 
match of the day, missed a birdie try at the second that left his 
match with Phil Mickelson all square. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Clark nor Sandelin ever recovered. Nor, as it turned  
out, did Europe. Just ahead of them, in the day's opening match, 
Tom Lehman birdied No. 4 to take a 1-up lead against Englishman Lee 
Westwood. Just behind them, Frenchman Jean Van de Velde bogeyed the 
first to go 1-down against Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the Americans had the Europeans right where they  
wanted them, trailing in every one of the early matches, Suddenly, 
U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw began materializing everywhere on the 
course, his walkie-talkie crackling, pumping up the troops with 
breathless updates. Suddenly, what began by looking like an 
impossible mission, no longer looked like even an improbable one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had been in the same position before. At Oak Hill  
in 1995, they needed to win five points from the singles to hold 
onto the cup and came up with only 4 1/2. Two years ago, at 
Valderrama, Spain, they needed nine and came up with eight. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Crenshaw tried to minimize the pressure by making  
sure the Americans didn't get ahead of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to win the first four matches,'' Mickelson said  
after drubbing Sandelin, 4 and 3. ``We not only did that, we won 
the first six and we dominated in them. That gave our side such 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two days in the team matches, the Europeans had played over  
their heads, ignoring the world rankings that labeled them 
prohibitive underdogs. But paired face to face, that became tougher 
to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 66 Andrew Coltart had to stare down No. 1 Tiger Woods. Van  
de Velde, No. 89, isn't even listed on the same page as No. 4 Davis 
Love. Swede Jesper Parnevik, who seemed invincible playing the team 
portion of the program alongside teen sensation Sergio Garcia, was 
giving away 13 places to his opponent, second-ranked David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	And it didn't help matters, either, when Parnevik glanced at the  
scoreboard just before teeing off and saw his teammates foundering 
in every match ahead of his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their momentum was definitely building,'' he said afterward.  
``You could tell that just by the first few matches. They just ran 
us over. When they get the first six matches, the whole place gets 
involved and sometimes that's all it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the ninth hole rolled around, Europeans held leads  
in five matches, but in only two was the margin larger than 1-up. 
Making matters even tougher, James had elected to use seven of his 
players in all eight matches the first two days. Fatigue didn't 
make cowards of any of them. But their play down the stretch left 
little doubt the clubs felt heavier, the holes looked smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit,'' said Parnevik, who was 5-down by the turn  
and eventually beaten 5 and 4, ``my focus was not what it was the 
first two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure will do that to a man. Sometimes an entire team.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Richardson Backs Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday  
he will recommend President Clinton sign a $288.9 billion defense 
bill, satisfied about resolving concerns over a new nuclear weapons 
agency and a department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last week overwhelmingly agreed to the changes, which  
came in response to months of allegations about Chinese espionage 
at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was in a defense bill that raises military  
pay and offers a 4.4 percent across-the-board increase in Pentagon 
spending, including more money for military housing and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, a private with two years of service would see  
his or her basic monthly pay increase from $1,076 to $1,128. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contains a sweetener provision that allows even  
higher increases -- up to 10.3 percent -- for mid-career officers the 
military particularly wants to retain. An officer who had reached 
the rank of major in 10 years, for instance, could see his or her 
monthly basic pay increase to as much as $4,252. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that the troops get their pay raise and ... this  
is an important national security bill,'' Richardson said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can interpret the provisions so there are clear  
lines of responsibility and the secretary is in charge and we 
protect our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would set up a separate, semiautonomous agency  
within the Energy Department -- the National Nuclear Security 
Administration -- to oversee the government's nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization plan grows from months of controversy about  
lax security at the Energy Department and the alleged theft by 
China of nuclear warhead secrets from the labs, dating back 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents believe the new agency would streamline control over  
nuclear weapons programs and provide increased accountability for 
security and counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has argued that the new agency would be given too  
much autonomy and would interfere in security and 
counterintelligence improvements he already has made in response to 
Chinese espionage concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House on Thursday signaled a willingness to approve  
the bill after Clinton heard from key GOP senators and met with 
Richardson. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the time there had been 
no formal decision about signing the measure, but ``we're going to 
continue to work through this.'' That still was the case Sunday, 
the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of E. Timor Torture Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The device found Sunday in a military  
barracks was crude, but no doubt effective: two teaspoons attached 
with tape to a chunk of wood and two wires. One wire ran to an 
electrical plug, the other presumably to a torture victim. 
</P>
<P>
	As Indonesian troops depart East Timor and hand over control to  
the international peacekeepers who arrived Sept. 20, evidence of 
torture -- and executions -- is slowly mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of two men, who U.N. officials said apparently had  
been executed, were exhumed Saturday from graves in Tibar, a hamlet 
seven miles east of the capital Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, a headless body was found in a water well.  
Locals said 20 more bodies may also be inside. Nearby, in what 
residents said was a torture chamber, there were bloody trails 
where victims, still alive, were allegedly hung on meathooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The discoveries add weight to calls for the United Nations to  
send forensic specialists to investigate alleged atrocities in East 
Timor for a possible international criminal tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	But their task will be daunting. Officials in East Timor say  
evidence is being lost to decomposition and fires allegedly being 
set by departing Indonesian soldiers. There also have been 
unconfirmed reports of bodies dumped at sea and the limbs of other 
torture victims thrown into sewers to make identification 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed in East  
Timor in recent weeks as militiamen -- backed by elements of the 
Indonesian military -- rampaged through the territory in retribution 
for East Timorese voting overwhelmingly Aug. 30 for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has long been accused of human rights abuses in the  
half-island territory, particularly against pro-independence rebels 
and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence leaders claim torture, by electric shock and other  
means, was used frequently by Indonesian troops on suspected 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bodies that were exhumed Saturday before video cameras  
were found by international police officers and a doctor working 
for the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, which oversaw the 
ballot and was forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said Sunday that evidence  
suggested the men had been executed: one man had been stabbed 
upward through the chin, the other shot through the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need for an investigation by proper forensic experts who  
can examine the evidence we found is very urgent,'' Wimhurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff of the multinational force, said  
it does not have the capacity or the mandate to fully investigate 
reported atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	The head on the peacekeeping force, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove,  
said Sunday he has asked the commander of Indonesian forces in East 
Timor to hold soldiers suspected of war-crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the ones alleged to have been involved in some of the  
worst present crimes ... are on their way out of the province, and 
we've asked for those people to be investigated and if necessary 
held where they are at the moment, which I understand may be 
Kupang,'' in West Timor, Cosgrove told Australian television. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was hopeful action would be taken.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is world interest in these events ... it is in the great  
advantage of Indonesia and the Indonesian military to get to the 
bottom of these allegations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Cops Storm Prison, 7 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Seven people were killed and 19 injured in  
a seven-hour battle between left-wing inmates and guards at an 
Ankara prison on Sunday, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards at Ulucanlar prison were searching for weapons and trying  
to transfer some prisoners when the fighting began. Security forces 
fired tear gas at inmates and barricaded roads to the area. No 
other details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish police have little control over the country's  
overcrowded prisons and it is not uncommon for inmates to have 
weapons and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioting quickly spread to six other prisons across the country  
where left-wing inmates took at least 49 prison guards hostage, 
Anatolia reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ankara, security officers stormed the wards of Ulucanlar  
prison to transfer some left-wing inmates loyal to the 
Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front and the Turkish 
Workers Peasants Liberation Army to other prisons and search for 
weapons, Anatolia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates from radical political organizations often run their own  
wards, which they decorate with flags and political posters. They 
have long resisted attempts by prison officials to break up the 
wards by transferring inmates to other prisons where they would be 
put in smaller cells and unable to meet with their comrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, speaking to reporters before his  
departure on a visit to the United States, said the fighting began 
after authorities were informed that prisoners had dug a tunnel to 
escape from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, seven inmates were killed in an Istanbul prison in  
clashes between prisoners belonging to two competing underworld 
rings.

<HEADLINE> Bucs 13, Broncos 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The stage was set for another Denver  
fourth-quarter comeback, only this time there was no John Elway to 
lead it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's defense lived up to its ranking as the stingiest in  
the NFL, preying on Brian Griese's inexperience in the closing 
minutes to hold off the winless defending Super Bowl champions for 
a 13-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver became the first defending Super Bowl champion to begin a  
season with three straight losses in a non-strike year. The New 
York Giants started 0-5 in 1987 following a Super Bowl championship 
season, but three of those losses were with replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Alstott rushed for a career-high 131 yards and scored on a  
28-yard run in the first quarter for the Buccaneers. But in the 
end, the league's No. 1 defense was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Terrell Davis failed to gain 100 yards for the third  
straight game, picking up 53 on 19 carries, and Griese failed to 
lead the Broncos to a first down on two possessions in the final 
4:08. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs (2-1) intercepted Elway's successor once, setting up  
one of Martin Gramatica's two field goals, and the Denver 
quarterback was sacked twice on the last two drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent Dilfer bounced back from poor performances in Tampa Bay's  
first two games to complete 15 of 18 passes for 135 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos had seven sacks after not having any in losses to  
Miami and Kansas City, but the Bucs controlled the ball for 14 more 
minutes than Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay ground out yards with Alstott and Warrick Dunn, and  
Dilfer didn't make any major mistakes after throwing five 
interceptions and losing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown 
in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs never tested the Broncos downfield, but made good use  
of high-percentage passes to set up Alstott's touchdown run and two 
field goals in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer was 10-of-11 in the first two quarters, although his  
longest completion was a 16-yarder to Dunn on a third-down swing 
pass that the running back turned into a big gainer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, meanwhile, continued to struggle on offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the NFL's most productive runner over the last two years,  
has failed to gain 100 yards in three straight games for the first 
time since the last two weeks of the 1997 regular season and the 
opener in 1998 . 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only touchdown came after Tampa Bay's Jacquez Green  
mishandled a punt that bounced through his hands and legs and Chris 
Watson recovered at the Bucs' 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays later, Griese threw a 12-yard TD pass to Ed McCaffrey  
to make it 7-7 late in the first quarter. The Broncos didn't 
seriously threaten again until Jason Elam kicked a 44-yard field 
goal less than a minute into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese was 14-of-28 for 132 yards. His scoring pass to McCaffrey  
was the first TD off the Tampa Bay defense in 13 quarters, a streak 
that began in the last game of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Tells GOP to Nominate Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, under fire from other  
Republicans for his views on America's entry into World War II, 
says ``braying donkeys of interventionism'' in both parties are 
leading the country along a dangerous path. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States should apologize to Russia for the  
``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into eastern Europe, which he 
said the United States promised before the Soviet Union abandoned 
the East European states of the Soviet bloc not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told the Russians ... if they would get completely from  
eastern Europe, we would not extend NATO there, and then we did 
it,'' Buchanan said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``How do you think they 
feel? They've lost the Cold War. We're rubbing their nose in their 
defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the West is making the same mistakes in Europe that he  
wrote about in a new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are repeating the errors that led to World War II, and for  
heaven's sake, stop it before World War III,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book entered the national political debate last week  
because of its questions about the U.S. entry into the war against 
Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Hitler's Third Reich was no threat to the United States  
after 1940, and Allied guarantees to Poland brought war to the 
continent and gave the Soviet Union's communist government two 
extra years to prepare for Germany's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rivals Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Steve  
Forbes have questioned Buchanan's writings in highly critical 
terms. McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's departure 
from the party, as he appears certain to do in order to campaign 
for the Reform Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runner George W. Bush said in an interview Friday with The  
Associated Press that he wants Buchanan to remain Republican, 
although he disagreed with his opinion that the German threat to 
the United States ended after Hitler lost the Battle of Britain in 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Buchanan said he needs at least three more weeks  
before deciding whether to leave the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a candidate for the Republican nomination, but I'm  
clearly thinking about going for the Reform Party nomination,'' 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the Republicans could keep him in the fold, Buchanan  
said with a laugh: ``They could offer me the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A leading GOP senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said  
Sunday on the same Fox program that the Republicans are paying too 
much attention to Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we ignored Pat, that would be the best course,''  
Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the book, which he described on CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' as ``a boring, scholarly work on foreign policy,'' was 
meant to sound an alarm to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem with both (parties) -- especially the Republicans --  
is these braying donkeys of interventionism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reduce our commitments to fight in all these  
ridiculous little places around the world. We need to rebuild the 
military to where it was when Ronald Reagan had it,'' he said on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he said, ``we need to let nations know clearly, if you  
fool with the United States, you have had it.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Prevents Flu Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An inhaled prescription drug being  
introduced next month is nearly 80 percent effective in keeping 
family members from getting the flu bug when a relative brings it 
home, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, called Relenza, is a powder spray inhaled through  
the mouth that has already been proven to reduce the duration of a 
bout of flu by a day or two. The study released Sunday shows it 
also cuts the chances of catching the flu from an ill relative by 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is the first of a new class of anti-viral medicines  
that are effective against both major strains of the disease, known 
as influenza A and B. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are a major step forward,'' said Dr. Frederick  
Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. ``The 
latest data show that they clearly work for prevention, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved in July by the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration and is made by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. The company says 
the drug will be on drugstore shelves Friday. The wholesale cost 
for enough to treat one bout of flu will be $37. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden presented the latest data at a meeting of the American  
Society of Microbiology, as well as a report on another drug that 
is the first to shorten a bout of the common cold. Glaxo Wellcome 
paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the  
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is the best 
way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help when 
people fail to get the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, youngsters bring home the flu to their parents and  
siblings from school and day care. The latest experiment was 
intended to see if family members could be protected by taking 
Relenza at the first sign of flu in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 975 families with school-age children volunteered to  
participate in the study. Between December and March, 337 of these 
families had a case of flu. The sick person and the rest of the 
family were randomly assigned to get either the drug or a 
look-alike dummy spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 4 percent of the folks in the families getting Relenza  
came down with the flu, compared with 19 percent in the untreated 
comparison families. Even when they did get sick, their disease 
appeared to be far milder. Flu in the Relenza-treated family 
members typically lasted three days, compared with about six days 
in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important aspect of the drug that could reduce the  
burden of influenza,'' said Dr. William Craig of the University of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza will be the first of a new class of flu medicines known  
as neuraminidase inhibitors to reach the market. However, 
Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, a similar medicine in pill form, is 
expected to be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to these medicines is that they must be started  
within the first day or two of symptoms to have any effect on the 
disease. Most people don't call their doctor at the first twinge of 
flu's body ache, and they probably could not get an instant 
appointment, even if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said drug companies will have to convince both physicians  
and patients to look at flu differently, now that medicines are 
available to both treat the disease and prevent it. For instance, 
he said doctors may eventually become willing to prescribe the 
drugs over the phone without seeing patients if they report typical 
flu miseries during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report to the conference Sunday, Hayden described the  
results of a study of pleconaril, an experimental medicine for the 
common cold. The medicine was developed by Viropharma Inc. of 
Exton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested it on 1,024 people and found that it shortened  
the length of a typical moderate-to-severe cold from 14 days to 
10 1/2. They looked at various measures of a cold's severity, 
including the number of tissues used. Their count: Pleconaril 
reduced the number of tissues needed by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Joe Serves Up Good Humor, Ice Cream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The ice-cream truck rolls around the  
corner, bells clanging as the driver yanks a tattered rope. A dog 
sits bolt upright on a stoop. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer's canine treat is here -- a cup of vanilla from Joe  
Villardi's Good Humor truck. The silver-haired man everyone calls 
Joe is working his route, stopping by homes, gas stations, 
factories where he knows his clients by first name. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a route he has followed for 46 years, a long trail of  
sticky, satisfied customers in this town about 30 miles north of 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	As his truck whizzes down a slope, a young woman yells: ``Joe,  
wait!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He backs up: ``Yes, honey?''  
</P>
<P>
	At an auto repair place, he's greeted: ``Hey, Joe!''  
</P>
<P>
	He booms back: ``Yes, Pete!''  
</P>
<P>
	When his truck rolls into the town's industrial zone, Joe turns  
to a louder electric bell to pull workers from their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	At a nearby gas station, he announces: ``Ice cream!''  
</P>
<P>
	From under a car: ``Yes!'' And tools drop.  
</P>
<P>
	All over White Plains, customers cluster on sidewalks, waiting  
for Joe. 
</P>
<P>
	Villardi, dressed in a T-shirt and white cotton pants with  
suspenders, is lord of his rickety truck. He has served ice cream 
and pop to four generations, starting with a pushcart at Yankee 
Stadium in 1946. He's apparently the longest-working Good Humor man 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Black letters announce ``G.H. Joe'' on his white 1988 Grumman  
truck, converted from an old telephone service vehicle. Every 
morning, Joe hoses it down before picking up the day's supplies. 
About 11 a.m., he begins the daily ritual that -- unless it rains -- 
continues late into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	About a hundred stops a day, he sticks out his head to ask:  
``What are we going to have, honey?'' Then he dips into the 
freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, it was raspberry and orange fruit sticks. Now,  
it's Mega Warheads, sour sherbet with tart candy inside, and 
chocolate-covered Soft Caramel Magnums and Power Rangers Lost 
Galaxies. He also offers soda, candy, sunflower seeds -- and lessons 
in kindness. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I didn't say 'thank you,''' says Jennifer Anasta, 9.  
``But then I heard him say it. So now I think it's proper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who lives with an oxygen tank posts a sign outside her  
house when she wants a treat, which Joe delivers to her door. For 
diabetics, he special-orders sugar-free ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows how many kids live in each house, and exactly what they  
want. He also can tell some what ice cream their grandparents liked 
as kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cotton-candy flavored ice on a stick, six twizzlers and canned  
tea,'' he recites, the regular order of a woman he greets with a 
``Hi, Mommy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a nearby tree-lined street, three little girls wave from the  
window, then come running. 
</P>
<P>
	Another regular is hardly a kid. At the appointed hour,  
91-year-old Etelvina Perdidao sits on her porch. She always gets 
Strawberry Shortcake ice cream, and she refuses to eat the 
supermarket kind, even if it's Good Humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes home all soggy. This is fresh,'' says ``Grandma,'' as  
Joe calls her. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is, it all comes from the same Good Humor company,  
started in 1920 in Youngstown, Ohio, at the Burt family ice-cream 
parlor. They patented the first ice cream on a stick, the Good 
Humor Sucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Now based in Green Bay, Wis., Good Humor disenfranchised its  
1,500 vending trucks in 1976, when drivers had to begin leasing or 
buying their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe operates one of three such private businesses on wheels in  
the White Plains area. He keeps his prices low, $1.75 tops for the 
Magnum, and if kids don't have enough change he let's them pay 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
	(Just for the record, he posts a sign inside his truck: ``Sorry  
No Credit!! Pay now -- Eat later!'') 
</P>
<P>
	Joe works his route from April 1 'til mid-October. The rest of  
the time, he hangs out with friends, goes fishing and vacations in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He has his special pride.  
</P>
<P>
	He won't tell his age, saying only that he's a Korean War  
veteran, and citing the ever-young Jack Benny, ``I'm 39 years 
old.'' And he won't divulge his income, saying only that he makes 
``an average living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nickel-and-dime route,'' he says, ``and you earn every  
penny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the curse, all the pennies. He takes home as much as  
$40 worth each week. But it gives him an edge on the competition. 
One of the other Good Humor vendors refuses pennies. 
</P>
<P>
	Street by street, home by home, person by person, Joe has become  
a community institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Stopped at a red light, he waves to the driver in the next lane,  
explaining, ``Here's another one who had diapers on when I first 
served him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another longtime client is June Heinzinger, a kid in the  
projects when she first bought from Joe 45 years ago. Now 53, she 
makes a living caring for children, walking them to Joe's truck on 
a sunny afternoon for their Smiley and Snoopy bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is community,'' she says. ``He's loyal to us, and we're  
loyal to him.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Mulls Dull Play Vs. Memphis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee is used to being booed on the  
road. What prompted fans to jeer the defending national champions 
during homecoming? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have booed, too. It was awful,'' Volunteers coach Phillip  
Fulmer said after Tennessee had to mount a 78-yard drive in the 
closing minutes to beat Memphis 17-16 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got too many good players on the field to be looking  
like we're looking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the performance, Tennessee (2-1) remained at No. 7 in  
this week's rankings by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols' defense and special teams, and a last-minute flourish  
by their offense, quieted 107,000 discontented fans at Neyland 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Parker had a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown, the first  
for the Vols since 1996. And freshman kicker Alex Walls, in his 
first start, kicked a 37-yard field goal and the extra point that 
won the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikki Allen intercepted Travis Anglin's pass in the end zone to  
stop one drive in the second quarter. And Memphis got only a field 
goal late in the fourth quarter after moving to first-and-goal at 
Tennessee's 6-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our defense would let us lose,'' Fulmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three years after upsetting Tennessee, Memphis (1-3) almost did  
it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan White kicked field goals of 32, 34 and 21 yards. And  
quarterback Neil Suber was 9-for-23 for a season-high 222 yards, 
including an 82-yard touchdown pass to Ken Coutain. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tennessee's Jamal Lewis rushed for only 45 yards on  
16 carries, and Tee Martin was only 15-for-28 for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin hit Cedrick Wilson with a 15-yard touchdown pass with  
a minute to play, setting up Walls' chip-shot for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have won that game in 1996 with mirrors,'' Memphis  
coach Rip Scherer said. ``In this one, we were as competitive as 
we've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An interception by free safety Fred Powell led to a field goal  
that put Memphis up 16-10 with three minutes to play. But Powell 
got beat by Wilson at the end for Tennessee's game-winning 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was heartbreaking,'' Powell said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee managed only two first downs and 49 yards of offense  
in the first half as Memphis controlled the ball for 17 1/2 minutes. 
The second half was only slightly better for the Vols, outgained 
290-216 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer said Tennessee's offense hasn't really been ``in sync''  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some work to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A bright spot was the Vols' final drive of the game. Martin was  
4-for-4, including a 53-yard strike to Bobby Graham, who raced to 
the Memphis 6-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tee and I told the offensive line if you give us time, we can  
make the play,'' Graham said. ``Tee made the perfect throw, high 
over the linebacker, and I made the catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays later Martin found Wilson, a Memphis native, for his  
third catch of the drive and the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hat's off to Tennessee,'' Scherer said. ``I have tremendous  
respect for Tee Martin. He made the plays when you need them.''

	Buchanan Tells GOP To Nominate Him  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan relented not an inch today on  
foreign policy views criticized by fellow Republican presidential 
hopefuls and made a modest proposal for the GOP to end his 
dalliance with the Reform Party: nominate him. At the same time, 
Buchanan chastised members of both parties -- ``especially the 
Republicans'' -- for being ``braying donkeys of interventionism.'' 
He said the United States should apologize to Russia for the 
``double-cross'' of expanding NATO into central Europe.

	Ten Missing in Hawaii Plane Crash  
</P>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The wreckage of a sightseeing  
airplane missing overnight with 10 people on board was spotted 
today on a nearly inaccessible spot on Mauna Loa Volcano. Searchers 
flying over the area found the debris at an elevation of about 
10,000-foot on the mountainside, said Marilyn Kali, a spokeswoman 
for the state Department of Transportation. They did not see any 
immediate indication of whether there were any survivors. The plane 
had taken off yesterday afternoon for a tour of the island's 
inactive volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea.

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- As Indonesian troops depart East Timor  
and hand over control to the international peacekeepers who arrived 
Sept. 20, evidence of torture and executions is slowly mounting. 
The bodies of two men, who U.N. officials said apparently had been 
executed, were exhumed yesterday from graves in Tibar, seven miles 
east of the capital Dili. Earlier in the week, a headless body was 
found in a water well. Locals said 20 more bodies may also be 
inside. The discoveries add weight to calls for the United Nations

militants in the breakaway republic. Russian Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev said today that he could not rule out the possibility of 
launching ground operations in the breakaway republic. Up to now, 
the military has seemed to favor an air war that would keep Russian 
casualties to a minimum.

cheered by the improbable survival of Sun Chi-kwang, 20, and Sun

	Tough Wall Street Week Expected

	NEW YORK (AP) -- While some investors are likely to view the  
battered market as a fine place for bargain-hunting, many market 
analysts expect another rough week on Wall Street starting 
tomorrow. Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell a total 
of 524.30 points. The plunge left the Dow 9.2 percent below its 
record close set Aug. 25. Still, analysts see one potential benefit 
from last week's sharp selloff. They feel the market's decline 
could convince the Fed that an interest rate increase isn't 
necessary.

<HEADLINE> Quayle To Drop Out of GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, unable to  
keep pace with George W. Bush's fund-raising juggernaut, has 
decided to drop out of the 2000 presidential race, The Associated 
Press learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle will announce his intentions at a news conference Monday  
in Phoenix, Arizona, said a senior campaign official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said Quayle decided to drop out this weekend, after  
consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and campaign manager Kyle 
McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The braintrust determined that Quayle could not raise enough  
money to compete deep into the primary season, even if he fared 
well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the two-term Texas governor, has raised more than $50  
million -- five times his nearest challenger. Quayle has been 
running a debt since early in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is the fourth Republican to depart the race, leaving Bush  
and seven others. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire dropped out of 
the GOP primary contest earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan is  
considering running for the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their campaign finance statements that will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quayle source said the former vice president has no regrets  
about his campaign, and leaves buoyed by a recent national poll 
that showed him with 9 percent of the vote -- a distant second to 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, however, has been unable to break out of the second-tier  
of candidates in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is still convinced he could fare well -- even win -- the  
New Hampshire primary. But even so, the concentrated primary 
calendar would give him little time to raise enough money to 
capitalize on a strong showing, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to realize that the primary calendar and Bush's huge  
bank account were two obstacles that he would never be able to 
surmount. And, the source said, Quayle thought it would be wrong to 
ask supporters to donate money to a campaign that couldn't go all 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle entered the race on April 14 in his hometown of  
Huntington, Ind., saying he wanted to rebuild American values after 
``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 1992, the 
former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of political 
gaffes and controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and 
I'm still here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme in his announcement 
speech, betting that primary voters will reward him for casting a 
spotlight on the family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle pitched a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut, billing it  
as a boon to middle-income families. He also portrayed himself as 
the best qualified potential commander-in-chief, recalling his 
participation in White House war councils. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president was always considered a long shot for  
the nomination despite his popularity among grass-roots activists 
and his strong organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he 
misspelled the word in a classroom full of school children. That 
and other miscues turned the vice president into a punch line for 
countless jokes, cementing for many American the perception that 
Quayle was ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies prove his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Television talk show host Jerry Springer,  
called the ``ringmaster'' for his raucous show known for its 
on-stage brawls, says he won't rule out a return to the political 
ring.

DeWine in 2000, but declined, saying he had committed his time to 
the show. 
</P>

Friday during a voter registration rally. But he added: ``I can't

<HEADLINE> Ullrich Wins Tour of Spain Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Germany's Jan Ullrich won the Tour of Spain  
cycling race Sunday, with Spaniards finishing second and third. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich, the 1997 Tour de France champion, won the 21-stage  
Spanish race over a total of 2,232 miles with a time of 89 hours, 
52 minutes, 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	His nearest rival, Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano, was 4:15 back and  
1:42 ahead of Roberto Heras. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich took control of the race in the 12th stage when he  
replaced defending champion Abraham Olano of Spain as the leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory appeared assured after he held off his rivals in the  
final two mountain stages Thursday and Friday, despite showing 
signs of fatigue. Ullrich then won Saturday's time-trial, clinching 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the time-trial I couldn't relax, my lead was minimal,''  
Ullrich said. ``But now I can feel good and show it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he rode the 101-mile final stage that started and  
finished in Madrid, traditionally a ceremonial leg, in a relaxed 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The leg was won by Jeroen Blijevens of The Netherlands in  
4:06:23.

<HEADLINE> System Made To Deodorize Hog Waste / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- A Southern Illinois University  
researcher says he has developed a system to quickly strip the odor 
from hog waste and produce high-grade fertilizer and surplus energy 
to boot. 
</P>
<P>
	The system makes use of the bacteria naturally present in manure  
and is among the ideas being pursued by researchers as Illinois hog 
farms continue to grow in size and become less remote. 
</P>
<P>
	But engineering professor Jim Blackburn said what sets his idea  
apart is its economic potential -- a plus for pork producers 
struggling with a severe slump in prices for their meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers would potentially have to buy less fertilizer and energy  
if the system works as well as lab tests indicate it will. Hot 
water heat produced during the treatment process could be used 
instead of electricity or gas to heat animal nurseries and 
containment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm trials are scheduled to begin early next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting waste treatment in a category where it's  
profitable,'' Blackburn said. ``Farmers could actually make money 
from treating their waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system involves a closed pit, an air blower and an air  
scrubber to recover offensive ammonia odors. A farmer who produces 
5,000 hogs a year would have an initial investment of about 
$50,000. The process would begin turning a profit for small farmers 
in four years or less. Large farms could see profits after only one 
year, Blackburn estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that research like this is getting done. It may  
not be the answer, but it may be a step in the right direction,'' 
said Mark Gebben, a Clark County hog producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the total number of hogs produced in the state has  
actually declined in the last 10 years, according to the Illinois 
Agricultural Statistics Service, pork production has become more 
concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, with urban sprawl and the increasing population of rural  
areas, farms have many more nearby noses to offend. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady stream of complaints has plagued pork producers over  
the last few years, prompting legislation to more tightly control 
hog farms and a pledge by pork producers to be more environmentally 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most hog waste is broken down in open lagoons by  
bacteria that do not require oxygen. That process results in the 
kind of severe odors that prompted the Illinois attorney general 
last month to sue a Henderson County hog farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburn's idea involves using bacteria that break down manure  
in the presence of oxygen. Such techniques have long been known to 
scientists, but Blackburn said he found a way to more effectively 
mix oxygen into the waste, resulting in quicker odor reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory tests show that in less than a day, the system can  
reduce gag-inducing odors to a mild scent similar to grain, 
Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers have pledged $2.3 million to odor research, said  
Tim Maiers, a spokesman for the Illinois Pork Producers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to the industry,'' he said. ``A solution  
to the odor problem could help pork producers remain a viable 
business here.''

<HEADLINE> Three Die in Double Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- Three people died in an apparent double  
murder-suicide when the head of the Catholic schools in western 
Montana shot his estranged wife and her boyfriend and then turned 
the gun on himself, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary investigations show that Tim Sullivan, 58, interim  
superintendent of schools for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena, 
fired the fatal shots Saturday night, said Deputy Coroner Brad 
Giffin. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two victims are Kathy Sullivan, 50, and Scott  
Bardsley, in his late 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor reported the shooting after hearing gunshots around  
8:45 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Giffin said it appears that Sullivan surprised his wife and  
Bardsley while they were in the living room of a small manufactured 
home in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
	All three bodies were found in the living room.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sullivan received a restraining order against Sullivan in  
August and the order was still current, said Capt. John Walsh of 
the Butte-Silver Bow County sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan had served as head of the Catholic schools in western  
Montana for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan also had worked for 32 years in the Butte public  
schools as a teacher, coach and curriculum director before retiring 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sullivan and Bardsley were also educators.

<HEADLINE> Neanderthals May Have Been Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Contrary to their slow-witted and even  
sickly image, Neanderthals were surprisingly robust, according to a 
two-year study of prehistoric bones discovered 100 years ago in 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their bones were as healthy as (those of) modern humans,''  
said University of Pennsylvania radiology professor Dr. Morrie 
Kricun, a bone specialist who studied the X-rays of 874 Neanderthal 
bones that came from more than 75 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals -- ancient hominids replaced by modern humans about  
30,000 years ago -- suffered from age-related osteoarthritis and 
back problems but were not disease-ridden, Kricun said Sept. 20. 
Earlier studies had suggested that Neanderthals may have died out 
because of dietary deficiencies or other health problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not suffer from any inflammatory arthritis,  
inflammatory diseases of the spine, malignant tumors, metabolic or 
endocrine disorders,'' said Kricun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, there was arthritis in some of the joints, some bone  
fractures that healed very nicely and a benign bone tumor in a rib 
of one of the individuals. But they were a healthy group based on 
their bones,'' Kricun said 
</P>
<P>
	Named for the Neander Valley in Germany where their remains were  
first found, Neanderthals lived in Europe, Africa, and the Near 
East between about 130,000 years ago and about 30,000 years ago. 
Scientists disagree whether they were the ancestor of modern humans 
or a related but different species. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were released by the University of Pennsylvania  
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology one century after the bones 
were found in a cave in Krapina, Croatia. The X-rays were taken by 
researchers at the University of Zagreb in Croatia in 1989 and 
1997, when they were sent to the museum for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason researchers had theorized that Neanderthals vanished  
because of starvation and disease is the tiny lines often found in 
the enamel of their teeth, which suggested that all of the body's 
resources were being diverted toward healing, said Dr. Alan Mann, a 
museum curator and Penn anthropology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots and lots of modern human children have these lines,'' he  
said. ``They can come from measles or fever, which doesn't mean the 
child is dying but that the body is fighting an infection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann pointed out, however, that the remains studied were from  
130,000 years ago -- early in the Neanderthals' existence, when food 
might have been more plentiful and the climate more hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Janet Monge, keeper of the museum's physical anthropology  
collection and a professor at Bryn Mawr College, said the findings 
came as ``a real shock.'' Researchers were looking to simply

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Expects Tough Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last week, stocks tumbled under a staggering  
weight of bad news. The dollar was declining. A handful of 
companies said their profits were in trouble. And Microsoft's 
president deflated enthusiasm for beloved technology stocks, even 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	This coming week, none of that bad news is likely to improve.  
While some investors are likely to view the battered market as a 
fine place for bargain-hunting, many market analysts expect another 
rough week on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell a total of  
524.30 points, tumbling more than 200 points in two separate 
sessions. The plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, or 9.2 percent, 
below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also fared poorly. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which lists most of the world's leading technology 
companies, lost 129.21 points over the course of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The tumble surprised few Wall Street analysts. In recent weeks,  
even as the Dow and the Nasdaq hit new records, many market 
watchers remained troubled about signs of ill health in the market. 
Above all, analysts worried that the strong performance of the 
Dow's blue-chip stocks and technology leaders like Intel and 
Microsoft wasn't shared by the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the market lost its last bastion of strength.  
Semiconductor stocks tumbled Wednesday, a day after an earthquake 
hit Taiwan, a major production center for the chips and components 
used in computers. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Thursday, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer sent the  
market spinning by telling reporters he believes technology stocks 
are too pricey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' he said at a conference of the Society of American 
Business Editors and Writers. ``I would put our company and I would 
put most companies in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic factors that drove stocks lower last week haven't  
disappeared. The dollar lingers near its lowest levels against 
Japan's yen since 1996. Investors also remain worried that the 
Federal Reserve at its Oct. 5 meeting will raise interest rates for 
the third time this year to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate  
profits as borrowing costs escalate. That can make bonds, with 
their guaranteed rate of return, more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar could be another menace. Some of the worst market  
declines in history have come in October, from the 1929 crash that 
launched the Great Depression to the 554.26-point drop on Oct. 27, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary time of year,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief  
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co in Kansas City. ``By 
September or October, you know where a company's fundamentals are 
for the year, and a lot of investment managers make their buy and 
sell decisions based on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts see at least two potential benefits from last  
week's sharp selloff. Some economists feel the market's decline 
could convince the Fed that an interest rate increase isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past week's stock market slide has virtually ensured the  
Fed will not move in the direction of another rate hike,'' said 
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has voiced concern over the lofty  
levels of the stock market, and said last month that the Fed would 
keep an eye on the market. Last week's selloff, some analysts 
reason, could convince the Fed that the stock market, at least, has 
not reached inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors could seize the chance to buy stocks at their  
new, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an overdue opportunity to shake out some of the  
market's excesses,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist 
at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York. ``There will be a point for some 
good buying opportunities. It's still a bull market.''

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Confirmed in Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A virus never before seen in the Western  
Hemisphere caused at least one of the deaths in New York City 
attributed to St. Louis encephalitis, the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the CDC, said that  
scientists there finished analyzing DNA late Friday from a tissue 
sample from one of three New York City residents who have died of a 
mysterious mosquito-borne virus in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to identify West Nile-like virus,'' she said.  
``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have some 
more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the strain of 
West Nile or a new virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the  
United States was no cause for alarm, as the pesticide spraying now 
under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work against 
the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West  
Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region. They 
said scientists were checking to see if it was that virus, rather 
than St. Louis encephalitis, that had killed three New York City 
residents and sickened 15 others in New York City and in 
Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and  
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work ahead of us yet,'' she said. ``We're  
looking at some new samples from humans, and we've got work to do 
with birds and mosquitoes.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Courts Hispanic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Some Hispanic Democrats who met with  
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley on Sunday said he is better 
suited than Vice President Al Gore to face GOP front-runner George 
W. Bush in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always admired Bill Bradley,'' said Gus Garcia of Austin,  
one of two dozen Tejano Democrats who met with the former New 
Jersey senator at a San Antonio hotel for a question-and-answer 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not 'Is Gore a good guy?', but 'Who is best  
for the country?''' said Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley received the endorsement of retiring New York Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan last week. Asked why he preferred Bradley 
over Gore, Moynihan responded simply, ``Nothing is the matter with 
Gore, but he can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who served three terms as a New Jersey senator and  
spent time with Moynihan on the Senate Finance Committee, 
downplayed the endorsement, saying, ``I respect Senator Moynihan a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats and Republicans will ask when voting, 'Who do I  
trust?''' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia alluded to the fact that Gore's ties to the scandals of  
the Clinton administration hurt his chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton can walk his way through that,'' he said of the lame  
duck president. ``Gore cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A flier distributed by some Tejano Democrats also centered on  
who is best to lead the fight for the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are both good men and good Democrats,'' the flier said.  
``Both have served America with distinction and honor. The question 
is not who is the better Democrat ... but instead, who is the 
better Democrat to defeat Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Bradley gaining on his rival. New polls in New  
Hampshire show Bradley in a dead heat with Gore. Gore holds big 
leads elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tejano Democrats plan to endorse a nominee in January, said  
Gonzalo Barrientos, chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's trip to San Antonio, the candidate's fourth to Texas,  
gave him another chance to court Hispanics.

<HEADLINE> Texas Readies for Undefeated Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- No more patsies for Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, coach Mack Brown wondered just how good his team was  
after the Longhorns struggled to defeat winless Rice 18-13. The No. 
15 Longhorns responded with a 62-0 beating of hapless Baylor in 
Waco on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown will find out quickly if either of those games was a  
fluke. Texas' next three opponents -- No. 13 Kansas State, No. 23 
Oklahoma and No. 6 Nebraska -- are all undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	The last three opponents for Texas (4-1 overall, 1-0 Big 12) are  
a combined 1-10. The Longhorns' only victory over a team with a 
winning record this season was a 69-17 rout of Stanford in the 
Cardinal's season opener. Stanford has since won three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Hodges Mitchell, who rushed for 131 yards and scored  
three touchdowns against Baylor, is confident Texas can beat better 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we play our best, we can beat any team in the country,''  
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory over Baylor (0-4, 0-2) was every bit as dominating  
as the win over Rice was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas recorded its first shutout since 1991 and handed Baylor  
its worst loss since a 77-0 blowout by the Longhorns in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated that the score got out of hand,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Major Applewhite was 26-for-37 for 333 yards and  
three touchdowns before leaving late in the third quarter. The 
Longhorns scored touchdowns on all eight drives that made it inside 
Baylor's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a perfect game,'' said wide receiver Kwame Cavil,  
who had eight catches for 97 yards. ``Nobody plays a perfect game, 
but this was a well-executed game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown can only hope his team is peaking as it heads into the  
heart of the Big 12 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the most complete game we've played in our two years  
at Texas,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Kansas State routed Texas 48-7 and held Heisman  
Trophy winner Ricky Williams to just 43 yards on 25 carries. The 
Longhorns rebounded from that loss to beat both Oklahoma and 
Nebraska. The 20-16 victory in Lincoln ended the Cornhuskers' 
47-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kansas State rallied to beat Iowa State 35-28, and  
Oklahoma and its record-setting passing attack rolled over 
Louisville 42-21. Nebraska easily beat Missouri 40-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, meanwhile, is struggling to find anything positive in  
its first season under new coach Kevin Steele. The Bears have been 
outscored 103-10 in their two conference games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose 13-10, it's gut-wrenching,'' Steele said. ``To  
lose this bad, that's tough to swallow.''

<HEADLINE> Nortel To Launch $100M Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nortel Networks, determined to claim its  
rightful place alongside Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies as 
one of the Internet's chief architects, is launching a $100 million 
sequel to its catchy ad campaign based on the Beatles' song ``Come 
Together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign starting Tuesday features celebrities such as  
Olympic gold medalist Michael Johnson, astronaut Buzz Aldrin and 
novelist Kurt Vonnegut responding to the question, ``What do you 
want the Internet to be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel, with annual revenues of $17.6 billion, is second only to  
Lucent in fiber-optic technology, a field that network equipment 
king Cisco is only now entering through an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, according to Nortel, about 75 percent all Internet  
traffic in North America travels over Nortel network equipment. And 
with telephone calls and television seemingly destined to converge 
over the Internet, fiber optics will only play an increasingly 
important role in carrying all that communications traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those observations are hardly overlooked on Wall Street, where  
Nortel's shares have are trading near their 52-week high of $50, 
closing Friday at $46.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ontario-based Nortel suffers from anonymity problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisco and Lucent have also spent heavily on advertising to  
ensure that unlike their high-tech network machinery, their names 
aren't invisible to the masses joining the Internet revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies, however, have enjoyed a decided advantage over  
Nortel. As one of the most successful stocks of the 1990s, Cisco is 
well known as the world's biggest supplier of the machinery used to 
build the Internet and other networks. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lucent, while only two years old, had the good fortune of  
its star pedigree, having descended from telecom pioneer Bell Labs 
before being spun off as an independent company by AT&AMP;T, perhaps 
the most widely held stock in America. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nortel, the first step in an aggressive branding effort that  
began earlier this year was changing the company's name from 
Northern Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the offbeat ``Come Together'' campaign, which was  
launched in February. Nortel says consumer awareness has improved 
by 10 percent since those commercials began running. But like many 
a beer commercial that has charmed TV audiences, the Nortel 
campaign has often proven more memorable than the brand name it was 
meant to bolster. 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign, which will begin with newspaper ads in major  
publications such as The Wall Street Journal, was designed by the 
company with Temerlin McClain Advertising and Fleishman-Hillard. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are expected to run through next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Other people appearing in Nortel's new ads and TV commercials  
include musician Curtis Mayfield and Nupur Lala, the recently 
crowned champ of the 1999 National Spelling Bee.

<HEADLINE> Neanderthals May Have Been Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Contrary to their slow-witted and even  
sickly image, Neanderthals were surprisingly robust, according to a 
two-year study of prehistoric bones discovered 100 years ago in 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their bones were as healthy as (those of) modern humans,''  
said University of Pennsylvania radiology professor Dr. Morrie 
Kricun, a bone specialist who studied the X-rays of 874 Neanderthal 
bones that came from more than 75 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals -- ancient hominids replaced by modern humans about  
30,000 years ago -- suffered from age-related osteoarthritis and 
back problems but were not disease-ridden, Kricun said Sept. 20. 
Earlier studies had suggested that Neanderthals may have died out 
because of dietary deficiencies or other health problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not suffer from any inflammatory arthritis,  
inflammatory diseases of the spine, malignant tumors, metabolic or 
endocrine disorders,'' said Kricun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, there was arthritis in some of the joints, some bone  
fractures that healed very nicely and a benign bone tumor in a rib 
of one of the individuals. But they were a healthy group based on 
their bones,'' Kricun said 
</P>
<P>
	Named for the Neander Valley in Germany where their remains were  
first found, Neanderthals lived in Europe, Africa, and the Near 
East between about 130,000 years ago and about 30,000 years ago. 
Scientists disagree whether they were the ancestor of modern humans 
or a related but different species. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were released by the University of Pennsylvania  
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology one century after the bones 
were found in a cave in Krapina, Croatia. The X-rays were taken by 
researchers at the University of Zagreb in Croatia in 1989 and 
1997, when they were sent to the museum for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason researchers had theorized that Neanderthals vanished  
because of starvation and disease is the tiny lines often found in 
the enamel of their teeth, which suggested that all of the body's 
resources were being diverted toward healing, said Dr. Alan Mann, a 
museum curator and Penn anthropology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots and lots of modern human children have these lines,'' he  
said. ``They can come from measles or fever, which doesn't mean the 
child is dying but that the body is fighting an infection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann pointed out, however, that the remains studied were from  
130,000 years ago -- early in the Neanderthals' existence, when food 
might have been more plentiful and the climate more hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Janet Monge, keeper of the museum's physical anthropology  
collection and a professor at Bryn Mawr College, said the findings 
came as ``a real shock.'' Researchers were looking to simply 
catalog the bones in a database when they noticed how healthy the 
remains appeared, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dogma that exists is that Neanderthals were struggling,  
inefficient in their environment, maladapted,'' she said. ``They're 
frequently portrayed negatively, but they were around for a long 
time in some very harsh conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their large brow ridges and sloping profiles,  
Neanderthals ``fulfill a stereotype we have of brutish people,'' 
Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect these brutish folk to have the same abilities  
as us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, experts who examined a 25,000-year-old  
child's skeleton in Portugal said it represented compelling 
evidence that humans as we know them evolved from mating between 
Neanderthals and anatomically modern man. 
</P>

Peninsula and that their hybrid offspring eventually evolved into 
what is recognized as modern man.

will be needed to substantiate his hypothesis.

	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The wreckage of a sightseeing  
airplane missing overnight with 10 people on board was spotted 
Sunday on a nearly inaccessible spot on Mauna Loa Volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers flying over the area found the debris at an elevation

<HEADLINE> Richardson Backs Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday  
he will recommend President Clinton sign a $288.9 billion defense 
bill, satisfied about resolving concerns over a new nuclear weapons 
agency and a department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last week overwhelmingly agreed to the changes, which  
came in response to months of allegations about Chinese espionage 
at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was in a defense bill that raises military  
pay and offers a 4.4 percent across-the-board increase in Pentagon 
spending, including more money for military housing and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that the troops get their pay raise and ... this  
is an important national security bill,'' Richardson said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can interpret the provisions so there are clear  
lines of responsibility and the secretary is in charge and we 
protect our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would set up a separate, semiautonomous agency  
within the Energy Department -- the National Nuclear Security 
Administration -- to oversee the government's nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization plan grows from months of controversy about  
lax security at the Energy Department and the alleged theft by 
China of nuclear warhead secrets from the labs, dating back 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents believe the new agency would streamline control over  
nuclear weapons programs and provide increased accountability for 
security and counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has argued that the new agency would be given too  
much autonomy and would interfere in security and 
counterintelligence improvements he already has made in response to 
Chinese espionage concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House on Thursday signaled a willingness to approve  
the bill after Clinton heard from key GOP senators and met with 
Richardson. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the time there had been 
no formal decision about signing the measure, but ``we're going to 
continue to work through this.'' That still was the case Sunday, 
the White House said.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler was  
helped off the field with an apparent re-occurrence of a hamstring 
injury during the second quarter of Sunday's game against the St. 
Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was injured without contact with 3:13 to go and the  
Falcons trailing 28-0. After making a couple of pump fakes and 
scrambling, he crumpled to the turf.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comedian Margaret Cho says she doesn't mind if  
successful women can't have it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want it all,'' Cho told TV Guide for the Oct. 2 issue.  
``I don't want kids and a family or to see the same boyfriend every 
day for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho is currently touring the country in her one-woman show,  
``I'm the One That I Want,'' an autobiographical account of her 
turbulent experiences in show business. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she never worried about her appearance until she landed  
her 1994 ABC sitcom, ``All-American Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the network told me, 'We have a problem with the fullness  
of your face,''' she says. ``It's not really a body part you can 
easily minimize. I really don't know how I managed to hold my head 
up after that.''

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Television talk show host Jerry Springer,  
called the ``ringmaster'' for his raucous show known for its 
on-stage brawls, says he won't rule out a return to the political 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cincinnati mayor says politics is his passion and  
it's likely he'll return to the city one day to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	He had considered a challenge to Republican U.S. Sen. Mike  
DeWine in 2000, but declined, saying he had committed his time to 
the show. 
</P>

	``Trust me, I really thought about doing it,'' Springer said  
Friday during a voter registration rally. But he added: ``I can't 
imagine doing the show while in the Senate.''

<P>
	PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) -- Six people were killed and at least a  
dozen more injured in a series of collisions between semitrailers 
and cars blamed on a dust storm that blew across a desert stretch 
of Interstate 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility was reduced to near zero in the wheat and sagebrush  
country 175 miles east of Portland where the accidents occurred 
Saturday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One crash on the eastbound lane involved five semitrailers and  
11 vehicles and claimed four lives, said Lt. Gregg Hastings, an 
Oregon State Police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Department of Transportation said two other crashes  
in the westbound lane, each involving semitrailers and passenger 
vehicles, killed one person each. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway was closed for most of the day in both directions  
after the Saturday morning accidents, backing up traffic for miles 
and forcing lengthy detours through Walla Walla, Wash. The 
westbound lanes were reopened by evening. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colombia Frees Peso to Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- With a multibillion-dollar International  
Monetary Fund loan deal in pocket, Colombia's government decided 
over the weekend to succumb to market forces and let the nation's 
currency trade freely against the U.S dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The move followed a week of fierce speculation against the peso,  
which over the last twelve months lost nearly 30 percent of its 
value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	It also comes as President Andres Pastrana's government seeks to  
chart a recovery course from Colombia's worst recession since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``From today onwards the peso/dollar rate will be determined by  
market forces,'' Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo told 
reporters in announcing the decision late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week alone, the central bank was forced to sell $400  
million worth of currency to bolster the peso, which weakened 
anyway, closing on Friday at 1,994.49 against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an exchange band mechanism established in 1994, the  
central Bank of the Republic automatically entered currency markets 
to sell dollars in order to keep the peso within a predetermined 
trading range. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's abolition came a day after the announcement in  
Washington of a line of credit from the International Monetary Fund 
worth between $2 billion and $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit is part of an ambitious $7 billion government plan to  
promote economic recovery, combat the illegal drug trade and seek 
an end to Colombia's 35-year civil conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrepo, a member of the central bank's seven-man board of  
directors, said the IMF had not demanded the abolition of the 
exchange band as a condition for the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not yet spelled out terms of the IMF line of  
credit. Customarily, the international lending institution requires 
recipient nations to enact measures promoting economic austerity 
and adhering more closely to free-market forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian peso's decline in value has been blamed on a  
worsening civil conflict and a sagging economy, which has shrunk 
6.7 percent over the last year as unemployment climbed to 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists welcomed Saturday's decision, but said the move came  
too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``The band was a bad mechanism. Colombia should have dismantled  
it five months ago,'' Juan Jose Echevarria, the director of 
Fedesarollo -- a private economic think-tank -- told Radionet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists and business leaders agreed Sunday that the peso may  
weaken to around 2020 against the dollar before settling at around 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Central bank director Miguel Urrutia said Saturday that the  
reserve bank would still intervene in the market if the price of 
the dollar threatened the economy as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Senators See New Value in Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that he has discovered aerobic exercise,  
Charles Grassley has a new cause to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, the Iowa  
Republican has a Capitol Hill soapbox from which to advance it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Grassley is only at the hearing-holding stage now, he's  
looking for ways to make older Americans more active. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we can encourage seniors to exercise, we should,''  
said Grassley, 66. ``If I'm an older poster boy for exercise, I'll 
accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley held a committee hearing Sept. 14 on seniors and the  
benefits of exercise. The following morning, he ran in an annual 
three-mile race for members of the federal government and the 
media, the SGMA Capital Challenge, underwritten by the Sporting 
Goods Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The final tally showed Grassley placed second in the 60-plus  
team captains category, with a time of 27 minutes, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	But this places him first among 60-plus members of Congress who  
were team captains. That's not a formal category, but it's not a 
bad showing for a self-described nonathlete who only started 
running last fall. ``Under any circumstances, I would not have 
expected to have won anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Grassley disputes any implication that this category was a  
Washington-style narrow definition that manages to fit one senator. 
``I passed Lugar, Cochran and Slade Gorton,'' he said, referring to 
Senate colleagues Richard Lugar of Indiana, Thad Cochran of 
Mississippi and Gorton of Washington, all Republicans. ``And there 
were House members over 60 and federal agency heads over 60.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His standing in the race is an example of how hard work pays  
off, Grassley said. He started by running and walking less than a 
mile, and now runs two miles a day, every day he is in Washington 
and many of the days he is in Iowa, Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and other experts who testified at his committee  
hearing outlined reasons he and other older Americans should keep 
active. 
</P>
<P>
	People who are fit live longer, said Dr. Terrie Wetle, deputy  
director of the National Institute on Aging. One study found that 
unfit men ages 60 and over who became fit had death rates 50 
percent below those who remained unfit, she said. Another study 
found that physically active older people had twice the likelihood 
of sedentary counterparts of living the rest of their lives without 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes little if any equipment or staffing to help seniors  
improve, Wetle said. Studies have found activities such as walking 
or gardening for as little as 30 minutes a day on most days can 
make an aerobic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only good health but good policy results from encouraging  
seniors to be active, Dr. James F. Fries of Stanford University 
School of Medicine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Programs to keep seniors active would save the government about  
five times as much as they would cost in Medicare expenses, Fries 
said. And it would cost Medicare no more than $100 per person per 
year to do the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it would require a change in the law to make Medicare  
change its focus to prevention, because Medicare is now mandated 
primarily to pay for treatment. The researcher also called for more 
research to promote new methods to encourage activity among older 
people and for reviews to make sure the new methods work. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraging exercise is one goal of a new bill aimed at having  
Medicare's administrators focus more on prevention. However, the 
measure sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D.-Fla., and James Jeffords, 
R.-Vt., aims primarily at establishing such prevention benefits as 
screening for high blood pressure, glaucoma and osteoporosis, 
counseling for tobacco cessation, and hormone replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would cost about $5 billion over 10 years, but it  
would create savings that would more than cover the costs, Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the price tag could create a fight in Congress. Graham did  
not expect to push the program through this year. ``It's going to 
be an uphill fight for anything in the remaining weeks of the 
current Congress,'' he said. ``This may have a better chance when 
the Congress comes back after the new year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Grassley encourages exercise, he doesn't want the  
federal government to shoulder any new costs to pay for it. He 
wants health maintenance organizations to do it instead. HMOs 
already are increasing their wellness programs, and ``it doesn't 
cost the taxpayers any more because we aren't paying for it,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Britain's Labor Party Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair's  
governing Labor Party opened its weeklong annual conference Sunday 
in terrific shape -- at least on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2 1/2 years after a landslide election victory, Labor is at  
record highs in opinion polls with around 50 percent support, 
buoyed by an economy outperforming expectations and a 
still-enfeebled Conservative Party opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``No government has ever been this popular,'' Labor General  
Secretary Margaret McDonagh said before the opening of the 
convention, the last before the 100th anniversary in February of 
Labor's founding. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Britons actually vote -- and fewer are bothering to do  
so -- the picture is less rosy. Labor lost ground in a plethora of 
elections this year, including for new separate assemblies in 
Scotland and Wales, where nationalists benefited, and in European 
Parliament elections, where the Conservatives did best. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was a record low of 23 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the other picture -- a government whose actual vote in  
the ballot box is in free fall, and if the opposition were not so 
weak it would be heading for a convincing defeat,'' said Patrick 
Dunleavy, professor of government at the London School of 
Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	In two special parliamentary elections last week, Labor held off  
by only a few hundred votes a challenge by the independence-seeking 
Scottish National Party in Hamilton South, a traditional Labor 
stronghold. In Wigan, a blue-collar district in north England, 
Labor won as usual, but the turnout was just 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics are increasingly calling Blair dictatorial.  
</P>
<P>
	An ICM poll of 1,011 voters showed that 47 percent think he's  
become arrogant, The Observer newspaper reported. Fifty-two percent 
said he doesn't care enough about working-class voters. The margin 
of error was 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the conservative Tories are weak, mired some 20 points  
behind Labor, and Britain's third-largest party, the Liberal 
Democrats, appears stuck at about 15 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front, Labor has outdone the Tories in curbing  
state spending. As a proportion of gross national product, state 
spending is running at 39.4 percent -- compared with 41-43 percent 
during 18 years of Tory government -- and closer to the U.S. figure 
of about 35 percent than to the 50 percent in Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation at 1.1 percent is at a 36-year low, and unemployment,  
4.2 percent, is at a 19-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sunday's conference, Blair made it clear that Labor planned  
to keep an iron grip on inflation and public spending 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got this far by being a government that's run the  
economy well,'' he told delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists estimate that by the next national elections,  
which must be held by spring of 2001, the Treasury will have $8 
billion to $16 billion to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question for Labor is what to do with the money:  
pre-election tax breaks for the middle classes who flocked to Labor 
in 1997, or a state spending spree aimed at core working-class 
supporters.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw Makes History at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Drenched with champagne and flush with  
victory, U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw crossed the veranda 
outside the men's locker room until he was virtually hanging over 
the throngs cheering his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He pumped his fist. He blew a kiss to the crowd. And then he  
shared with them the message that had been so effective in rallying 
the Americans from a 4-point deficit to a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't stop believing,'' Crenshaw told the fans. And then,  
pumping his fist one more time, he yelled, ``Yes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of gushing about the history of the Ryder Cup  
and The Country Club course, Crenshaw went out and made some this 
weekend, guiding the Americans to victory in eight of 12 singles 
matches Sunday -- one other was tied -- to wrest the cup back from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	No team had ever come back from more than 2 points down on the  
final day, but Crenshaw was stunningly optimistic on Saturday night 
when sent the media home with this farewell: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to leave y'all with this thought,'' he said, wagging  
his finger at the reporters who had watched his heavily favored 
side fall behind 10-6 after two days. ``I'm a big believer in fate. 
I have a good feeling about this. That's all I'm going to tell 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club has been the site of several memorable events,  
none more historic than the 1913 U.S. Open, when unknown American 
amateur Francis Ouimet beat English professionals Harry Vardon and 
Ted Ray in a playoff. The victory is considered the founding moment 
of American golf, and Ouimet is considered its father. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was right on No. 17 that Ouimet -- a caddie who lived  
right across Clyde Street from the hole -- made par to beat Vardon's 
double bogey and go two strokes up; Ray had already fallen back. 
Crenshaw called the coincidence ``a little bit spooky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Francis Ouimet's dream. Francis Ouimet's dream, right here!''  
Crenshaw yelled as he hugged tournament chairman John Cornish after 
Justin Leonard's 45-foot putt all but clinched the cup. ``We made 
the greatest putt I've ever seen, right here on Francis Ouimet's 
green. ... It's almost mystical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. Opens have been played at The Country Club since  
Ouimet's victory, as well as the 1968 Junior Open that was the 
coming-out party for a 16-year-old Crenshaw. After becoming Ryder 
Cup captain two years ago, he came to walk the course and the 
memories nearly overwhelmed him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Crenshaw learned last month that some of his players didn't  
share his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Four golfers -- Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, David Duval and Phil  
Mickelson -- were said to be upset during the PGA Championship that 
they did not have a say in how the $20 million in Ryder Cup profits 
would be distributed. Duval, for one, called the event a ``big 
corporate outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw fumed that his players didn't see the tournament the  
way he did, and he criticized them publicly. And when the U.S. team 
fell behind 10-6 after the first two days, fans and reporters 
guessed that selfishness might be a reason why the favorites were 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	And Crenshaw wasn't done.  
</P>
<P>
	He invited longtime friend George W. Bush to a team meeting  
Saturday night, and the Texas governor read a quote from a veteran 
of the Alamo. Finally, something seemed to strike a chord with the 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't look like he was going to make it, but he was going  
to fight until the end,'' Mickelson recalled. ``It shows what a 
number of Americans have done for this country. We might not be 
soldiers who fight in wars, but this is something of its own and we 
need to fight as if we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Crenshaw sent his team out for the final day in shirts  
decorated with pictures of U.S. cup-winning teams from the past. 
Where will the picture of Crenshaw's team be if the next Ryder Cup 
captain chooses to follow suit? 
</P>
<P>
	How about the heart?  
</P>
<P>
	``I told y'all last night when I left that I'm a big believer in  
fate because I know how well these guys can play, and I know how 
determined they were, and I know how confident they felt under 
seemingly insurmountable odds,'' Crenshaw, who played in the event 
four times, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't describe it last night. But when I left here I  
said, `We're in good shape.' I did feel good about it. I felt 
confident. Darned if we didn't pull it off. Unbelievable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- With help from a handful of celebrity  
performers, tennis star Andre Agassi's benefit concert served up 
some good news: More than $3.9 million was raised for local youth 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an awesome time,'' Agassi said during Saturday night's  
fifth annual concert at the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The money from the concert, silent auctions and other events  
benefits the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which was founded 
in 1994 to help at-risk Las Vegas children. Agassi donates money 
and spends time one-on-one with the children, frequently playing 
tennis with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stage for this year's concert were Sir Elton John,  
LeAnn Rimes, Luther Vandross, Gloria Estefan, Robin Williams and 
Stevie Wonder.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Family Harvests Lice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABU RAWASH, Egypt (AP) -- The hunter poises over his prey, his  
weapons close at hand -- a towel, a comb and a pair of tweezers. 
</P>
<P>
	After harvesting lice from the head of a homeless man, Mohammed  
Abbas al-Sayyad will sell the insects to Cairo University so that 
entomology students can study them. 
</P>
<P>
	He also collects other insects, poisonous and nonpoisonous  
snakes, frogs and rats for Cairo and several other Egyptian 
universities and research centers. 
</P>
<P>
	He's continuing a tradition of hunting for science followed by  
his father, grandfather and great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any doctor who graduated from an Egyptian university must have  
had to deal with a member of our family,'' al-Sayyad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He traces the family trade -- a lucrative and sometimes-dangerous  
enterprise -- back 300 years, and says early customers included 
foreign explorers in Egypt. Al-Sayyad, in fact, means ``the 
hunter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every member of this family does this job, and even if someone  
has another job, he goes hunting every now and then,'' said 
al-Sayyad, sitting cross-legged on a cushion in his two-story house 
in Abu Rawash, a village 15 miles west of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract with Cairo University, his biggest client, was  
$58,000 last year, a huge amount in a country where many make less 
than $100 a month. Orders range from as many as 500 lice to a few 
dozen snakes. The rarer the animal, the higher the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Other families in Abu Rawash do similar work. The village is ``a  
rich area of insects and since it is close to Cairo and the 
university it is the suitable place to buy the needed samples of 
insects for the students,'' said Rifaat Gharib Abul-Ila, head of 
Cairo University's insect department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptian Organization for Biological Products and Vaccines,  
which produces antivenom for snake and scorpion bites and exports 
the products to 26 countries, also occasionally calls on the people 
of Abu Rawash. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sayyad goes hunting outside Abu Rawash once every two weeks,  
sometimes ranging as far as the Western Desert and Upper Egypt. He 
himself began as a child, and now takes along his sons, 6-year-old 
Islam and 5-year-old Ahmed, but makes sure the children handle only 
nonpoisonous snakes for now. 
</P>
<P>
	He can earn $58 for a deadly cobra and $43.50 for a cerastes, a  
snake that is almost as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hunting trip in the Western Desert a few years ago,  
al-Sayyad was bitten on the finger by a cerastes. He tied a 
tourniquet to prevent the poison from spreading and injected 
himself with antivenom. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said, ``I would never consider changing my job,  
despite all the dangers.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The Ryder Cup singles matchup everyone  
wanted to see was between golf's hottest young superstars, Tiger 
Woods and Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who like fireworks, a better combination might  
have been Jarmo Sandelin and Phil Mickelson. The two have a history 
of friction, dating to the 1996 Dunhill Cup when Sandelin pretended 
to shoot at his ball in the hole and Mickelson thought he was being 
insulted. 
</P>
<P>
	On the fourth hole Sunday, Sandelin appeared to replace his ball  
slightly closer to the hole than where he had marked it. He 
realized his mistake and looked up at Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson did nothing, which made the Swede even more  
uncomfortable. Finally, a rules official stepped in and said 
Sandelin did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson has said he's put the 1996 incident behind him. And he  
tried to put it to rest finally when he said, without being asked, 
``I was expecting gamesmanship and he showed nothing but class and 
sportsmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandelin had also had problems with Mark O'Meara in the 1997  
Lancome Trophy, when he accused the American he dubbed 
``Mark-it-nearer'' of moving his ball closer to the hole. But this 
time the accused became the accused. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandelin, who lost 4 and 3 in his only Ryder Cup action, has  
said that he got a negative reputation because the media and some 
players don't understand his fun-loving personality. So he began 
the European team's news conference by saying, ``I love you all. 
Thank you. I love you there, I love you everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *'HEY ANDREW, OVER HERE':* Andrew Coltart, playing in his first  
Ryder Cup, had a little trouble on the ninth hole when a marshal 
told him his shot had gone into the woods. In fact, it was in the 
rough, just a few feet from the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Coltart had to hit again, but then found his first ball in the  
rough -- about 30 seconds after the 5-minute time limit was up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's tough,'' he said. ``You just got to get on with it, and  
you've just got to try and play. ... It didn't have a huge bearing 
on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coltart lost 3 and 2 to Tiger Woods.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHIRT OFF MY BACK:* U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw has gone on and  
on about the history of the Ryder Cup and of The Country Club, 
which has been called the birthplace of American golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team's shirts for the final were maroon and decorated  
with pictures of Cup-winning teams of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The European team wore more traditional, checked shirts. Asked  
about his opponent's choice, European captain Mark James 
deadpanned, ``I guess we missed out on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club played host to the 1913 U.S. Open, where local  
caddie Francis Ouimet won a playoff against English professionals 
Harry Vardon and Ted Ray. The event led to a golf boom in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Country Club has been good to American golf,'' said  
Crenshaw, who first played here in the 1968 U.S. Junior Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IT'S A DOG'S LIFE:* Roaming among the 35,000 humans at The  
Country Club was ``Walker,'' a black Labrador retriever in the 
employ of the Massachusetts State Fire Marshall's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog was called upon three times over the weekend to sniff  
out suspicious packages -- a backpack, a brown paper bag and a 
cooler -- none of which turned out to be a threat, according to his 
handler, Paul Kastrinakis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just here in case something comes up ... because of past  
occurrences,'' he said, alluding to the bombing at the 1996 
Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Kastrinakis said he and his partner had to go through a  
seven-week training period with the Connecticut State Police. The 
two have to be certified as a team, and a chemist must also certify 
the dog's nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Kastrinakis said he's been on the bomb squad for two years, and  
hasn't had a real one yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it stays that way for the rest of my career,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other canine spotted at the tournament was Emma, a  
border collie used to chase geese off the course. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEXT STOP, THE PRESIDENT'S CUP?:* With his team struggling to  
stay afloat in the Ryder Cup golf tournament, U.S. captain Ben 
Crenshaw needed some encouragement. Enter Republican presidential 
candidate George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is a longtime friend of Crenshaw, and was in  
town to root for the U.S. team on Saturday -- along with his 
parents, former President George Bush and first lady Barbara Bush, 
and his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're close buddies,'' Bush told the Boston Herald. ``We're  
from the same town. We go to church together. We play golf 
together. I'm looking to say hi, to pick him up. He's a good guy. 
He'll get a handle on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he tried to encourage Crenshaw, and expressed  
confidence that the U.S. team would rebound. He also spoke to the 
team on Saturday night, reading them a quote from an Alamo veteran 
who fought against overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was a strange choice -- the United States lost the  
battle at the Alamo -- it did the trick. Crenshaw's team rallied 
from four points down to beat the Europeans 14 1/2-13 1/2 and win the 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Colin Montgomerie has still never lost a singles  
match. For all his heroics, Justin Leonard has yet to win a match; 
he halved three and was 0-2-2 in 1997. ... The Ryder Cup marked the 
last assignment of Boston Globe reporter Joe Concannon, who has 
been covering golf for 34 years. A party was held in the press tent 
before the start of matches, and he was toasted with champagne. ... 
NBC earned a 4.9 rating and a 14 share for Saturday's telecast, the 
highest overnight ratings since the network began telecasting the 
event in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Former Reagan Aides Criticize Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ex-aides to Ronald Reagan said Sunday they are  
skeptical of a new biography that contends the former president 
came dangerously close to death while at the hospital in the hours 
after the 1981 assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The former aides told NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that Edmund  
Morris' account of events surrounding the shooting at a Washington 
hotel on March 30, 1981, contained details they were not aware of -- 
and seemed a bit more dramatic than the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was much more gravely wounded than I knew,'' said former  
advisor Lyn Nofziger. ``I did not get that impression that he was 
on death's bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Meese, a former attorney general, said Reagan ``was still,  
during that time, functioning, talking with us'' after being shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea of great drama was really not there to the extent  
that it seems to be portrayed,'' Meese said. He added that Morris' 
assertion that Reagan made decisions about Iran while hospitalized 
and ``not fully in complete control of the situation is just simply 
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' authorized biography, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald  
Reagan,'' is due in bookstores this week. Newsweek published 
excerpts in its current issue, on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The book has generated controversy because Morris, frustrated at  
being unable to penetrate Reagan's murky persona, created a 
fictional character to help with the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Morris said he feels  
he portrayed Reagan ``very, very objectively,'' despite having a 
difficult time pulling personal details and private thoughts from 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was truly one of the strangest men who's ever lived. Nobody  
around him understood him,'' Morris said, according to a transcript 
of the interview set for broadcast Sunday night. ``Every person I 
interviewed, almost without exception, eventually would say, you 
know, I could never really figure him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that group included Nancy Reagan -- and himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy, many years later, admitted that she found parts of him  
mysterious, that she couldn't figure out either,'' Morris said. 
``He's still a mystery to me. Still a mystery. And I think he 
always will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nofziger discussed the book alongside Reagan's spokesman Marlin  
Fitzwater, deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver and Meese. They and 
other former aides also disagreed with other characterizations in 
the book -- that Reagan and his vice president, George Bush, did not 
get along, that Reagan was ``an airhead'' whose attention waned 
during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Education Secretary William Bennett, appearing on CBS'  
``Face the Nation,'' acknowledged Reagan ``might tune off'' during 
boring Cabinet meetings. But he said Reagan tended to give his 
attention to two or three things at a time, rather than everything 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Bennett added, ``The notion that Nancy Reagan did not know  
Ronald Reagan I find preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Reagan seems enigmatic because he was a private man who  
``didn't give you everything emotionally. ... He wasn't Bill 
Clinton. He didn't spew all over you every time you asked him a 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan ``didn't pretend to be an intellectual,'' Meese told NBC.  
``Certainly he was on top of the things that he had to decide.'' 
His ability to deal one-on-one for hours with Russian President 
Mikhail Gorbachev and other world leaders ``dispels any idea of 
being an airhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aides also disputed another passage, which says the fact  
that Reagan lost 3,500 cubic centimeters of blood ``was suppressed 
for a long time,'' and that Reagan suffered ``a major physiological 
insult from which he would never entirely recover'' when he was 
given lukewarm blood to replace that lost blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no idea how close the president actually came to dying  
that afternoon,'' Morris wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The assertion by Edmund that this blood was cold and therefore  
it changed Reagan forever, that's a little hard for me to 
believe,'' Deaver said. Despite that, Deaver said, Reagan ``was 
seriously hurt, and I think the infection that developed later in 
the hospital was even more serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes that, hours after the shooting, Reagan's blood  
pressure was returning to normal and the president was joking out 
loud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regaining consciousness at 7:30, he was unable to continue  
joking aloud, because tubes crammed his nose and throat,'' Morris 
wrote. ``So he reverted to weak scribbles on pink paper: 'I'd like 
to do this scene again -- starting at the hotel'.''

<HEADLINE>  Strong Aftershock Kills 3 in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two brothers were pulled to freedom Sunday  
after 5 1/2 days buried alive in the wreckage of Taiwan's killer 
quake, saying they survived by eating a few apples and playing 
cards in the small space where they were trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the devastation and shattered hopes, Taiwanese were cheered  
by the improbable survival of Sun Chi-kwang, 20, and Sun Chi-feng, 
who turned 26 Wednesday, one day into their 130-hour ordeal in the 
wreckage of a collapsed Taipei building. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were rescued even as powerful aftershocks continue  
to jolt Taiwan. A particularly strong one hit early Sunday, killing 
at least three people on top of more than 2,000 who had already 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Onlookers applauded as the younger Sun, stripped to the waist  
but staying upright and holding a bottle of water he got from 
rescue workers, was lifted to safety by a crane. His brother was 
rushed away on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Liu Luan, heaved with sobs of joy as her sons came  
out alive, speaking so fast she was almost incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept thinking, 'This is not possible, this is not  
possible,''' Liu told reporters at the scene. ``I kept praying for 
them all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were hospitalized in stable condition. Doctors were  
checking them for possible internal injuries or dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are both very clear and conscious of what happened,''  
said Dr. Su Chong-jen, chief of surgery at the hospital where they 
were taken. ``What they need now is rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun brothers had been playing bridge when the 7.6-magnitude  
quake struck in the wee hours Tuesday. The 12-story building they 
were in crumpled, flattening parts of the hotel, offices and 
apartments it contained. The brothers' parents and sister were not 
at home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The two kept up their spirits by continuing their card game  
while they waited in the small space, their doctor said by 
telephone. When their water ran out, they were forced to drink 
their own urine. 
</P>
<P>
	From his hospital bed, Sun Chi-kwang said he even managed to  
give his sibling a birthday gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``My older brother told me that never in my life did I celebrate  
his birthday with him, so I said today I would celebrate with you 
and I gave him my necklace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told TVBS television that while trapped he had ``a very  
strange dream'' in which ``there was someone beside me saying that 
behind the fridge there was a hole from where I could get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was really strange and I told my older brother.  
He asked me what it meant and said fate could not have been talking 
to me, so I went back to sleep,'' Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little later I saw a hole, and indeed it turned out to be a  
big hole,'' he said, referring to the hole rescuers carved into the 
rubble to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency crews worked into the night through a light drizzle in  
hopes of saving more lives in the Taipei building, though they were 
not certain whether anyone else was still alive. The building was 
one of the hardest-hit structures in Taipei, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's aftershock -- a sizable earthquake in its own right --  
brought down some buildings in central Taiwan, the hardest-hit 
region, and cracked walls as far away as Taipei, 90 miles to the 
north. Its magnitude was estimated at 6.8 or 6.5 by different 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershock killed three people, injured at least 58 and  
buried another 20 in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there have been thousands of aftershocks, Sunday's was  
big enough to send frightened people scurrying out of their homes 
to safe, open spaces. Others donned motorcycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody here dares to stay home at night. They all stay in  
tents,'' said university student Lee Wen in the town of Puli, where 
water, electricity and telephone service have yet to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from the new tremor, and more bodies unearthed on Sunday,  
brought the confirmed toll from the quakes to 2,056. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disaster Management Center said 8,667 people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Sunday, Pope John Paul II urged the world to come to  
the aid of Taiwan's earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting pilgrims at his summer residence outside Rome, John  
Paul prayed for the victims and their loved ones. He expressed 
confidence that ``the international community will respond with 
renewed solidarity and ready assistance in the urgent work of 
relief and rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the government announced two major steps to  
try to ensure Taiwan bounces back smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Sunday night he was temporarily  
imposing tighter limits on how far stock prices can fall in a 
single day, to 3.5 percent from the normal 7 percent. The market 
has been closed since the quake struck. It reopens Monday, and many 
expect a plunge in prices on concerns about economic fallout from 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, President Lee Teng-hui signed a rare emergency  
decree that gives the military increased powers to maintain order. 
The decree, which would supersedes all existing laws for six 
months, still must be approved by legislators.

<HEADLINE> Funds Meant for Poor Said Misused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Five million dollars in federal tax money  
meant to help the poorest of Appalachia's poor built sewer lines 
for automaker BMW in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmer County, W.Va., where one-third of the 7,500 residents  
live in poverty, hasn't received a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast isn't unusual, according an analysis of grants  
distributed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, reported Sunday 
in The Columbus Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
	From the program's inception in 1965 through 1998, millions of  
federal tax dollars were spent on Appalachia's wealthiest counties 
while its many of its most impoverished communities were ignored, 
the Dispatch reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It analyzed 22,169 grants totaling $16.4 billion when adjusted  
for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenses:  
</P>
<P>
	--$75,200 for a bronze statue of Olympic track star Jesse Owens  
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	--$500,000 to expand an intersection leading to a Pennsylvania  
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5 million for sewer lines and worker training at BMW's plant  
at Spartanburg, S.C., listed among the nation's ``booming locales'' 
that same year by Money magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Pittsburgh received $70.4 million in the  
commission's first 32 years, one of the largest chunks of 
Appalachia Regional Commission grant money. 
</P>
<P>
	``That money should be targeted to the most needy areas, to the  
most needy people. I don't understand those priorities,'' said the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson. He visited southeast Ohio last year to draw 
attention to Appalachia's struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse White Jr., federal co-chairman of the commission since  
1994, acknowledged problems with the grant process. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's spending decisions are improving, he said. He  
pointed to Pittsburg's Allegheny County, Pa., which hasn't received 
money from the commission since White took the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's $516.4 million budget for fiscal 1999  
represented its highest funding level ever, White said. Congress 
also set aside $2.3 billion to continue work on Appalachian 
highways and it formally renewed the Appalachian Regional 
Commission through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was created during President Lyndon Johnson's  
``war on poverty'' to help build highways and improve education, 
health and standard of living in Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's mountains and foothills run through 13 states, from  
New York to Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-fourth of the 406 counties are considered economically  
distressed -- most in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and 
southeastern Ohio -- meaning they have unemployment over 8.5 
percent, poverty rates above 19.6 percent and average incomes 
per-capita of $12,934 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	All 406 counties qualify for federal grants.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonprofit groups, colleges, governments and health-care  
providers submit the requests, and the governors of the 13 states 
help the agency director choose the grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing requires them to award the bulk of the money to projects  
in the neediest counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dispatch study found more than one-fourth of the grant  
money, nearly $4.6 billion, had gone to Maryland, New York, 
Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- states with few, if any, counties 
labeled economically distressed by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the agency, such as former U.S. Rep. Scott Klug of  
Wisconsin who tried to kill the commission in the mid-1990s, say 
the grants aren't working and no amount of tax money can solve the 
region's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these communities have had money thrown at them,''  
Klug said. ``Do they need another 35 years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Cooper, 39, who grew up in Portsmouth, Ohio, believes  
they do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see people from Appalachia on TV in houses that you  
wouldn't let your dog live in,'' she said. ``Those people need 
help. Why spend money in New York when it's needed in southeast 
Ohio or Kentucky or West Virginia?''

<HEADLINE> Bride Shot By Ex Before Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- A woman preparing for her wedding was  
shot to death Sunday by her ex-boyfriend, who was restrained by the 
woman's brother and then arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rolls Royce was waiting at the curb Sunday afternoon as a  
photographer inside Gladys Ricart's home here photographed the 
39-year-old woman while she got ready for her wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before 4 p.m., her ex-boyfriend, Augustine Garcia,  
entered the house, approached the bride, pulled out a gun and 
fatally shot her, according to Bergen County Prosecutor William H. 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who was carrying a small, five-shot, .38-caliber hand  
gun, was being held at the Ridgefield Police Department 
headquarters Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been charged yet, but he will be charged,'' Schmidt  
said. He expected Garcia would be arraigned sometime Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garcia is a former boyfriend. They dated for six or seven  
years and broke up about nine months ago,'' the prosecutor said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons have gone from super to  
stupor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season's Super Bowl teams both fell to 0-3 Sunday as the  
Broncos lost to Tampa Bay 13-10 and the Falcons fell to St. Louis 
35-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Alstott rushed for a career-high 131 yards and a touchdown,  
and the Buccaneers (2-1) held Terrell Davis to 53 yards at Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver is the first defending Super Bowl champion to begin a  
season with three straight losses in a non-strike year. The New 
York Giants started 0-5 in 1987 following a Super Bowl 
championship, but three of those losses were with replacement 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not used to this situation, but it's a learning  
experience,'' said Davis, the league's MVP last season. ``We've 
been on top, now we've got to experience how it feels to be on the 
bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos had seven sacks after not having any in losses to  
Miami and Kansas City, but the Bucs controlled the ball for 14 more 
minutes than Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``A win is a win. I don't care if it's a Picasso or I drew it,''  
said Warren Sapp, Tampa Bay's Pro Bowl defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner threw three TD passes in the second quarter and ran  
for another score in the third period as the Rams routed Atlanta in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams (2-0) ended an eight-game losing streak to NFC West  
opponents and a four-game losing streak against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hungry dogs,'' said cornerback Todd Lyght, who had an  
interception. ``We don't want to just eat the meat off the bone, we 
want to eat the bone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler reinjured his right hamstring  
late in the first half and said he may miss next week's game 
against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent about two weeks resting it and rehabbing it, but it  
doesn't seem to be getting any better,'' said Chandler, who missed 
last Monday night's loss at Dallas because of the same injury. 
``Hopefully it will come back, but I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NFL games, it was Carolina 27, Cincinnati 3; Baltimore  
17, Cleveland 10; Kansas City 31, Detroit 21; Buffalo 26, 
Philadelphia 0; Seattle 29, Pittsburgh 10; Washington 27, New York 
Jets 20; Tennessee 20, Jacksonville 19; Indianapolis 27, San Diego 
19; Oakland 24, Chicago 17; and Green Bay 23, Minnesota 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Giants played at New England on Sunday night. The  
Monday night matchup is San Francisco at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Bucs 13, Broncos 10    	
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay sacked Brian Griese twice on Denver's last two drives,  
and an interception of Griese set up one of two field goals by 
Martin Gramatica. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent Dilfer bounced back from poor performances in Tampa Bay's  
first two games to complete 15 of 18 passes for 135 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Rams 35, Falcons 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a star in NFL Europe and Arena Football before taking  
over for injured Trent Green during the preseason, completed 17 of 
25 passes for 275 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Hanspard, filling in for injured Atlanta star Jamal  
Anderson, was held to 50 yards on 17 carries. In two games last 
year, Anderson averaged 180 yards against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Panthers 27, Bengals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Charlotte, Tshimanga Biakabutuka had a 62-yard TD run on  
Carolina's first play from scrimmage, then added a 67-yard scoring 
run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Biakabutuka finished with 132 yards on eight carries as Carolina  
(1-2) won its first game under George Seifert. Both his touchdowns 
set team records for longest run from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati is 0-3 for the third time in seven years.  
</P>
<P>
                        *Ravens 17, Browns 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Baltimore, quarterback Stoney Case scored twice on 1-yard  
runs in his first start for the Ravens as the team formerly known 
as the Cleveland Browns beat the expansion version. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns (0-3) hoped to provide the city of Cleveland a  
measure of revenge against Ravens owner Art Modell, who moved the 
franchise to Baltimore after the 1995 season. Instead, Modell 
watched Baltimore (1-2) record its first victory under coach Brian 
Billick. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Chiefs 31, Lions 21    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kansas City, Elvis Grbac threw two TD passes as the Chiefs  
handed Detroit its first loss in the post-Barry Sanders era. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first six possessions, the Lions (2-1) were sacked  
three times, had a pass batted down, were penalized twice and 
punted five times. The Chiefs (2-1) led 24-7 late in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Seahawks 29, Steelers 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Pittsburgh, Merton Hanks had a 23-yard interception return  
and Charles Rogers had a team-record 94-yard punt return barely two 
minutes later as Seattle (2-1) beat the Steelers (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks made five interceptions and chased error-prone  
Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart by halftime, when the Seahawks 
led 26-0. Todd Peterson kicked a club-record five field goals for 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Redskins 27, Jets 20    	
</P>
<P>
	At East Rutherford, N.J., Kenard Lang had three of Washington's  
six sacks and Stephen Davis had three TD runs as the Redskins (2-1) 
beat the reeling New York Jets (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
	The injury-ravaged Jets lost only four games in 1998, when they  
made the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Bills 26, Eagles 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Orchard Park, N.Y., Steve Christie kicked four first-half  
field goals, Doug Flutie threw a 15-yard TD pass, and Antowain 
Smith had a 4-yard scoring run as Buffalo (2-1) beat the woeful 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles (0-3) had two touchdowns nullified by offsides 	
penalties in the first half and finished the game with only 22 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Titans 20, Jaguars 19 	
</P>
<P>
	At Jacksonville, Neil O'Donnell threw a 12-yard TD pass to  
Michael Roan with 3:26 left to give Tennessee a rain-drenched win 
over the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans (3-0) won their fourth game in five years at  
Jacksonville (2-1) and their ninth straight against AFC Central 
opponents. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Book: Einstein Had Retarded Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new book claims that Albert Einstein's  
illegitimate daughter was born severely retarded, possibly with 
Down syndrome, and died at 21 months after a bout with Scarlet 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
	When the first volume of Einstein's collected papers was  
released in 1987, it showed that he had had an affair while at 
university with a fellow student named Mileva Maric, who later 
became pregnant and gave birth to a child at her parent's home in 
rural Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby, a daughter named Lieserl, was born severely retarded,  
possibly with Down syndrome, according to a new book, ``Einstein's 
Daughter: The Search for Lieserl,'' by Michelle Zackheim, Time 
magazine reported in its current issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Zackheim's book says that Maric was unable to put the girl up  
for adoption and ultimately left her with her parents in the 
Vojovodina region of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Zackheim says she wrote the book because of her curiosity about  
what became of the abandoned child. She said she wanted to find out 
how ``did (Einstein's) daughter feel about being abandoned, 
especially by someone who was so important to the culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of turning up a living heir, the author's research  
led her to a letter Einstein had written to Maric in 1903 that said 
``I am very sorry about what has happened to Lieserl. Scarlet fever 
often leaves some lasting trace behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This clue led Zackheim to deduce that the baby died at the age  
of 21 months from Scarlet Fever. 
</P>
<P>
	The new book is just the latest in a number of revelations about  
Einstein's personal life that have scholars re-evaluating the image 
of the wild-haired, iconoclastic inventor of the theory of 
relativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston University historian Robert Schulmann, director of the  
Einstein Papers Project, told Time that the book's conclusions 
about the child's fate are ``as good as anything I could come up 
with, or anyone else. But it's speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard physicist and Einstein historian Gerald Holton was more  
critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``She worked very hard traipsing through all those Serbian  
cemeteries and came up with nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Warplanes Bomb Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military on Sunday warned it  
may launch ground operations against Islamic militants in Chechnya 
while warplanes bombed the Chechen capital for a fourth day, 
pounding industrial and communications facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Russian jets flew repeatedly over the city's southern  
Oktyabrsky district Sunday morning, firing rockets and dropping 
bombs, the Interfax news agency said. The district is the site of 
Chechnya's now-destroyed television broadcasting center as well as 
oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said he could not rule  
out the possibility of launching ground operations in the breakaway 
republic. Until now, the military has favored an air war that would 
keep Russian casualties to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several variants of a plan for ground operations,  
which will be implemented depending on the situation that 
develops,'' Interfax quoted Sergeyev as saying. He spoke while 
visiting soldiers recovering from Dagestan battle wounds in a 
Moscow military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main aim of all the plans is to eliminate the bandits''  
and ``to create a considerably deep security zone around 
Chechnya,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants are separatists who want to form an independent  
Islamic nation in what is now southern Russia. The Russian military 
said the air raids are aimed at preventing militant incursions from 
Chechnya into the Russian republic of Dagestan, where they fought 
Russian forces in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, however, Russian leaders have vowed to eradicate  
the militants altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyewitnesses said that over the past four days, Russian air  
raids have destroyed more than 100 oil pumps, reservoirs and small 
refineries in and around Grozny that are believed to be controlled 
by Chechen rebel field commanders. The oil was the basis of a 
profitable business providing low-grade gasoline to other Russian 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian planes also struck suspected rebel camps near Chechnya's  
border with Dagestan on Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, 
citing the provisional federal press center in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, commander of Russia's Air Force,  
said in a television interview Sunday that the air campaign against 
Chechnya could last another month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian military commanders appeared to be considering a major  
raid into Chechnya to put the militants on the defensive and stop 
their incursions into surrounding Russian territory. While Russian 
has massed armored forces on the Chechen borders, military analysts 
say the force is too small to mount a full-scale invasion of 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military is short of everything from trained  
infantry to food, and an invasion of Chechnya could risk a major 
defeat -- not unlike the kind it suffered during the 1994-96 war, 
when it lost control of Chechnya to a much smaller, poorly-armed 
guerrilla force. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Russian public opinion appears to favor tough  
action against Chechnya in the wake of a series of apartment 
bombings in Russia during the past month that have been blamed on 
the Chechen militants. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dagestan Sunday, two Russian policeman and a volunteer were  
killed in a shootout with a suspected Islamic militant sheltering 
in a concrete bunker near the Chechen border, ITAR-Tass reported. 
The militant was also killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chechens tried desperately to flee the bombing in  
their republic. An estimated 40,000 people arrived in the 
neighboring republic of Ingushetia, prompting the Ingushetian 
authorities to close the border on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chechen side of the border, Chechen authorities set up  
tents for some of the tens of thousands of trapped civilians and 
brought in piles of firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto  
independence in 1996. Moscow still claims it is a part of Russia 
and has struggled to keep violence from spreading outward.

<HEADLINE> Sleep Deprivation, Alcohol Compared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Not sleeping enough can give you the same  
results as drinking too much. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a Stanford University study of people  
with mild to moderate sleep apnea: people whose breathing stops 
several or even dozens of times an hour, interrupting their rest 
without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 million Americans have the problem but fewer than 2  
million of them have been diagnosed, according to the American 
Sleep Apnea Association's Web site. The undiagnosed figure may be 
as high as 25 million, according to Stanford's Sleep Disorders 
Clinic and Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	People known to have apnea did as poorly on a test of reaction  
time as people who were too drunk to drive a bus or truck in 
California, said Dr. Nelson B. Powell of the Stanford center. 
</P>
<P>
	On three of seven measurements, they did worse than people too  
drunk to drive at all in California and other states where the 
legal test is a blood alcohol content of .08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell presented his study Sunday at the annual convention  
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 
Foundation, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to underscore the dangers of driving while  
sleepy, whether or not it's because of apnea. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times have you or anybody you've known been nodding  
off at the wheel, or said, `Gee, I've got to roll the window down 
or turn the music louder'?'' he said. ``I'd bet every driver, at 
one time or another has driven too tired. We know it's wrong but we 
still do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This study gives a comparison that people can understand, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful study,'' said Dr. Regina Walker, an  
associate professor of otolaryngology at Loyola University in 
Chicago. ``It is an extremely well-thought-out, well-controlled, 
prospective study that is looking at something I think is of great 
significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 80 volunteers and 113 people with apnea. The  
volunteers' average age was 29 and 56 percent were women. In 
contrast, 81 percent of the apnea patients were men, and their 
average age was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	However, statistical analysis ruled out age and gender as  
reasons for the difference, Powell said. He said the full analysis 
will be published next month in a national peer-reviewed journal. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the people took a 10-minute test of reaction speed,  
pushing a button to turn off a randomly set light. After four tests 
to get their baseline reaction time, the comparison group started 
drinking 80-proof alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	They were tested three more times as they kept drinking. Their  
blood alcohol count averaged .05 percent at the first re-test, .08 
percent at the second and .083 at the third. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California and several other states for anyone  
with a blood-alcohol content of more than .04 percent to drive a 
bus or truck, and .08 is considered legal proof of driving drunk in 
16 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to simple reaction times, analysts looked at six  
mathematical permutations, such as the means of the 10 fastest and 
of the 10 slowest times. 
</P>
<P>
	The apnea patients, whose breath stopped about 29 times an hour  
while they were asleep, did worse on all seven measurements than 
the drinkers did on their first re-test, and worse on three of them 
than those who were legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of my patients don't think being sleepy is a big deal,''  
Walker said. ``I think this will help legislators and the public 
understand just how serious the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also that it's not controllable,'' she added. ``People think,  
`I can just make myself stay awake.' They can't.''

<HEADLINE> E.Carolina Rewarded for Perseverance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- After a week in its home-away-from-home,  
East Carolina was rewarded for its perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina, forced to spend a week on the road waiting for  
the effects of Hurricane Floyd to subside, mounted a fourth-quarter 
rally and knocked off Miami 27-23 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped a week in which the No. 19 Pirates (4-0) had to spend  
a week in Columbia, S.C., where they beat the University of South 
Carolina the previous weekend. That was one week in a motel, with 
trips to the mall, the movies and a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly's desperation  
fourth-down pass sailed out of bounds to secure the victory, the 
Pirates let their emotions show in a variety of ways. Some ran 
around in celebration, others thrust their fists into the sky, 
while a few more simply fell on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the reality of what Floyd has done to coach Steve  
Logan's bunch of football nomads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some aftermath to contend with,'' Logan said. ``I've  
got 18 to 20 players that are displaced. We've got to get them 
re-situated, and in the meantime, we've got to prepare for a 
football game this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for this week's game was tough enough. Logan and his  
team used the indoor and outdoor facilities at South Carolina to 
prepare for the 18th-ranked Hurricanes. Because the situation in 
Greenville changed every day, the Pirates switched the game from 
their home field to North Carolina State's Carter-Finley Stadium, 
some 85 miles to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, it appeared that the makeshift arrangements  
took their toll on the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina committed two turnovers, seemed to be a little out  
of rhythm on offense and unable to wrap up on defense. Throughout 
the game, Kelly escaped the Pirates and scrambled for big gains. 
Reserve running back Clinton Portis ran through East Carolina for 
147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	At the half, Miami (2-2) built a 20-3 lead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to know what we did at halftime. The only  
thing we did at halftime, I just begged our offense to please not 
turn the ball over any more,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap may have awakened the Pirates, but Miami coach Butch  
Davis said if his team eased up a little, it was wrong to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team should have definitely not gotten complacent at  
halftime,'' Davis said. ``We came into this game knowing that ECU 
was very dangerous entering the game 3-0. They are a talented and 
dangerous team and there should not have been any complacency in 
our locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes pushed the lead to 23-3 on Andy Crosland's  
47-yard field goal with 12:13 left in the third quarter. That's 
when East Carolina took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Wilson, whose earlier fumble led to a touchdown, ran 23  
yards for a score with 9:43 left in the period. Wilson then capped 
an 84-yard drive with an 18-yard touchdown run with 11:59 to play, 
closing the gap to 23-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Miller added a 39-yard field goal with 9:30 left to draw  
the Pirates closer. By then, the Hurricanes showed no semblance of 
the offense that ran up 301 yards through three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina capped the comeback with a 79-yard, 10-play drive  
that ended on David Garrard's 27-yard scoring pass to Keith Stokes 
with 4:51 left. When time ran out, fans ignored pleas to stay off 
the field and tore down both goal posts. Security guards kept the 
poles in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was ready to refute the notion that having had to prepare  
under adverse conditions would have an impact on his team. Miami 
wide receiver Reggie Wayne agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a perfect season already and they would play hard  
to keep it, no matter what the situations are,'' said Wayne, who 
caught a 21-yard scoring pass from Kelly in the first quarter. ``A 
top 10 team's coming in to play them and they're going to play hard 
regardless. We knew they would come out and play hard. In the 
second half, we came out and we didn't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the game at No. 9, the Hurricanes were the  
highest-ranked team East Carolina has ever beaten. Now, reality 
lies ahead and it doesn't necessarily have to do with football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't even there. We didn't even have to deal with many  
of the things that have already been dealt with,'' Logan said. ``I 
told the kids all week to keep counting their blessings and we were 
well taken care of and we had a lot of good times in the hotel. It 
really kind of pulled us together in some ways, although nobody's 
got any underwear.''

<HEADLINE> Packers 23, Vikings 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre never gets tired of making  
the extraordinary look like child's play. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre led the Green Bay Packers to another thrilling comeback  
win, hitting Corey Bradford with a 23-yard touchdown pass with 12 
seconds left and giving the Packers a 23-20 victory over the 
Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those touchdown passes, I've dreamed about them a million  
times since I was a kid,'' he said. ``Of course, Corey Bradford 
wasn't in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford's catch capped a 77-yard, 104-second drive led by  
Favre, who beat the Oakland Raiders in Week 1 with a similar 
last-ditch march. It was Favre's 12th fourth-quarter comeback and 
the 15th game-winning drive of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's final pass came on a fourth-and-1 play, and Green Bay  
had no timeouts remaining. Favre said he didn't call a play but 
simply took the snap and threw toward Bradford, who bumped Jimmy 
Hitchcock at the line of scrimmage and ran on a full sprint toward 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a dream, and I was hoping I wouldn't wake up,''  
Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it was a man call, and he beat me,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``I just got beat. I let him in the end zone. I take full 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 6-of-7 on the final drive, hitting Bradford twice and  
Dorsey Levens three times as the Packers (2-1) scored their only 
offensive touchdown of the game against Minnesota's fired-up 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think I saw him catch it,'' said Favre, who ran  
and leaped toward the other end of the field with his arms raised. 
``As I threw it, I knew it was going to be perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Moss caught a 10-yard touchdown pass -- just his second  
reception of the game -- from Randall Cunningham with 1:56 to play, 
giving Minnesota (1-2) a 20-16 lead. Both teams struggled to mount 
sustained offensive drives until the game's fabulous finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota took one last shot at the end zone, but rookie  
defensive back Antuan Edwards made his second interception of the 
game as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, who wept after the Oakland win, collapsed onto a sideline  
bench shortly after throwing the final pass and was helped off the 
field by medical staff. He said he almost hyperventilated and was 
simply out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm too tired to cry today,'' he said with a laugh. ``Believe  
me, I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was 24-of-39 for 304 yards. Green Bay won for the 32nd  
time in 33 games at Lambeau Field, where Minnesota beat the Packers 
37-24 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss' catch capped a five-play, 80-yard drive for the Vikings.  
With 3:40 to play, Cunningham hit Jake Reed on a short slant at the 
Minnesota 30, and Reed slipped between rookie defensive backs 
Edwards and Fred Vinson and ran half the length of the field before 
Vinson dragged him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had six catches for 108 yards as the Vikings' passing  
struggles continued, but Minnesota ran the ball well. After rushing 
for 71 yards in Minnesota's first two games, Robert Smith had 85 
yards on 21 carries, including runs of 7 and 11 yards on the 
Vikings' last scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Green Bay mostly shut down the Vikings offense that ran  
up 545 total yards in its win at Lambeau last season and compelled 
the Packers to draft three defensive backs, all of whom played 
extensively Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a variety of coverage schemes, Moss had just one catch  
for 3 yards in the game's first 58 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Longwell kicked three field goals, including a 34-yarder  
with 4:25 to play that gave Green Bay a 16-13 lead. Gary Anderson 
had two field goals for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards returned his first NFL interception 26 yards for a  
touchdown when Cunningham tried to throw to Moss in triple coverage 
deep in Vikings territory in the second quarter. The rookie was 
helped along by a massive block from Vonnie Holliday on the return. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota drove 94 yards on its first possession and went up 7-0  
on Leroy Hoard's 5-yard run, but only after the drive stayed alive 
on a personal foul against Packers linebacker George Koonce. Both 
teams then settled into a pattern of long drives that didn't end up 
in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's yesterday's news,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said.  
``They just made a nice play. You can't be surprised about 
anything. Brett Favre made the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes: Reed has back-to-back 100-yard receiving games for the  
Vikings. ... Levens rushed for just 49 yards but had a career-high 
nine receptions for 84 yards. ... Minnesota's 20 points were the 
most the Vikings have scored in a game this season. Last year, 
their lowest output in a game was 24 on their way to an NFL-record 
556 points. ... Longwell is perfect on seven PATs and five field 
goals for Green Bay this season. ... Chris Doleman and Corey Miller 
both played extensively for Minnesota after being signed earlier in 
the week. ... Billy Lyon made his first career start at defensive 
tackle in place of Santana Dotson (stinger). Dotson had played in 
all 114 previous games of his NFL career. Lyon had one of the 
Packers' two sacks and made five tackles.

<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Even the most prolific offense in  
the NFL will take a little charity from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention a bunch of help from its defense.  
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Redskins, helped by crucial penalties committed  
by the New York Jets and a defense that registered six sacks, won 
27-20 Sunday. The Skins (2-1) got three short touchdown runs from 
NFL scoring leader Stephen Davis and three sacks by Kenard Lang. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus all that help from the injury-ravaged Jets, who have gone  
from AFC title game loser in 1998 to 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to say this is a statement game for us,'' NFL passing  
leader Brad Johnson said. ``It's a huge win, coming from behind in 
New York against the Jets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We handed them the game,'' Jets center Kevin Mawae said.  
</P>
<P>
	New York took a 17-13 lead on Curtis Martin's 3-yard run to cap  
a seven-play, 73-yard drive, and John Hall's 37-yard field goal 
with 8:10 to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Jets got generous.  
</P>
<P>
	On an 80-yard drive that ended with a 4-yard go-ahead run by  
Davis, cornerback Ray Mickens was called for two pass interference 
penalties. The first cost the Jets 35 yards when he bumped Michael 
Westbrook, the other nullified a stop on third down when he held 
Albert Connell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Ray (from Texas A&AMP;M). He has a tendency to hang,''  
Connell said. ``He sits on routes and tries to make the big play on 
every down. I took advantage of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickens just shrugged when asked about the penalties as he left  
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``No comment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But coach Bill Parcells, his face drenched in sweat, called it  
``non-competitive coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lack of coverage and poor judgment,'' Parcells added.  
</P>
<P>
	Then Lang got two sacks, the second forcing a fumble by  
quarterback Rick Mirer that was recovered by Dan Wilkinson at the 
New York 21. Davis scored from the 7 for a 27-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to make something happen,'' Davis said. ``I think we  
just relaxed as a unit and then we scored some points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Williams' 81-yard kickoff return set up the Jets at the  
Washington 16, and a TD pass to Keyshawn Johnson was overruled. 
Hall made a 34-yard field goal, but Washington recovered the 
on-side kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm biting my lip,'' Parcells said. ``The is the first time in  
many years I have to bite my lip over what went on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins, who yielded a league-worst 457 yards in each of  
their first two games, allowed 337 -- not great, but good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were real mad today and we got ticked off on that very  
first drive,'' Lang said of the unit that gave up a 35-yard 
touchdown catch by Dedric Ward. ``We were just not going to let 
this happen again. After that, we got it together and decided we 
were going to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After sputtering early, Washington's prolific offense finally  
awakened midway through the second quarter, helped greatly by an 
illegal contact penalty against backup cornerback Marcus Coleman on 
third down. Johnson found Stephen Alexander for passes of 21, 15 
and 20 yards before Brett Conway hit a 26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Skins came right back on their next possession. Johnson beat  
a blitz to find Connell for 34 yards after he hooked up with 
Westbrook for 29. Davis scored from the 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway's 50-yard field goal on the first series of the second  
half made it 13-7. But then the Redskins went silent with the ball 
until late in the fourth period, when they again were aided by 
Jets' miscues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not good enough, and it's very evident right now,''  
Mawae said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Washington had three sacks heading into the game, and Lang  
equaled that by himself, giving him four this season. The other 
sacks Sunday were by Dana Stubblefield, Dan Wilkinson and Ndukwe 
Kalu ... Mirer's touchdown pass was his first since Dec. 15, 1996, 
while with Seattle ... Mirer finished 17-for-31 for 227 yards and 
one interception. Johnson was 17-for-28 for 241 yards ... Davis, 
who entered the game with 235 yards, rushed for 93 ... Jets tight 
end Fred Baxter sustained a hip flexor, the only injury in the 
game.

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong aftershock rocked Taiwan today,  
killing three people, injuring 58 others and collapsing several 
buildings weakened by the killer quake that struck six days 
earlier. People donned motorcycle helmets and huddled in safe, open 
spaces after the 8 a.m. aftershock, which registered a 6.5 
magnitude. Killed today were an 18-year-old man and a 25-year-old 
woman whose car was buried in a landslide triggered by the 
aftershock. A third unidentified person was also killed.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Seven people were killed and 19 injured in  
a seven-hour battle between left-wing inmates and guards at an 
Ankara prison today, the Anatolia news agency reported. Guards at 
Ulucanlar prison were searching for weapons and trying to transfer 
some prisoners when the fighting began. Security forces fired tear 
gas at inmates and barricaded roads to the area. No other details 
were immediately available. Turkish police have little control over 
the country's overcrowded prisons and it is not uncommon for 
inmates to have weapons and cellular phones.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Courts Hispanic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Some Hispanic Democrats who met with  
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley on Sunday said he is better 
suited than Vice President Al Gore to face GOP front-runner George 
W. Bush in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always admired Bill Bradley,'' said Gus Garcia of Austin,  
one of two dozen Tejano Democrats who met with the former New 
Jersey senator at a San Antonio hotel for a question-and-answer 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not 'Is Gore a good guy?', but 'Who is best  
for the country?''' said Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley received the endorsement of retiring New York Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan last week. Asked why he preferred Bradley 
over Gore, Moynihan responded simply, ``Nothing is the matter with 
Gore, but he can't be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who served three terms as a New Jersey senator and  
spent time with Moynihan on the Senate Finance Committee, 
downplayed the endorsement, saying, ``I respect Senator Moynihan a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats and Republicans will ask when voting, 'Who do I  
trust?''' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia alluded to the fact that Gore's ties to the scandals of  
the Clinton administration hurt his chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton can walk his way through that,'' he said of the lame  
duck president. ``Gore cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A flier distributed by some Tejano Democrats also centered on  
who is best to lead the fight for the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are both good men and good Democrats,'' the flier said.  
``Both have served America with distinction and honor. The question 
is not who is the better Democrat ... but instead, who is the 
better Democrat to defeat Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Bradley gaining on his rival. New polls in New  
Hampshire show Bradley in a dead heat with Gore. Gore holds big 
leads elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tejano Democrats plan to endorse a nominee in January, said  
Gonzalo Barrientos, chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's trip to San Antonio, the candidate's fourth to Texas,  
gave him another chance to court Hispanics.

<HEADLINE> Wolverines Make Case for Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Lloyd Carr can't decide whether his  
Michigan Wolverines are getting more or less national respect than 
they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, they made believers out of Wisconsin on Saturday  
with a fierce defensive performance. 
</P>
<P>
	With a similar effort against pass-happy Purdue next weekend,  
the Wolverines will prove their defense is among the nation's best 
-- maybe even good enough to carry an inconsistent offense to a 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely proud of our football team,'' Carr said after  
Michigan stuffed Ron Dayne and beat Wisconsin 21-16. ``Do we have 
improvement to make? Yes, we do. But you can't tell me this isn't 
an outstanding win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But moments later, when Carr was asked if his team is worthy of  
its No. 4 ranking, he changed his tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of undefeated teams better than we are,'' he  
said. ``We're just trying to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were few doubters at Camp Randall Stadium, where the  
Wolverines held Dayne to zero rushing yards in the second half. 
Michigan had trouble running but scored with a sharp, careful 
passing game and a little trickery. 
</P>
<P>
	With a defense this fearsome and two strong-armed quarterbacks  
having their best seasons, the Wolverines feel ready to take on 
anyone. No. 11 Purdue and its own Heisman Trophy hopeful, 
quarterback Drew Brees, visit Michigan Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we won't get outworked against anybody, because that's  
Michigan football,'' linebacker Ian Gold said. ``We aren't trying 
to impress anyone. We compete against ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin entered the game averaging 291.7 rushing yards a game,  
the fifth-highest total in the country. The Wolverines allowed just 
125 yards on 36 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne had 88 yards in the first half, including a 34-yard  
touchdown run that he made by breaking two tackles at the line of 
scrimmage and running untouched to the end zone late in the second 
quarter. The run seemed to energize the Wolverines, and those yards 
were the last positive numbers of Dayne's afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We forgot to wrap up, and it cost us,'' cornerback James  
Whitley said. ``We looked at each other and made sure it didn't 
happen again. We didn't want him to get the Heisman against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the Wolverines still have problems, most  
specifically with a running game that can't seem to move the ball 
against anyone. The Badgers stuffed tailback Anthony Thomas and the 
Wolverines managed just 94 rushing yards, 45 of which came on a 
double-reverse to receiver David Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michigan threw the ball effectively against a solid Badgers  
pass defense. The Wolverines used several four-receiver sets, and 
six players caught passes for 257 yards, including seven for 88 
yards by Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan also showed that intangible knack for making big plays.  
The Wolverines' 10-play, 91-yard drive in the third quarter that 
produced the winning touchdown was propelled by a 39-yard pass from 
Brady to Marcus Knight and a 23-yard TD pass that DiAllo Johnson 
caught in double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came down to them making more plays,'' Wisconsin coach  
Barry Alvarez said. ``Big games like this are about big plays, and 
they made the most big plays.''

few minutes of trading. There were 396 companies falling -- 
including the crucial high-tech manufacturers. Only 50 stocks were 
up, mainly of companies that sell materials like cement and glass

<HEADLINE> 50 Die in Mexico Fireworks Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A series of explosions ripped through a  
crowded area of street stalls and shops across from a downtown bus 
station Sunday in the central Mexican city of Celaya, killing about 
50 people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports said the tragedy apparently began when a fireworks  
storehouse exploded about 10:30 a.m. A few minutes later there was 
a second large blast, which some reports said was caused by 
exploding cooking gas tanks at a nearby restaurant and other 
reports blamed on more exploding fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	The second explosion apparently trapped some rescuers who had  
responded to the first blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very big tragedy,'' Mayor Ricardo Suarez said in an  
interview with the national TV Azteca network. 
</P>
<P>
	State spokesman Francisco Aguilar said 50 people were confirmed  
dead and 76 others injured. Troops were called in to help police 
evacuate residents and to seal off an eight-block area around the 
explosions as rescue workers searched for more victims in this 
industrial city 120 miles northwest of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those reported dead were a police officer, two Red Cross  
workers, two fire fighters, a local reporter and four children. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity was cut to the city center and gasoline sales were  
halted at several stations, according to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents feared the possibility of more explosions in the area,  
still hot from the fire, because of the presence of numerous 
clandestine fireworks factories, local reporter Rafael Pinzon told 
Mexico City's Formato 21 radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear if the shop where the initial blast  
occurred was a legal business. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinzon said local radio stations were calling for donations of  
picks and shovels to help overwhelmed rescue workers in the city, 
whose factories, some owned by U.S. corporations, produce clothing, 
metal stampings and stove parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ramon Martin flew to the city and appealed urged residents  
to keep ``cool heads'' during rescue efforts.

<HEADLINE> Corning Unveils Optical Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- A single strand of optical fiber can handle  
5 million telephone conversations at once, or up to 320 billion 
bits of voice, video or Internet traffic each second. 
</P>
<P>
	In just 15 years, 120 million miles of fiber-optic cable have  
been installed worldwide. That much alone can handle more 
information than all the billions of miles of copper wiring laid 
down over the last century. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, the networks connecting phones and computers might use  
light from end to end in place of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	That dazzling Information Age notion inched closer to reality  
recently with Corning Inc.'s unveiling of two prototypes of a key 
component in this hyper-speed technology: the optical switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning, which invented optical fiber in 1970, said it will soon  
begin selling optical switches aimed at replacing electronic 
counterparts that slow down calls on high-capacity fiber-optic 
grids. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go to a full-blown, transparent optical network, there's a  
lot of things that have to happen ... and this is one step along 
that path,'' said Mark Thomas, an optical components analyst for 
RHK Inc. in South San Francisco, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A few dozen companies are jostling to make headway in the  
optical-switch market. A much bigger step will be creating the 
optical version of a more complex and general-purpose switching 
system known as the cross-connect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corning models are the latest in an emerging variety of  
switches known as reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers that 
operate more flexibly and reliably by working directly with light 
passing through optic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiber optics, coded electrical signals are turned into laser  
light pulses that travel great distances through ultra-pure glass 
fibers and then are converted back to electricity to power 
communications receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	When data has to be rerouted, say from a cross-country grid into  
a slower regional phone network, today's electronic switches must 
convert the laser signals into electricity, redirect them and then 
convert them back into light. Optical devices that divide and 
combine the light signals should perform far more cheaply and 
quickly, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Corning's products offer ``greater sophistication and high  
reliability,'' said James Frodsham, an optical networks marketing 
manager at Nortel in Ottawa, Canada. ``They are extending the 
vision of the all-optical network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aimed at both long-haul and metropolitan systems, the switches  
could begin to be installed as early as next year, said David 
Charlton, a manager in Corning's optical networking devices unit. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alternative technologies being explored by Corning  
and rivals like Lucent Technologies is the MEMS system -- 
microelectronic mechanical switches that use thousands of 
infinitesimal mirrors to direct light. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in western New York, Corning is the world's leading maker  
of optical fiber. Optical fiber and photonics components now 
account for half its sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan each scored  
two goals Sunday as the United States overwhelmed Brazil 6-0 in an 
exhibition game that was rematch of the women's World Cup 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Parlow and Danielle Fotopoulos added goals and Kristine  
Lilly had three assists to help the United States improve to 
100-8-8 in five years under coach Tony DiCicco. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also was the 22nd of 1999 for the Americans, tying  
the 1998 team for most in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike America's 2-0 shutout of Brazil in the World Cup  
semifinals on July 4, Sunday's game had little suspense. Even 
without leading scorer Mia Hamm (strained hamstring) and goalkeeper 
Briana Scurry (hip twinge), the United States controlled the game 
from the opening kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett beat three Brazil defenders to open the scoring in the  
29th minute, and MacMillan followed five minutes later on a bizarre 
sequence that started when Brazil goalkeeper Andreia was whistled 
for illegally picking up the ball after receiving a pass from a 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	While several Brazil players, including Andreia, argued with  
American referee Sandy Hunt, Lilly grabbed the ball and made a 
quick pass to MacMillan for what amounted to an empty net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians had limited scoring chances and were outshot  
15-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the second for the United States since its  
captivating run to the World Cup title this summer. The Americans 
beat Ireland 5-0 in Foxboro, Mass., on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 people watched that game, and the attendance  
Sunday at Mile High Stadium was 25,099. Several fans brought 
tablecloth-sized American flags and a handful of girls dyed their 
hair red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the game was an exhibition, both teams treated it like  
something bigger, combining for four yellow cards and countless 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan and Brazil defender Fanta argued briefly after getting  
tangled up early in the second half. They will get a chance to 
resume the conversation next month during the four-team U.S. 
Women's Cup '99.

<HEADLINE> Duval Finally Shows His Stuff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- David Duval got his compensation after  
all. 
</P>
<P>
	With his triumphant match Sunday in the Ryder Cup, he had the  
thrill of a career, he had fans, he had international fame. And he 
had one more chance to talk about money from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never about compensation. It was about money going to  
charity,'' Duval said. ``The word 'compensation' was used and it 
just snowballed from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was talking about the controversy he helped create when he  
brought up the issue earlier this year of how Ryder Cup money is 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it was Ryder Cup Sunday and he was speaking as the  
winner in an important match, one of those that helped the 
Americans pull off a thrilling comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Much had changed for Duval as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had some things said to me that weren't particularly nice,''  
Duval said as a crowd roared approval after he won his match 
against Jesper Parnevik on the 14th hole. ``At times, I thought I 
was on the European side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	After closing out Parnevik with a short putt, Duval circled the  
green three times, punching clenched fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had ever experienced a fan reaction like that, the  
No. 2 player in the world said, simply, `No,' and shortly 
thereafter gave a final pump to the crowd as if to confirm what had 
seemed so improbable just a day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had spoken at an emotional team meeting the night before,  
when, Hal Sutton said, everyone cried. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was down an almost hopeless 10-6 and few thought it  
conceivable the Americans would go on to win, 14 1/2-13 1/2, the greatest 
come-from-behind victory in the 72-year history of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `I think we're better and let's go kill them,'''  
Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had also spoken at a meeting earlier in the week, telling  
his teammates he was tired of being misrepresented as the guy who 
wanted players to profit from the Ryder Cup. He said he was only 
seeking a say in how the money, which goes to the PGA, was 
distributed to charity. He told them he was happy to be there and 
to be representing his country. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval on Sunday showed as much emotion as he ever has on tour  
and played with the skill to match it when he defeated Parnevik 5 
and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was too bad Parnevik, a friend from the tour, had to  
lose so soundly after forming such a potent two-man team with 
Sergio Garcia on the first two days of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry it had to happen,'' Duval said, ``but I sure am  
proud of it.''

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Surge Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices nationwide surged more than  
1 1/2 cents in the past two weeks because crude oil prices continue to 
increase, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average nationwide as of Friday was $1.3341, up  
1.63 cents per gallon from a Sept. 10 survey, said Trilby Lundberg, 
who directs the Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-cent-a-gallon dip, however, occurred in the West, which  
continues to recover from a gas shortage prompted by Northern 
California refinery fires in the spring, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price hike in most areas resulted from crude oil prices that  
have jumped by more than $1.20 per barrel, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lundberg survey showed a national average price for self  
service regular unleaded gasoline of $1.2817. Mid-grade unleaded 
was $1.3803 and premium unleaded was $1.4652. 
</P>
<P>
	For full service regular unleaded, the survey showed the average  
price was $1.6112 with mid-grade at $1.6976 and premium at $1.7720. 
That compares with average prices in the West on Friday of $1.3876 
for self-serve regular, falling from $1.4311 on Sept. 10, Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's Bay Area still reports the nation's highest  
average prices, Lundberg said. Self-serve regular unleaded was 
$1.5813, compared with $1.6315 on Sept. 10, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has the nation's lowest average price with self-serve  
regular unleaded at $1.1151 and the Midwest showed a price hike 
higher than the national average, rising from $1.2356 on Sept. 10 
to $1.2763 on Friday, Lundberg said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Mining Co. To Bid for Asarco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Grupo Mexico, Mexico's largest mining  
company, announced plans to make a bid to acquire U.S. mining 
concern Asarco Inc., entering a three-party merger battle already 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Mexican Stock Exchange on Friday, Grupo  
Mexico said the offer will be made through its recently formed 
Delaware-based subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico, which has a 10 percent stake in Asarco, said it  
will offer to buy all of Asarco's common shares it doesn't already 
own for $26 a share. That would be a 10 percent premium over 
Asarco's Friday closing share price of $23.56 1/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico said the offer, agreed to at a board of directors  
meeting Friday afternoon, was based on the condition that existing 
Asarco shareholders offer to sell enough shares to give Grupo 
Mexico at least an 80 percent stake in Asarco, including the 3.9 
million shares it already owns. The offer is also subject to 
necessary approval under U.S. laws and Asarco statutes, Grupo 
Mexico added. 
</P>
<P>
	If the offer is successful, Asarco would be merged with Grupo  
Mexico's new Delaware-based unit and become a subsidiary of Grupo 
Mexico, the world's fourth-largest silver producer, sixth-largest 
zinc producer and 10th-largest copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grupo Mexico offer is about $1.29 per share, or $51 million,  
more than a competing cash and stock bid by Phelps Dodge Corp. to 
acquire Asarco, based on Friday's closing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge Corp. received antitrust clearance Friday for its  
proposed offer to buy both Asarco and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. for 
$2.83 billion, in a deal that would merge three of the nation's 
four largest copper companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cyprus Amax and Asarco boards have resisted the offer and  
instead plan to push ahead their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders for Cyprus Amax, based in Englewood, Colo., and  
Asarco, based in New York, are scheduled to vote on their two-way 
deal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge shares were down $1.93 3/4 on Friday, to $54.56 1/4 on  
the NYSE. Cyprus Amax shares were down 18 3/4 cents, at $18.62 1/2, also 
on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff's Web Site Attacks Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida sheriff is using his official  
government Web site to denounce abortion and attack gays, 
feminists, atheists and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	After quoting the preamble to the U.S. Constitution, Lee County  
Sheriff John McDougall takes a stab at what he calls ``the 
diabolical forces of moral corruption'' -- Planned Parenthood, 
politicians, liberal judges, cyber-porn, music videos and ``United 
Nations one-world government radicals,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our disgrace as a nation we have caved into the wishes of  
the depraved,'' he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougall, 57, said he posted the letter as a crime prevention  
document about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get the message out there,'' McDougall told the  
Fort Myers News-Press for Saturday's editions. ``As a nation, we're 
dissolving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida attorney general's office wouldn't comment on the  
legality of McDougall's use of government property to express 
personal views. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee County Commissioner John Manning said McDougall is entitled  
to his views, ``but when it comes to taxpayers paying for the Web 
site, there has to be a question ... of the appropriateness of that 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDougall isn't new to controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	When rapper Ice-T released his 1992 song ``Cop Killer,''  
McDougall tried to have him charged with sedition. 
</P>
<P>
	When an abortion provider asked McDougall for protection from  
protesters, McDougall said he would protect the doctor's free 
speech as he would protect ``a baby killer like yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Florida, called the sheriff's latest letter distressing 
and said McDougall needs to brush up on the protections afforded by 
U.S. law.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Prevents Flu Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An inhaled prescription drug being  
introduced next month is nearly 80 percent effective in keeping 
family members from getting the flu bug when a relative brings it 
home, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, called Relenza, is a powder spray inhaled through  
the mouth that has already been proven to reduce the duration of a 
bout of flu by a day or two. The study released Sunday shows it 
also cuts the chances of catching the flu from an ill relative by 
79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is the first of a new class of anti-viral medicines  
that are effective against both major strains of the disease, known 
as influenza A and B. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are a major step forward,'' said Dr. Frederick  
Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. ``The 
latest data show that they clearly work for prevention, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved in July by the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration and is made by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. The company says 
the drug will be on drugstore shelves Friday. The wholesale cost 
for enough to treat one bout of flu will be $37. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden presented the latest data at a meeting of the American  
Society of Microbiology, as well as a report on another drug that 
is the first to shorten a bout of the common cold. Glaxo Wellcome 
paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the  
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is the best 
way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help when 
people fail to get the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, youngsters bring home the flu to their parents and  
siblings from school and day care. The latest experiment was 
intended to see if family members could be protected by taking 
Relenza at the first sign of flu in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 975 families with school-age children volunteered to  
participate in the study. Between December and March, 337 of these 
families had a case of flu. The sick person and the rest of the 
family were randomly assigned to get either the drug or a 
look-alike dummy spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 4 percent of the folks in the families getting Relenza  
came down with the flu, compared with 19 percent in the untreated 
comparison families. Even when they did get sick, their disease 
appeared to be far milder. Flu in the Relenza-treated family 
members typically lasted three days, compared with about six days 
in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important aspect of the drug that could reduce the  
burden of influenza,'' said Dr. William Craig of the University of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza will be the first of a new class of flu medicines known  
as neuraminidase inhibitors to reach the market. However, 
Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, a similar medicine in pill form, is 
expected to be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to these medicines is that they must be started  
within the first day or two of symptoms to have any effect on the 
disease. Most people don't call their doctor at the first twinge of 
flu's body ache, and they probably could not get an instant 
appointment, even if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said drug companies will have to convince both physicians  
and patients to look at flu differently, now that medicines are 
available to both treat the disease and prevent it. For instance, 
he said doctors may eventually become willing to prescribe the 
drugs over the phone without seeing patients if they report typical 
flu miseries during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report to the conference Sunday, Hayden described the  
results of a study of pleconaril, an experimental medicine for the 
common cold. The medicine was developed by Viropharma Inc. of 
Exton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested it on 1,024 people and found that it shortened  
the length of a typical moderate-to-severe cold from 14 days to 
10 1/2. They looked at various measures of a cold's severity, 
including the number of tissues used. Their count: Pleconaril 
reduced the number of tissues needed by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Blasts Bush Over Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- GOP front-runner George W. Bush decided  
to attend the Ryder Cup over the weekend instead of the California 
Republican Party convention, prompting one rival to accuse him of 
``cowering in the bushes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it kind of strange that somebody whose people keep  
telling us he's got it all sewed up is showing up absent at so many 
important party meetings and has been contriving to try to destroy 
all of the venues of debate that ought to be taking place in this 
season,'' radio host Alan Keyes said at a convention news 
conference Sunday. ``What's he afraid of?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes added: ``If the term `mediocrity' does not apply to Mr.  
Bush, let him come out here and prove it. Because last time I 
looked, all the money in the world doesn't make you a superior 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said the governor passed up the GOP gathering in the  
nation's largest state to attend a Hispanic meeting and the golf 
tournament in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Keyes, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole were the only  
presidential candidates to attend the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to convention delegates, Keyes sharply criticized  
Republican voters who were lining up behind candidates they 
perceive as the likely winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are people in this room who will actually and go  
out and stand for the mindless, mediocre equivocators who put our 
principles on the back burner while promising that they will 
achieve everything under the sun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Keyes said his repeated references to unnamed ``mediocre  
equivocators'' was not necessary directed at Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes also predicted that rival Pat Buchanan's possible  
departure from the Republican Party would send conservative 
Republicans into his camp.

<HEADLINE> NFL Injury Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The last thing the Atlanta Falcons needed was another injury.  
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Chris Chandler was helped off the field after  
reaggravating a hamstring injury in the second quarter of Sunday's 
35-7 loss to the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was injured without contact with 3:13 to go and the  
Falcons trailing 28-0. After making a couple of pump fakes and 
scrambling, he crumpled to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed the Falcons' second game, a loss to Dallas, with  
a hamstring injury sustained in the their season-opening defeat to 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent about two weeks resting it and rehabbing it, but it  
doesn't seem to be getting any better,'' Chandler said. ``Hopefully 
it will come back, but I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Monday night loss to the Cowboys that Chandler missed,  
Falcons lost All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson to a season-ending 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Things also got worse for Cincinnati (0-3) when Ki-Jana Carter,  
the oft-injured first overall pick in the 1995 draft, went down 
again, this time with a dislocated right kneecap in the first 
quarter of the Bengals' 27-3 loss to Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers lost center Frank Garcia, who left in the second  
quarter with a concussion and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Chiefs, despite a 31-21 victory over previously  
unbeaten Detroit, were down to their third-team halfback in the 
second half. Bam Morris, starting in place of Kimble Anders, went 
out with a hamstring injury. Rookie Rashaan Shehee replaced Morris 
and scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Chargers lost two defensive backs while getting  
buried under 404 passing yards by Peyton Manning of Indianapolis in 
a 27-19 Colts victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Rodney Harrison strained his right hamstring and  
cornerback Terrance Shaw sprained his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguars defensive lineman Renaldo Wynn left Jacksonville's 20-17  
loss to Tennessee in the second quarter with an injured left ankle 
after Titans guard Scott Sanderson rolled into the back of Wynn's 
leg. Titans tight end Jackie Harris left with a strained hamstring, 
and Jaguars receiver Reggie Barlow left after suffering a 
concussion.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Encarnacion Hurt by Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit outfielder Juan Encarnacion, bleeding  
profusely, had to be helped from the field after being hit in the 
face by a pitch from Kansas City right-hander Blake Stein on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays taken at Henry Ford Hospital showed he has a fractured  
left cheekbone and a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-inning pitch was up and in on Encarnacion, a  
right-handed batter. As he began backing away from the plate, 
Encarnacion turned his face into the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	A large pool of blood formed on a light blue towel placed under  
Encarnacion's head by trainer Russ Miller. After a few minutes, 
Encarnacion was helped to his feet and rode off the field on the 
side of a cart with a stretcher on board. He was sitting up but 
leaning on Miller.

<HEADLINE> Specter: Dems Could Join Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican senator leading a special  
investigation of the Justice Department said Sunday he was 
confident Democrats eventually would join his task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said last week they would not participate in what they  
said was partisan investigation of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do expect the Democrats to join,'' Sen. Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., said on ``Fox News Sunday. ``Our staffs were working 
together on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was named by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to  
head the five-member panel that will review the Justice 
Department's handling of issues such as the Waco siege, alleged 
Chinese spying at nuclear weapons labs, and campaign finance 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he had worked well in the past with Sen. Patrick  
Leahy, who would lead the Democrats, ``so I think that we'll iron 
out the concerns and work in a bipartisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls Sunday to the home and office of a spokesman for Leahy,  
D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, went 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Leahy said the proposed panel of three Republicans  
and two Democrats had been set up over Democratic objections and 
``I don't intend to be part of a Republican-organized, partisan 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter already has drawn complaints from former Sen. John  
Danforth, who was named by Attorney General Janet Reno to head an 
independent inquiry into the FBI siege of the Branch Davidian cult. 
</P>
<P>
	After Specter sent aides to Texas to preserve evidence collected  
from the incident, Danforth asked him to hold off for 30 days 
before talking to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me to forebear for 30 days, and I thought it over and  
decided to do that,'' Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said there were also ``real questions as to whether it's  
advisable to hire Chuck LaBella'' to lead the panel's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella is a former Justice Department prosecutor who publicly  
disagreed with Reno's decision not to hire an independent counsel 
to investigate alleged fund-raising abuses by the 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he was aware of concerns of a conflict of interest  
and ``I'm not going to make a judgment on that until I discuss it 
with Sen. Leahy and other Democrats.''
