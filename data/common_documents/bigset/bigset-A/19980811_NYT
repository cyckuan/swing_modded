HACKETT'S FAST PACE A CHANGE FOR TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC coach Paul Hackett chose some familiar
adjectives as his first official day of training camp concluded
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enthusiasm. Energy. Positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those were Hackett's quick impressions on day one of USC's
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The same could also be said of Hackett, who constantly paced
around the practice fields, supervising drills. He's walking so
much that he wears a pedometer to record the distance he travels
each day to determine if it will serve as sufficient exercise.
</P>
<P>
   If Hackett's constant energy is a change for the Trojans, his
decision to hold camp at UC Irvine certainly has shaken the team
out of its regular routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change of pace,'' linebacker David Gibson said. ``This
year we're trying to do a lot of things different and this is the
start of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So were there any surprises on day one?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carson Palmer had an excellent first day and Jason
Thomas made a nice recovery from when he couldn't go,'' Hackett
said, referring to his true-freshman quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas missed the morning practice after spraining his ankle
during Saturday's freshman workout but returned in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rendon suspended: Senior kicker Adam Rendon has been
indefinitely suspended and will not attend training camp, Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out,'' Hackett said. ``I'll visit where we are when we
get back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is not academic-related, and involves violating
team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another kicker, Jeff Weichman of Santa Monica, is no longer with
the program after being sidelined with colitis.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: As usual, there were a few players nursing
minor injuries as camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chris Claiborne is practicing only once a day to rest
a sore knee. Center Matt McShane and tackle Ken Bowen did not
practice Monday. McShane hurt his shoulder trying to move furniture
in his apartment; Bowen is sore after his car was rear-ended over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darnell Lacy, who was academically suspended from the
Purdue game, has a herniated disc and might not return until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Antuan Simmons did not practice because he needed to
take his physical in Los Angeles. Offensive guard David Pratchard
of Canyon High School practiced in the afternoon session; he is
recovering from offseason back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're OK. There's a couple of bumps and bruises,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Receiver woes: With Rod Perry transferring and Windrell
Hayes' arrival pending, Hackett said he is concerned over the
Trojans' dwindling numbers at wide receiver. Since USC has a glut
of running backs, Hackett said he might move one over to receiver _
at least for practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get by with eight to 10 receivers,'' Hackett said.
``We need 15.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward speaks: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward's self-imposed
media blackout lasted all of 24 hours before he reversed field and
again spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' a good-natured Soward said, after being told
by officials it would be wiser to speak than remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   __ Goux returns: Among those attending the first day of practice
was longtime USC assistant Marv Goux, who served on the staff with
Hackett in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   __ Iacenda ready: Fullback Ted Iacenda of Hart has completely
recovered from a pair of shoulder operations and will be ready to
participate when full contact drills begin Thursday. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

ANGELS ACQUIRE FETTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels continued to make changes
to their roster Monday, some by choice and others out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   They acquired right-handed relief pitcher Mike Fetters from the
Oakland A's for a player to be named later and an undisclosed
amount of cash. Fetters is expected to join the Angels today in
Detroit, at which time they'll have to move somebody off the roster
to make room for him.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Fetters' second run with the Angels, having played
for them in 1989-91 before being traded to Milwaukee for pitcher
Chuck Crim after the 1991 season. He spent six seasons with the
Brewers, his best season coming in 1996 when he was 3-3 with a 3.38
ERA and 32 saves.
</P>
<P>
   This season with the A's, Fetters was 1-6 with a 3.99 ERA and
five saves in 48 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also placed first baseman/outfielder Darin Erstad and
infielder Dave Hollins on the disabled list. Erstad has a strained
left hamstring and Hollins an inflamed right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Erstad and Hollins on the roster are first baseman
Chris Pritchett and outfielder Reggie Williams, who were promoted
from Triple-A Vancouver. Pritchett was hitting .264 with six homers
and 39 RBI for the Canadians; Williams was hitting .282 with five
homers, 25 doubles and 39 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make room for Pritchett and Williams on the 40-man
roster, the Angels designated Frank Bolick and Damon Mashore for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had played in every game this season but hurt his
hamstring beating out an infield hit against the Indians on Aug. 4.
He's hitting .303 with 19 homers and 68 RBI. Hollins, who has been
bothered by his shoulder since May, is hitting .242 with 11 homers
and 39 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In more encouraging news for the Angels, designated hitter Tim
Salmon was named the American League player of the week after
hitting .480 with four homers and nine RBI.

TRADE WAS TOUGH ON JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was the cornerstone of a franchise, a catcher
with exceptional skills, home-grown and full of promise, the symbol
of a city's baseball hopes and dreams. In time, he was expected to
bring a fistful of World Series rings home and an era would be
defined by his name.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was unceremoniously jettisoned, traded 3,000 miles away.
Incensed fans cursed the corporate suits who cut the deal and
mourned the departure of their irreplaceable hero.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza?
</P>
<P>
   No, Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marlins traded Johnson to the Dodgers in the May 15
deal for Piazza, Florida fans lost more than the best defensive
catcher in the game. They lost a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Fort Pierce, Fla. Played at University of Miami.
Became the expansion Marlins' first-ever first-round draft pick in
1992 and proclaimed, ``This is like a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from their farm system and immediately began
collecting Gold Gloves upon entering the majors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He belonged to us. He was one of us,'' a Miami columnist
eulogized at the time of the trade. ``He should have been the one
Marlin deemed untouchable in the fire sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotions ran deep for Johnson, too. And will again today,
when he faces his old team _ what's left of it, anyway _ for the
first time as the Marlins arrive for a three-game series at Dodger
Stadium. Johnson will then make his first return to Florida for a
two-game set next Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be very exciting,'' Johnson said. ``It's the place
where I grew up and had a chance to make it to the big leagues with
the Marlins. And the fans are great there. They treated me well.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the trade that shook major-league baseball
and two franchises, Johnson is sentimental about Florida but
grateful to be playing for a team with money to spend, a commitment
to winning and a realistic shot at the postseason. His old team is
sporting a league-low $6 million payroll, and the fairy tale that
took the Marlins to the World Series has become a B-grade horror
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The trade saved Johnson from a season of agony. But it also
pulled him a continent away from home, from his parents and from
his baseball roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Johnson said. ``But once I got out here, I
realized it's a better situation for me, because I have a chance to
contend here. The Marlins, they were in the process of getting rid
of all their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Johnson, shipped along with Gary Sheffield, Bobby
Bonilla and Jim Eisenreich to the Dodgers for (temporarily) Piazza
and Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Marlins in the process of dismantling, Johnson
hoped he might survive the salary purge and remain a Marlin, for
obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family,'' he said. ``My wife was eight months pregnant and
I was pulling her away from her family. And my mom and dad live
down there. It was difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything is settling into place for Johnson now. Rhonda
Johnson gave birth to Brandon, the couple's first child, July 27.
And the personal and professional challenges associated with the
move have begun to fade into the background. Not coincidentally,
Johnson's offensive game _ criticized by some fans and critics of
the trade _ is coming around.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, Johnson had hit safely in 12 of his previous 21
games, batting .257 during the stretch. He hit his 16th home run in
Friday's win over Pittsburgh and went 3 for 4, with the game-tying
RBI, in Saturday's victory over the Pirates (``A very good sign,''
said manager Glenn Hoffman). His batting average for the season is
.209, but while fans fret, teammates are unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's down on his hitting, but the guy can hit,''
pitcher Darren Dreifort said. ``He was in a slump when we first got
him, but you've got to understand the transition that he went
through, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got rid of Piazza, what's he done offensively? He's got 20
home runs right now, CJ's got 16,'' Dreifort said. ``Just leave him
alone and let him hit. He'll hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Dodgers expected a .300-30-100 guy when they
obtained Johnson, a defensive gem but career .241 hitter. The job
of replacing Piazza's offense fell to Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who understood the game, they understood the trade,''
Johnson said. ``I didn't come by myself. So it was disappointing
that some people didn't realize that, but at the same time, the
players understood the trade... I came here to do what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Namely, defense. Throwing out 30-plus percent of baserunners,
blocking pitches in the dirt, calling the right pitches. The
result: Dodgers pitchers have a 3.62 ERA in their last 76 games and
have lowered the staff ERA from 4.10 on May 15 to 3.77 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just exceptional at everything he does back there,''
Dreifort said. ``He calls a great game, he mixes up the pitches,
location-wise he mixes it up real well. He's always thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Johnson will be thinking about his past as he steps onto
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I wanted to stay (in Florida),'' Johnson admited.
``I mean, that's my home. Who would have dreamt that this would
happen to the Marlins? But that's baseball. Baseball's all about
adjustments and you just learn to adjust.''

YOUNGER MANNING RAISES EYEBROWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ His father is the most revered football
player in the history of the University of Mississippi. And for the
past four years his brother turned the University of Tennessee into
Peyton's Place.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are that Eli Manning, a senior quarterback at
Cardinal Isidore Newman High in New Orleans, won't be spending his
college days in Knoxville, Tenn., or Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eli is his own person,'' said Archie Manning, Eli's father,
All-American at Ole Miss and former NFL veteran. ``It will be
strictly his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the favorite to land the 6-5, 185-pounder comes
from among Texas, LSU, Florida State or Ole Miss. But Eli has a
wish list of 10 to 15 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for the best fit for me,'' said Eli, who turns 18
in January. ``It doesn't matter if it's north, west, east or
south.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Eli will equal Peyton's accomplishments _ including
challenging for a Heisman Trophy and becoming a first round NFL
draft pick _ remains to be seen. But, at this point, Eli, who
sports a B average and 1,070 score on the SAT, compares favorably
physically and statistically to his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Peyton threw for 7,190 yards and 92 touchdowns
in his three years as a starter. In his two seasons, Eli, who's an
an inch taller than his brother at the same stage, has compiled
4,887 yards and 50 touchdowns for the Division 2-A (the second
smallest) private school in an upscale section of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect this type of quarterback to come through your
school,'' said Tony Reginelli, Cardinal Newman's athletic director
and former coach. ``And you sure don't expect it twice. It's
unheard of, really. Both kids are once-in-a-lifetime kids.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Another son rising Another sought-after quarterback with a
well-known surname is Chris Simms of Franklin Lakes Ramapo High in
New Jersey. The 6-5, 215-pound Simms, whose father, Phil was a
Super Bowl-champion quarterback with the New York Giants, might be
the top quarterback prospect in the country. He's considering Penn
State, Ohio State, Texas, Michigan, Miami and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Buckeyes, 'Horns on roll: Ohio State and Texas continue to
lead the nation in early commitments with 11 each. But, with no
early signing period, there is plenty of time for recruits to be
swayed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Each player on Ohio State's list is from the state and all of
Mack Brown's Longhorn commitments are from Texas.

   Problems of spring &QL; 
a distant memory
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BACK in the spring, when the Astros' desperate need for pitching
help first surfaced, obvious solutions to their arms crisis simply
didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   You'd hear names, but none of them got a rise. At the time, the
Astros appeared about as far removed from the Randy Johnson raffle
as the Durham Bulls. Actually, Durham might have stood a better
chance of acquiring Johnson in March.
</P>
<P>
   The caliber of addition Houston could reasonably contemplate was
more along the lines of Bill Pulsipher, once a top Mets prospect
whose career had flatlined to the point that he was taking Prozac
to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, who has a soft spot for anything Mets after
years spent in that organization, took a hard look-see at Pulsipher
anyway, then decided to pass.
</P>
<P>
   If Chris Holt and Ramon Garcia didn't come around, the Astros'
general manager figured, surely the Astros could piece together a
viable _ albeit reed-thin _ rotation with Jose Lima, Sean Bergman
and either Pete Schourek or John Halama in support roles behind the
post-Darryl Kile co-aces, Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. They could. The Astros climbed into first place in
early May and have been ensconced there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Lima and Bergman are 10-game winners already _ the latter goes
for No. 11 tonight _ and Schourek did a serviceable job after the
rookie Halama was sent down, holding down the fort until none other
than Mr. Johnson miraculously landed in our laps.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher matches Hampton
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher ultimately made his way to Houston, although he came
wearing a Brewers uniform Monday night. He was the best Milwaukee,
the epitome of middle-market malaise, could do to bolster its staff
before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   We in Houston know how that goes, having been a have-not for too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pulsipher shut out the Astros for five innings before
giving up a two-run homer in the sixth to Moises Alou, who whacks
one of those practically every night.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher's six-inning effort was his longest stint of the
season, and he pitched at least as well as Hampton, whose
second-half doldrums have limited him to one victory since he
pulled a hamstring in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   That slump hasn't hurt, though, has it? The Astros held a
two-game lead over the Cubs the evening Hampton got hurt. It grew
to eight after Monday's 5-2 victory over Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, just another day, another comeback, another victory
provided by a home run _ Sean Berry's three-run blast in the
eighth. As manager Larry Dierker had joked the previous day, all
the winning is almost getting tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, right.
</P>
<P>
   This latest script was chock full of good stuff, an
embarrassment of riches indeed. Hampton had his best outing since
the DL hiatus, although one mistake to pinch hitter Brian Banks
cost him a chance to gain the win and possibly go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   At least he looked more like the Hampton of last year instead of
last month, when he was 1-2 with a 6.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Much closer but still no win
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all the way back,'' he said afterward, ``but it's a
start. I thought I did a pretty good job of changing speeds,
something I've been having trouble with.''
</P>
<P>
   No complaints about his offense, however. He smacked his fourth
double of the season to raise his batting average to .262. Could
there be a pinch-hit assignment ahead for him?
</P>
<P>
   Although Hampton could have used the ``W,'' Scott Elarton's
earning it in relief was a milestone _ his first as a
major-leaguer. He foretells a bright future every time he ambles to
the mound. When Johnson is long gone, Elarton may well be the
Astros' staff stud.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of studs, Billy Wagner was Billy Wagner for the second
time in two days. If there are lingering effects of his being
smacked in the ear by a vicious line drive last month, the Kid is
keeping them well hidden. He mowed down the Brewers 1-2-3 in the
ninth, striking out two for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks fine to me,'' Dierker said. ``I don't know how he
could look any better. And having Randy around is going to help
him. They're different body types, but they're the same kind of
pitcher. I've asked Randy to help him (learn to) use his slider,
and you saw that he threw it several times effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's easier to have confidence with a three-run
lead than a one-run lead. But the more he tries it, the better he's
going to get with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So here the Astros sit, 26 games over .500 and poised to put a
premature end to the division race. Amazing, considering their
angst in spring training.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Apple's iMac Is Already a Big Hit  
   
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
For Apple Computer, it's beginning to feel a lot like 1984 all over
again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple's iMac, an eye-catching new home computer that resembles
the original 1984 Macintosh in its breakthrough design and ease of
use, has already shattered the company's record for first-week
orders, with 150,000. The $1,299 computer, which sports a gently
curved aquamarine plastic case, is scheduled to ship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our single biggest product launch since 1984,'' interim
Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in a telephone interview yesterday. ``The
feedback retailers are getting for this product is the most
exciting they've seen in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer dealers also noted a steep run-up in advance orders of
the ``Internet-ready'' computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen this type of excitement from our customers
surrounding a new PC,'' CompUSA CEO Jim Halpin said in a statement.
``We think (iMac) has the potential to become one of (our)
best-selling consumer computers of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1,299 computer is targeted at the 10 million consumers who
own Macs, but have been slowly defecting to cheaper Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   While the sleek Internet terminal has won high marks for its
speed and ease of use, detractors contend it is too simple. They
criticize the iMac for lacking basic connections for printers and
other peripherals, omitting a standard floppy drive and being
difficult to customize.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its shortcomings, an estimated 400,000 units are
expected to ship by the end of September, fueling a sales spike
over the next six months and feeding a recent resurgence at Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Apple intends to stoke the flames of consumers' interest in iMac
with a major radio campaign, beginning yesterday, in which 20
stations nationwide are giving away an iMac daily until its
Saturday debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun week,'' Jobs said. ``We intend on putting tens
of thousands of these on shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The iMac is the high-tech equivalent of the New Beetle, but it
is reasonably priced,'' said Matthew Rothenberg, director of online
content for Mac Publishing, which yesterday launched iMacworld, a
Web site devoted to the new computer. ``By wedding solid
performance and a groundbreaking design, (iMac) could be a dynamite
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's turnaround _ punctuated by three straight profitable
quarters and a rising stock price _ hasn't gone unnoticed on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund giant, has
given Apple a big vote of confidence in recent months by scooping
up millions of company shares. The company last month raised its

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Apple's Chief Marketer Reveals Secret Formula Behind the iMac  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The guarded interview was almost over when Apple marketing chief
Phil Schiller leaned forward to disclose the secret formula behind
the new iMac computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a passionate _ some might say neurotic _ attention to
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many meetings we had on the trackball,''
Schiller said, ``how we passed it around to make sure it looked and
felt just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent hours debating the colors of the wires inside the
mouse cable because if you have a translucent cable, the colors of
the wires matter.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think it odd that top execs, right up to Apple interim
CEO Steve Jobs, should fuss and fret over such minutiae, then you
miss the point. To Apple, the iMac is not just another computer.
It's an electrically charged piece of industrial art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know their friends tell our customers they're crazy for
getting iMacs when PCs are cheaper,'' Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple doesn't care about the naysayers. Its target is the
passionate minority who belive that Macs are and always have been
better.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Apple's short-term future comes down to a bit of
human calculus: How many people willingly will pay more for a
computer that makes a statement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this belief in my gut it'll be more than 3 percent,''
Schiller said, referring to Apple's overall share of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Pinup boy? &LR;  Playboy photographers just finished an all-day
shoot at the Atherton mansion of Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. No,
it's not what you might think. Oracle's co-founder and fearless
leader and everyone else involved remained fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his fashion sense is why Playboy shutterbugs jetted out
here to dote on Oracle's head honcho. Playboy editor-in-chief Hugh
Hefner has selected Ellison as one of the best-dressed men in
America for a photo spread in the magazine's December issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison isn't the only Northern California notable to make the
list. Playboy photogs also caught San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
last week, at his sartorial best.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say others on the list include actors Michael Douglas,
Matthew Broderick and Will Smith, as well as talk show host Matt
Lauer and John Sikes, president of MTV.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Billion-dollar man?  &LR; Netscape Communications should be
strewing flowers in the path of former Oracle executive Barry
Ariko. News that Ariko will become Netscape's chief operating
officer sent Netscape's shares up almost 25 percent yesterday. It
closed at $31.19, a $6.13 spike.
</P>
<P>
   That made headhunter Frank Poirier of San Francisco shake his
head in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's a great exec, but no one individual warrants
that kind of increase,'' said Poirier, chalking up the spike to
``momentum buying.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems no accident that Ariko left Oracle shortly after Oracle
President Ray Lane took control of the company's U.S. sales force,
an indirect snub of Ariko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for Larry,'' Poirier said, ``but
anyone at Oracle will tell you, you're either in or out of the
inside crowd there.''
</P>
<P>
   So now Ariko, who is on the outs at Oracle, has become
Netscape's most valuable insider. Jeez, four more days like
yesterday and the whole Netscape crew can retire.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; WELL written? &LR;  If you've never gotten the proper recognition
for your cyber-musings, take heart. The WELL, the online community
based in Sausalito, will award four $500 prizes for the

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Sorting Out Cybershrinks  
   
 By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
In these cyber times, you can find love and lose it, gamble your
fortune away or shop 'til you drop a bundle _ all without leaving
your computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now can you get help there, too.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of therapists are setting up online practices
that provide counseling over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not therapy, but it can be therapeutic,'' said David
Sommers, a Kensington, Md., psychologist who went online in 1995,
one of the first to offer counsel by e-mail. Although Sommers
eventually found his Internet practice too time-consuming, more
than 100 other psychologists have since hung out electronic
shingles. That's generating controversy in psychological circles,
where many worry about the lack of controls or research on online
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The types of therapy offered online are as varied as the
therapists themselves. Besides individual psychotherapists, there
are specialists in the problems of clergy, sex offenders and police
officers. Many sites promise help with sex or relationship problems
_ and, appropriately, some even specialize in problems with online
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Some counselors answer a single question by e-mail for a fee.
Others do ongoing electronic counseling. Still others offer group
or one-on-one chats. Fees range from $15 to $45 per e-mail query.
Therapy by keyboard is no substitute for the real thing _
especially for those with serious emotional problems. (It probably
isn't much good for the Web-addicted, either.)
</P>
<P>
   But cybershrinks say their services can be helpful, especially
for people who live in remote areas, disabled people, those who
travel a lot, and those too embarrassed or rushed to see a
therapist in person.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Web therapy has provoked fierce debate among psychologists.
The American Psychological Association (APA) set up a task force to
study the issue and has scheduled two discussions on it as part of
its annual convention in San Francisco beginning this Friday.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``I think it's impossible to be ethical and provide services
to new patients via e-mail,'' said Marlene Mahue, a San Diego
psychologist and a member of the APA task force. Mahue, who
publishes the online Self-Help and Psychology Magazine at
 &LR; www.cybertowers.com/ &LR;   &LR; selfhelp &LR; , said therapists are trained to
read visual and auditory signals from patients and can't properly
evaluate people based on written text only.
</P>
<P>
   She also worries about the anonymity of the Internet _
therapists have no way of knowing exactly who it is they are
treating. Likewise, anyone can set up a Web site and purport to be
a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no supervision and no research (on Internet therapy).
People are just doing it,'' said Thomas Nagy, a Palo Alto
psychologist who teaches ethics at Stanford University's department
of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Many online shrinks share such concerns, and they urge patients
to proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the Wild West era,'' said John Grohol,
president of the newly formed International Society for Mental
Health Online. Grohol, who runs free mental health chats online at
 &LR; www.grohol.com/chats.htm &LR; , collaborated with Martha Ainsworth, a
Princeton, N.J., Internet communications counselor, on a Web site
at  &LR; www.metanoia.org  &LR; that lists online therapists and checks their
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grohol and others are still excited about the possibilities
offered by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers a great way of expanding treatment
options,'' said Jeanne Rust, a Tucson, Ariz., eating-disorders
counselor ( &LR; www.edrecovery.com &LR; ). Rust treats patients in such
far-flung spots as Australia, Malaysia and Switzerland via
real-time Internet chats. She's planning to open an
eating-disorders treatment center in Tucson that will offer two
months of online follow-up therapy.
</P>
<P>
   She also uses the Web to keep in touch with her local patients,
who e-mail her daily with lists of what they ate and how they felt
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will write me things that would take months
to say in face-to-face therapy,'' Rust said.

ELECTRO RENT SEEKS REFUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Electro Rent Corp. said it has uncovered some
``material issues'' involving the computer and test equipment
rental business it bought last year from GE Capital Technology
Management Services, and those problems dragged down Electro Rent's
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   And now Electro Rent wants a partial refund on its $239.2
million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Despite posting record 1998 fiscal profits Monday, the renter of
personal computers and test equipment said the undisclosed issues
in the balance sheet of the recently acquired business resulted in
increased costs and less-than-expected revenues for Electro Rent.
</P>
<P>
   That news sent Electro Rent shares down Monday $3.4375 to close
at $17.8125.
</P>
<P>
   The GE division, combined with the general downturn in the
overall computer industry and the ongoing Asian currency crisis,
pulled the company's bottom line below what Electro Rent officials
had anticipated, Chairman and President Daniel Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a tumultuous year and we couldn't avoid all the
fallout,'' Greenberg said. ``To that you can add the extra
complication of some unfinished business with the GE TMS
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg would not elaborate on the ``issues,'' the size of the
price reduction it seeks, nor other remedies to which Electro Rent
said it is entitled.
</P>
<P>
   John Oliver, a spokesman for Stamford, Conn.-based GE Capital,
said Monday that GE will make it plain to Electro Rent that the
sale price was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned it was a fair business, fair price
done in good faith, and we're going to make it clear and
demonstrable to any reasonable observer,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended May 31, Electro Rent posted net income of
$32.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, up 34 percent from the
prior year's $24.1 million, or 97 cents per diluted share. Total
revenues were $255.5 million, a 70 percent jump from $150.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter net income jumped 45 percent to $7.5 million (30
cents per diluted share) from $5.2 million (21 cents per diluted
share). Quarterly revenues more than doubled to $80.9 million from
$37.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too shabby,'' Greenberg said about the results.
``It's just one always wants to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had expected fourth-quarter results to be closer to
those from the third quarter, when Electro Rent posted $10.6
million (85 cents) in net income on $85.2 million in revenues,
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the first fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31 are expected
to exceed last year's $38.9 million, but net income is expected to
fall below the nearly $7 million it posted the same time last year,
because of the problems related to the GE business and the overall
weakened industry, he said.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Making A Toolbar Permanent  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:  Sometimes when ``replying to author'' of an e-mail message,   I
will get a toolbar between the header and the body of the   message
that allows me to select fonts and formatting. I can   change the
text of my reply to boldface, underline or italicize   it _ even
change the color. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  What makes the toolbar appear, and is there a way to make &LR;   &LR; it
a permanent feature of my computer? I use Windows 95 with &LR;   &LR; Outlook
Express. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By default, the formatting toolbar appears whenever you
reply to a message that was composed in HTML _ Internet programming
language that allows for the kind of formatting you described. You
also can use HTML for new messages. To display the toolbar for an
individual message, click the Format menu in the New Message
window, then choose Rich Text (HTML). To display the toolbar in all
new messages, click the Tools menu in the main Outlook Express
window, then choose Options. Click the Send tab, then select the
HTML option for the Mail Sending Format.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I have AOL but have not used it for several months &LR; 
 &LR; because I got better service via a local ISP. I have tried in &LR; 
 &LR; vain to figure out how to cancel AOL. Any suggestions? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; A:  &LR; America Online didn't get nearly 13 million subscribers
by making it easy to cancel. There is no way to do it online even
though it's a piece of cake to sign up online. Anyway, you can view
a complete list of ways to cancel by going to the keyword
``cancel.'' In the words of country singer Jo Dee Messina, ``Send a
fax or send me a letter or give me a call, that would even be
better.'' The phone number is (888) 265-8008.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I keep hearing about what a great deal shareware is. But &LR; 
 &LR; I'm not really sure what it is. Can you throw some light on the &LR; 
 &LR; subject and also tell me where I can find some shareware? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Shareware is software that you can download and try out for
free. If you like it, you're expected to buy it. Shareware includes
utilities to help manage your PC, games and programs such as image
editors.
</P>
<P>
   Most shareware costs less than regular commercial software. For
instance, I've obtained programs for my PalmPilot for as little as
$12. But just because they're inexpensive doesn't mean they're not
good. Winzip, for instance, is a $29 shareware program that many
consider the best data-compression program available.
</P>
<P>
   Good places to look for shareware include  &LR; www.shareware.com &LR; 
and &LR;  www.hotfiles.com &LR; . If you're an AOL user, you also can go to
the keyword ``shareware.'' Note that many top shareware programs
can be found in all of the shareware libraries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I've got a problem with my mouse. It keeps freezing, so &LR; 
 &LR; I can't even shut down Windows properly. Any ideas? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It could be one of several problems, says Don Miller,
product specialist for mouse-maker Logitech. But the first thing
you should do is try using the keyboard next time the mouse
freezes. If you can't, it means that your whole system is frozen
and the mouse probably isn't responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely reasons for a frozen mouse, says Miller, are a
problem with the electronic circuits inside the mouse, or a
messed-up driver (a software file that tells the computer how to
use a mouse, printer or other component).
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether the mouse is defective, see if your
computer will work with a different mouse. Or see if your mouse
will work with a different computer.
</P>
<P>
   If the mouse isn't the problem, it's probably the driver _ which
in many cases has been designed specifically for the brand of mouse
you have. Try changing the driver to a generic one that comes with
Windows. You can do this by going to the Mouse icon in the Control
Panel and selecting the General tab.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't solve your problem, it could be that you have a
problem with your video driver or a port-conflict issue _ which you
may need a trained technician to solve.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; 
Windows 98 lets you make use of the empty space on the taskbar that
resides at the bottom of the display. You can put your Internet
Explorer links there, or a URL address space for fast access to the
Web. You also can have a Quick Launch area for icons of programs
you use a lot. To explore the possibilities, right-click any blank
area on taskbar, then choose Toolbars.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Microsoft Files for Dismissal of Case  
   
 By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Saying the government can't prove its case, Microsoft Corp.
yesterday officially asked a federal judge to throw out an
antitrust case against the software giant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a detailed, 88-page filing, Microsoft argued that the
antitrust lawsuit filed by the federal government and 20 states was
legally undermined b a June federal court ruling on an earlier suit
that favored the Redmond, Wash., company. The Appellate Court
of &UR;  &LR; the District of Columbia said Microsoft was justified in its
decision to integrate its own Internet Explorer browser into the
market-dominant Windows 95 operating software.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, whose latest suit centers on the newer
Windows 98, contends that strategy is an illegal use of monopoly
power and harmed competitors such as Netscape Communications of
Mountain View, which makes a rival browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that even ``public interest'' favors its
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you step back from all the heated rhetoric and apply
well-established legal principles to the actual facts of the case,
it is clear that the government will not be able to prove its
case,'' William Neukom, Microsoft senior vice president for law and
corporate affairs, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's integration of Internet technologies into the
operating system has been good for consumers and good for thousands
of independent software companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts said Microsoft has almost no chance of getting
the case thrown out before the trial, scheduled for Sept. 8 in
Washington, D.C. Experts said the motion to dismiss the case was
more of an attempt to sway the ``court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way this case is not going to trial in September,''
said Rich Gray, an intellectual property attorney at Bergeson,
Eliopoulos, Grady &AMP; Gray in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson warned
that he was not inclined to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have followed the case said there weren't any
surprises in Microsoft's latest filing, which adhered to the legal
and public strategy it has followed to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft knows it has little chance for a summary judgment,
but wanted an opportunity to tell the judge how feeble the
government's case is,'' said Hillard Sterling, an antitrust
litigator in the Chicago office of Gordon &AMP; Glickson P.C.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued three main points:
</P>
<P>
   _That Windows 98 is a ``single, integrated product that includes
Internet Explorer technologies'' which can not be separated without
``seriously degrading the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   _That integrating Internet Explorer benefits consumers, software
developers and computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   _That Netscape and Microsoft are vigorous competitors and that
Netscape was not prevented from distributing its Web browser to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contended it had a strong case for dismissal based on
the June appeals court ruling. That court held that a 1995
agreement between the federal government and Microsoft allowed
integration of software applications like Internet Explorer with
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said that court's decision did not take into account
the same monopoly issues and evidence that will go before Jackson
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not say whether or not Microsoft had
violated any antitrust laws, Gray said. ``It has some reasonings
that helps Microsoft's case, but it didn't decide anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape General Counsel Roberta Katz said Microsoft was ``using
the same tactics that a magician might use in getting you to watch
what's happening with the left hand so you don't see what happens
with the right hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that Netscape's own statistics on how many
people use its browser prove it was a viable competitor and that
there was no illegal use of monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   However, Katz said, Microsoft ``tried to cut off (Netscape's)
distribution through computer manufacturers and Internet service
providers.''

 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The day of reckoning is close at hand for Eric Schmidt, the former
super nerd at Sun Microsystems who heads Novell.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Provo, Utah, company announced yesterday that NetWare 5 will
go on sale by September 20. It is the first major upgrade of
Novell's flagship product since 1994 _ and some believe its best
chance to stem Microsoft's headlong assault on a market that Novell
once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novell is under significant pressure to have a very successful
product,'' said Dan Kusnetzky, research analyst with International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   NetWare 5 is built entirely on the technology of the Internet,
allowing companies to seamlessly blend their Intranets and
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings down the barrier between them,'' said John Slitz,
Novell's senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since Schmidt became chief executive of
Novell, he has remolded the company to fit his vision of a future
in which all networking will revolve around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has trimmed 1,000 jobs _ about one-fifth of
the workforce _ while purging about half of the company's managers
and installing his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has brought financial stability back to Novell, which
lost $122 million in the first full quarter after he took over. It
has made money in the past three quarters, and its stock hit a
52-week high of $13.50 last month. It closed yesterday up 6 cents
at $10.88.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues have been flat, however, and still are running at an
annual rate of about half the $2 billion that the company posted in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Novell's slide has coincided with the rise of Windows NT,
Microsoft's network operating software. Although NetWare still
boasts more than 80 million users, Windows NT now is outselling it
in new installations.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt made it clear that he intends to regain the momentum
that previous management squandered through a combination of
ill-fated acquisitions, poor marketing and product delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``With NetWare 5, customers leap ahead of the pack with smarter,
more manageable and efficient networks,'' he said. ``Novell has
regained its rightful place as the only networking vendor that can
get them there.''
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing NetWare's integration with the Internet, Novell
hopes to counter Microsoft's argument that Windows NT works better
than NetWare in corporate networks that use Windows-based PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Novell is heavily promoting NetWare's directory feature, which
lets network administrators manage various parts of the network.
Novell generally is considered better than Microsoft in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Slitz said NetWare 5 also outguns Windows NT when it comes to
working on large network servers.
</P>
<P>
   But Novell isn't just battling Microsoft. It also must fight its
own past mistakes, especially the initial version of NetWare 4,
which was full of bugs and didn't always work with previous
versions of the software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novell really needs something to set a fire underneath the
company,'' said analyst Bruce Raabe of Collins &AMP; Co. Whether
NetWare 5 can do that is unclear, but Raabe said that ``having a
product like this can't hurt.''

 CHICAGO BOYS, 7 and 8, CHARGED WITH BRUTAL MURDER OF 11-YEAR-OLD By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a case that has sent chills across this city, two
boys, ages 7 and 8, have been charged with murdering an 11-year-old
girl _ striking her with a rock, sexually molesting her and
suffocating her with her own underwear _ apparently to take the
bright blue bicycle she had been riding, the police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice experts said that they knew of no case in which
younger children had been prosecuted for murder in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the police said on Monday that on Sunday evening
the boys confessed to the July 27 killing of Ryan Harris, an
honor-roll student who had just finished fifth grade. After killing
Ryan in an alley behind a building on Chicago's South Side, they
stashed her bicycle so they could retrieve it later, the police
said. Then, they said, the 8-year-old rode his bicycle home and
watched cartoons and the 7-year-old went home to play with a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the boys appeared for a probable cause hearing in
Juvenile Court, their feet swaying above the floor as they sat
before Judge Gerald T. Winiecki.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old's lawyer had him stand on a chair at one point so
a witness could see him better. The 7-year-old spent most of the
hearing drawing hearts, a house and a rainbow with colored pens on
one of his lawyer's yellow legal pads.
</P>
<P>
   Slayings by children in recent years have stunned the nation and
led many states to take a tougher approach to juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has seen several horrifying crimes involving children,
including a 1994 case in which two boys, 10 and 11, dropped a
5-year-old boy to his death from the 14th floor of a housing
project. But the Ryan Harris case has struck an especially painful
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era, the ages of these offenders is very frightening
to hear about,'' said Mayor Richard M. Daley. ``Children are
growing up much, much faster.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Winiecki ruled that there was probable cause to try the boys on
juvenile charges in the slaying and ordered them held overnight at
Hartgrove Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Chicago. Winiecki
instructed reporters at the probable cause hearing not to disclose
the boys' names; The New York Times had decided not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In court and at a news conference, the police and prosecutors
described how they believe Ryan was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the 8-year-old boy knew Ryan, who lived in
the working-class suburb of Lynwood just south of the city but who
was staying with a godmother in Chicago's impoverished Englewood
neighborhood this summer so she could attend a day camp at a high
school there.
</P>
<P>
   They said that on July 27, Ryan and the 8-year-old went to ride
their bicycles around the high school and ended up in an alley
behind a building.
</P>
<P>
   There, the police said, they were met by the 7-year-old, who was
a friend of the 8-year-old, and the boys began throwing rocks.
Detective Allen Nathaniel testified on Monday that the 7-year-old
told him he threw a rock that struck Ryan in the back of the head
and knocked her off her bicycle, apparently leaving her
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The detective testified that the 7-year-old told him that the
boys moved her bicycle to a wooded area about 20 feet away and
``they both took one arm of Ryan and dragged her to the same wooded
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the detective testified the 7-year-old told him, ``They
began to play with her. He said they began to play with her `very
softly.' He said they pulled her panties down. After he pulled her
panties down, he put them in her mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel said the 7-year-old told him he then began rubbing
leaves and branches around her nose and mouth. Police found pieces
of leaves stuffed in Ryan's nostrils. At some point, the police
said, one or both of the boys molested Ryan with what Nathaniel
called a ``small tubular object'' that ``caused a half-inch gash''
around her genitals.
</P>
<P>
   The detective said that the 8-year-old told him that when he saw
the 7-year-old play with her body, he ran off. The police said the
boys told them they had stashed Ryan's bicycle, a Road Warrior
model, in some weeds; but when the police returned to look for it,
it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's body was found on July 28, in tall weeds in the wooded
area behind the building. The cause of death was asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   The police initially questioned the boys as potential witnesses
in a door-to-door canvass of the neighborhood. The boys said they
saw a strange man lure Ryan into his car. But investigators became
suspicious when the boys changed their stories, providing details
that ``would only be known by the detectives that investigated it
and the perpetrators,'' said Sgt. Stan Zaborac.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the oldest of six children, was a straight-A student, her
family said, and dreamed of playing professional basketball and
becoming a doctor. Her grandfather, Nathaniel Hamlin, told
reporters after her body was found that Ryan was so diligent she
would come home from school and tutor her brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the boys in the Englewood neighborhood described
them as well-behaved children. Several said they could not believe
these boys had committed such a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Blanton, who runs a corner laundry, said the boys would
help her with chores. ``They used to clean up for me,'' Ms. Blanton
said. ``I didn't even have to ask them. They'd just pick up a broom
and start cleaning. Anything for some candy money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors said the boys were always offering to cut the
grass or pick up the garbage. They played basketball often at a
hoop in an alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they get the right person and don't charge those babies
for something they didn't do,'' said Glenda Tucker, a neighbor. ``I
just don't believe it and I think they're being framed.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who identified himself only as P.B. said: ``Those boys
don't even like girls. They play with Tonka toys and sit in the
dirt and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vallas, the chief executive officer of the Chicago public
schools, said the 8-year-old attended Parker Community Academy and
was an ``ideal student with good grades and few absentees.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 7-year-old, a student at Wadsworth School, had
discipline problems in school.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice experts said on Monday that though they did not
know of any exhaustive record of juvenile killings they had not
heard of children any younger being prosecuted for murder. Roger
Lane, a professor of history at Haverford College and the author of
``Murder in America, a History'' (Ohio State University Press,
1997), said he believed that there were three 8-year-old boys
charged with murder in the 1800s and early 1900s, but none of the
boys was formally indicted or convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a 9-year-old boy named Cameron Kocher was charged with
murder in Pennsylvania and ultimately convicted. In 1996, in
Richmond, Calif., a 6-year-old was initially charged with attempted
murder in the beating of a baby, but charges were suspended and the
boy was put in a residential treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   Under Illinois law, children cannot be charged as adults until
they turn 13. If convicted in the juvenile system, they can be held
only until they turn 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan Harris case is likely to lead to debate about the
competence of children to understand their culpability in a crime.
Are children that young capable of recognizing the consequences of
their behavior? How should judges hold them accountable for
uncommonly depraved actions?
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for both boys said that their clients had not
been properly questioned, a charge that the police denied. The boys
were brought into the police station by their parents or
grandparents, but Nathaniel said under questioning that the adults
were not in the room when the boys confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they made a statement, how voluntary a statement could it
be?'' said Catherine Ferguson, a public defender representing the
7-year-old. ``Can he waive his Miranda rights?''
</P>
<P>
   The police said their procedure was proper because youth
officers were present during the interviews with the boys and their
parents were informed immediately after they gave their statements.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Grant, the lawyer for the 8-year-old, said: ``My client
was a victim of the state's foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that the 8-year-old's behavior, as described by
Nathaniel, was ``what a normal 7- or 8-year-old would do. He saw
another kid throw a rock. He got on his bike and he went home.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Michael Oppenheimer, sought to portray the boys
as being similar to any other defendant accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that you have a 7- and 8-year-old who are
charged,'' Oppenheimer said after the hearing. ``But the facts of
the case warrant the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of the two boys sat in the courtroom on Monday and at
one point, the 8-year-old waved at his parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a baby. Look at him,'' the father murmured to the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Ryan Harris sat in the courtroom too, rocking with
silent sobs during parts of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven and 8 _ I can't see 7 and 8,'' Ryan's mother, Sabrina
Harris, said outside the courthouse Monday evening. ``She's got
sisters 7 and 8.''

NFL SET TO INVESTIGATE CUTTING INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said
Monday he expects the NFL to look into the details surrounding the
Michael Irvin-Everett McIver situation.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry could reveal whether Irvin intentionally tried to
harm McIver. If he did, it could lead to a fine or a suspension for
Irvin under the league's violent crime policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McIver practiced for the first time Monday since
needing stitches to close a nearly 2-inch cut on his neck that was
caused, sources said, by Irvin with scissors in a July 29 dorm room
scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   McIver would not comment about the incident or a report that
Jones negotiated a deal for Irvin to pay McIver for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just talking football,'' McIver said. ``The questions are
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, however, was adamant that neither he, nor any of his
representatives, paid to keep McIver from talking or filing a
police report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given anyone any money,'' Irvin said. ``I didn't
pay anybody anything. There has been no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also continued to deny any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of any deal,'' he said. ``I know of no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the intense media scrutiny is the main reason that
the NFL will probably look into a situation that the Cowboys have
tried to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys owner said that the league's fact-finding mission
would probably be handled by Ben Nix, one of the NFL's security
representatives based in Dallas. Nix, who was in Wichita Falls on
Monday, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, the NFL looks at what the media says and takes a
long look at it and when they find out nothing has happened, they
move on,'' Jones said. ``My contention is that most of it [media
speculation] is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was not surprised that his name was linked to the
report of him brokering a payment because, ``I'm the general
manager, I get put into everything involved in the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said ``no comment'' when asked if the
NFL was looking into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources with knowledge of the situation,
the incident escalated into a fight when McIver was getting a
haircut and Irvin wanted McIver to get up from the barber's chair
so he could get a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   McIver took exception and pushing and shoving began between the
6-foot-2, 200-pound Irvin and the 6-foot-5, 318-pound McIver. The
fight ended, sources said, with Irvin inflicting a cut near
McIver's carotid artery with a scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey and Irvin have each said the
incident resulted from ``horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL investigation finds that Irvin violated the league's
violent crime policy, commissioner Paul Tagliabue could take
disciplinary action against the Cowboys' leading receiver in the
form of a fine or a suspension, regardless of whether there was an
arrest or conviction, according to the policy.
</P>
<P>
   McIver has not filed a complaint. If he does, and if Irvin is
charged and convicted, the consequences could be severe. Irvin is
already on probation stemming from a 1996 conviction for felony
cocaine possession. If he is found to have violated the terms of
his probation, he faces up to a 20-year prison sentence. Criminal
convictions or certain behavior problems would constitute a
violation of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County's adult probation director said Monday that the
latest allegations of a cover-up or payoff don't change his stance
of last week _ that probation officials won't investigate unless a
criminal complaint is filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still dependent on police agency,'' Ron Goethals said.
``If a witness came forward, we would direct them to a police
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the original conditions of probation, the terms are that
the person on probation should not break the laws of this state or
any other state,'' he said. ``Ultimately, that will come down to a
determination by a law enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Manny Alvarez would determine whether or not to
revoke Irvin's probation based on a recommendation and
investigation by the probation department following a criminal
complaint, Goethals said. Alvarez sentenced Irvin to four years'
deferred adjudication in July 1996 after the wide receiver pleaded
no contest to felony cocaine possession. Alvarez is on vacation
this week and couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's probation could be revoked if a new criminal offense is
shown _ a standard component of most probation agreements, Goethals
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deferred adjudication agreement, if Irvin serves his
sentence to Alvarez's satisfaction, the Dallas County district
attorney's office will drop the charges, and Irvin's record will
show no conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, McIver had not practiced with the team
before Monday. He came to practice 30 minutes after the rest of his
teammates took the field and worked out with the first team. Gailey
said the time McIver has missed will not cause him to lose his
starting job. McIver has missed each of the club's two preseason
games and last week's scrimmage against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to get him in the one-on-one play, if not
the scrimmage'' Tuesday night against the New Orleans Saints in
Shreveport, La., Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little fatigued,'' McIver said as he walked off the
field. ``Any time you miss time heading into the season it is a
setback. I've got a lot to make up and I'm willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has said there is no animosity between him and McIver. The
rest of the Cowboys do not appear to be distracted by the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a concern of mine,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ``The media has said a lot about this, and maybe in
the past this would have taken away from what we do on the field.
But I don't think this has at all.''
Staff writers Clarence E. Hill Jr. and Mede Nix contributed to this
report.

Wagner closes the door 
after homer breaks tie
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Sean Berry's sense for drama and suspense may soon put him in a
class with the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Berry might be too predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Stop us if you've heard this before. Berry's three-run homer in
the bottom of the eighth inning propelled the Astros to a 5-2
victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night at the
Astrodome. It was the third time Berry has won a game with a home
run this season and the 19th time the Astros have won a game in
their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the situations everyone dreamed about when they were
little kids,'' Berry said. ``It's the best feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's blast off Brewers reliever Chad Fox untied a 2-2 game,
and the last-minute run support gave rookie reliever Scott Elarton
the first win of his big-league career. Elarton followed starter
Mike Hampton to the mound and watched from the bench as closer
Billy Wagner struck out two of three batters he faced in the ninth
for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, making his second appearance since returning from the
disabled list, had the crowd of 18,995 on its feet for most of the
final inning. It was the smallest Astrodome crowd since May 27, but
it wasn't lacking for noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the people cheer for you like that, it raises your level
and makes you a better player,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a difficult assignment to find an offensive player
better than Berry over the past two weeks or so. The streaky third
baseman is hitting .453 with three homers and 10 RBIs in his last
17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a good streak right now,'' Berry said. ``In this game,
you're going to have good streaks and bad streaks. You just try to
stay hot for as long as you can and ride it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are threatening to ride off into the sunset with the
National League Central Division banner. Monday's victory
maintained their lead over the second-place Chicago Cubs at 7{
games. The third-place Brewers are in town for three more days
before the Cubs drop in for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where you can possibly get a streak going and benefit
from beating the teams you're playing,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hampton nor Mets starter Bill Pulsipher allowed a run
through the first five innings, and the Astros grounded into three
double plays during that span.
</P>
<P>
   But one bad pitch can make all the difference in a pitching
duel, as Pulsipher learned in the sixth when the Astros matched
their hit total from the previous five innings with three,
including Moises Alou's 31st homer and his second in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with every Astros homer hit in the Dome, General
Admission fired his cannon from the outfield seats, sending a cloud
of smoke into the air. Before the smoke had cleared, the game was
tied again.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton got two quick outs to start the seventh inning but was
tagged for three consecutive hits, including a two-run pinch-hit
homer to left by Brian Bates. It was Bates' first homer of the
season, and it came on Hampton's first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hampton) made two bad pitches with two out _ a fastball up
and a changeup up _ and that killed him,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has won only one game since June 9, showed
improvement despite receiving the fourth no-decision in his last
six starts. He allowed nine hits and struck out three batters in
his 92-pitch performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to keep us in the game for seven innings, and the
bullpen shut them down,'' Hampton said. ``My last inning was
disappointing. I'm not going to lie and say it wasn't. But overall,
I was pretty satisfied with my performance. I felt good. I'm not
all the way back, but I'm getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton retired the side in order in the top of the eighth, and
Berry put on his hero's cap in the bottom of the inning after Jeff
Bagwell and Alou got things started with back-to-back singles.
Wagner fed the Brewers a steady diet of sliders in the ninth to
earn his first save since the highly publicized incident in which
he was hit in the head by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like the Billy of old,'' Dierker said. ``He threw
some really good sliders. He made better use of that pitch than in
any of his other outings this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who never had pitched in relief during his professional
career until this season, earned his milestone victory in his 14th
big-league appearance _ the last 12 of which have come in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of trips to the hill (without a victory),'' said
Elarton, who is 1-0 with a 1.29 earned run average as a reliever.
``But when you're pitching in relief, you're not out there to get a
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought my first big-league win would come out of the
bullpen, but I'm not complaining. The bullpen is what has kept me
in the big leagues.''

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the
sight of his team's play Saturday night on film was not as bad as
it looked in person.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had little good to say about his team after the 16-3 loss
to the Raiders. He had a different take Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not nearly as disappointed after watching the tape as I
was after the game,'' Gailey said. ``The things that we did wrong
were correctable, fairly easily correctable. We just got to go do
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey attributed the poor performance to ``five or six''
things, including problems in concentration and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we'll be working the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he conveyed the same message to the team in a
meeting before practice, however, he said he didn't take them
completely off the hook for their play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make it all gooey that everything was OK
because it wasn't,'' Gailey said. ``We still made mistakes. The
thing I told them is the mistakes are correctable but the key is
not make them in the first place.'' EX-VIKING SMITH WORKS OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys worked out former Vikings defensive end Fernando
Smith, but haven't signed him.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Smith had a good workout, but
said the team probably won't make a decision until after Tuesday's
scrimmage against the Saints in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is recuperating from a July 7 hernia operation,
stayed to watch practice after his workout. He said he liked the
situation with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would fit in great here,'' Smith said. ``They rotate
the front four \Rlike in Minnesota\S. And if they want me to be a
pass rush end, just come in on third down, that would be no
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said he will make a decision tomorrow, is also
negotiating with other teams. Smith has visited Washington,
Jacksonville, Atlanta, Chicago and New Orleans. He has one more
scheduled visit with either San Francisco or Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys do decide to pursue Smith to help shore up their
weak defensive end play _ they will be hard pressed to compete in a
bidding war for Smith. The financially-strapped Cowboys would have
to rework a couple of player contracts to sign Smith, whose asking
price for 1998 is $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had 16 career sacks in four years with the Vikings. His
best year was in 1996 when he recorded 91/2 sacks. Smith was
hampered by the hernia injury last season and had four sacks.
ANOTHER COUNTRY HEARD FROM
</P>
<P>
   Mexican football player Marco Martos joined the Cowboys Monday
as a ceremonial addition for their American Bowl matchup against
the New England Patriots on Monday in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Martos, who played with the Broncos in the American Bowl last
season, said the game will be a bigger deal this year because the
Cowboys are more popular in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is the team of Mexico,'' Martos said. ``Everyone in
Mexico loves Dallas. I think it's going to be 115 to 120 thousand
people in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Martos knows his presence is more of a publicity stunt,
he is doing it for personal reasons. A football fan since age 7, he
hopes to eventually earn a spot on an NFL roster. Martos played
with the Barcelona Dragons in NFL Europe the past couple of years,
catching 42 passes for 501 yards and seven touchdowns. ANOTHER
BATES
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys released wide receiver Michael Hicks and signed
former Florida linebacker James Bates on Monday. Bates is the son
of Cowboys defensive line coach Jim Bates.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bates' second stint with the Cowboys. He originally
signed with the team last summer, but saw his dream of playing with
his father fade when he tore the Achilles' tendon in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bates said he never thought he'd get another chance and jumped
at the opportunity to play when the Cowboys called.
</P>
<P>
   Bates says football is his first love, however he created a nice
niche for himself during the year away from the game. He worked as
a college football commentator for the Sunshine network and did
some acting, including a small role in the next movie version of
the Addams's Family, which is scheduled to be released this fall.
BROOKS WORKS OUT
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Macey Brooks, who has missed nearly two weeks
because of testicular torsion, participated in limited workouts
Monday. He did some light running and was involved in some
individual drills. Brooks is expected to be out another two weeks.
GETTING A PEEK
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 tickets have already been sold to the Cowboys
scrimmage Tuesday against the New Orleans Saints in Shreveport, La.
Promoters are expecting 30,000 by game time.
</P>
<P>
   What those fans will get for their price of admission _ tickets
range from $15 to $35 _ is some kicking drills, some passing drills
and a series of controlled scrimmages.

TIME TO HOP ON THE KITNA BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You can't say enough about Seahawks
quarterback-in-waiting Jon Kitna, so let's say some more. Like how
Kitna is exactly the kind of athlete who makes you remember why you
love sports.
</P>
<P>
   The guy makes it look fun.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Kitna is such a good guy. Honest. Fresh.
Confident, but not arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is: Why wait? Why not accelerate the
Kitna-as-Seahawk-quarterback-in-waiting plan? After all, Rick Mirer
once got the chance to lead the Seahawks to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this should be Kitna's season. There is every reason to
suspect it would be exciting. And there is growing reason to
believe the Seahawks might be better served by getting Kitna
untracked now, this season, instead of waiting, even if a certain
Warren Moon decides to grace the Seahawks with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Why wait?
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren's 41. Maybe he needs more time off,'' Kitna joked the
other night, after his first home start for the Seahawks seemed to
prove the Tacoma native was ready for his close-up, Mr. DeMille.
</P>
<P>
   If Kitna is the quarterback of the future, and he's making eyes
pop open right now, why not turn the team over to him?
</P>
<P>
   If Ryan Leaf is the Chargers' starting quarterback from now
until whenever, then Kitna should get the same green light. If
Peyton Manning is the Colts' franchise-saving QB two weeks into
training camp, then Kitna deserves a promotion, too.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Kitna's first preseason start Saturday against
the Colts, one thing is abundantly clear: The kid can play.
</P>
<P>
   When we say Kitna's a ``kid,'' it's a compliment, since it
really means he plays with the sort of passionate, driving abandon
that you expect in a kid, even though his poise, presence and
strength more than demonstrate he is no kid.
</P>
<P>
   But like a kid, Kitna has fun. And he makes football fun to
watch and exciting, which is a good reason as any to show up at the
Kingdome this season and root for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike a certain 41-year-old veteran, Kitna has no other
agenda except to play his brains out, learn, be part of the team
and make his teammates look as good as they should.
</P>
<P>
   From running back Ricky Watters to receiver Mike Pritchard to
speedster Joey Galloway to tight end Deems May, don't think for a
minute these big-time talents could not rally around their man from
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, winning is the bottom line. The Seahawks enter 1998 with
no alternative except to make the playoffs. There is too much
talent all over that roster, too many playmakers on Paul Allen's
pricey little whizbang, to think anything less than the postseason
is acceptable. So who cares if the AFC West is a bear that makes
the Seahawks' playoff route unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite this unsourced proclamation that the Hawks must get
to the playoffs in '98, there is a little more to the season than
just a playoff berth. The second-best thing to hope for in '98
would be plays. Big plays. Medium plays. Chain-moving plays that
make the Seahawks competitive each down, each half.
</P>
<P>
   As much as victories, Seahawk watchers should want to
consistently see plays that give the team momentum, because making
plays is the down-to-down turn-on. And so far, Kitna has shown that
when the ball is in is hands, the Seahawks are going to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, when Kitna can't find a receiver to throw to,
he knows instinctively when to break across the line and run for a
first down, like a Steve Young or a Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot more than what Moon or John Friesz can do. Friesz
is a terrific guy who some days throws a good football. But after
all those seasons lost to injury and all that immobility in the
pocket, it's clear Friesz is not a No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   These comparisons of Kitna to Young and Favre might constitute a
bit of a stretch, they might be slightly premature, but quite
honestly, if you can't get gung-ho over an out-of-the-woodwork find
like Kitna, then who else are you going to get excited about?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon? Where is he?
</P>
<P>
   The longer Moon decides he's not getting enough dough to come
and play football for the Seahawks, the more you want this season
to belong to Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says the Seahawks must have Moon to make it
serious this season. The longer Moon thinks $4.5 million is the
only way it's worth it to him to play football, the more heartily
you root for Kitna to get the chance to prove conventional wisdom
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna got the start Saturday night against the Colts and all but
made the $48 million franchise savior, Manning, look like the
rookie Manning is.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna wore a sly smile afterward, too. He knew he had done well.
He knew that everything Dennis Erickson wanted to see out of him
was on display. Good decisions. Audibles at the line. Accuracy,
strength, legs. Enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hawks are back in Cheney, and Moon's timetable would
appear to be winding down. Moon could afford to be away from Cheney
for the first three weeks of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The way Kitna is showing he's ready for the show, the more we
should wonder if Moon would not indeed better serve the long-term
interests of the Seahawks by backing up this exciting young
quarterback with no blue blood or high-falutin' credentials, but
who possesses the one thing football fans love to see in their
quarterback. The kid's a winner, and you would root like crazy to
see him pull off a season full of big plays and victories.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested, jump on the Kitna bandwagon.

SEAHAWK CORNER THOMAS SETS SIGHTS ON IMPROVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ When Willie Williams couldn't play in Saturday
night's preseason game because of a sore ankle, the Seahawk coaches
didn't hesitate to insert Fred Thomas at right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Thomas, whose first two seasons in the NFL have been
marked and marred by a series of big plays, the Indianapolis Colts
didn't hesitate in going his way.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Thomas who had his way.
</P>
<P>
   The game began for Thomas like so many others have, with him
running stride for stride with a receiver but failing to make the
play at the last second. This time, it was a 46-yard completion
from Colts rookie quarterback Peyton Manning to Jerome Pathon, the
rookie receiver from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But before eyes could roll and those ``Here we go agains'' could
be muttered, Thomas made amends. Three plays later, he intercepted
a Manning pass and returned it 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawk series stalled, it was Thomas who downed Jeff
Feagles' pooch punt at the Colts' 3-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Needing 5 yards for a first down on the Colts' next possession,
Manning went to 246-pound fullback Zach Crockett with a third-down
pass. But there was Thomas, all 5-foot-9, 172 pounds of him, to
push Crockett out of bounds a yard short of the first down marker.
</P>
<P>
   On the Colts' next possession, Manning again went to Pathon. But
Thomas made a jarring hit to drop the former Husky after a 4-yard
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the final play of the first half, Manning threw deep to
rookie receiver E.G. Green. Guess who was there to slap the pass to
the turf? Again, it was Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, coach Dennis Erickson called the effort the best game
Thomas has played for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, defensive coordinator Greg McMackin offered, ``Fred has
been having a great camp. He's been doing really well in practice,
and he needed to take what he's been learning in practice and use
it in a game. The other night, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   What's gotten into Thomas?
</P>
<P>
   Call it confidence. Call it a renewed faith in his talents,
which were abundant enough that the Seahawks selected him in the
second round of the 1996 draft. Call it the rebirth of a player
whose short career seemed to be on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, focus on something Thomas is working to rid himself
of _ double vision.
</P>
<P>
   While reviewing game video during the offseason, defensive backs
coach Willy Robinson detected something was wrong with Thomas, who
time and again was on a coverage only to flail one direction while
the ball and receiver connected in the opposite direction. The club
sent Thomas to see Dr. Alan Reichow, an assistant professor of
optometry at Pacific University, who immediately recognized Thomas'
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, I battled vision problems, something I was in denial
about,'' Thomas said. ``Once I got that treated, it was all about
me making plays. I see the ball better, I'm reading things
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And continuing to correct the problem that used to cause him to
see one ball split into two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't just ever go away,'' he said. ``But if I keep
treating it and doing my exercises, I'll keep it where I want to
be. But it's just something I've got to do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to practice and meetings and more practice and
more meetings, Thomas does exercises to strength his weak eye.
Things like tossing a ball against the wall in his dorm room,
following it with both eyes and catching it with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me stay focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches and other players need Thomas to be focused. They
also need him to play more consistently than he has the past two
years. Although not listed as a starter, he plays in the nickel
defense at right corner, allowing Williams to slide inside and
cover a slot receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is striving to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I shouldn't read what the (preview) magazines say, but
they say I've been exploited and that I'm a target,'' he said. ``I
know to change that I've got to come out and play every game and
make the plays that come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Seahawks, Saturday night was a huge step in the right
direction.

JONES, COWBOYS: SAME AS THEY EVER WERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   [ital]''For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I
am willing to know the whole truth _ to know the worst and provide
for it.''[end ital] _ Patrick Henry
</P>
<P>
   Sad but true, Jerry Jones doesn't think you can handle the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Cowboys owner/general manager is doing his best Jack
Nicholson impersonation, in case you hadn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Nicholson as the arrogant U.S. Marine colonel,
screaming at defense attorney Tom Cruise from the witness stand in
``A Few Good Men?'' That was about a cover-up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth?'' Nicholson ranted, smirking at Cruise. ``You can't
handle the truth!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the movie's signature line.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jerry, in his own way, is sending the same message to you
regarding the haircut heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   He is, he'll swear, trying to protect you, trying to keep your
Cowboys safe and intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our fans,'' you can almost hear him say, his Arkansas
twang dripping molasses.
</P>
<P>
   For you. All for you.
</P>
<P>
   Because the truth, you see, might harm the Cowboys, and he's not
at all sure that you, the fans, can deal with that.
</P>
<P>
   I say he's underestimating you. I say he doesn't know you at all
and that he's using you as an excuse because it's his own ego, his
own pride, his own checkbook, that can't stand the light of the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest truth of all is that with one slimy, poorly handled
cover-up, Jones has undone all the hard work, all the damage
control, all the positive steps that the Cowboys organization had
taken in changing its image in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   What fools we were to buy into that facade. Nothing has changed
because Jerry hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones might as well fire Calvin Hill, his symbol of change for
the good, because poor Calvin means nothing. He's just a
figurehead. Same goes for Chan Gailey. Gailey can have all the
family values in the world. He can be the country's No. 1 citizen,
but it means zilch if he has no input when something like this
happens.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's a part of this, then shame on Gailey, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones had meant it when he said this was a new era for the
Cowboys, then there would be no cover-up. You and I would know
exactly what happened in that dorm room, who was involved and what
the Cowboys were doing about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's how honest people deal with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry wouldn't be hiding it from the news media. He wouldn't be
hiding it from you, the ticket-buying public. He wouldn't be hiding
it from the district attorney's office, campus police or Judge
Manny Alvarez. He wouldn't be hiding it from the NFL, which is
expected to begin an investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't be reading about payoffs to Everett McIver, because
Michael Irvin wouldn't be in a position to surreptitiously bribe
himself out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And if the truth costs this team Irvin's services, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   I say, as bad as that would hurt, you can deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's really simple, when you think about it. If Irvin's guilty
of something here, if he stabbed McIver in a fit of rage, or in a
fight, or whatever, then he needs help and he needs to be held
responsible. The Cowboys aren't helping him by covering for him, or
being enablers, which is what the drug and alcohol counselors call
it, of his aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's not stopped here, then where? When does it end? If
he can get away with stabbing someone, for whatever the reasons,
what can he not get away with?
</P>
<P>
   And if Michael Irvin is guilty of nothing, then please tell us
that, too. We need to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this story is picking up steam nationally. Across
the country, they're giggling at the Cowboys' expense again.
Late-night talk show hosts are loading up the one-liners. The
Dallas Badboys are back in town.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever positive feelings had been built with the coming of
Gailey and his assistants, a strong draft, a sense that the team
had finally stepped away from the smoldering ruins of scandal and
deceit, have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not because Michael Irvin might have gone haywire with a pair of
scissors. Who can predict something like that?
</P>
<P>
   No one expected perfection from every player. We understood that
problems would occasionally crop up. What we had hoped, what we had
prayed, was that how this organization reacted to those problems
would have changed.
</P>
<P>
   That's where we wanted and expected a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? You can handle the truth. I'm absolutely certain of
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's Jerry Jones who just can't face it.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't at all mean that you don't deserve to hear it.

WTA'S NEWEST MILLIONAIRE KEEPS ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Ai Sugiyama is far from a household
name in the United States. But if she plays tennis the way she has
of late, more fans might realize more about her.
</P>
<P>
   They might realize that Ai is Japanese for love, that Sugiyama
is ranked 16th in the world or that she hit a career milestone last
weekend in the Toshiba Classic at La Costa.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama topped the million-dollar mark in winnings after
reaching the quarterfinals by beating Steffi Graf and Jennifer
Capriati at La Costa, both previously undefeated there. Sugiyama
continues to play well as she beat France's Anne-Gaelle Sidot 6-4,
6-3 Monday in the opening round of the $450,000 Acura Classic at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the million-dollar mark, Sugiyama said, was not a
specific goal on the Corel WTA tour, but she is thrilled to have
reached it. She is one of 17 players at Manhattan Beach this week
to have accomplished that. With some of the cash from recent wins,
she plans to embark on business ventures at home, outside of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama, 23, already has opened a sporting-goods store called
Belly Buttons and plans to open a cafe and flower shop. She has not
decided on names for the new stores, but she has an explanation for
the eyebrow-raising name of the sporting-goods store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The belly button is the center of you,'' she said. ``And I'm
the center of everybody back there who supports me.''
</P>
<P>
   The store is a type of dedication to those people.
</P>
<P>
   While Sugiyama plays in relative obscurity in the U.S., her
place in Japan is much different. ``If I walk here, nobody is going
to recognize me,'' she said. ``In Japan, some people know me. Some
people will come up to me for autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   She enjoys the attention from Japanese fans, partly because they
have a different attitude toward their sports stars than U.S. fans.
``They have respect,'' Sugiyama said.
</P>
<P>
   What might separate Sugiyama from other players on the tour is
her mental toughness. She has a steady ground game and says the key
to success is simply to cut down on unforced errors. But other
players recognize the psychological part of her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the toughest mentally of any player,'' said American
Kimberly Po, who is ranked 60th and is half Japanese. ``When it's
5-0, you know she's going to play as hard as any other point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugiyama will need intensity in her second-round match against
third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. About her chances against
Sanchez Vicario, Sugiyama said, ``I cannot miss a lot early.''
</P>

Halard-Decugis 6-2, 6-4, but the Rolling Hills resident was not too
choked up about the loss. She is in the process of moving to
Hermosa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now, I'll have enough time to pack and move,'' said
Po, who blew a 4-1 lead in third set.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis will have a challenge in the second round when
she faces second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who is trying to win her
third WTA event in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, like Po, grew up within short driving distance of
Manhattan Beach. Said Po, ``It's different playing here than
anywhere else. I mean I can drive from home to here. And I have
fans cheering for me, which on the other events that never
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Youth, experience qualify: Four qualifying matches concluded
on Monday morning to complete the first-round field of 28 players.
San Diego's Alexandra Stevenson, Latvia's Larisa Neiland,
Luxembourg's Anne Kremer and Italy's Adriana Serra-Zanetti
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, the four had to win three matches, which Stevenson
said is an advantage. ``It gets you warmed up, and it's great as
long as you don't lose,'' she said. ``I like getting ready in the
qualifiers but wouldn't want to be doing it my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, 17, is the tournament's second youngest player. Only
Serena Williams, 16, is younger. Neiland, 32, is the tournament's
oldest player.
</P>
<P>
   __ Battle of the ages: Williams and Neiland play a first-round
match today at 7 p.m., which highlights the day. Nathalie Tauziat,
fifth-seeded, will be the highest seed to play today. She meets
Chanda Rubin at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The highest seed to play on Monday, No. 6 Irina Spirlea, beat
Fang Li 6-0, 6-2. Li won her two games, after trailing 5-0.

`THE THRILL' SAYS HE WANTS TO REMAIN WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>

By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The heckler seated behind the visitors'
dugout on a July afternoon at Oakland Coliseum drew the ire of his
intended target.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers first baseman Will Clark responded twice.
</P>
<P>
   The sacrifice fly that sent Athletics outfielder Jack Voigt to
the warning track in center field was Clark's first rebuttal. The
second occurred as Clark returned to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with the contract!'' Clark barked tersely
toward the heckler, who suggested repeatedly that his performance
this season was a result of impending free agency. ``It has
everything to do with the fact that I can still hit!''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 34 and healthy, can hit, and he wants to continue hitting
for the Rangers after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that would be unfair to say,'' said Clark, whose
five-year, $30 million contract expires after the season. ``I think
that would be common sense. Why wouldn't I? I live here. I have a
house here. I enjoy the Metroplex immensely, and I've got a lot of
friends here. Plus, in the five years that I've been here, I think
this ballclub has improved each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty realistic, though. I know that I can't control
anything that's going to happen two months from now. Why should I
worry about it if I can't control it?''
</P>
<P>
   The people in control are Rangers general manager Doug Melvin,
president Tom Schieffer and owner Tom Hicks. Clark's status will be
addressed after the season, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know my feelings,'' Clark said. ``They know my
sentiments. They know how much I love playing here and how much I
love being a part of this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers begin a two-game series with the Indians on Tuesday
at Jacobs Field. The matchup will lack a premier but injured first
baseman. That player is Indians first baseman Jim Thome _ not
Clark, who went on the disabled list five times in the previous two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's future with the Rangers beyond 1998 once appeared in
doubt because of his inability to stay healthy for 162 games. Yet
Clark and the disabled list are strangers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to do that the last few years,'' Clark said. ``I
had this black cloud following me, and I've been able to stay away
from it this year. The only thing I wanted to do was to be able to
play healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a toll on you mentally when you have to go out there
and play hurt every day. You're absolutely exhausted by the end of
the season. Here we are in August, and I feel just as good now as I
did a few months ago _ not only physically, but also mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark is on pace to hit .303 with 22 home runs and 106 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a premier hitter when he's healthy,'' Melvin said. ``He's
got a chance this season to drive in 100 runs. He puts the bat on
the ball, uses the whole field and works the count well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark lacks the power of Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn, who
hit four home runs in the Rangers' four-game series this weekend at
The Ballpark in Arlington. Yet Clark provides legitimate gap power.
He's on pace for 36 doubles, ranks near the league leaders in
on-base percentage (.383) and is a veteran who plays the game right
despite physical limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who bats fifth in the lineup, also prevents opposing
pitchers from pitching around cleanup hitter/right fielder Juan
Gonzalez, who has six intentional walks despite leading the major
leagues with 119 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's respect for Will Clark,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also must weigh the intangibles Clark brings to
the clubhouse when discussing his future.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, who played for the Orioles in
1994, saw a ``noticeable change in the Rangers from the other
side'' after Clark arrived that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He notices everything,'' said designated hitter Lee Stevens,
who calls Clark his idol. ``He knows what everybody is doing.
That's why he's `The Sheriff.' They had him come on a road trip
with us last year when he was on the disabled list. That's how
important he is. They wanted him there for his presence. That
should pretty much tell you everything right there.''
</P>
<P>
   What would a Rangers' clubhouse be like without Clark?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quieter, but there probably would be a lot more
stuff going in here that shouldn't be going on,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clark will continue to blurt his one-day-at-a-time
cliches about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like me, as much as we enjoy playing, there's going to be
a job if you want it, and we'll see what happens at the end of this
year,'' he said. ``I'm not looking past today or tomorrow, though.
I'm enjoying this ballclub too much right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying coming into the clubhouse every day and messing
with Rusty Greer and Mark McLemore and watching new teammates like
Todd Zeile and Royce Clayton do well. I'm enjoying this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day nears when the Rangers must decide whether Clark will
enjoy it here beyond this season.

FOR CLUB PROS, REALTITY OF PGA CHAMPIONSHIP IS BIGGEST THRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Must be a thousand things going through the
heads of Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Mark O'Meara, Colin Montgomerie
and the other golf studs as they prepare for the pressure and
prestige of a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one worry they don't have:
</P>
<P>
   Getting worn out by walking the course.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't about Casey Martin, aka Cartman. He's not at
Sahalee. This is about the guys here who teach the game but don't
often play it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time I walked 18 holes,'' Jim
Schuman said Monday after a practice round in near-perfect weather.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've played the Treetops golf course in Gaylord, Mich.,
where he teaches, you haven't heard of Jim Schuman. Unless a
miracle occurs on the order of Olive Oyl-beats-Holyfield, you won't
hear of him the rest of the week, either.
</P>
<P>
   He's among the 25 club pros in the PGA Championship who've spent
thousands of hours teaching mutts like you and me to keep our heads
down, while dreaming of one day walking an 18th fairway with a
major in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman's typical day at Treetops is so consumed with curing
hooks and slices that he just doesn't play much golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do play, I'm riding a cart to get in before dark,'' he
said. ``Here, you have to pace yourself. I'd love to stay out on
the range and hit balls all day. Then Thursday (the first round)
would come and I wouldn't be able to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuman, a trim, good-looking 34-year-old guy, is out of shape
for this kind of golf. In fact, nearly all of his fellow club pros
are out of shape for this kind of golf, whether aerobically or
physically.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman got here Sunday, but mentally he's been here for weeks,
after qualifying for his first major by finishing in the top 25 of
the national Club Players Championship in North Carolina in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days couldn't go by quick enough,'' he said. ``But at
home, I'd have to give another (teaching) lesson, then another, and
another. I found myself saying, `I can't wait to get out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's made it, the grin is threatening to split open his
head; none of that passionless cool of the touring pro for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge for me, unbelievable,'' Schuman said. ``There are
friends of mine, guys who've been on the tour for some years, and
have never made a major. This is a huge deal. As the days got
closer (to coming to Seattle), that's when I started feeling the
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get here, the anxiety starts over again. There's the
clubhouse, there's the range, and pretty soon, I'm next to Nick
Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew I was here. I've seen him play in other
events, but I said, `Gosh, there he is.' You don't rub shoulders
with these guys that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement that Seattle's golf community feels hosting its
first big-deal tournament is little different than the rush felt
here by the nation's Tin Cuppers, who are experiencing in practice
rounds the apex of their golf existence.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like being Foghorn A&AMP;M in the NCAA men's
basketball tournament's field of 64: The week of anticipation is
far richer than the nearly inevitable Thursday blowout.
</P>
<P>
   When you're from Peru, Ind. (pop. 15,000), and your club is
called Rock Hollow, making this PGA field is mammoth. But since it
is the fourth appearance of club pro Todd Smith in the PGA, he's
not quite as slackjawed as he was that first practice round at
Bellerive in St. Louis in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got off the course and I didn't remember what I'd done and
didn't remnember what the holes were like,'' he said. ``I was just
glad it was over. Then I felt OK afterward. I even made the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf on the home course and golf at the highest level are almost
two distinct games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disadvantage for club pros is playing under these
conditions _ quick greens, high rough,'' Smith said. ``It's hard
for us to come out in one week and adapt. We might play two or
three events where conditions are similar, but these (touring pros)
play this a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sahalee's former club pro, Rick Acton knows the gig well. He
says the problem is more acute for pros from clubs in the Northeast
and Midwest, who are in the midst of their busiest time, unlike
their counterparts from Florida and hot climates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all carry the home-club expectations, which are
enormous and unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel this obligation to go out and play well for them,''
he said. ``It's very hard to go to the PGA and, almost by
definition, fail. The big deal is not how they do at the PGA, it's
just getting here. For the touring pro, the end of their dream is
Sunday, not Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The hometown supporters) really don't understand. They don't
know how good the (touring pros) are. They know how well their club
pro plays in the pro-am every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shoot 68 on the home course and they think, `Well, four
68s, that's 8-under, that could win at the PGA.' But they don't
understand a 68 at Rolling Oaks golf course and 68 at a major is 20
shots difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The club pros know the distinctions intimately. So the smart
ones lower expectations to increase the enjoyment. Schuman is
inviting his parents out from Wisconsin, and he has a high school
buddy for a caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to share this experience,'' he said. ``I didn't want
to come out alone and just take pictures of how big these trees
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today I made a few long practice putts on 18 and heard
people screaming and yelling. I couldn't explain that back home.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part this week, these guys will find themselves
lost in a strange Northwest forest. They won't be happy about it.
That doesn't mean they aren't immensely satisfied golfers.

TIME TO HOP ON THE KITNA BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You can't say enough about Seahawks
quarterback-in-waiting Jon Kitna, so let's say some more. Like how
Kitna is exactly the kind of athlete who makes you remember why you
love sports.
</P>
<P>
   The guy makes it look fun.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Kitna is such a good guy. Honest. Fresh.
Confident, but not arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is: Why wait? Why not accelerate the
Kitna-as-Seahawk-quarterback-in-waiting plan? After all, Rick Mirer
once got the chance to lead the Seahawks to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this should be Kitna's season. There is every reason to
suspect it would be exciting. And there is growing reason to
believe the Seahawks might be better served by getting Kitna
untracked now, this season, instead of waiting, even if a certain
Warren Moon decides to grace the Seahawks with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Why wait?
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren's 41. Maybe he needs more time off,'' Kitna joked the
other night, after his first home start for the Seahawks seemed to
prove the Tacoma native was ready for his close-up, Mr. DeMille.
</P>
<P>
   If Kitna is the quarterback of the future, and he's making eyes
pop open right now, why not turn the team over to him?
</P>
<P>
   If Ryan Leaf is the Chargers' starting quarterback from now
until whenever, then Kitna should get the same green light. If
Peyton Manning is the Colts' franchise-saving QB two weeks into
training camp, then Kitna deserves a promotion, too.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Kitna's first preseason start Saturday against
the Colts, one thing is abundantly clear: The kid can play.
</P>
<P>
   When we say Kitna's a ``kid,'' it's a compliment, since it
really means he plays with the sort of passionate, driving abandon
that you expect in a kid, even though his poise, presence and
strength more than demonstrate he is no kid.
</P>
<P>
   But like a kid, Kitna has fun. And he makes football fun to
watch and exciting, which is a good reason as any to show up at the
Kingdome this season and root for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike a certain 41-year-old veteran, Kitna has no other
agenda except to play his brains out, learn, be part of the team
and make his teammates look as good as they should.
</P>
<P>
   From running back Ricky Watters to receiver Mike Pritchard to
speedster Joey Galloway to tight end Deems May, don't think for a
minute these big-time talents could not rally around their man from
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, winning is the bottom line. The Seahawks enter 1998 with
no alternative except to make the playoffs. There is too much
talent all over that roster, too many playmakers on Paul Allen's
pricey little whizbang, to think anything less than the postseason
is acceptable. So who cares if the AFC West is a bear that makes
the Seahawks' playoff route unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite this unsourced proclamation that the Hawks must get
to the playoffs in '98, there is a little more to the season than
just a playoff berth. The second-best thing to hope for in '98
would be plays. Big plays. Medium plays. Chain-moving plays that
make the Seahawks competitive each down, each half.
</P>
<P>
   As much as victories, Seahawk watchers should want to
consistently see plays that give the team momentum, because making
plays is the down-to-down turn-on. And so far, Kitna has shown that
when the ball is in is hands, the Seahawks are going to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, when Kitna can't find a receiver to throw to,
he knows instinctively when to break across the line and run for a
first down, like a Steve Young or a Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot more than what Moon or John Friesz can do. Friesz
is a terrific guy who some days throws a good football. But after
all those seasons lost to injury and all that immobility in the
pocket, it's clear Friesz is not a No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   These comparisons of Kitna to Young and Favre might constitute a
bit of a stretch, they might be slightly premature, but quite
honestly, if you can't get gung-ho over an out-of-the-woodwork find
like Kitna, then who else are you going to get excited about?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon? Where is he?
</P>
<P>
   The longer Moon decides he's not getting enough dough to come
and play football for the Seahawks, the more you want this season
to belong to Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says the Seahawks must have Moon to make it
serious this season. The longer Moon thinks $4.5 million is the
only way it's worth it to him to play football, the more heartily
you root for Kitna to get the chance to prove conventional wisdom
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna got the start Saturday night against the Colts and all but
made the $48 million franchise savior, Manning, look like the
rookie Manning is.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna wore a sly smile afterward, too. He knew he had done well.
He knew that everything Dennis Erickson wanted to see out of him
was on display. Good decisions. Audibles at the line. Accuracy,
strength, legs. Enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hawks are back in Cheney, and Moon's timetable would
appear to be winding down. Moon could afford to be away from Cheney
for the first three weeks of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The way Kitna is showing he's ready for the show, the more we
should wonder if Moon would not indeed better serve the long-term
interests of the Seahawks by backing up this exciting young
quarterback with no blue blood or high-falutin' credentials, but
who possesses the one thing football fans love to see in their
quarterback. The kid's a winner, and you would root like crazy to
see him pull off a season full of big plays and victories.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested, jump on the Kitna bandwagon.

CRUZ BACK IN SWING WITH BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ You don't hear much about The Trade anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Randy Johnson-to-Houston swap remains fresh, but Mariner
fan reaction to the trade last season sending young left fielder
Jose Cruz Jr. to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitchers Mike Timlin and
Paul Spoljaric was the most unpopular in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comparison,'' one club official said Monday. ``When Cruz
was traded, we were bombarded with telephone calls, faxes and
e-mail from unhappy fans. There were only a few faxes and even
fewer phone calls immediately after the Johnson trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``When fans in Seattle saw Junior (Ken Griffey Jr.) come up 10
years ago and become a superstar, then watched young Alex
(Rodriguez) come up and do the things he has done, they thought
they were getting another Junior or Alex in Jose,'' Mariner manager
Lou Piniella said. ``But players like Junior and Alex come along
very seldom.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Johnson wanted out of Seattle. Cruz didn't.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, as the Mariners and Blue Jays begin a two-game
series at SkyDome Tuesday night, The Trade hasn't been as one-sided
as many predicted. Timlin has become Seattle's most dependable
closer since Norm Charlton in 1995, Spoljaric is being groomed as
Johnson's replacement in the starting rotation and Cruz slumped so
badly earlier this season the Blue Jays demoted him to the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But Cruz, 24, is back. He's more relaxed, confident and
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning July 30 from a two-month refresher course with
Class AAA Syracuse, Cruz has reclaimed the starting role in center
field and is batting .357. The latest of his two post-demotion home
runs came on Sunday when he slugged a game-winning, two-run homer
in the eighth inning to beat the Oakland Athletics, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called confidence,'' Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson said
of Cruz's resurgence. ``He worked really hard (at Syracuse) and did
what we asked him to do. He's relaxed and confident. You can see it
in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   You also can hear it in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is fun again,'' Cruz said in a telephone interview.
``I never really lost confidence in myself and am the same player I
was before. I know I can play up here and just needed to work
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz went back to the basics of hitting: see the ball and hit
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just swinging the bat and letting things happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Good things are happening again for the switch-hitter who
finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year voting
last season after hitting 26 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Stardom loomed. But then the bright lights dimmed this season.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, Cruz was batting .211 and hadn't hit a home run
since opening day. His defense was shaky. His mind seemed
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   So it was goodbye Toronto and hello Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first got here, he was down and out,'' Syracuse
manager Lloyd Moseby recently told TruNorth Baseball. ``I felt bad
for him. But he worked hard and never came into my office and said,
`Hey, what's Toronto saying about me?'''
</P>
<P>
   After Cruz batted .298 with seven home runs and 23 RBIs in 40
games at Syracuse, the Blue Jays asked him to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He belongs in the majors,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone was saying the same thing last year when
Cruz, the Mariners' first-round draft choice in 1995, joined
Seattle on May 30 and became an instant contributor, hitting 12
home runs and driving in 34 runs in 49 games.
</P>
<P>
   But with the bullpen in disarray and their AL West title hopes
riding on improved relief, the Mariners dealt Cruz to Toronto on
July 31, the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner fans wailed. Blue Jay fans celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of expectations put on his shoulders, and it
really wasn't fair,'' Piniella said. ``In this business, you can't
put too much pressure on yourself, and that might have happened to
him. I think he needed to go back (to the minors), get his mind
together, work on his game and become hungry again.
</P>
<P>
   But Cruz said that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into all that stuff,'' he said. ``I just didn't
play well the first couple of months, and if I knew why, I would
have corrected it and played better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a humbling game, and if you let it, it will be bite
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz is biting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have an outstanding major league career, and I'd
take him back in a second,'' Piniella said. ``In fact, when he was
struggling, Woody (Woodward, the M's vice president of baseball
operations) and I talked many times about getting him back.''

CLINTON ANNOUNCING PLAN ON CONSUMER WATER SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will stand at the edge of a
reservoir that serves San Francisco Tuesday morning to announce new
regulations intended to inform consumers what is in the water they
drink.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the Environmental Protection Agency will require
each of the nation's 56,000 water districts to alert their
customers to the presence of pesticides, solvents, metals,
micro-organisms and other regulated substances that are routinely
found in the nation's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The information, which will resemble the nutrition labels
attached to most food products, will be sent to customers at least
once a year and will list the levels of benign trace elements such
as calcium, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium, which at
high levels can lead to serious gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   California is the only state that already requires suppliers to
tell consumers what is in the water. The federal guidelines will
provide customers with even more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has pushed hard to provide consumers with
information about all kinds of pollution they may be exposed to on
the theory that sunshine . . . is the best disinfectant,'' Kathleen
McGinty, chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information in the hands of consumers is a very potent tool
that can bring about change,'' McGinty said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will make the announcement at the San Andreas Reservoir
in San Bruno, where San Francisco stores much of the water it pipes
from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The president was scheduled to arrive in the Bay Area last night
as part of a three-day fund-raising swing that will bring in
several million dollars for Democratic candidates across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced that he will cut the trip short by
several hours to return to Washington late Wednesday to discuss
possible responses to last week's embassy bombings in Africa.
Officials said the president may also want to be on hand Thursday
morning for a ceremony for Americans killed in the attacks. The San
Francisco leg of the trip will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Before he returns to Washington, Clinton is expected to raise at
least $1 million for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, starting at a
$1,000-per-plate lunch Tuesday at the St. Francis Hotel. Clinton
leaves for Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon for two more fund-raising
events for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The new water regulations were authorized by the 1996 Safe
Drinking Water Act. They call for for public water districts to
provide their customers at least once a year with a detailed list
of contaminants, something that California has required since the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond the state law, the new guidelines call for water
agencies to identify the likely source of the contaminants, and
include a special advisory for people who may be at special risk,
such as those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's water supply, like that of most of the nation,
is well within government regulations and is considered safe,
although it contains elements that in large doses can be a risk to
those with specific illnesses or weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in cleaning up water across the
country,'' McGinty said. ``There is a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president's announcement is part
of an effort to make the public aware of pollutants so they can
make more informed choices or work to alleviate the source of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really expanded the public's right to know in an
important area,'' said Dr. Gina Solomon, a scientist with the
Natural Resources Defense Council. ``People really care what they
put in their mouths, and they really care what is in their water.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said she is hopes most states will go beyond the federal
requirements and provide information on contaminants that are not
currently regulated.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TALENT AND GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
   By C.W. NEVIUS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They used to flock to Barry Bonds. When he was winning the MVP
award three times in four years, the national media came to him on
bended knee, asking for a moment, a quote.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bonds blew them off. A Sports Illustrated
writer became so exasperated that he ended up writing a story on
how difficult it was to talk to him. Another writer from one of the
largest newspapers in the country tried for some time to interview
him, finally gave up and was on a pay phone, calling the editor to
say that the story would have to be canceled when Bonds walked by.
``Want to talk now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   You never knew with Bonds, and we still don't. He's more
approachable now, but less likely to be approached. At one point
Bonds said he was glad to see that the Bay Area press corps was
allowing him his space. Actually, writers were ignoring him.
</P>
<P>
   This all matters because it is entirely possible that this week
Bonds will reach an amazing baseball milestone. With two more home
runs he can become the first player in the history of the game to
hit 400 homers and steal 400 bases.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning display of power and speed, but what does it
all mean? As the curtain starts to come slowly down on Bonds'
career, such milestones look more than ever like an empty string of
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bonds is an almost certain first ballot Hall of
Famer, but _ unless there is an incredible run by the Giants in the
next two years _ when the rest of the bronze plaques start
comparing their championship rings, Bonds is going to have to
change the subject. He has never won it all, and his frustrating
record in the postseason (one home run and five RBIs in four years)
must eat at him.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any question that Bonds wants to win. This isn't
some greedy jerk who is collecting a huge paycheck while
sleep-walking through his contract. His physical skills may have
slipped, but he is still  &LR; the  &LR; impact player on the Giants, the
hitter every team has to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains convinced that his responsibility begins and ends
within the confines of his batting helmet. Anything that happens
beyond his narrow world view does not concern him.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a leader, on or off the field. He declines to bother
with mandatory team stretching before many games, and he has
exasperated generations of old-school baseball fans by refusing to
run out routine ground balls because he feels the pointless effort
takes too much out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he continues to steal bases at times when the only reason
can be to pad his stats. The whole fuss in Philadelphia two Sundays
ago, when Bonds stole second with the Giants holding a 9-2 lead,
was vintage Bonds. It would be fascinating to know how many of his
437 steals were cheapies like that one.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Phillies considered that steal, and that's why
pitcher Ricky Bottalico hit Bonds (in the leg, which is accepted
baseball protocol). Bonds, who said he was tired of getting hit,
charged the mound, starting one of baseball's famous bench-clearing
discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is fine. The Phillies made their point, and so did
Bonds. The problem is, now Bonds is going to have to serve a
suspension soon, taking him out of the lineup in the middle of a
tense playoff run. To his credit, Bonds has said he was sorry, but
the damage is done. Bonds defended his masculinity, and the Giants
lose him for three games. How many like that tradeoff?
</P>
<P>
   They say no man is an island, but in the clubhouse, Bonds is a
notorious peninsula. He sits in front of his locker or in the
training room and rarely interacts with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that may be for the best. When it comes to social
skills, Bonds' report card would be checked for, ``Does not play
well with others.''
</P>
<P>
   We got the annual Bonds dustup out of the way relatively early
this year, when he and 42-year-old pitcher Danny Darwin scuffled.
There was a similar incident years ago when Bonds and and former
Giants first baseman Mark Carreon exchanged punches. Then there's a
long list of people with whom he's had verbal confrontations,
including former third baseman Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The real puzzler is how Bonds seems to go after those who have
supported him. He talks of how he reveres his former Pittsburgh
manager, Jim Leyland, but while they were with Pittsburgh, the two
got into a shouting match at spring training, which was caught on a
television camera.
</P>
<P>
   And this year Bonds became upset at Giants manager Dusty Baker,
who has bent over backwards to defend his left fielder. Ironically,
Baker thought he was sticking up for Bonds at the time. Hearing
that the Dodgers intended to throw at Bonds in retaliation for his
post-home run antics in last year's season-ending series, Baker
issued a warning in the media. Bonds, upset that Baker did not come
to him first, told reporters that Baker could ``kiss my ass.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Barry Bonds that baseball will know. As his skills
erode, Bonds says he will play out his contract, which runs through
2000, and fade away. If so, he will be known as a player who was
just a notch below the greats _ talented but mercurial, an odd guy
who often annoyed his teammates and always mystified them.
</P>
<P>
   Nice numbers, though.

about how clever the octopus is: ``The most intelligent
invertebrate in the world, there's no denying it,'' according to
Roland Anderson, a biologist at the Seattle Aquarium. In fact, they
are even smart enough to have fun. Last month, a researcher
documented that the animals actually engage in play behavior, a
mark of relative mental complexity and normally considered the
province of young mammals. By Natalie Angier.

   SCI-GENE-SNIPS (Undated) _ A new word is edging into the study
of human genetics: the snip. Snips, variations in the DNA that make
each individual unique, are the genetic determinants of health and
disease. Now, because of machines that rapidly decode DNA, the
chemical chain that embodies the genetic instructions, snips are
becoming more accessible and more highly prized. Snips will help
population geneticists reconstruct the size and timing of the early
human migrations that peopled the globe. And they should enable
medical geneticists to trace elusive links between genes and
disease, particularly the common diseases to which many genes
contribute. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-LEMUR-WRIGHT (Undated) _ Patricia Wright's trail to
Madagascar and environmental heroism began with an act that is now
considered the antithesis of conservation _ the purchase in a
Brooklyn pet store of an owl monkey. Today, Ms. Wright is one of
the nation's foremost authorities on the lemurs of Madagascar. By
Jane E. Brody.

   SCI-DECLINING-DISEASES (Undated) _ Newsworthy new and unusual
infections have been attracting so much fanfare this year that we
have yet to hear a fitting recessional for the handful of great
infections of history that are slowly fading from view. So what's a
medical school to do, keep on teaching about diphtheria and
measles? By Abigail Zuger.

   SCI-RESTORING-SPEECH (Undated) _ Doctors have long been trying
to give people their voices back. In the 20th century, ear and
throat specialists have treated the voiceless with a variety of
what they call larynoplastic phono surgeries operations to make
vocal cords work again. For the future, some surgeons see a return
to electricity in the form of tiny pacemakers helping the vocal
cords to open and close normally. And, another group is putting
together implants for vocal cords. By Erin St. John Kelly.

   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Many people make significant changes in
what they eat, drink, take or do based on research that is far from
conclusive. Some become unduly alarmed about suspected but unproved
risks to health that they cannot control. Others decide that
because what is ``fact'' one week is sometimes contradicted by a
new study finding the next, they won't change any habit. But few
people, including many who report health findings in print or on
the air, know how to interpret scientific research or understand
the certainties. By Jane E. Brody. (``l'' code)

best-seller list. What makes Sammy sell? Reports of a movie deal,
that's what. By Ralph Blumenthal.

<P>
   BEACH-BLANKET-BABYLON (San Francisco) _ Arts in America: If
``Seinfeld'' was about nothing, ``Beach Blanket Babylon'' is about
everything. A wild musical homage to popular culture, it has become
no less a part of San Francisco than the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit
Tower and fog. It has played eight times a week 51 weeks a year for
the last 24 years, and every show is a sellout in the 400-seat Club
Fugazi. By Michael Janofsky.

UC BERKELEY TO GET PESTICIDE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore announced Monday that the
first center to study the effect of pesticides on children will be
established at the University of California at Berkeley, part of a
federally funded initiative focusing on children's health.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a White House ceremony, Gore said UC Berkeley's School of
Public Health has been awarded $1.1 million in federal funds to
look at the impact of pesticide exposure on children living in
agricultural regions near Salinas in California's Salinas Valley.
</P>
<P>
   UC researchers will carry out the project in collaboration with
community organizations in the Salinas Valley, including La Clinica
De Salud Del Valle De Salinas and La Natividad Medical Center in
Salinas. They intend to follow 550 pregnant women in the Salinas
area over three years to examine the impact of pesticides on
children's development.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticide use in agriculture and for home and industrial
purposes has doubled over the past 30 years, according to ``Our
Children at Risk,'' a report issued last year by the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children and infants are uniquely susceptible because of their
physiological immaturity and greater exposure,'' the report stated.
It noted that pesticides ``have been associated with certain
childhood cancers, found to adversely affect the nervous system,
and linked with birth defects and altered functions of the immune
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Gonzalez, director of El Colegio Popular, a community
organization in Fresno, welcomed the establishment of the UC
Berkeley center, saying ``it is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was years before anybody started to document accidents and
rashes and connecting them to pesticides,'' Gonzales. ``It is still
definitely a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   During the current harvest season, approximately 250,000 workers
are picking a range of crops on California farms. Arcadio Riveros,
director of Salud Para La Gente, a health clinic in Watsonville,
said children in farmworker families run a greater risk of being
exposed to pesticides, even if they don't work in the fields
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, parents carry pesticides in their clothes,
which they wash along with their children's clothes. ``Regular
washing does not necessarily get rid of these pesticides,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal grant was one of eight to be awarded to universities
nationwide to establish ``Centers of Excellence in Children's
Health Research.'' The $10.6 million initiative comes in response
to an executive order issued by President Clinton in April 1997, in
which he directed all federal agencies for the first time to take
children's health into account when issuing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The other centers will examine the growing incidence of
childhood asthma and respiratory problems. The University of
Southern California, for example, received $1.3 million to look at
the impact of secondhand tobacco smoke and other environmental
health threats, working together with community organizations like
Mothers of East Los Angeles. Another grant went to Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore to look at the impact of air pollutants and
rising ozone on asthma rates among inner-city children.

 REP. YOUNG TAKES A PAGE FROM SEN. McCARTHY  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Rep.
Don Young, R-Alaska, has created a new loyalty test for members of
the U.S. Forest Service:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are you now, or have you ever been, a card-carrying member of
The Sierra Club? Are you now, or have you ever been, a dues-paying
member of the Wilderness Society? Have you ever had any contact
with environmental organizations?''
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, Young, as the chairman of the House Resources
Committee, wrote a letter to the Regional Forester of the
Southwestern Region Eleanor S. Towns of the Forest Service in
Albuquerque, N.M., asking her ``whether any of their employees are
members of'' or ``have any contact with'' any environmental groups
that have been involved in lawsuits against the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks 19 separate questions, each of which would take
a month to answer fully, but this one _ question No. 13 _ stands
out as an unconstitutional infringement on the associational rights
of federal employees. The U.S. Supreme Court made it clear in
rulings from the 1960s and '70s that even federal employees have a
right to associate with whom they wish.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the letter that Young doesn't like the way the
Endangered Species Act is being implemented in Southwestern United
States. The Forest Service had reached an agreement with ranchers
to preserve the limited riparian areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Towns was given until Aug. 15 to respond to Young's inquiry.
Let's call the enviro-affiliation question what it is _ a
witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Young's letter implies that enviros in the Forest Service leak
federal documents to environmental groups. Question No. 12 of the
letter: ``How does the U.S. Forest Service prevent conflicts of
interest involving their employees from arising in their
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the old Joe McCarthy ploy _ guilt by association. The taint
of environmentalism is equivalent to the stigma of communism in
Young's equation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Forest Service employee and a member of the
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity or any other
environmental group, you probably leaked Forest Service information
to give leverage to the environmentalists in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The implication here is that if you are employed by the Forest
Service, then you had better not be a card-carrying member of any
environmental group. You shouldn't care about the environment.
After all, forests are timber waiting to be cut _ nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The very question reflects Young's own position on the
environment _ the wilderness and forests are there to be exploited.
In the last few years he has voted against a bill to repeal the
lawless salvage timber sale program; against a bill to reform of
the hardrock mining; against a bill to eliminate funding for
subsidized timber logging roads.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group gave him a zero rating
on environmental issues in 1995-96. PIRGs are state-based
non-profit, non-partisan research and advocacy groups. In 1997, the
League of Conservation Voters, which educates voters on the voting
records of their elected officials, gave Young a mere 6 percent
rating out of a possible 100 percent on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Congress, Young is one of the best arguments in
favor of term limits _ currently serving his 13th term as Alaska's
only member of the House, he is tied into the economic power
structure. Bound, one might say.
</P>
<P>
   According to the non-profit, non-partisan Center for Responsive
Politics, in a short year and a half, from January 1997 to July
1998, Young has accepted $93,736 in campaign contributions from the
oil and gas, forestry, and mining industries.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Young doesn't see that accepting these funds might
constitute a conflict of interest for the chairman of the House
Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-year election cycle, 1995-1996, Young pocketed a
little more than $1.1 million in campaign donations _ $173,050 or
15 percent of that came from agricultural, energy and natural
resource industries.
</P>
<P>
   Young is well aware where his loyalties lie.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of disclosure _ which Young has asked from Forest
Service employees _ I suggest that before any member of Congress
votes on a bill, he or she state how much in total campaign
contributions have been received from industries affected by the
proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how different the votes on proposed legislation would be
if a member of Congress had to get up and confess: ``Hello, my name
is Don Young. I'm addicted to campaign donations from the minerals
and agricultural industries. In the past year, I accepted over
$100,000 in contributions from them. And now I vote in favor of
this bill that grants a tax break to these industries.''
</P>
<P>
   While campaign contributions may not constitute a quid pro quo,
a favor for a favor, a vote for a large donation _ still the vast
amounts of money do weigh heavily and create a steep inclined
plane, a slope that funnels the vote in the desired direction. An
upright member of Congress might have a problem not falling down
into it.
</P>
<P>
   At least our senators and representatives ought to be called on
the relationship between their votes and the donations they have
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Young might then be a little more cautious about accusing others
of conflicts of interest and so-called tainted associations.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let
the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three
families confronted with this dilemma and how they reached their
decisions. (slugged:

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than
defeat youngsters, says Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

 &UR; (1,500 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANE HARRIS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From Working Mother magazine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

<P>
   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

   MINSK, Belarus _ In a dingy office not far from the intersection
of Lenin Avenue and Karl Marx Street, some serious capitalism is
being committed in the most Soviet of the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus, a country of 10 million sandwiched between Poland and
Russia, has been noted for its repression and lack of free
enterprise in the seven years since the Soviet Union disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet huddled around a computer terminal, Olga Zauyalova, 20, and
her partner Pavel Bintsarovski, 18, perform an uncanny exercise in
this country with little in the way of a market economy: They
create, produce, advertise and sell products, competing via the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, their company -- appropriately called ``Alien''
-- is mere fiction, and their profits are all on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the whiz kids have excelled as part of an international
competition of young entrepreneurs. They are among eight teams from
six nations scheduled to compete in Atlanta on Thursday(Aug. 13) in
the Global Business Challenge, sponsored by Junior Achievement
International and the computer-equipment maker Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The competition began in February with 648 students representing
teams from 39 countries. The contest via the Internet uses software
created by Junior Achievement to simulate the management of a
company and the factors that can affect the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The students compete for profit, sales, and market share by
setting product prices, determining production levels, planning a
market strategy and research and development budgets, and investing
in plants and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the high schoolers and college students from the
former Soviet Union are among the best.
</P>
<P>
   Only one American team, from Mill City, Ore., reached the finals
this year. Another team comes from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The six remaining teams are from lands once behind the Iron
Curtain -- Belarus, Ukraine, two teams from Lithuania and two teams
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very interesting for us because it is so new,'' said
Zauyalova. ``We have a central economy, but in Junior Achievement
we get to deal in models of market economies. That is exciting. And
during Soviet times, we had no opportunity to communicate with the
world. Now, we're doing it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, each team will compete via computer simulation to
manufacture and market a fictional product called ``EchoPens,''
computerized pens that can remember and reproduce what they have
written.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Junior Achievement organization has long been
known in the United States as a booster of budding capitalists
through its after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its foreign activities exploded after the fall of the Soviet
Union in 1991, and with the growth of economies in Latin America
and Asia. Junior Achievement programs have been introduced in 103
countries outside the United States, reaching about 1 million
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're saying to the kids is: Go out there and create, you
don't have to wait on the government,'' said Sam Taylor, the chief
operating officer at the Junior Achievement headquarters in
Colorado Springs, Colo. ``It makes them feel that they are a part
of the (global) system, and I think that is a very powerful
incentive for democratic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   That message has resonated loudly in Eastern Europe, where the
novelty of open markets has made Junior Achievement programs
popular, reaching about 250,000 students compared with some 60,000
in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the team from Belarus, profit-motive also is an
incentive. The $3,000 first-place prize money offered in Atlanta is
a fortune in a country were the average annual salary has most
recently been estimated at $800 or less because of massive
inflation and the stagnant, state-run economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all are real aliens in your life of prosperity,'' the team
from Belarus explains on the competition Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus imposes rigid controls on its banking and commerce. It
has no equity markets and only about five percent of companies and
enterprises in the nation are privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   They are facts which lead to frustration for the young
enterprisers once the competition ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this knowledge, I just wish I could use it to get a good
job,'' said Bintsarovski, who competed in the 1996 finals in San
Francisco and -- subject to the rules -- will be relegated to the
role of observer in Atlanta. ``I think all my theoretical training
would be enough for me to start my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Their adviser, Vycheslav Starikov, an economics professor and
head of the local Junior Achievement program founded in Minsk in
1992, predicts changes in his country now that young people have a
taste of Western-style freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I weren't sure about the future, I wouldn't have gotten
involved in this,'' he said. ``The younger generation will not live
in the same conditions we did. They simply will not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential,'' said Starikov. ``We just need the
conditions to succeed.''

   In the case of the team from Belarus, profit-motive also is an
incentive. The $3,000 first-place prize money offered in Atlanta is
a fortune in a country were the average annual salary has most
recently been estimated at $800 or less because of massive
inflation and the stagnant, state-run economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all are real aliens in your life of prosperity,'' the team
from Belarus explains on the competition Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus imposes rigid controls on its banking and commerce. It
has no equity markets and only about five percent of companies and
enterprises in the nation are privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   They are facts which lead to frustration for the young
enterprisers once the competition ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this knowledge, I just wish I could use it to get a good
job,'' said Bintsarovski, who competed in the 1996 finals in San
Francisco and -- subject to the rules -- will be relegated to the
role of observer in Atlanta. ``I think all my theoretical training
would be enough for me to start my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Their adviser, Vycheslav Starikov, an economics professor and
head of the local Junior Achievement program founded in Minsk in
1992, predicts changes in his country now that young people have a
taste of Western-style freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I weren't sure about the future, I wouldn't have gotten
involved in this,'' he said. ``The younger generation will not live
in the same conditions we did. They simply will not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential,'' said Starikov. ``We just need the
conditions to succeed.''

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood has treated its sex symbols with a mixture of pride
and prejudice. The history of the women who supply the glamour to a
glamour industry is for the most part a sad one.
 &HT;    For many, the more the flashlights popped, the more lines of
print their lives occupied, the less happiness seemed to come their
way. Rita Hayworth was the perfect screen goddess but she could
never quite cope with the adulation that came from her looks,
especially since the real woman behind the facade couldn't ever
measure up.
 &HT;    Marilyn Monroe, who parlayed pinups and calendars into the kind
of stardom even she probably never dreamed of, is now celebrated _
again and again in books and movies _ as a feminist icon. But at
the height of her success she was confused and abused and never
managed to surmount her miserable childhood.
 &HT;    Voluptuary Jayne Mansfield met an untimely end (in a car crash
in l967) before she could prove to anyone that she was anything
more than a superstructure.
 &HT;    Not all sex symbols however have crashed and burned: Raquel
Welch has worn well and is about to remarry at 57. Joan Collins
parlayed her over the top diva image into Our Lady of Perpetual
Glamor. Sharon Stone and Demi Moore are earning up to $12 million a
picture. Stone is happily married to a newspaper editor from San
Francisco while Moore's marriage to Bruce Willis has just bottomed
out.
 &HT;    The jury is still out on Bo Derek. In the l979 movie ``10'' she
became the world's perfect woman, and an instant corn-rowed sex
symbol. As Dudley Moore's fantasy, she ignited the sexual desires
of millions of men around the world.
 &HT;    Today Bo is all of 41 years old and while men at that age can
continue to be box office icons, her sex symbol movie career is
virtually over. However, in October she's coming back _ to the
small screen. Still able to slip easily into a bikini, in ``Wind on
Water,'' a steamy new series on NBC, she's playing a beautiful
widow with two teenage sons, a strong woman battling to keep her
Hawaiian ranch. It's a kind of ``Dallas'' meets ``Bonanza'' via
``Baywatch.''
 &HT;    Two decades ago while Derek had the world at her feet, her life
was hardly her own. Her world and everything in it belonged to her
Svengali _ her domineering director-husband John Derek.
 &HT;    Bo was in her teens when Derek 30 years her senior, who had made
an art of growing sex symbols and marrying them, spotted her and
recreated her to his own blueprint. From then on Derek called the
shots. But in May of this year after a 24-year marriage Derek died
of heart failure, leaving Bo with a huge hole in her life.
 &HT;    She is still a sexy lady, her skin apparently untouched by her
years in the California sun. Wearing tiny granny sunglasses to lend
maturity, her figure is exercise-trim in a gray silk pants suit
over a black blouse, her hair still California beach baby blonde.
She's still Bo, the 10, just a tiny bit older. But the strings are
still visible even though the puppeteer has disappeared.
 &HT;    ``We were together since I was l7,'' she explains seriously,
``and that was my adult life. Now he's gone it hasn't really hit me
yet. It's all very strange.''
 &HT;    Derek had spent his lifetime molding women to fit his preferred
image. A former actor, he did it with Ursula Andress, wife No. 2.
He then photographed Linda Evans, his third wife for sexy magazines
and gained control over Bo when she was little more than a child.
 &HT;    She was a typical California surfer kid named Mary Kathleen
Collins from Long Beach, when Derek first set eyes on her on the
set of an erotic film he was making in Greece. Her mother had come
along as chaperone. Derek called her The Kid because he said he
didn't like her name.
 &HT;    For the Kid, finding her own life distinct from the man who ran
the only one she's known for almost a quarter of a century is a
tough order.
 &HT;    ``It was a matter of either going back to work or jumping off a
cliff,'' says Bo, who still makes her home on the sprawling horse
ranch she shared with her husband in the Santa Ynez Valley, 150
miles north of Los Angeles in the rolling Santa Barbara hills _ far
from the influences of Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``It's an absolute blessing that I have to go to Hawaii to do
the series, '' she admits. ``They are going to tell me when to get
up, where to go and what to say and do. That's important to me
right now. I'm not good at making decisions.''
 &HT;    Ironically, she says before he died Derek tried to talk her out
of doing the show.
 &HT;    ``He shuddered at the idea of me taking the role. Coming back to
Hollywood playing a mother to two adults was not his idea of the
woman he was in love with. He always saw me as The Kid. He couldn't
figure out that I'd grown up. But I felt this was the right thing
to do. I took control of my own career. And that makes it easier
for me to live with now.''
 &HT;    While the evidence of it is all around, not least in everything
she says, she still denies that Derek orchestrated her every move.
 &HT;    ``He was a rebel and he wanted things the way he wanted them.
But we both danced to our own drummer. And we fought battles with
Hollywood. Some we lost, some we won. But it enabled me to sleep
well at night. But then I took my own life in my own hands. I'm not
l7 anymore. ''
 &HT;    Hollywood believed Derek was using his young wife, exploiting
her immaturity to stroke his own ego _ and boost his bank balance.
But Bo says it was never that big a deal.
 &HT;    ``I never took my screen image very seriously,'' she says.
``Blake Edwards (director of ``lO'') was responsible for it. Not me
... although I got a lot of credit for it. Even John got credit for
it, or the blame and he had nothing to do with it,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    The most she and Derek are guilty of, she points out, was going
with the momentum Edwards had started. ``I never made an effort to
change that image. I really didn't. I wasn't out to prove anything.
It was a blessing in my life and made my life an absolute fairy
tale. After '10' I could pretty much do anything I wanted in the
business. So it was my fault if I didn't go to another level. I was
responsible.''
 &HT;    But how does the dancer dance when the dance master is no more?
The new series, she says, will be her life line. ``Wind on Water''
has given her a new family structure.
 &HT;    ``I feel it came at the right time and place in my life. I
believe in the show but it's not about me. It's much bigger than
me. It's about the young people on the show, their problems, their
experiences. I'm just the mom. Mind you I'm never going to be the
sit on the porch kind of mom. ''

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Police sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day after
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd
at the airport or on the streets for hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment at this harsh treatment reminds me of
African-Americans in the United States who are needlessly hassled
by local police.
</P>
<P>
   My brushes with security have been understandable. An army
patrol flagged down my car and searched it as I drove away from the
family of a Hamas bomb-maker who had recently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to display articles in my lap-top computer to prove
that my travels in Arab areas were for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   These checks can be a nuisance. They are not going to eliminate
terrorism. But, on the way into the airplane or the movies, they
can also be a little reassuring.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'' -- EXCERPTS FROM CRISTINA
SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  North American English-language print rights. 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the
world--Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to
the top of the publishing world, then switched to television to
create the ``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual, Cristina became well-known to English-speakers when
she began broadcasting her show for CBS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, told in three 1200-word parts, will inspire anyone to
do more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina
lost it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's
revolution. She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will
to work and to believe in her own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission in this book is to show her readers how to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERIES IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN SPANISH, slugged
BC-CRISTINA-SPANISH-BOOK-EXCERPT-NYTSF) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. She
lays down rules of disciplined goal-setting and shows her readers
how to follow them to success.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila
of Miami Sound Machine, of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior, and
finally of how he led her to become more successful than even she
had dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the longs and
grueling pace, the seductions of fame and influence. She also
counters her critics who say the show is too sexy, and tells for
the first time why she chose not to renew her English-language deal
with CBS.

<P>
   I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
</P>
<P>
   I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
</P>
<P>
   My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
</P>
<P>
   That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I divide my goals into categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Begin right now.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'': PART 2
</HEADLINE>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time--one of life's little coincidences--another
friend, a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he
was organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and
he wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
</P>
<P>
   One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos; I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
</P>
<P>
   But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered, and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
</P>
<P>
   One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight--with razor blades--over
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
</P>
<P>
   That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
</P>
<P>
   We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
</P>
<P>
   I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
</P>
<P>
   That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth painting my toenails.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
</P>
<P>
   All I could do was laugh!
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair--my entire
appearance--along with everything I had grown used to during the
past 20 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat and low sugar, and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
</P>
<P>
   Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blond and blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
blonde) to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
</P>
<P>
   Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no--ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races--Asian, African American or Hispanic--underwent to
alter their features to make them look ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathan Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
</P>
<P>
   So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   What I never understood, though, and what I never will
understand, is how it was reported in the trade publications again
and again that our show had failed and that we were canceled
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my Iife? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
</P>
<P>
   I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
</P>
<P>
   I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
</P>
<P>
   I did all these things! I completed those cycles.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Summer camp an experience for the senses
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone tell me, what is that smell that gestates in a boys'
dorm at summer camp?
</P>
<P>
   Put 20 pre-pubescent males into one room, and I don't expect the
essence of rose attar. And yet, we're talking month-old road kill
here. Rotten underwear, rotten food scraps, rotten, rotten, rotten.
</P>
<P>
   If Mel Gibson and Danny Glover could release this odor on their
enemies, they'd truly have a lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting our youngest son's camp mid-week and getting one
whiff of the dorm, I have a new appreciation for asthmatics. Any
self-respecting pair of lungs would shut down after ingesting one
breath of that fog.
</P>
<P>
   I admit, I'm new to the vagaries of summer camp. I didn't get to
attend as a child, so I have no personal experience from which to
draw.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the risk of sounding gender-biased, I do think there's a
difference between boys and girls' hygiene habits. At least girls
seem to make more of an effort to disguise body odor.
</P>
<P>
   We also noticed at the camp that there is a marked difference in
the sounds emitted by gender. Boys are loud. Believe me, with three
sons, I know that boys are loud. They bellow, roar, belch and, in
general, rampage through life.
</P>
<P>
   Teeny, tiny testosterone in the wailing infant grows into
terrible tyrannosaurus Rex testosterone in the teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one thing I've never heard a boy do: Squeal. Girls
squeal. A lot. Loudly. At ear-piercing levels. Multiply that by 100
at the camp and it produces a weapon more lethal than the boys'
stench.
</P>
<P>
   So, between the noise and the odor, our son's summer camp
experience was a real ear- and eye-opener. I have unbounded respect
for all the camp counselors who volunteered their time and senses
(or lack thereof) for this weeklong experience. Of course, many of
them were quite young and probably just a shower or two removed
from their charges.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for our visit was Talent Night. It was an
extravaganza Ed Sullivan would have envied. We saw spinning
basketball tricks, comedy skits and even a takeoff on the
``Saturday Night Live'' cheerleading routine. We heard musical
numbers and a memorable impersonation of Aerosmith. We heard jokes,
really bad jokes. We were assaulted with silly string. And
throughout it all, the boys roared and the girls squealed.
</P>
<P>
   One skit in particular drew a raucous response. The youngsters
were testing out an echo, presumably on a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   They yelled ``salami,'' and it echoed back ``salami.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they called out ``pastrami,'' or some such, and it was
echoed back.
</P>
<P>
   But when they yelled ``baloney,'' there was no echo. They tried
again, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hollered a camp counselor's name, ``who's the best
counselor in the whole camp!'' You guessed it, the echo came back
``Baloney!''
</P>
<P>
   The whooping and hollering was deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was time to leave, and things suddenly became very
quiet. As we gave our son a hug and said goodbye, he looked up at
us with big, solemn eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin','' he muttered. Then, ``Two more days of camp, huh?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Gonna make it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm. I guess,'' he answered, looking longingly at our car.
</P>
<P>
   But then, his friends came and whirled him away into yet another
frenzy of activity. We said our goodbyes and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he arrived home a champion camper. Full of
stories and accomplishments, new songs and games, he regaled us
with bunk bed escapades and camp food descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I asked him, ``Glad to be back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``It smells like home.''
</P>
<P>
   After his dorm, that can only be a good thing.
</P>

 &HT;    Enforce rules for HOV lanes or take them away
 &HT;    By Linda Sharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it was first announced we would be getting HOV
lanes on the freeways in metro Atlanta, I was less than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   My immediate response was it was a waste of time and taxpayers'
money. I have since changed my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am traveling alone most of the trips I make through
downtown, I rarely get to use them. However, when I have had the
opportunity, I have found them to be not only efficient, but stress
reducing.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit when I am sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic in
one of the non-HOV lanes, I long for the luxury of cruising
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I have noticed an increasing percentage of solo
drivers who are doing more than just lusting. They are hopping in
the HOV lanes in an obvious disregard for the posted rules and
regulations. I don't know about you, but this really gets my goat.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be one particular stereotype or vehicle
type, but they all seem to be well-schooled in knowing how to beat
the system. I see a lot of high-end luxury vehicles _ sedans to
full-size sport-utility vehicles _ who are offenders. But on the
other hand, there are just as many economy cars using the HOV as a
passing lane. The one thing they all have in common is a total
disregard for the law.
</P>
<P>
   In long, straight stretches, you'll see these offenders darting
in and out of the HOV lane to advance their position. They always
drop back in their proper lane just prior to a curve. Obviously,
they expect the law to be laying in wait just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if there is an accident, these drivers seem to take it as
their license to steal.
</P>
<P>
   While I would agree it is probably acceptable to pass the
accident scene, I don't think it permits it two or three miles
after that accident. It also seems a lot of out-of-state drivers
cruise in the HOV lanes. There are adequate signs and no excuse for
this.
</P>
<P>
   I do have some questions.
</P>
<P>
   While buses and motorcycles are allowed in HOV lanes, were they
really intended for motor homes pulling boats at 45 mph? Or, if you
aren't going to keep up with the flow of traffic in the adjoining
lanes, should you be allowed to create a roadblock in the HOV lane?
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I observed an officer ticketing a young woman for
traveling illegally in the HOV lane. As he wrote, she was putting
on her mascara. Sadly, it is a commentary on how a lot of drivers
perceive the HOV lanes and their regulations. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, they ask other motorists to report offenders. I'm
not yet ready for the HOV militia. Rather, I would welcome a
substantial fine for violators and make it progressive. Each repeat
offense doubles the fine. Sooner or later, you will either get
these drivers' attention or they won't have any money left for gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, if we are going to have HOV lanes, then they need
to be enforced. Or we should do away with them and have an extra
lane for the rest of us.

 &HT;    Chevy sedan may exit as product line is trimmed
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than 10 years after it was introduced as a 1990
model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is one of the vehicles
reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors carries out the
talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are four reasons
it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best buy'' and a car
that ``does most things adequately, but unexceptionally.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It has base prices of $17,795 for the unadorned sedan, $19,395
for the sensibly equipped LS version and $20,295 for the sporty,
spoilered LTZ four-door. The ``light driftwood metallic'' _ brown,
if you will _ test vehicle totaled $21,454 with its only missing
optional features of any significance being a sunroof ($700) and
leather seats ($695).
</P>
<P>
   _ Although classified a midsize sedan, the Lumina is the largest
four-door in the Chevy fleet. It weighs a trim 3,300 pounds, is
200.9 inches long with a 107.5-inch wheelbase and can seat six
persons, although the middle passengers are likely to squawk.
Headroom and legroom are decent both front and rear, and the trunk
has a fully usable 15.5 cubic feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its 16.6-gallon fuel tank gives the Lumina a cruising range of
more than 300 miles, and its EPA figures are realistic: 20 mpg in
the city and 29 on the highway. That's predicated on
non-jack-rabbit starts in stop-and-go traffic and a willingness to
let the Lumina proceed at its own pace instead of forcing a
downshift up hills and long interstate inclines. Regular fuel is
recommended, and the tester's performance wasn't notably enhanced
by premium.
</P>
<P>
   In LS trim, the Lumina has the basics of air conditioning, tilt
wheel, full instrumentation and a stereo with cassette player and
four average speakers. Its options were reasonably priced, with an
in-dash CD player costing $93 and steering-wheel-mounted stereo
controls adding $171.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior can hardly be tagged exciting, but it's pleasing
with a moderate use of brightwork and blackout. The interior
deserves better marks, because it's got an easily read
instrumentation pod, big and/or convenient controls and good
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The seating, at best, is fair. The optional power driver's seat
($305) adjusted nicely to drivers of different sizes, but the lower
portion of the seatback proved uncomfortable to some. The rear
seating is, um, firm and sized more for children than full-size
adults.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Lumina is one of those cars that falls into the
easy-driver category, meaning little physical effort is required,
and it has a stable feel, as long as brisk cornering isn't asked of
it. The ride's comfortable, but not quiet _ the 160-horsepower V-6
goes willingly, but it does some serious wailing en route to its
6,000 rpm redline. Peak power comes at 5,200 rpm, while maximum
torque is developed at a comparatively hushed 4,000 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Given some styling perks, a refined drivetrain and better
seating, the Lumina could be more than the utilitarian
family/commuter sedan that it is. For now, however, it's a
workhorse that seems to be running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1998 Chevrolet Lumina LS front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $21,454 (base: $19,395)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, power anti-lock brakes
with front discs and rear drums, height-adjustable seat belts,
side-impact beams, daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.1-liter V-6 engine (160 horsepower), four-speed
automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: LS package with keyless entry, cruise
control, power trunk opener, dual AC/heat controls, mats, $645;
six-way power driver's seat, $305; leather-wrapped steering wheel
with stereo controls, $171; rear child seat, $125; rear defogger,
$170; CD player, $93
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 20 mpg regular unleaded city, 29 mpg highway

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's one real issue and a lot of partisan fog

</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ The absurdity of myriad airline fares
cannot be more graphic than in the rates at least one airline
charges to fly to Atlanta from two South Florida cities. Likely,
similar situations exist in other areas, on other airlines. Some
starched shirt at Delta, I am certain, would have an explanation
for this vast difference but it would be incomprehensible to me,

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ ``Saving Private Ryan'' is three movies.
The first is a searing depiction of Omaha Beach. The second is the
finding of Pvt. Ryan. The third is a fight for a French village,
every battle scene you've ever seen done better. Omaha Beach
carries the rest to greatness. But the middle film, the search,
deserves a weightier theme. Sadly there are few left to do WWII
justice. (Rosenfled, Cox News Service) MOVED MONDAY.

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ The summer of 1998 will go down in the books as
one of the hottest on record. But Sarah T. Hayes of Longview,

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Herb Evans is a man is dying of ALS
_ Lou Gehrig's Disease. Every muscle in his body is failing. And
he's not sick enough for Medicare. Medicare knows exactly what's
killing this man, but under money-saving revisions approved by
Congress, he was informed he was no longer eligible for home-care

   LANE-COLUMN _ Because current fashion excesses take their cues
from fashion excesses of the '70s and '80s, parents now are in the
peculiar position of seeing their children sent to the office for
the same styles that earned them the scrutiny of yesterday's

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ ``Bill Clinton's having this big conference in
October,'' my friend reminds me, ``to find out why there is so much
violence in our schools. What a waste of time and money. Ask any

And don't forget, almost all they know so far in their lives they

 &HT;    Gellhorn speaks: Hemingway was `complete egotist'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Granta 62'' is a rich feast. Among the entrees are Richard
Ford on where writing comes from, an excellent short story by Dani
Shapiro and a stunning memoir of Martha Gellhorn by Nicholas
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, of course, Gellhorn is remembered, not as an utterly
fearless war correspondent, but as Ernest Hemingway's third wife,
which drove her up the wall. She refused to write or talk about him
for public consumption, but, in private, talked about him
constantly. Shakespeare dutifully took notes.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, according to Gellhorn, was selfish, a mythomaniac, a
man who had to have sex every day but, in spite of all his
practice, was a lousy lover. She insisted that he was ``not gay,
none of that.'' He never took notes, because he had absolutely
total recall, from the feel of the weather to the texture of the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare creates a picture of two people who were ragingly
jealous of each other's gifts _ Hemingway of Gellhorn because she
was braver and a better reporter; Gellhorn of Hemingway because he
happened to be a great writer, which she, hampered by a lack of
imagination, could never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a complete egotist,'' remembered Gellhorn, ``but he did
liberate English prose from mandarins like Henry James and Edith
Wharton. He freed everyone into being able to write about what they
felt. After Ernest it was possible to use ordinary words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you feel when he killed himself?'' Shakespeare asks
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is not that the marriage exploded; the wonder is that
they were ever together for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   WHODUNNIT . . . Avon hopes to catch even more of their share of
the mystery wave with Twilight, a new line that will feature both
new books and reprints. Elizabeth Peters' popular Amelia Peabody
mysteries will appear under the imprint, as will Carolyn Hart,
along with some lesser-known authors.
</P>
<P>
   Avon's mysteries have always tended toward the category known as
``cozies'' largely deriving from Agatha Christie _ who slipped
arsenic into the vicar's teacup after the Sunday service, etc.
Twilight hopes to slightly enlarge upon their brand identity by
launching a new series about murders in old Philadelphia and
another about an 18th century midwife.
</P>
<P>
   Who buys mysteries? Typically, mystery readers are women,
between 45 and 55, with a higher than average income and,
apparently, very little blood-lust.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE . . . ``Wisdom, when acquired, proves
incommunicable and useless and goes with our learning into the
grave. The edges of it occasionally impinge on people, though, and
strike a little awe into them.''

 &HT;    Enforce rules for HOV lanes or take them away
 &HT;    By Linda Sharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it was first announced we would be getting HOV
lanes on the freeways in metro Atlanta, I was less than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   My immediate response was it was a waste of time and taxpayers'
money. I have since changed my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am traveling alone most of the trips I make through
downtown, I rarely get to use them. However, when I have had the
opportunity, I have found them to be not only efficient, but stress
reducing.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit when I am sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic in
one of the non-HOV lanes, I long for the luxury of cruising
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I have noticed an increasing percentage of solo
drivers who are doing more than just lusting. They are hopping in
the HOV lanes in an obvious disregard for the posted rules and
regulations. I don't know about you, but this really gets my goat.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be one particular stereotype or vehicle
type, but they all seem to be well-schooled in knowing how to beat
the system. I see a lot of high-end luxury vehicles _ sedans to
full-size sport-utility vehicles _ who are offenders. But on the
other hand, there are just as many economy cars using the HOV as a
passing lane. The one thing they all have in common is a total
disregard for the law.
</P>
<P>
   In long, straight stretches, you'll see these offenders darting
in and out of the HOV lane to advance their position. They always
drop back in their proper lane just prior to a curve. Obviously,
they expect the law to be laying in wait just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if there is an accident, these drivers seem to take it as
their license to steal.
</P>
<P>
   While I would agree it is probably acceptable to pass the
accident scene, I don't think it permits it two or three miles
after that accident. It also seems a lot of out-of-state drivers
cruise in the HOV lanes. There are adequate signs and no excuse for
this.
</P>
<P>
   I do have some questions.
</P>
<P>
   While buses and motorcycles are allowed in HOV lanes, were they
really intended for motor homes pulling boats at 45 mph? Or, if you
aren't going to keep up with the flow of traffic in the adjoining
lanes, should you be allowed to create a roadblock in the HOV lane?
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I observed an officer ticketing a young woman for
traveling illegally in the HOV lane. As he wrote, she was putting
on her mascara. Sadly, it is a commentary on how a lot of drivers
perceive the HOV lanes and their regulations. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, they ask other motorists to report offenders. I'm
not yet ready for the HOV militia. Rather, I would welcome a
substantial fine for violators and make it progressive. Each repeat
offense doubles the fine. Sooner or later, you will either get
these drivers' attention or they won't have any money left for gas.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, if we are going to have HOV lanes, then they need
to be enforced. Or we should do away with them and have an extra
lane for the rest of us.

 &HT;    Chevy sedan may exit as product line is trimmed
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less than 10 years after it was introduced as a 1990
model, the midsize Chevrolet Lumina sedan is one of the vehicles
reportedly headed for the ax if General Motors carries out the
talked-about thinning of its product line. Here are four reasons
it's been tagged a ``blue light'' special, a ``best buy'' and a car
that ``does most things adequately, but unexceptionally.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It has base prices of $17,795 for the unadorned sedan, $19,395
for the sensibly equipped LS version and $20,295 for the sporty,
spoilered LTZ four-door. The ``light driftwood metallic'' _ brown,
if you will _ test vehicle totaled $21,454 with its only missing
optional features of any significance being a sunroof ($700) and
leather seats ($695).
</P>
<P>
   _ Although classified a midsize sedan, the Lumina is the largest
four-door in the Chevy fleet. It weighs a trim 3,300 pounds, is
200.9 inches long with a 107.5-inch wheelbase and can seat six
persons, although the middle passengers are likely to squawk.
Headroom and legroom are decent both front and rear, and the trunk
has a fully usable 15.5 cubic feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its 16.6-gallon fuel tank gives the Lumina a cruising range of
more than 300 miles, and its EPA figures are realistic: 20 mpg in
the city and 29 on the highway. That's predicated on
non-jack-rabbit starts in stop-and-go traffic and a willingness to
let the Lumina proceed at its own pace instead of forcing a
downshift up hills and long interstate inclines. Regular fuel is
recommended, and the tester's performance wasn't notably enhanced
by premium.
</P>
<P>
   In LS trim, the Lumina has the basics of air conditioning, tilt
wheel, full instrumentation and a stereo with cassette player and
four average speakers. Its options were reasonably priced, with an
in-dash CD player costing $93 and steering-wheel-mounted stereo
controls adding $171.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior can hardly be tagged exciting, but it's pleasing
with a moderate use of brightwork and blackout. The interior
deserves better marks, because it's got an easily read
instrumentation pod, big and/or convenient controls and good
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The seating, at best, is fair. The optional power driver's seat
($305) adjusted nicely to drivers of different sizes, but the lower
portion of the seatback proved uncomfortable to some. The rear
seating is, um, firm and sized more for children than full-size
adults.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Lumina is one of those cars that falls into the
easy-driver category, meaning little physical effort is required,
and it has a stable feel, as long as brisk cornering isn't asked of
it. The ride's comfortable, but not quiet _ the 160-horsepower V-6
goes willingly, but it does some serious wailing en route to its
6,000 rpm redline. Peak power comes at 5,200 rpm, while maximum
torque is developed at a comparatively hushed 4,000 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Given some styling perks, a refined drivetrain and better
seating, the Lumina could be more than the utilitarian
family/commuter sedan that it is. For now, however, it's a
workhorse that seems to be running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1998 Chevrolet Lumina LS front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $21,454 (base: $19,395)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, power anti-lock brakes
with front discs and rear drums, height-adjustable seat belts,
side-impact beams, daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.1-liter V-6 engine (160 horsepower), four-speed
automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: LS package with keyless entry, cruise
control, power trunk opener, dual AC/heat controls, mats, $645;
six-way power driver's seat, $305; leather-wrapped steering wheel
with stereo controls, $171; rear child seat, $125; rear defogger,
$170; CD player, $93
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 20 mpg regular unleaded city, 29 mpg highway

<P>
   Es dificil ser rico.
</P>
<P>
   Todo el mundo quiere que las personas que lleguen arriba hayan
empezado desde abajo. Yo no empece desde abajo, debo admitirlo.
</P>
<P>
   Mi abuelo era millonario. En Cuba le llamaban ``el zar del
papel'', porque era copropietario de las revistas Bohemia, Carteles
y Vanidades, que fueron las mas importantes de la isla, ademas de
tener el monopolio absoluto de la venta de todo el papel para
publicaciones en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Naci en Miramar, un suburbio idilico y ricachon de
</P>
<P>
   La Habana. Alli creci hasta que nos vimos obligados a emigrar a
Miami (Estados Unidos), en 1960, poco despues de haber triunfado la
revolucion de Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Pero yo no provengo directamente de los tropicos ni de la islita
paradisiaca de las palmeras, del tabaco y del ron; mi familla es
solamente una segunda generacion de cubanos. En verdad somos vascos
por los cuatro costados, y aunque yo me aferro a mi cubania, no hay
duda que herede los genes y el caracter de mi casta.
</P>
<P>
   Ser vasco es, de por si, controvertido, complicado,
singular...Es una sociedad a la inversa, donde los hombres cocinan
platos gourmet en sociedades gastronomicas, las mujeres son tercas
y duras como las piedras, y donde todo el mundo--hasta las vacas y
las ovejas--sobrevive a base de obstinacion y pura tenacidad. Con
esa herencia vasca naci en el Caribe y vine a radicar en la
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   El impacto mas grande que experimente fue escuchar la palabra
``spic'' aplicada a los hispanos como termino peyorativo. No
entendia por que me llamaban spic, hasta que alguien me explico que
la pa- labra era derivada de la forma en que el hispano pronuncia
el verbo ``to speak,'' acortando el sonido de la vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Especificamente, no entendia por que me decian, ``Spic, por que
no regresas al pais de donde viniste?'', cuando ninguno de los
antepasados de aquellos ``nativos'' eran de aqui tampoco.
</P>
<P>
   Me matricule en la Universidad de Miami, estudiando
comunicaciones. Durante el ultimo ano de estudios, la universidad
requeria un internado en alguna publicacion: yo quise hacerlo en
Vanidades, porque mis lazos sentimentales eran muy pro- fundos con
la revista, naturalmente. Mi familia se la acababa de vender en
aquellos momentos a Miguel Angel Capriles y a su socio, Armando de
Armas, quienes habian sido sus distribudores en Venezuela durante
la epoca de mi abuelo, en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a redactar todo tipo de articulos, desde temas de
belleza y modas, hasta noticias internacionales. Considero que mi
mayor logro durante esa etapa fue la adquisicion de un vocabulario
panamericano, que fue lo que mas me sirvio para conseguir el
trabajo que ahora desempeno en la television.
</P>
<P>
   (En 1973) Frank Calderon, quien era el director de Buenhogar,
obtuvo la posicion de director de Cosmopolitan en Espanol, y lo
primero que hizo fue llevarse a Mati Saralegui de Vanidades como su
primera redactora.
</P>
<P>
   Como buena Chica Cosmo, decidi mudarme de mi casa en Key
Biscayne a los veintiseis anos para instalarme en un pequeno
apartamento, con mi hermana menor, Maria Eugenia. El hecho de que
se le fueran dos de sus hijas de la casa--sin casarse, como
``aventureras''--le causo un gran trauma a mi padre.
</P>
<P>
   En aquellos momentos estaba arruinado, despues de una aventura
financiera en Arabia Saudita, y trataba de vender la mansion de Key
Biscayne para recortar el presupuesto. Pero antes de que eso
sucediera, para independizarme y no convertirme en una carga para
ellos, me mude.
</P>
<P>
   Empece a darme cuenta de que mi vida era muy vacia. Fue,
sencillaniente, que me tope con el vacio. Me di cuenta de que tenia
que controlar el aspecto personal de mi vida para dedicarle toda
esa energia que desbordaba a mi trabajo, y seguir adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los muchachos con quienes estaba saliendo se llamaba Tony
Menendez. ``Necesito tranquilizarme y tener un hijo. Este es un
buen hombre y se que sera un buen padre.'' Y, friamente, lo
calcule.
</P>
<P>
   Me case con el, y un ano despues tuve mi primera hija, Cristina
Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, a los veintintieve anos de edad.
</P>
<P>
   Estaba locamente enamorada de mi bebita, Titi, pero no de mi
esposo. Era un hombre bueno y yo lo queria, pero no estaba
enamorada de el. A medida que pasaba el tiempo, y mientras que
transcurria mi ano de domesticidad, me daba cuenta de que mi
marido, aunque trabaja todos los dias del ano (y que conste que
todos los dias encasquetaba su saco y su cuello y corbata y
trabajaba) sencillamente no vendia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvinios que mudarnos para el apartamiento de tres cuartos de mi
padre. Un dia mi esposo me dijo, ``Tienes que trabajar y
ayudarme.'' Yo le mire a los ojos y le respondi: ``Yo deje mi
carrera para empezar una familia contigo. Si tu me pides que
regrese al trabajo, tienes que entender el lio en que te vas a
meter.''
</P>
<P>
   Me dirigi a Cosmopolitan y regrese a la oficin de mi ex jefe,
Frank Calderon. ``Lo siento'', me respodio.
</P>
<P>
   Saliendo del edificio, y tratando de pensar que iba a hacer en
mi desesperacion, di media vuelta y me dirigi hacia la oficina de
Elvira Mendoza, a quien habia dejado plantada en Vanidades para
irme a Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Fui sincera con ella y le confese que necesitaba trabajo. Su
respuesta fue inmediata: ``Si, como no, yo se lo doy''.
</P>
<P>
   Y asi regrese, circulo completo, al punto donde habia comenza-
do, porque me pagaba casi el mismo sueldo que ganaba al princi-
pio, el salario mas infimo que me podia asignar.
</P>
<P>
   Trabajaba a todas horas, en lo que me mandaran. Y hacia lo que
fuera necesarlo con tal de ganarme mi dinerito.
</P>
<P>
   Fue entonces que el dueno de la empresa me propuso, como trabajo
adicional, ser coordinadora editorial para una revista de formato:
Intimidades. Basicamente era una revista de educacion sexual, y
como en Vanidades ganaba tan poquito dinero, lo acepte.
</P>
<P>
   Pasaba el dia entero trabajando en Vanidades, redactando.
Entonces, a las cinco de la tarde, me montaba en mi carro, me comia
un sandwich por el camino, iba a recoger a mi bebita, la metia en
una canasta, y la llevaba a casa de mi suegra Marieta, una santa
que trabajaba en una fabrica de manufacturar ropa de baile.
</P>
<P>
   Yo corria nuevamente para mi oficina y abriamos Intimidades.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidades resulto un exito a nivel internacional, y la segui
dirigiendo. Hasta que un dia, Frank Calderon, por razones que aun
desconozco, que dio un tanganazo con su miquina de escribir contra
un buro, y se marcho repentinamente. La gerencia me ofrecio su
posicion como directora de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora permitanme hacer un aparte, como recapitulacion de toda
esta experiencia. Muchas veces las mujeres profesionales me piden
consejo sobre como coordinar el trabajo y los hijos. Pero tambien
me dicen: ``Ja! Para ti es facil, porque tu tienes sirvientas,
servicio en la casa, tu no tienes que cocinar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pero eso es ahora. Que poquito se acuerde nadie de los tiempos
dificiles. A nadie se le ocurre pensar que para llegar a la
posicion que hoy ocupo, he tenido que atravesar una serie de
etapas. Nadie se aparecio, en mi camino, con una varita magica para
decirme: ``Puff! De ahora en lo adelante tu seras Cristina, la de
la television''.
</P>
<P>
   El triunfo tiene muy poco que ver con la suerte.

<P>
   Como el mundo editorial en que me desenvolvia estaba tan rela-
cionado con las companias disqueras, en una ocasion me llamo un
representante de la CBS para pedirme un favor con estas palabras
profeticas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Acabamos de firmar a un conjunto local, que se llama el Miami
Sound Machine. Los vamos a llevar a la discoteca Regine's en Nueva
York para lanzarlos como nuevos artistas de la compania, y
necesitamos que tu nos apoyes editorialmente con ellos''.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo--casualidades de la vida!--me habia llamado otro
amigo periodista de Puerto Rico, que estaba organizando un festival
de musica caribena en Cancun, Mexico, para pedirme que le
recomendara a un grupo que representara la musica latina que mas
estaba sonando en los Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Sin pensarlo dos veces, le recomende al Miami Sound Machine. Y
fue en el avion que nos llevo hacia el festival, donde por primera
vez conoci a Emilio y Gloria Estefan, y (casualmente!) a Marcos
Avila, el bajista de la banda.
</P>
<P>
   Durante ese viaje Emilio y Gloria fueron muy agradables, y
rapidamente entablamos amistad, tan espontanea y sincera que poco
despues Tony (mi esposo) y yo comenzamos a salir con ellos como
parejas.
</P>
<P>
   Viendolos a ellos, percibiendo la felicidad en su matrimonio, me
di cuenta de lo infeliz que yo era. Empece a darme cuenta que tenia
que cambiar las circunstancias en que me hallaba con el ejemplo de
ellos: trabajar juntos, echar para adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Un dia Emilio me dijo: ``Me voy a Peru con Gloria y con la
banda. Ya te estas divorciando. Ya tus problemas no tienen arreglo.
Por que no me dejas invitarte y te pasas diez dias alla, con
nosotros?''.
</P>
<P>
   Era mi destino encontrarme con mi destino.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, que es muy bromista, empezo a venderme a Marcos, no se
ni por que. Me repetia: ``Marcos Avila es mi mano derecha. Es un
muchacho muy serio... por que no se empatan?''.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos hoy me cuenta que durante todas sus experiencias con
Emilio, este siempre ha tenido este tipo de vision, presentimientos
que han llegado a convertirse en realidad. Ahora pienso que tal vez
Emilio presintio la reaccion quimica entre Marcos y yo antes de que
transcurriera todo lo que voy a contarles.
</P>
<P>
   Pero en aquel momento yo escuchaba sus palabras, y pensaba:
``Marcos es bajito, es gordito, tiene malas pulgas, es callado. Y
es casado! A mi me encantan los hombres altos, los guapos, los
lindos. Tambien tengo malas pulgas. Seria una combi- nacion
espantosa!''.
</P>
<P>
   Una noche fuimos todos a una discoteca. Yo estaba en la mesa de
Gloria y Emilio, y fui al bano. De repente veo que una mujer negra
y una mujer blanca comienzan a fajarse, con una navaja, por un
musico.
</P>
<P>
   Y el musico era Marcos! Me paralice. Hice lo que tenia que hacer
en piloto automatico, sin siquiera echarle un vistazo a las
rivales. Sali despavorida de aquel bano. Y al salir, Marcos se me
acerco para decirme: ``Quieres bailar?''
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``Ni loca!''. Y me regrese a la mesa para ver como
se desarrollaba el resto de aquella situacion.
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche Marcos me explico que estaba atravesando esa etapa
caotica de inestabilidad total que precede a un divorcio. A veces
dejaba su hogar para refugiarse en casa de su abuela, donde se
escondia por un par de semanas antes de regresar a su propia casa y
visitar a su bebita.
</P>
<P>
   Por mi parte, mi ex marido y yo estabamos separados, con pape-
les y todo.
</P>
<P>
   Con Marcos fue todo como el caso clasico de ``un clavo saca a
otro clavo''. Nos apoyamos el uno al otro, o la gordura se apoyo en
la hinchazon. Fuimos dos almas desgraciadas que se encontraron,
como dos desamparados bajo el puente.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de uno de los conciertos nos reunimos todos en una suite
y formamos tremenda fiesta. Al terminar la diversion, el se ofrecio
a acompanarme de regreso a mi habitacion. Entro conmi- go, se sento
en mi cama, me empezo a dar masajes en la espalda, y me dijo: ``Si
tu y yo hacemos el amor...''.
</P>
<P>
   De repente se corrigio:''No. Cuando tu y yo hagamos el amor, tu
vas a ver lo que es un hombre de verdad''.
</P>
<P>
   Yo me hice la que no lo habia oido; le dije good-bye bien
rapidito, le di un besito tonto, y se fue. Pero me quede pensando,
y con aquella promesa por dentro. Al dia siguiente me levante a las
seis de la manana, y me arregle hasta las unas de los pies!
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche volvio, y todas sus promesas se quedaron cortas.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de aquella experiencia, nunca mas nos separamos. Fue
como hacer el amor con alguien para quien te habian predisenado con
ese unico proposito y fin. Despues de tantos anos de infelicidad
conyugal, encontrarme con alguien hecho a la medida de mi cuerpo y
alma fue como un bofeton de proporciones karmicas.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos tiene once anos menos que yo. En aquel momento tenia una
cola de caballo como Miguel Bose, hasta la mitad de la espal- da;
en el frente, estaba rapado. Ademas, llevaba una argolla en una
oreja. En fin, el era un musico.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres estaban completamente opuestos a la relacion. Aparte
de que Titi, mi nina, era tremenda! Recuerdo que el primer dia que
Marcos llego a casa, Titi tenia unas esposas de policia plasticas
de juguete, y lo amarro a la escalera de metal de la casa, lo dejo
ahi, y boto la llave... para que el no pudiera estar conmigo.
Tuvimos que romper las esposas.
</P>
<P>
   Ante aquella situacion, le adverti a el: ``Tienes que primera
mente conquistarla a ella, porque yo no me voy a casar si ella no
quiere que me case.
</P>
<P>
   Al cabo de nuestro primer ano juntos, la nina habia llegado a
tenerle tanto carino a Marcos que un dia me dijo: ``Mami, el nos
quiere. El es bueno. Por que no nos casamos con el?''.
</P>
<P>
   No pude menos que reirme!
</P>
<P>
   Para la boda me puse un vestido blanco de algodon que habia
comprado en Mexico, y Titi llevaba uno exacto; compre unas
florecitas blancas para el pelo, y otras a ella. Entonces ella se
paro a mi lado, con su vestidito exacto al mio, y las dos nos
casamos con Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Mas tarde, a pesar de su exito y del dinero que estaba ganando,
y despues de doce anos consecutivos con el Miami Sound machine,
decidio irse del grupo. ``Ya tuve las fans, y las limosinas y ``The
Johnny Carson Show,'' fueron sus palabars exactas. ``Ahora quiero
tener una familia.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos abrio una compania de relaciones publicas: MagikCity
Media, la cual aun mantiene. Y una vez que el comprobo que a el le
estaba yendo bien, empezo a lavarme el cerebro para que yo me fuera
de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Mi reaction: ``Tu estas loco?''
</P>
<P>
   No obstante, Marcos me convencio de que lo que yo estaba
haciendo en aquella empresa era vender mi tiempo en vez de mi
talento.
</P>
<P>
   Y recuerden bien todos los que esten leyendo este libro ese
consejo tan importante, a cualquier nivel de vida en que se
encuentren en estos momentos.

<P>
   Para nadar en el mundo de la television, nada fue facil.
Empezando porque tuve que despojarme, como una serpiente, del
cuerpo, la cara, el pelo y mi apariencia completa... y de todo a lo
que estaba acostumbrada durante los ultimos 20 anos de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Habia sido escritora y directora de revistas, trabajaba en un
buro como una esclava, y cuando me tomaba un receso, me daba por
devorar todo lo que habia en las maquinas de alimentos, lo cual me
hacia engordar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando hoy miro los videos del primer ano del ``Show de
Cristina,'' me horrorizo. Me veo fea, ridicula, gritona y como un
caballito en rifa, llena de gangarrias, cadenas, pulseras, aretes
de tres pisos, con todo colgando y haciendo ruido con el microfono.
</P>
<P>
   El cambio fue paulatino. Poco a poco fuimos puliendo mi imagen,
y prestando atencion a la reaccion del publico. Me costo mucho
trabajo encontrar mi estilo. Ahora conservo el cabello liso,
cortado en una sola capa, y me gusta el maquillaje tenue y la ropa
sencilla.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a comer sin grasa y sin azucar, y pequenas cantidades de
proteina cada tres horas, para mantener mi energia estable y poder
funcionar mejor durante todo el dia. El resultado fue que por
primera vez me veia regia en la television, y por primera vez en mi
vida entendi lo que era ser una mujer atrac- tiva porque cuando
llegaba a cualquier lugar, la gente se volteaba a mirarme aunque no
supieran quien era. Eso jamas me habia pasado... y tenia 41 anos!
</P>
<P>
   Otro factor en mi apariencia era ser tan blanca, tan rubia y con
los ojos claros. Cuando el show fue lanzado al aire, llovian las
cartas de mis hermanos hispanos en todos los Estados Unidos, en las
cuales mencionaban que yo era ``demaslado blanca'' y ``guera''
(rubia para los mexicanos) para representar a las hispanas, cuando
brown era beautiful ...y yo no era brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hasta que comprendieron que lo que me estaban haciendo a mi era
tan racista como lo que les estaban haciendo los anglos a ellos...
y las criticas cesaron. Pero el proceso torno seis meses de cartas
del publico en las que me decian que me pusiera mis ruborizador.
</P>
<P>
   Una vez se me acerco una senora de edad avanzada y me reprocho:
``Ay, usted nada mas que habla de sexo, Cristina''.
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``No senora, yo hablo de todo! Desde platillos
voladores hasta el cancer del seno. Usted solamente recuerda los
programas de sexo.''
</P>
<P>
   Presento temas de sexo porque aparte de la enorme necesidad que
hay de informar sobre la materia, cada vez que incluyo algo de
sexo, en el programa los ratings se van por las nubes, y los
numeros desplazan la hipocresia.
</P>
<P>
   Por que en vez de criticar un programa llamado a una emisora de
radio o escribiendo cartas airadas no apagan los televisores cuando
hay algo de sexo? Pero...Noo! Al reves. Se prenden mas y mas
televisores.
</P>
<P>
   Es evidente que muchas personas no tienen la menor idea de lo
que es la sexualidad humana, y alguien les tiene que explicar la
verdad. Obviamiente sus padres no han asumido la responsabilidad de
hacerlo, porque la responsabilidad de educar sexualmente a nuestros
hijos, igual que moralmente, es de nosotros los padres.
</P>
<P>
   Mi primer viaje con ``El Show de Cristina'' a Mexico fue muy
importante en el desarrollo del programa. Tuvimos una fastuosa
conferencia de prensa, seguida de un almuerzo, durante el cual me
presentaron a la prensa mexicana para que les explicara el concepto
del programa. Fue una experiencia agradable y alentadora.
</P>
<P>
   La debacle que se avecinaba se comenzo a fraguar cuando
``Cristina'' comenzo a trasmitirse en el horario de las cuatro de
la tarde (igual que en los Estados Unidos) y reemplazando la pro-
gramacion infantil que existia previamente a esa hora.
</P>
<P>
   Es decir, que en un pais tan tradicional como Mexico, eligieron
para un programa polemico y controversial como el mio, un horario
en que quienes veian la television eran principalmente los ninos.
</P>
<P>
   A partir de ese momento comenzaron las quejas de algunas
asociaciones de padres de familia, y del publico en general, contra
el programa y, especialmente, contra el horario del programa.
</P>
<P>
   Un poco despues cambiron el programa al horario de las once de
la noche, y yo, inocentemente ajena a esta caceria de brujas que se
estaba produciendo, viaje a Mexico con mi equipo para grabar por
primera vez.
</P>
<P>
   Al llegar al estudio, todo fue de maravilla. El foro tenia
capacidad para 500 espectaclores y estaba siempre abarrotado de
personas que esperaban el dia entero para poder entrar.
</P>
<P>
   Pero una vez que todas estas asociaciones, que mientras tanto me
estaban atacando, se enteraron que yo estaba grabando en la Ciudad
de Mexico, enviaron un sequito de periodistas para entre- vistarme.
Excepto que no me hacian las preguntas normales, como los
periodistas en otras partes. Aquello era un ataque frontal, verbal
y luego escrito. Yo me preguntaba: Dios mio, pero por que este
rencor? No entendia lo que estaba sucediendo!
</P>
<P>
   ``Bodas Homosexuales,'' el programa el mas controversial hasta
la fecha, me hizo cuestionar hasta que punto se puede correr el
riesgo de poner en peligro la estabilidad de la familla, y de seres
quendos a un nivel personal, por cuestiones de principlos.
</P>
<P>
   El programa fue lanzado al aire el 4 de enero de 1996, y aunque
fue conducido con decoro y respeto, se suscito una campana de odio
muy intensa en Miami que desato una desagradable corriente de
intolerancia.
</P>
<P>
   Todo esto culmino en una manifestacion frente a los estudios de
Univision en Miami, donde aproximadamente 1,500 personas acudieron
con pancartas que decian: ``ABAJO CRISTINA!'', ``N0 A `EL SHOW DE
CRISTNA,' SI A CRISTO!''.
</P>
<P>
   Mi papa va a misa todos los dias. A raiz de este incidente,
estaba en la iglesia, y como hacia frio, llevaba puesto una
chaqueta del programal que dice ``Cristina'' en la parte de atras.
</P>
<P>
   El sacerdote estaba diciendo tantos horrores de nosotros en el
pulpito que mi papa, para no causar otro incidente, se quito la
chaqueta y la doblo, para que no se viera el nombre de su hija.
</P>
<P>
   Mi hijo que entonces tenia 10 anos aparentemente se entero de
los ataques en su colegio parroquial, ya que un dia llego a la casa
y me pregunto muy consternado: ``Mami, estamos teniendo
problemas?''.
</P>
<P>
   Estos incidentes desafortunados me hicieron suffir las criticas
en carne propia.
</P>
<P>
   Surgio la consabida pregunta: no me parecia mal que los ninos
vieran una boda de homosexuales en la television, a las cuatro de
la tarde? Si me hubiera parecido mal, no lo habria presentado.
</P>
<P>
   Me parecen aun mas alarmantes las cifras de ninas prostitutas,
de abuso sexual infantil, de drogadiccion y alcoholismo entre los
adolescentes.
</P>
<P>
   Pero aunque me alarme y me aterre--dada la profesion que escogi,
y la suerte que Dios me ha dado de tener un programa como
este--tengo el deber y el compromiso de informar, y el compromiso
de reflejar la realidad que existe en el mundo en que vivimos.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres emigraron de Cuba para que yo creciera en una
sociedad donde no hubiera censura. Y si los ataques personales eran
el precio que yo tenia que pagar--no solo el precio personal, sino
el de mi familla--estaba mas que nunca dispuesta a pagarlo por el
resto de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Gracias a Dios, ellos piensan igual que yo, especialmente mis
tres hijos.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Voluntary uniforms clothe dress-code crackdown
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few better indicators of social change than school
dress codes.
</P>
<P>
   In times of prosperity, people get sillier in their dress. (It's
a known fact, so take some solace from the stock market's recent
dive.) And when widespread fashion silliness trickles down to the
classroom, administrators strike back.
</P>
<P>
   Because current fashion excesses take their cues from fashion
excesses of the '70s and '80s, parents now are in the peculiar
position of seeing their children sent to the office for the same
styles that earned them the scrutiny of yesterday's assistant
principals. This makes the work of a fashion cop harder both for
enforcers and perps.
</P>
<P>
   As one who was predestined to nerdhood from the time I first
laced up a pair of black hightops, I had few dress-code problems.
But when I did, it was a beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   My hair did it. I was not attempting fashion, I just didn't like
haircuts. Haircuts involved my father dragging me to places that
smelled of talc and cheap smoke and discussing my appearance with
men in white coats who called me ``Sport'' and ``Red.'' Even for
me, it was a visit to the geek factory. I fought it with the best
weapons at my disposal _ procrastination and laying low.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, it could be put off no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop right there, Red,'' the assistant principal called out to
me in a busy, between-periods junior-high hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Surely he meant someone else. Like many nerds, I operated on the
assumption that I was invisible to authority figures, cool kids and
girls over 10. This belief was seldom challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Since my name was not Red, I kept walking. He couldn't mean me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean you,'' he growled.
</P>
<P>
   I was apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   I was officially informed on paper and in the office that I had
24 hours to have my hair tamed to requisite length. Preferably by a
man in white who would put down a tattered copy of Argosy and say
``Whaddle it be, Red?'' by way of introduction.
</P>
<P>
   I slunk back to class.
</P>
<P>
   Yet upon my return, I found something amazing had happened. My
social standing, which was about what you'd expect of someone who
could work a sliderule, had strangely altered. In the short time I
spent in the principal's office, I somehow had achieved outlaw
status. Cool kids spoke to me for the first time. Detention room
recidivists commiserated. Girls ignored me in an altogether more
pleasant manner.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the school day was way-cool. But the spell was
broken that afternoon as soon as I heard the phrase ``Whaddle it
be, Red?''
</P>
<P>
   I went back to being ultra-nerd for the next decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   That experience was on my mind, as I read the dress code that my
kids' middle school just mailed out to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only hair colors which occur naturally in humans are
appropriate,'' I recited. The kids groaned, protested and noted
that the blue rinse favored by several older substitute teachers
may be out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   More interestingly, the school also launched what they called
``an optional uniform policy.'' You can wear a uniform to school
but don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   This has an odd sound to it. Is a voluntary uniform really a
uniform? I can't imagine the Enterprise with half the crew in sharp
Star Fleet jumpsuits and the other in baggy jeans and backwards
baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as dumb as the phrase ``voluntary uniform'' sounds, it is
good training for what we laughingly call The Real World. A place
full of voluntary uniforms. From the suits that mark one as a suit,
to the leather jackets that may mark one variously as a biker, a
mid-life crisis case or cold-weather slacker. There's khaki
voluntary uniforms of information-age workers. And, of course, the
real voluntary uniform of middle school boys: baggy and long shorts
with oversized T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that's not the school's official voluntary uniform. That
could doom the voluntary uniform movement before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   But if the kids grasp the concept, they'll understand what's
going on when the time comes to strap on ties and pull up
pantyhose. This will put them ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems a shame to hurry them there. We don't get to be
cool very long. And having been a cool kid for one day, I'm the
wrong one to rush anyone into voluntary uniforms.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Is it any wonder our children are so violent?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ There's a two-foot banner of toilet paper
streaming from the top of the raspberry bush beside my garage door.
Kids did it last Saturday night, probably some of my students on a
sleepover. It means they like me _ I think.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, three teens were pulled over by police at 3:30 a.m.
for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. You'll never guess
what officers found in the truck: Silly String, Liquid Plumr,
aluminum foil, and plastic two-liter bottles. The boys were out for
a little harmless bomb throwing because they didn't like the way
their boss had been treating them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the would-be bombers told police they intended to
``terrorize'' the boss's house, make a smiley face in the lawn with
gasoline, take an ax to the shrubs, and throw a bomb on the lawn.
Nice going, guys; that ought to get your point across. Can't help
but wonder, wouldn't it have been a lot simpler just to look for
another job?
</P>
<P>
   But worst of all, I have this gut feeling that at least one set
of parents is denying their son has a problem and is referring to
the entire episode as a ``boyish prank''? Maybe because we've heard
it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is really a good boy,'' we read when little Sammy
attempts to get even for an imagined slight by shooting up his
classroom, or decides to blow away his grandmother because she
makes lousy cookies. ``He's just a little troubled.'' Troubled?
Definitely. A good boy? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good boys'' don't feel the need to emulate Hagar the Horrible
when life doesn't quite meet their expectations; they don't become
terrorists when their boss offends them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good boys,'' my friend, a teen-court judge on the Oregon coast
says, ``are the lucky ones whose childhood has equipped them with
moral and ethical alternatives to such over-the-top behavior _
whose parents haven't joined the not so elite ranks of the
out-to-lunch parent bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekly, she deals with the results of parents acting more like
children than their offspring. ``A single father I know took his
son off to Utah and dumped him in a drug rehab program. It's good
the boy is getting help, but the reasons he's there are not. The
father has known for two years that his son has a drug problem, but
when I asked him why he hadn't taken steps earlier, why he hadn't
kept the boy at home instead of letting him hang out at the skating
rink where he knew drugs were rampant, his response was: 'He needs
to spend time with his friends.' I know what that translates to,''
she says, ``because I hear it every court session. What that parent
is saying is: I don't have time to keep my kid at home because I'm
busy making money and having a life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same guy,'' she reminds me, ``whose 18-year-old
daughter has been allowed to bring her boyfriends home for
sleepovers since she was 16. The father's reasoning? 'They're not
doing anything.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, discipline takes time and energy
and it's a lot easier just to give in. Heck,'' she chuckles, ``I'm
56 years old and my mother's 87, and I can promise you if I showed
up at her door with a boyfriend, there'd be separate sleeping
arrangements that she wouldn't hesitate to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I had a parent tell me the reason police couldn't
find her at 2 a.m. to notify her that her 15-year-old daughter had
just been picked up incoherent on the beach was because she (the
mother) was sleeping at her boyfriend's place. I asked why she
didn't sleep at home and keep an eye on her daughter. You know what
she said? 'Because I was poor and abused as a child so I don't know
about things like that.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The judge's advice to her was to get over it. ``You're all grown
up now and it's time to assume responsibility for your actions AND
those of your children.'' But she knows she's whistling in the
wind. This is the kid's third offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's having this big conference in October,'' my
friend reminds me, ``to find out why there is so much violence in
our schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a waste of time and money; it's just another load of
'feel good' bull. Ask any judge who deals with kids. The pattern is
invariable. Kids are enraged at having no parents. And don't
forget, almost all they know so far in their lives they have
learned from television.''
</P>
<P>
   Well parents, it's up to us. What's it going to be? Toilet paper
on the raspberry bush or bombs on the lawn?

 &HT;    Commentary: Left holding bed pan by Medicare
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If only Herb Evans were sick.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the government told his health provider.
</P>
<P>
   If only Evans had pneumonia, or a bronchial infection _
something other than the fact that he can't use his arms or legs,
or that his lungs work only at 20 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   If so, if Herb Evans were sick, then Medicare would pay for
home-health visits as it had until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is still well enough to chuckle at the irony in these
statements. His vocal chords still afford his usual loquacity. But
it's no laughing matter. The Waco man is dying of ALS _ Lou
Gehrig's Disease _ though at 57, seven years after his diagnosis,
he bucks the odds of this vicious killer each day he breathes anew.
</P>
<P>
   Every muscle in his body is failing. And it's not sick enough
for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't some bookkeeping screw-up. Medicare knows exactly
what's killing this man. But under money-saving revisions approved
by Congress, since he's not having an ``acute episode'' or any
complication that requires a licensed nurse, he was informed he was
no longer eligible for home-care visits under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is among hundreds of thousands of home-bound Americans cut
at the knees by limitations put on home-care benefits in the 1997
Balanced Budget Act. Some were affected by a cap placed on how much
assistance they could get in a year. What the act did was draw a
line at projected costs based on 1994 figures and say, ``No more
home-care beyond that.'' The objective was to curb the rapid growth
of home-care costs and to get at fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Congress didn't understand what was driving
up the cost of home care. It wasn't fraud. It was choice, and sound
decisions. People who otherwise would be in costly institutional
care choose home care, generally fending for themselves with loved
ones helping, and relying on professionals only for daily visits of
short duration.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a bargain, Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   In Evans' case such visits mean helping him out of bed once a
day _ to bathe, to use the bathroom _ and otherwise to check his
vital signs and make sure all's well. His working wife and a son
spend as much time as they can with him, but she can't hoist him
out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, sir. If only you were sick.
</P>
<P>
   As if his plight needs more irony, it came shortly after the bad
news set in about home care, which Medicare had been paying for
through Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center. The Evanses found out
that Medicare would pay for the same services, and more, through a
hospice program based on his terminal prognosis. He switched over
to the Hillcrest Hospice.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, Herb Evans will chuckle _ he can still do it this
week _ to report that being diagnosed terminally ill, and
qualifying for hospice, is his lucky break, home-care wise.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be necessary. Ears have been burning in Washington.
Finally policy-makers are responding. Leaders on both sides of the
aisle in Washington are urging a halt to Medicare cuts which had
fallen so unmercifully on home care.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Pyle, manager of the home care service that was helping
Evans until the limits came into play, said that taking care out of
the home will compromise people's health and cost more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to force a lot of people into nursing home
environments, a lot of people into acute care.'' It's also going to
drive some people into poverty and over onto the Medicaid rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Evans says it jokingly, but it's no joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to save Medicare, but wanted us to die.''

 FUNKY iMAC BRINGS NEW LOOK, HOPE FOR APPLE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ A goateed, British-born industrial designer
used Apple Computer Inc.'s new iMac as a pulpit for his crusade
against computers designed more for computer builders than for
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start with engineering dictates,'' said Jonathan
Ive, 31, Apple's vice president of industrial design. ``We actually
started with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac began with an idea from Apple co-founder and interim
chief executive Steve Jobs: To make a computer that would follow
not only form, but fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first talked about this, we didn't talk about other
computer companies,'' Ive said. ``We talked about companies like
Swatch, companies that broke the rules, that viewed technology as a
way to the consumer, not the consumer as the path to the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's latest _ some are saying last _ effort to again become a
force in home computing goes on sale Saturday. According to Apple,
the pre-orders for the $1,299 iMac are making this the largest
computer roll-out in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   Key to this crucial comeback is iMac's look: A sleek,
translucent white and aquamarine all-in-one machine straight out of
a Jetsons cartoon. The look is the creation of a secret Apple
international design team gathered and headed by Ive.
</P>
<P>
   Apple used customer focus groups to help create the blueprint
for the new machine. The response was immediate, and clear, Ive
said: Today's computers are complicated, mysterious _ even
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   One person's comments still sticks in Ive's mind. ``She said, `I
want to be able to do this and that. I want to be able to do some
e-mail. Don't give me any of your megahertz. I don't need those.'
It's very sobering,'' Ive said, ``to see how the majority of people
see high-tech products.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter those reactions, a ``back to the future'' look was
chosen. Nostalgia paired with progress. More Jetsons, less Blade
Runner. It's a design, Ive said, inspired by Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve talked specifically about the `Jetsons,''' Ive said.
``How it showed a future that was comfortable, not dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's design team then set about coming up with a computer in
which ``form slavishly followed function.'' Instead of cables
snaking from a hard-to-reach rear, iMac's connections _ for a
keyboard, mouse and other peripherals _ are in a single large port
on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for cables to be in the back, except that
it's easier for the engineers,'' Ive said.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac was also has a giant top handle built into it, a
favorite Ive feature. ``It's great. You immediately see it and know
it's for your hand. The product immediately becomes usable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the iMac shipping container was ``designed obsessively,''
Ive said. A cutout in the foam packaging allows a new user to lift
the machine easily from the box. The mouse's cord is packed coiled,
not crimped, the better to keep kinks away.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the translucent plastic skin, the antithesis of
computer beige. According to Ive, the plastic was colored after
consultation with candy industry pros.
</P>
<P>
   The see-though covering _ which changes hue with the intensity
of the room lighting _ forced some fundamental design changes for
the interior of the iMac, including the elimination of
reinforcement ribs and interior nuts and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to express the technology,'' Ive said.
``We're trying to express it as technology that can do a lot of
different things for different people.''
</P>
<P>
   One feature _ or lack thereof _ has raised some hackles in the
computer world: The iMac does not come with a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you the best Apple answer on the lack of the
floppy,'' Ive said. ``I can give you my answer: When you move on,
you have to leave some things behind. The floppy drive, which I
will argue until I'm blue in the face, is really antiquated
technology. I've heard the complaints,'' he said, ``but if there's
not some sort of friction in a move forward, then your step is not
as consequential as you'd like to believe it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the perfect computer,'' he sighed, rubbing his
creation's cover protectively. ``But I think we've taken a
consequential step here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But is it too much, too late for Apple, which has seen its
market share plummet in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be the savior for the company,'' said
Forrester Research consumer technology analyst Tom Rhinelander.
``It's just a stopgap measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based analyst said Apple's less-than 5
percent market share is too weak to revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer wars are over,'' Rhinelander said. ``Apple lost.
It's time for them to move on to other technologies that aren't
computer based.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Wolf, a director in the equity research department
at Credit Suisse First Boston, disagreed. ``Nobody knows what's
going to happen. The fact is, there's an enormous build-up for this
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said there were an estimated 10 million Mac users
worldwide, 30 percent to 40 percent of whom are using four-year-old
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 10 percent of Mac owners decide to upgrade to an iMac,
that's a million units sold,'' Wolf said. ``That's an incredible
performance. And after seeing the iMac, I think its doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer reported its third straight money-making quarter
in mid-July, earning $101 million (65 cents a diluted share) and
far outstripping expectations. That compared with a loss of $56
million (44 cents) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been locked down in a design studio for the last
year, Ive said he was well aware of what is riding on the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I've heard all the numbers,'' he said, when asked about
Apple's minute market share. ``But that's what gave us some
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot to lose,'' he said.

JOCKEY IS OLDER, WISER AND HAPPY IN SECOND PLACE

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Down the stretch, Awesome Again decided
it was quitting time. Awesome Again quit procrastinating, quit
letting all the people holding betting slips for the No. 7 horse
wonder if he was going to ever get around to living up to his name.
</P>
<P>
   With only mild urging from jockey Pat Day, Awesome Again pulled
away from the competition, toward the finish line, at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone knew what was going to unfold as she watched the 1
1/8-mile replay of the race on a television screen underneath the
grandstand at Saratoga Race Course. Krone had a close-up view from
her seat aboard Tale of the Cat moments earlier, yet she couldn't
resist getting caught up in the moment again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noooooooo!'' Krone shrieked at the television screen in agony
and ecstasy, because there she was, right back in the middle of a
big race at her idea of the summer place to be. Just like the first
time, Tale of the Cat finished three lengths off the lead Saturday
afternoon in the $400,000 Whitney Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most fun I had being second,'' Krone said, ``in
my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is what happens while you're trying to ignore everybody
around you getting older. Julie Krone _ the 4-foot, 10-inch,
100-pound sweetheart of Saratoga _ is 35 now. Can you believe it?
She has been riding winners and losers for nearly half her life,
and she has the scars to show it.
</P>
<P>
   A decade has passed since Krone cracked the top five in the
national jockey standings for the first time. Six Saratoga seasons
have come and gone since Krone came within one victory of tying
Mike Smith for first in the Spa's jockey standings. Five years have
elapsed since Krone and Colonial Affair were a winning combination
at the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Once Krone passed that rite of passage into horse-racing
history, nothing seemed out of reach. She had barely turned 30 when
she won five races in one day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero had been
the first to do it. Ron Turcotte, the jockey of Secretariat, was
the second. Krone was the third.
</P>
<P>
   The fall happened 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Off a horse. From grace.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been the same for Krone since Aug. 30, 1993. Krone
was second in the riding standings when she went down on the final
day of the season _ her right ankle going snap, crackle, pop. She
returned nearly nine months later with two plates and 14 screws
still in her rebuilt ankle. She stopped winning as often as the
owners and trainers demanded. She stopped getting the mounts that
would let her win the way she and her fans had come to expect. She
dropped to the B list, unable to make her mark at Saratoga or any
of the other hot spots anymore. Last year, Krone decided that the
best way to rebuild her career was to take a step down to the
Monmouth Park circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through so much,'' Krone said. She said it with a
smile, without a hint of self-pity. She was back at Saratoga, if
only for a brief interlude. Her mount had traded the lead with
Awesome Again for much of the race, and she had heard the screams
of 30,665 fans. As Krone wound her way back toward the finish line
after the race, fans gave her a winner's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was for the horse,'' Krone said. ``These people know what
they're looking at. They can tell that he ran as hard as he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they could tell that he had run as hard as Julie Krone
could ride him. People forget a lot of things, but the years
haven't done a thing to dim the memories that the Saratoga crowd
has for Krone. They remember the rise, the fall. They remember how
she tried to pick herself back up, and they let her know how much
they appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate when people react,'' Krone said. ``Here
is special.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not every place where fan after fan will tell a jockey
``Great ride'' after a second-place finish. People want to see
Krone in Saratoga, and they want to see her do well. She's a part
of the place, part of the rich history, even if it embarrasses her
for anybody to suggest that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because of the success and the adversity,'' Krone
said. ``This is the place where I got beat by one for leading rider
and was at the highest point of competitiveness in New York. I'm
riding every day with Angel (Cordero) and Mike (Smith). It was
proving something, doing something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they witnessed me almost getting killed. It's like
everybody gets to go through it with me. Maybe they feel like it
shows a good side of them also _ that people are capable of
overcoming a lot. They recognize what I've been through, and it
makes them connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the emotional connections can get a little
complicated. Saratoga is where a love connection resulted in a 1995
wedding. Saratoga is also where Krone rode so high and fell so far,
so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good when people ask me for my autograph and
stuff,'' Krone said. ``Then somebody will go, `I saw you fall. I
was at the hospital. It was so gross. Your ankle was turned
backwards.' I have to deal with that all the time. It's all part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting easier, though. I've become better at blocking it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is what happens to you when people get older, and they go
through changes. Things always change _ sometimes for the better,
sometimes for the worse, sometimes for better and worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at Monmouth, I switch between races,'' Krone said.
``And every race I see, I yearn to be here. I miss it a lot. I feel
drawn. It makes me feel very sad. Part of me stays here.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone managed a smile. This was a day for Krone to be
happy, to enjoy where she is and what she's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as fun as it can be,'' she said, ``running second.''

ALL THE WORLD'S A JOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Another columnist at the Boston Globe is biting
the dust. Just two months after Patricia Smith was forced to resign
for inventing people and quotes in her columns, Mike Barnicle has
been asked to resign for stealing eight jokes from a book by George
Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of this case is that they were such lousy jokes.
</P>
<P>
   At least Smith invented interesting characters, who spoke in
lively fabricated quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle borrowed such Carlin jokes as ``Some day I wanna see
the pope come out on that balcony and give the football scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's version used ``I'd love to'' instead of ``I wanna''
and baseball scores instead of football, but it still wasn't funny.
Maybe it was funnier when spoken by Carlin in a stand-up routine.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's excuse was that he'd never read Carlin's book and
someone had sent him the lines. Then a TV station produced a tape
of him recommending the book. So Barnicle said he had recommended
it without reading it.
</P>
<P>
   How long does it take to read it? It's a book of jokes, not
``War And Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think it's pretty low-grade for a columnist to
steal eight lousy jokes from a lousy book.
</P>
<P>
   After a careful review of my last 10 columns, I've discovered
that 42 of the lousy jokes were my own, and five of the lousy jokes
were stolen from previous columns by me.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in recycling. The secret, like recycling plastic, is
to form the material into something slightly different, if just as
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 good jokes in my last 10 columns, eight were from my
wife, and four were from colleagues. Look, I have to come up with
five columns a week, so if I hear a decent line or printable joke,
I use it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm fabricating the above numbers, because I thought
all jokes I used were great, even my own. There also were dozens of
puns and plays on words that were strictly my own, and also great,
in my own estimation.
</P>
<P>
   You'll never catch me fabricating modesty for very long.
</P>
<P>
   This is all in the interest of a new policy called ``being
honest with the public.'' Or, let's be really honest and call it
``being dishonest in a lively way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what America wants. Look at this Clinton-Lewinsky thing.
</P>
<P>
   Every news-talk show in America is all-Monica, all-the-time. Are
the commentators honest about this, saying they are doing this for
ratings and prurient interest in fabric stains?
</P>
<P>
   No way. According to them, it's a constitutional crisis and a
test of a presidency. Then they go on repeating the same
allegations we all heard months ago.
</P>
<P>
   George Carlin jokes start to look good after this, even recycled
ones. In fact, Jerry Seinfeld was funny about this on ``Letterman''
last week, wondering why the president was in trouble for lying
about sex, saying, ``Without lying, there would be no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld stole that line from his own Broadway show, but acted
like he spoke it spontaneously, which is his job. As I said before,
if a line is good, recycle it. Wear it out. (Or use it in your
column, and then note that Seinfeld previously stole it from
himself.)
</P>
<P>
   The line I made up two weeks ago was ``Aren't people supposed to
lie about sex?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I really overheard a version of it in a conversation. It
wasn't as funny as Seinfeld's line. It's just true, so I didn't
count it as a borrowed joke.
</P>
<P>
   If everybody were completely honest, and the world didn't look
like the same bad joke over and over again, life would be easier
but very boring.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what a terrible world it would be if the Dallas
Cowboys really were a squeaky-clean America's Team, instead of
America's Most Wanted Team (that name has entered the public domain
_ I don't know who made it up).
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys once again are facing allegations of disorganized
crime (a dumb play on words I take responsibility for). Michael
Irvin (whole Web sites are devoted to Irvin jokes) reportedly
slashed teammate Everett McIver with a pair of scissors in a
dispute over who was next in line for a haircut, but the Cowboys
are downplaying the incident as ``horseplay'' (no joke, but funny).
</P>
<P>
   Ah, we're glad to read that the NFL has a violent crime policy
(again, no joke). If a player uses a deadly weapon in the
commission of a crime, he must undergo mandatory clinical
evaluation and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't a joke either _ except as a punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If you or I slashed a co-worker with scissors while on the job,
we'd undergo mandatory clinical firing and prosecution. But these
are the jock gods of football, and even if they plagiarize the
actions of street thugs, they are still making millions instead of
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The above, of course, is what all Americans think when they hear
about Dallas Cowboys getting off easy. In a column, it is just as
hard to come up with an original moral lesson as it is an original
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Some day I'd love to see the pope appear on his balcony and tell
Dallas Cowboys jokes. Does the pope do off-color material? Does he
steal lines? No, it's unoriginal sin.
</P>
<P>
   Or did Father Guido Sarducci already use that line?

 PUTTING AN UGLY STAMP ON THE '70s  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While some good things happened to me during the
1970s _ I got a college degree, saw both Richard Burton and Rex
Harrison on stage, moved to San Francisco, visited Paris in the
springtime and first tasted Dom Perignon _ I tend to think of the
decade as a whole as a tacky, unfocused wash-out.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Postal Service has reaffirmed my suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its continuing ``Celebrate the Century'' project, the
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee has released its 30 nominees for
stamps that will commemorate the 1970s. As with previous decades,
Mr. and Ms. America get to vote and pick the 15 subjects that will
become actual stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 choices for the '70s, I can find only eight I'd even
consider voting for. And three of those would make mighty ugly
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The other 22, well, they include the Smiley Face, the Pittsburgh
Steelers, Tennis and _ dare I say it? _ Disco.
</P>
<P>
   When I remember ``People and Events'' of the '70s, I don't
remember much. The stamp nominees in that category back me up.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Rights Movement, Watergate, Earth Day, the Oil
Shortage, the Opening of China and the Bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Earth Day deserves a stamp. The Opening of China, too. They were
big deals then, they're big deals today. Which is more than you can
say for the Oil Shortage or Bicentennial. (Would you pay 32 cents
for an oil shortage stamp?)
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Rights Movement is good, except it began in the
'60s. As for Watergate, the post office says it doesn't commemorate
disasters. Who but Bob Woodward wouldn't call Watergate a disaster?
</P>
<P>
   Other categories for '70s stamps are Arts and Entertainment,
Sports, Science and Technology, and Lifestyle. The pickings within
are slim.
</P>
<P>
   True, I'd vote for stamps for ``Sesame Street,'' the National
Public Radio-Public Broadcasting System and for ``Roots.'' And
ditto the magnificent Triple Crown winner Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I believe they have become the Diversions That Ate
America's Brain, ``Monday Night Football'' and VCRs probably
deserve stamps for making their mark on the collective culture.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the end of the stamp worthy for me. What remains:
</P>
<P>
   In Arts and Entertainment _ ``The Godfather,'' the Spiral Jetty,
``All in the Family,'' ``A Chorus Line'' and Photo Realism. (I love
``The Godfather,'' but as a stamp, it's an offer I can refuse. I
hadn't a clue what the Spiral Jetty was so I looked it up. It's an
example of ``land-and-earth art'' by Robert Smithson. OK. No
stamp.)
</P>
<P>
   In Sports _ The aforementioned Steelers, Soccer Leagues, Tennis
and the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   In Science and Technology _ Jumbo Jets, Pioneer 10 and Medical
Imaging. (Noble, but imagine the stamp.)
</P>
<P>
   In Lifestyle _ Smiley Face, Postmodern Architecture, Jogging,
1970s Fashion, Citzens Band Radio and Disco.
</P>
<P>
   How can you get postmodern architecture onto a postage stamp?
Why would you want to put a CB radio on? And 1970s Fashion? That
flared, platformed, polyester mutant should never have been born
yet is back again here at the end of the '90s. Give it a stamp?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I remind the Postal Service of its no-disasters
rule.

   The hotel chambermaid stood at my door, my size 10 black German
leather sandals in her dainty right hand. I'd left them in the
workout room under the Cybex leg-extension machine _ something I'd
never do in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you! Where would I be without my shoes?'' I gushed,
fishing five francs out of my coat pocket. Giggling, she took the
coin and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That night it was out with friends to their favorite pretty
little bistro. Till the wee hours, we feasted on rillettes de
sardines, Coquille St-Jacques in garlic and scallion sauce,
peppered pear dessert, sparkling wine and espresso _ and oui! _
massive quantities of billowing cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, my raw throat felt like a tractor had rolled
through it on caterpillar treads. My vision was blurred; I was
alternately sweating and freezing. Was I really going to be sick
all day? I glanced out the window. There was a huge poster for a
French opera company showing a sylph whirling in a pink tutu, and
someone had defaced it by spray-painting the giant words coming out
of her mouth: ``Bill Clinton, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for energy, I devoured the contents of my minibar: nuts,
chips, Toblerone, salami, cheese, yogurt (for the live cultures), a
banana. Then I fetched my PruCarePlus HMO Out-of-Network Service
Card. ``... Designated user must call provider immediately in case
of emergency ... if hospitalization or surgery is recommended,
please call 1-800- ...'' Another wave of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily my friends were home by the phone. They told me that in
France there is an ``S.O.S.-doctor'' program for emergencies, ``a
really nice service you can't have in America because the doctors
are too afraid of being sued for malpractice.'' The physicians make
old-fashioned house calls, even to your hotel room, they said.
''Just ask the reception desk. Tell them you need a doctor. They'll
call one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, okay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, Madame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick. I need a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooo ...''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, more torture. I imagined my mother's voice, saw her
forefinger waggling in my face: A strange man coming to my hotel
room? Why, he might be anyone! Maybe he was going to do terrible
things to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom. Right, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later I heard a knock, unbolted the door and
there, undoubtedly sent from heaven or Central Casting, was Doctor
Emile Mallereau, Medecine Generale: about 6 foot 3, firm square
jaw, wide shoulders, blue-green eyes, high forehead, ruddy skin,
wavy hair _ and yes, even a small black bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you zee patient?'' _ he entered with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, yes ... yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold?'' he winced. (Indeed, I had dialed the thermostat up as
far as possible and heaped three extra plaid blankets on the bed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Im afraid so,'' I said, tugging at my bathrobe. ``Is it
uncomfortable in here?'' _ trying to be the gracious hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what ez zee problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You speak English?'' I asked, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course.'' (Read: ``You dope, we all speak English; so
few of you speak French.'')
</P>
<P>
   I proceeded to tell him I was an American journalist on a
European tour interviewing world leaders about NATO expansion and
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah! A journalieeeste!'' he arched his noble eyebrows. ``But
NATO ... zee European Union'' _ shaking his head, the brow
furrowing _ ``Vee will hate zees single currency, zees Euro. Zees
eez bad for France. And why did not your Congress accept the bid
from Romania to join NATO? You take Poland but not Romania! Ah, it
makes me ill!''
</P>
<P>
   We adjourned to the mattress near the bedstand, which was
cluttered with my bottles of vitamins, antacids, melatonin,
chromium piccolate, calcium-magnesium tablets, aspirin and
sugar-free mints.
</P>
<P>
   Now Docteur Mallereau pointed to my robe and grey Hanes
sweatshirt. I took the hint. Over my head went the duds and there I
sat. Unphased, he began to poke and pummel my neck and arms _ as I
breathed deeply, inhaling, exhaling, sticking out my tongue,
coughing, turning, flexing my elbow, dilating my eyeballs _ as
doctors make you do the world over. ``Yes, ahem, oh my ....'' he
mumbled, wielding the cold stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him about my asthma, my chemical sensitivities,
how when the office cleaning lady uses polishes and sprays, I'm
always sure she's testing chemical weapons for a Third World army.
I wanted to tell him that perfume makes my face swell like a plum
and my mother chain-smoked and my brothers and I now can smell a
lit cigarette a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't say any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Madame Journaliste, what do you think of zees Monica
Lewinskee affair? You Americans are so ztrange, you want to
assassinate a good president. You do not want him to be human? Zees
ez very bad for the rest of zee world. Prime Minister Mitterrand
had a daughter and a wife and a mistress and we French were very
sophisticated about zat. But you are so funny about sex. I think we
French are with money as you are with sex!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, er ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus all zees noise about Saddam Hussein and zee weapons of
mass destruction. Zees winter Mees Madeleine Albright coming to
Paris for zee dialogue with Monsieur Vedrine _ no? Zey go to zee
Foreign Ministry with cupids on zee moldings and crystal
chandeliers and French flags. Very beautiful. But eet eez clear
this is but a distraction from zee president's problems!''
</P>
<P>
   I managed to splutter, ``We reelected him knowing he had, er,
fidelity issues. But he was supposed to BEHAVE. Not do it with an
INTERN, for Pete's sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah ... I see. Well, in any case, you have a bad bronchitis and
an influenza and a fever. You must stay in zees bed and watch your
TV,'' he motioned to the screen. Sound mute, it was on CNN
International.
</P>
<P>
   His prescriptions were for two bottles of effervescent aspirin,
a throat spray with a huge nozzle on top, cough syrup (the kind
that's so thick it warms your whole body after one swig) _ and 10
days' worth of 1,000mg packets of a strange orange-granulated brand
of erythromycin that looks like Tang. (You're supposed to mix it
with water and drink the fizz, but I found it tastier to eat dry
with a teaspoon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And so you live in Manhattan?'' he was asking, as I handed
back his emergency-call forms filled in with my vital data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you would know of a cheap apartment available for a
month in zee summer with a view of Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap? Across from Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here eez a business card'' _ he reached in his pocket. ``You
will call me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui! Merci!''

   The hotel chambermaid stood at my door, my size 10 black German
leather sandals in her dainty right hand. I'd left them in the
workout room under the Cybex leg-extension machine _ something I'd
never do in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you! Where would I be without my shoes?'' I gushed,
fishing five francs out of my coat pocket. Giggling, she took the
coin and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That night it was out with friends to their favorite pretty
little bistro. Till the wee hours, we feasted on rillettes de
sardines, Coquille St-Jacques in garlic and scallion sauce,
peppered pear dessert, sparkling wine and espresso _ and oui! _
massive quantities of billowing cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, my raw throat felt like a tractor had rolled
through it on caterpillar treads. My vision was blurred; I was
alternately sweating and freezing. Was I really going to be sick
all day? I glanced out the window. There was a huge poster for a
French opera company showing a sylph whirling in a pink tutu, and
someone had defaced it by spray-painting the giant words coming out
of her mouth: ``Bill Clinton, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for energy, I devoured the contents of my minibar: nuts,
chips, Toblerone, salami, cheese, yogurt (for the live cultures), a
banana. Then I fetched my PruCarePlus HMO Out-of-Network Service
Card. ``... Designated user must call provider immediately in case
of emergency ... if hospitalization or surgery is recommended,
please call 1-800- ...'' Another wave of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily my friends were home by the phone. They told me that in
France there is an ``S.O.S.-doctor'' program for emergencies, ``a
really nice service you can't have in America because the doctors
are too afraid of being sued for malpractice.'' The physicians make
old-fashioned house calls, even to your hotel room, they said.
''Just ask the reception desk. Tell them you need a doctor. They'll
call one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, okay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, Madame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick. I need a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooo ...''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, more torture. I imagined my mother's voice, saw her
forefinger waggling in my face: A strange man coming to my hotel
room? Why, he might be anyone! Maybe he was going to do terrible
things to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mom. Right, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later I heard a knock, unbolted the door and
there, undoubtedly sent from heaven or Central Casting, was Doctor
Emile Mallereau, Medecine Generale: about 6 foot 3, firm square
jaw, wide shoulders, blue-green eyes, high forehead, ruddy skin,
wavy hair _ and yes, even a small black bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you zee patient?'' _ he entered with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, yes ... yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold?'' he winced. (Indeed, I had dialed the thermostat up as
far as possible and heaped three extra plaid blankets on the bed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Im afraid so,'' I said, tugging at my bathrobe. ``Is it
uncomfortable in here?'' _ trying to be the gracious hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what ez zee problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You speak English?'' I asked, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course.'' (Read: ``You dope, we all speak English; so
few of you speak French.'')
</P>
<P>
   I proceeded to tell him I was an American journalist on a
European tour interviewing world leaders about NATO expansion and
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah! A journalieeeste!'' he arched his noble eyebrows. ``But
NATO ... zee European Union'' _ shaking his head, the brow
furrowing _ ``Vee will hate zees single currency, zees Euro. Zees
eez bad for France. And why did not your Congress accept the bid
from Romania to join NATO? You take Poland but not Romania! Ah, it
makes me ill!''
</P>
<P>
   We adjourned to the mattress near the bedstand, which was
cluttered with my bottles of vitamins, antacids, melatonin,
chromium piccolate, calcium-magnesium tablets, aspirin and
sugar-free mints.
</P>
<P>
   Now Docteur Mallereau pointed to my robe and grey Hanes
sweatshirt. I took the hint. Over my head went the duds and there I
sat. Unphased, he began to poke and pummel my neck and arms _ as I
breathed deeply, inhaling, exhaling, sticking out my tongue,
coughing, turning, flexing my elbow, dilating my eyeballs _ as
doctors make you do the world over. ``Yes, ahem, oh my ....'' he
mumbled, wielding the cold stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him about my asthma, my chemical sensitivities,
how when the office cleaning lady uses polishes and sprays, I'm
always sure she's testing chemical weapons for a Third World army.
I wanted to tell him that perfume makes my face swell like a plum
and my mother chain-smoked and my brothers and I now can smell a
lit cigarette a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't say any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Madame Journaliste, what do you think of zees Monica
Lewinskee affair? You Americans are so ztrange, you want to
assassinate a good president. You do not want him to be human? Zees
ez very bad for the rest of zee world. Prime Minister Mitterrand
had a daughter and a wife and a mistress and we French were very
sophisticated about zat. But you are so funny about sex. I think we
French are with money as you are with sex!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, er ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus all zees noise about Saddam Hussein and zee weapons of
mass destruction. Zees winter Mees Madeleine Albright coming to
Paris for zee dialogue with Monsieur Vedrine _ no? Zey go to zee
Foreign Ministry with cupids on zee moldings and crystal
chandeliers and French flags. Very beautiful. But eet eez clear
this is but a distraction from zee president's problems!''
</P>
<P>
   I managed to splutter, ``We reelected him knowing he had, er,
fidelity issues. But he was supposed to BEHAVE. Not do it with an
INTERN, for Pete's sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah ... I see. Well, in any case, you have a bad bronchitis and
an influenza and a fever. You must stay in zees bed and watch your
TV,'' he motioned to the screen. Sound mute, it was on CNN
International.
</P>
<P>
   His prescriptions were for two bottles of effervescent aspirin,
a throat spray with a huge nozzle on top, cough syrup (the kind
that's so thick it warms your whole body after one swig) _ and 10
days' worth of 1,000mg packets of a strange orange-granulated brand
of erythromycin that looks like Tang. (You're supposed to mix it
with water and drink the fizz, but I found it tastier to eat dry
with a teaspoon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And so you live in Manhattan?'' he was asking, as I handed
back his emergency-call forms filled in with my vital data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you would know of a cheap apartment available for a
month in zee summer with a view of Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap? Across from Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here eez a business card'' _ he reached in his pocket. ``You
will call me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui! Merci!''

   The following op-ed-length articles from the July/August '98

   &UR; ARE U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Morihiro Hosokawa &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morihiro Hosokawa was prime minister of Japan from 1992 to
1993. &LR;

   &UR; PREVENTING WAR in the TAIWAN STRAIT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Chas. W. Freeman Jr. &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Taiwan seems convinced it can campaign for
independence with the military backing of the United States. If war
is to be prevented, Washington must convince Taipei as well as
Beijing that it is time for them to work out a mutually acceptable
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chas. W. Freeman, Jr., is co-chair of the United States-China
Policy Foundation. A former diplomat, he served as deputy chief of
mission at Beijing from 1981 to 1984 and assistant secretary of
defense for international security affairs from 1993 to 1994. &LR;

   &UR; PROTECTING THE WORLD'S REFUGEES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Roberta Cohen and Francis M. Deng &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less
acute than the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World
War II. Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roberta Cohen is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.
Francis M. Deng is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and
has served as representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
Internally Displaced Persons since 1992. &LR;

   &UR; WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S STAUNCH SUPPORTERS? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Ehud Sprinzak &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) Benjamin Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great
paradox of Israeli politics today. Despite diplomatic blunders and
derailment of a peace process that is overwhelmingly supported by
Israelis _ nearly 60 percent, according to recent polls _ he
remains popular. Among his strongest supporters are Jews who left
the former USSR, and have painful memories of intense
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ehud Sprinzak, a professor of political science at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, is the author of ``The Ascendance of
Israel's Radical Right.'' &LR;

<P>
   &UR; PALESTINIANS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Khalil Shikaki &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,450 words) As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism,
Yasir Arafat's personal influence and political wiles have let him
dominate and change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure
could. But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Khalil Shikaki is a professor of political science at an-Najah
National University in Nablus and Director of the Center for
Palestine Research and Studies. &LR;

<P>
   &UR; POWER IN A TERRORIZED LAND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Lahouari Addi &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1500 words) Horrifying reports of violence in Algeria are
seldom fleshed out with any firm explanation of motives and
lawbreakers. Many say it is not Islamist rebels, but rather the
army that is the culprit. Of late, Algeria's generals have blocked
an international investigation to uncover the truth about the new
spree of village massacres.

<P>
   &UR; KYOTO'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Henry D. Jacoby, Ronald G. Prinn and Richard Schmalensee &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The Kyoto pact on global warming is neither a
battle won nor a costly burden _ more like a quick political fix
for the vast problems of climate change. Reducing greenhouse-gas
emissions requires including the developing countries who sat out
Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Neil C. Hughes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The symbol of the Chinese Communist Party's
economic policies has been an unbreakable iron rice bowl, standing
for cradle-to-grave social security. But with Beijing unable to
keep its state enterprises _ behemoths that employ about 76 million
workers _ afloat, China is teetering between economic reform and
social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA and the ASIAN CONTAGION &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Nicholas R. Lardy &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (6,000 words) So far China has avoided Southeast Asia's
financial crisis, but it shares many of the underlying weaknesses
that brought on the panic. Although it lacks capital convertibility
that imperiled other countries its weak banking system has issued a
mountain of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICA'S BERLIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Ernest R. May &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>

   &UR; ARE U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Morihiro Hosokawa &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.

   &UR; PREVENTING WAR in the TAIWAN STRAIT &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   (1,400 words) Taiwan seems convinced it can campaign for
independence with the military backing of the United States. If war
is to be prevented, Washington must convince Taipei as well as
Beijing that it is time for them to work out a mutually acceptable
relationship.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less
acute than the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World
War II. Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million.

   &UR; WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S STAUNCH SUPPORTERS? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Ehud Sprinzak &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) Benjamin Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great
paradox of Israeli politics today. Despite diplomatic blunders and
derailment of a peace process that is overwhelmingly supported by
Israelis _ nearly 60 percent, according to recent polls _ he
remains popular. Among his strongest supporters are Jews who left
the former USSR, and have painful memories of intense
anti-Semitism.

   &UR; PALESTINIANS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,450 words) As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism,
Yasir Arafat's personal influence and political wiles have let him
dominate and change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure
could. But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.

   &UR; POWER IN A TERRORIZED LAND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Lahouari Addi &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1500 words) Horrifying reports of violence in Algeria are
seldom fleshed out with any firm explanation of motives and
lawbreakers. Many say it is not Islamist rebels, but rather the
army that is the culprit. Of late, Algeria's generals have blocked
an international investigation to uncover the truth about the new
spree of village massacres.

</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The Kyoto pact on global warming is neither a
battle won nor a costly burden _ more like a quick political fix

emissions requires including the developing countries who sat out
Kyoto.

<P>
   &UR; SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Neil C. Hughes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The symbol of the Chinese Communist Party's
economic policies has been an unbreakable iron rice bowl, standing
for cradle-to-grave social security. But with Beijing unable to
keep its state enterprises _ behemoths that employ about 76 million
workers _ afloat, China is teetering between economic reform and
social unrest.

   (6,000 words) So far China has avoided Southeast Asia's
financial crisis, but it shares many of the underlying weaknesses
that brought on the panic. Although it lacks capital convertibility
that imperiled other countries its weak banking system has issued a
mountain of bad loans.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Africa's mixed record of democratization, including the
emergence of a large number of hybrid regimes committed to
effective governing and real economic development, but not
Western-style democracy, has led some analysts and foreign-policy
makers to question the wisdom of promoting democracy as a core
theme of U.S. Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the focus has been on leaders who have come to power in
Central Africa and the Horn _ in states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea
and Uganda, economic basket cases with a legacy of civil war. The
new commitments may be to sweeping away the failures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about Africa's most progressive new
leaders is that all have embraced economic reform, reestablished
political stability and reduced human-rights abuses, but have
resisted multiparty democracy _ a strategy that has achieved
dramatic results. Those African leaders who are committed to
putting their own houses in order deserve, and in many cases have
received, the support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But Africa's new leaders may also want to assert African control
of the continent's destiny, and thus reject a deferential attitude
toward outsiders and their advice. They may be impatient with
neighboring states that do not share these objectives and whose
regimes threaten their own. They may believe that economic
development must precede democracy and reject the view that
democratization and development are mutually supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the African countries with the highest long-term growth
rates have been Botswana and Mauritius, which also have the longest
records of democratic rule. More recently, positive growth has
returned to Benin, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa, where the
resurgence of democracy has been strongest. Growth is also positive
in Cote d'Ivoire and Malawi, where democratic transitions are still
at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's worst performers during the 1990s _ Kenya, Nigeria and
the former Zaire _ are cases not of failed democratization but
failed authoritarian rule. The clear lesson from Africa is that
economic renewal and democratization go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. policy, the implication of this relationship is that
countries in different stages of democratic transition must be
treated differently. African regimes can be divided into four
categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ First are a handful of states with strong and potentially
enduring commitments to both free-market economies and democratic
governance but that are not yet consolidated democracies. In this
category are Benin, Botswana, Mali, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second are those that have demonstrated a modest to strong
commitment to macroeconomic reform and have embarked on democratic
transitions by holding multiparty elections or have carried out a
significant degree of political liberalization. Included in this
group are Burkino Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique,
Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third are those that have embraced macroeconomic reform but
seek to promote development without democracy. In this group are
Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Niger and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth are those that either resist both economic reform and
democratic rule or are unable to exercise authority across their
territory because of civil war or state collapse. In this group are
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the United States is to maintain a clear and
consistent commitment to its foreign-policy goals while calibrating
them for each category of states. These goals, as articulated
during President Clinton's trip to Africa earlier this year, are
essentially three: economic reform and sustainable development via
Africa's integration into the global economy; improvement on human
rights and progress on democratic transition; and reestablishment
of political stability and effective governing in war-torn states,
particularly in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is particularly difficult vis-a-vis the hybrid
regimes in the second and third categories because of their diverse
mix of policies. Virtually all of these countries are better off
economically and politically than they were at the beginning of the
1990s. Several, including Ethiopia and Uganda, have had dramatic
improvement in their growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   None, however, is a consolidated democracy, and in some,
progress toward building democratic institutions has been painfully
slow. These hybrid regimes are brittle because few have established
strong institutions to sustain their economy or polity.
</P>
<P>
   They will either evolve into more democratic regimes or slip
back into the authoritarian rule that characterized Africa
throughout the 1980s. Such a return to authoritarianism would risk
state collapse and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with the northern third of Uganda fertile ground
for rebellions, President Yoweri Museveni must incorporate the
people of the region into the nation in the same way he reached out
to the Baganda peoples by restoring the kingdom of the country's
largest ethnic group to consolidate his regime in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In Ethiopia, President Meles Zenawi must likewise craft
appropriate mechanisms to bring the alienated Amhara and Oromo, the
country's two largest ethnic groups, back into the political
process if long-term stability is to reign.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, prospects for stability turn on whether Paul Kagame's
Tutsi-based minority regime can deal with the Hutu majority
politically rather than militarily. After the genocide, the rural
areas are now nearly 95 percent Hutu, which makes successful
counterinsurgency operations almost impossible without an effective
political component.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that in none of these cases is long-term
stability or prosperity likely without a more liberal and inclusive
politics, in which diverse interests bargain for, share and
possibly alternate power with each other. Democratization, in
short, is in the self-interest of those in power.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the United States should continue to
urge democratization for the good of such nations and leaders, or
whether it should ease up in order to maintain harmonious
short-term bilateral relations. While broadly cooperating with some
regimes, the United States should still maintain a dialogue about
the need to deepen the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   The issues to be addressed might include strengthening the rule
of law, increasing government transparency and accountability,
making decentralization meaningful, developing an independent media
and civil society, and ensuring genuine electoral competition no
matter what the political framework.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. efforts to promote democracy abroad argue that
U.S. national interest is not served when foreign-policy objectives
are defined in moralistic terms rather than on the basis of
concrete interests. Yet in the post-Cold War world, the main U.S.
interest in Africa is the peaceful development of African states so
that they are no longer islands of instability and poverty that
require U.S. assistance or intervention, but partners in trade and
full members of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving these goals depends on the continued promotion of
democracy as a core element in U.S. Africa policy.

<P>
   Africa's mixed record of democratization, including the
emergence of a large number of hybrid regimes committed to
effective governing and real economic development, but not
Western-style democracy, has led some analysts and foreign-policy
makers to question the wisdom of promoting democracy as a core
theme of U.S. Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the focus has been on leaders who have come to power in
Central Africa and the Horn _ in states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea
and Uganda, economic basket cases with a legacy of civil war. The
new commitments may be to sweeping away the failures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about Africa's most progressive new
leaders is that all have embraced economic reform, reestablished
political stability and reduced human-rights abuses, but have
resisted multiparty democracy _ a strategy that has achieved
dramatic results. Those African leaders who are committed to
putting their own houses in order deserve, and in many cases have
received, the support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But Africa's new leaders may also want to assert African control
of the continent's destiny, and thus reject a deferential attitude
toward outsiders and their advice. They may be impatient with
neighboring states that do not share these objectives and whose
regimes threaten their own. They may believe that economic

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

<P>
   Women in Latin America know they are alone when it comes to
protecting themselves against sexual crimes. But in few countries
are they as defenseless as in Mexico, where the police who are paid
to protect them often become the source of their terror.
</P>
<P>
   An entire battalion of the Mexican police _ 24 in all _ is being
accused of sexually abusing and raping three teen-age girls. Nine
of them have already been identified by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ age 13, 15 and 18 _ were walking down the streets of
Xochimilco, a suburb of southern Mexico City, at 10 o'clock on July
19, a tranquil Sunday night. A police van stopped. The girls got
in. It is unclear whether the policemen stopped to ask the girls
for directions and then forced them in or if the girls needed
directions and got into the vehicle voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once in the van, the three girls were driven to a
place that can only be described as hell _ a horse stable, property
of the police force. There, for four nights, they were forced to do
as they were told. They were humiliated by the many men in uniform
who dropped by and demanded to be served _ to be waited on and
cooked for. The girls were tortured and sexually molested. The
youngest two were raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are free _ and fortunate to be alive _ because the
18-year-old was able to escape and luckily found the rare policeman
who would listen to her and take action rather than join the tragic
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as pitiful and horrific as it is, is not surprising.
It stands as an indictment of the state of the police force in
Mexico, as well as a reminder of the fear women in Latin America
must live with every day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that an average of 82 rapes are committed
in Mexico City daily. Few are reported. Mexican women, like other
women in Latin America, know they are on their own when it comes to
sexual crimes. The justice systems see rape with the same eyes and
the same attitudes that characterize most Latin men: husbands who
believe that demanding sex is a conjugal right or judges who first
will decide if the victim of rape is an ``honest'' woman or an
``indecent'' one before reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian judge is reported to have asked a victim: ``Are you a
virgin? And if you are not, why do you complain?'' With attitudes
like this, it is not surprising that women prefer to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, those who file complaints face the sad fact that a
mere 15 percent of reported cases will be investigated. This is
hardly the first time Mexico City's police force has been accused
of rape. In 1990, five policemen were arrested for engaging in wild
rampages in which they raped 19 young women.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1991, El Financiero, one of the city's main
newspapers, reported on a woman who had been raped by policemen _
on three separate occasions. When Cristina Rivera Vargas testified
in a rental dispute against her landlady in court, she was
threatened: If she didn't retract her testimony, she would ``regret
it.'' Two days later, as she walked outside, an unidentified group
of men suggested that she do what her landlady had told her or
else, plain and simple, they would kill her. Less than two weeks
later, Rivera was forced inside a car, raped and left on the side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely she filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, she identified one of her rapists: a
police officer. She was confident that justice would be served when
prosecutors attending her case assured her ``everything was going
well.'' A month later, Rivera was again abducted, taken to a house
complete with electric-shock torture devices and beaten
unconscious. She woke up next to a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera went back to the police, this time to drop the charges.
But the policemen continued to harass her, demanding extortion
money. They set a deadline for her to deliver the amount of cash
they wanted. She didn't. Three months later she was snatched again
from home. A young man found her, at five in the morning _
staggering by the train tracks, her hands tied, her mouth taped _
and took her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's case probably followed the same fate as most of
Mexico's rape complaints _ of those 15 percent that are
investigated, only 15 percent ever make it to a verdict. Rape is
not a serious felony _ not in Mexico and not in the rest of the
region. Until recently, most Latin American constitutions saw rape
as a crime against the state, not a crime committed against the
body and soul of one woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Latin woman does not only have to fear being raped by her
husband or by a policeman. She might very well find herself walking
down the aisle, marrying her own rapist. Fourteen Latin American
countries _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
the Dominican Republic and Venezuela _ will acquit a rapist who
offers to marry the victim. In Costa Rica, the law is so extreme
that she doesn't even need to accept _ just the offer is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first opposition-party leader of
Mexico City in 70 years _ who is widely regarded as a presidential
frontrunner in 2000 _ has an opportunity to change the system, to
end the immunity with which rape is treated by Latin America's
justice systems. Indeed the director of the investigation has
announced she will ask for the maximum sentence of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that this case does not join the 85 percent of those
that never come to trial and that, if it is tried, it will not be
by men who put the onus on the victims. Or by men who think like
the Peruvian military general in ``Untold Terror: Violence Against
Women,'' a December '92 Human Rights Watch report, who said that
rape is an occasional regrettable ``excess'' committed by his
troops. ``Boys,'' he said, are far from their families and suffer a
great deal of tension because of the nature of combat. They get
their aggression out by raping women.''
</P>
<P>
   With protectors like this, where can a woman in Latin America
start feeling safe?

   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the

was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.
 &HT;    Advocates of direct democracy, such as Robert Wiebe, the
political historian and theorist, oppose ``government by experts,''
and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington ``know-it-alls'' who
could not pass his ``Elroy test'' (what his little hometown knows
is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on
experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning.
 &HT;    One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare ``the
new paternalism,'' frankly telling people what is good for them.
Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude,
despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
 &HT;    I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some
constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has
some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. (``Don't be a wimp.'')
With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that both his parents were teachers and his
wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as
``street talk'' in rural Wisconsin _ ``setting'' for sitting,
``oncommon'' for uncommon, ``secatary'' for secretary.
 &HT;    He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: ``I'm the
only one still talking devolution.'' The Republican Congress is
``as bad as the president.'' He feels that he has the spirit of
Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive _ except that
La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of
big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's
projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his
encirclement by foes.
 &HT;    To get a ``top down'' view of the states' new activism, I
interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a
Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the
policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when
aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the
states'-rights activism a healthy development.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Clinton does not see the states shoving the
federal government off the scene so much as interacting with it in
new ways. But Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state
initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed
mandates.
 &HT;    ``I don't agree with a lot of those votes,'' he said, ``but I
think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as
they don't contravene a federal statute or the Constitution.
Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are
designed to address. Either representative government is going to
have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is
on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the
progressive populists are going to have to put their own
counterproposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this
movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say
on public issues.''
 &HT;    We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the governor and
the president, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail
on the future of states' rights. The president is well disposed
toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy.
Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude
on his master strategy.
 &HT;    Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in
turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think
he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The
president himself considered the Republican bill he signed too
sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring
food stamps and child-care provisions.
 &HT;    I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in
their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when
economic reverses come.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for
children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of
reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
 &HT;    ``Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule
for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in
Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states
had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms,
considerably lower, than they had been in the early '70s, because
they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I
came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states
anyway. Now the states are responsible.
 &HT;    ``In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the
welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a
work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility
around. They could say that 'in our state the federal government
has all these rules _ and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the
county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with
the states will be more positive than negative.''
 &HT;    It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the
president. ``President Clinton has done everything he possibly can
to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin.''
 &HT;    He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human
Services. ``I could get matching grants'' for new programs,
Thompson complains _ but the government will not turn over the
money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help
from the federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states
have to observe federal conditions if they accept federal money.
 &HT;    So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the
governor has kept on top of things. When I suggest that federal
oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other
states, he is dismissive.
 &HT;    ``They're always saying that, that the states were going to be
having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may
have happened in the '40s and '50s. But right now you've got
governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that
they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a
governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very
competitive.'''
 &HT;    But the states are vulnerable to national forces too. Clinton
ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic
and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel
softening of the division between state and national life, not just
in government but in every sphere.
 &HT;    This does not mean that states are not better at handling some
things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national
scale.
 &HT;    There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction,
dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment
fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the
Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for ``good old
days'' that were not all that good.

 THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES ... and WASHINGTON

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,

TRAINER, 45, AND LONGTIME JOCKEY JOIN RACING HALL OF FAME

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A trainer who was accepted earlier than
any other and a jockey who rode for parts of five decades have been
inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, the youngest trainer ever inducted, and jockey
Jacinto Vasquez were joined at the awards ceremony Monday by
pioneer trainer Ansel Williamson and horses Riva Ridge, Bayakoa and
Fort Marcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never planned, of course never expected,'' said Mott,
who became a household name while guiding the great Cigar to 16
consecutive victories in 1995 and '96. ``I'm very honored and
humbled to be inducted into a club like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott, who just turned 45, is three months younger than Allen
Jerkens was when he was inducted in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Born in South Dakota, Mott began training horses with other
family members as a teen-ager. (That's why he was eligible for
induction; a trainer must be licensed for at least 25 years to be
considered).
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, he went to work for fellow Hall of Famer
Jack Van Berg, who made the trip to Saratoga Springs to present
Mott with his plaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have missed it if I had to walk here from
California,'' Van Berg said. ``If you raised a child, you wanted
him to grow up to be like Bill Mott.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Mott's first year of eligibility, and his selection was
popular with the crowd gathered for the ceremony. With Cigar alone,
he won 15 stakes for owner Allen Paulson, including the Dubai World
Cup and the Breeders' Cup Classic. Cigar retired with nearly $10
million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mott trainees: Theatrical, Paradise Creek, Fraise, Ajina,
Geri, Wekiva Springs, Gaily Gaily, Heatherten and Lassigny.
Entering this season, Mott had amassed 2,330 wins and more than $80
million in earnings. Cigar (twice), Ajina, Paradise Creek and
Theatrical all were Eclipse winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that are responsible for me being
here,'' Mott said, ``and, of course, it would take a day and a half
to begin to name everybody that's been a part _ mainly Jack Van
Berg, he was a big part of it. He gave me an opportunity to train.
He put some horses in my name and I got some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott has won several New York Racing Association meet titles and
was the leading trainer at Saratoga for the past four years,
including a tie in 1997. He also has done well in Kentucky, and
holds the Churchill Downs record for most winners in a meeting, 54
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, the leading apprentice in his native Panama, rode from
1959 to 1996 and won the Kentucky Derby aboard Foolish Pleasure and
the filly Genuine Risk. He also was the rider of the ill-fated
superstar Ruffian, and twice rode horses who defeated the great
Secretariat (Angle Light and Onion).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor,'' said Vasquez, whose career was stained
by his implication in a race-fixing controversy at Saratoga, an
issue that likely delayed his induction. ``It's the ultimate in
racing, but without all those great horses, you don't have an
opportunity to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez rode more than 5,000 winners, including 268 stakes
victories over the last 20 years of his career. Other well-known
horses ridden by Vasquez included Princess Rooney, Manila, Risen
Star, Forego and What A Summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel Williamson, born a slave but later freed, was a Civil
War-era trainer. He trained horses for such renowned stables as
Woodburn Stud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, six years before his death, Williamson trained
Aristides and won the first Kentucky Derby. National Museum of
Racing and Hall of Fame historian Tom Gilcoyne, who uncovered much
of Williamson's background, accepted the plaque for him.
</P>
<P>
   Riva Ridge was a champion at ages 2 and 4 for Meadow Stable,
which simultaneously had Secretariat in training. Riva Ridge
compiled a lifetime mark of 30-17-3-1 for earnings of $1.1 million
from 1971-73. He ran second to Secretariat in the first Marlboro
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bayakoa came from South America and won the Eclipse for older
females two years in a row (1989-90). Her overall record showed 21
wins from 39 starts, but her record in the states was 18-for-31 for
trainer Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Marcy was a three-time national grass champion for trainer
Elliott Burch and Paul Mellon's Rokeby Stable with 21 career wins
from 75 starts, 18 seconds and 14 thirds for earnings of $1.1
million.

WAR ON GRAFT PAYS, MEXICO CITY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Imagine a local government that increases revenues
in one year by 216 percent. Then try to imagine a place where a
once-stagnant bureaucracy suddenly begins firing crooked building
inspectors, providing curbside services to small businesses, and
opening licenses for public review.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City may not be the first place that comes to mind. But
in the heart of this sprawling metropolis, better known for its
rogue police officers and bribe-loving officials, the street-level
fight against corruption is producing a surprising budget windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an institutionalized corruption network that
extended into the government and it's our responsibility to clean
it out,'' said Jorge Legorreta, head of the Cuauhtemoc Delegation,
an area of about 600,000 residents and one of 16 Mexico City
boroughs. ``The result so far has been a more honest government and
more money for other services.''
</P>
<P>
   Money collected in the district for building permits and
licenses since January has increased to more than $700,000 versus
$326,000 for the same period last year. But perhaps more important
than the revenues is the perception among many constituents that
the old ways are changing.
</P>
<P>
   The district that Legorreta oversees is best known for the
historical treasures that it holds. The borough includes the city's
historic district, the colonial-era government square known as the
Zocalo, the fine arts palace, and scores of museums and businesses.
But like other areas of this city once under the control of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the district was also fertile
ground for government payoffs and kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year voters elected an opposition party mayor, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, who then appointed a new cadre of borough chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Legorreta, 50, an architect and sociologist, was a college
professor who had never worked in government before this year. But
he and his deputies immediately began a campaign to clean up the
borough, mostly by tackling corruption for government licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Several building inspectors suspected of taking bribes or
failing to report fees to the government treasury were fired. Other
workers were sent to training programs for refresher courses on
government service.
</P>
<P>
   Legorreta also changed the rules to require builders to apply
directly at the borough office, implemented a new public review
process, and last month began a new mobile service for area
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Diaz Hernandez, president of a group of local bar and
nightclub owners, said in an interview this year with a Mexico City
newspaper that many of his members have used the money they've
saved from bribes to pay taxes and other old debts, and to remodel
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Experts assert _ and Legorreta agrees _ that there is more
pressure today than before on Mexico City officials to show
progress in reforming government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have an elected mayor before so there wasn't much at
stake for bureaucrats or other officials,'' said Felix Velez, a
public policy professor at the Autonomous Technical Institute of
Mexico. ``But now there is more incentive to be honest and more
reason for an opposition party to capitalize on corruption left
over from another administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Legorreta said one remaining problem is that many city laws on
licensing and enforcement are outdated. For example, he said, there
are no laws that restrict adult entertainment to certain
neighborhoods, and there is little enforcement of regulations
against prostitution and littering.
</P>
<P>
   These laws would have to be amended either by the city's
legislature or by the federal congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an imbalance between the laws and the reality today,
and I believe that has contributed to much of the corruption that
we find today,'' Legorreta added in an interview last week in his
downtown office, which is dominated by three images _ a bust of the
Indian Cuauhtemoc, a photo of Mayor Cuauhtemoc, and a picture of
the Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in corruption, he said, is the low pay of
government workers. A building inspector makes about $204 a month
and a borough lawyer makes $170.
</P>
<P>
   The city and boroughs still have their share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other districts has yet shown the kind of success
Legorreta has had in combating corruption. Legorreta's district
continues to have problems with unlicensed street vendors who clog
streets and sidewalks. And Cardenas, the mayor, has floundered
recently in local polls over his attempts to control crime and
improve city services.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to dealing with the borough government, some
in the Cuauhtemoc district sound a little more hopeful that things
are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when paying the (government) officer was a regular
event. It was part of our business schedule,'' said Carlos Gurria
Mendez, a gift shop manager. ``Now, when we see somebody from the
borough stop by, it's to give us new information, not to take more
money.''

CATHOLIC AUTHOR WARNS OF THE DANGERS OF RELIGIOUS RELATIVISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago Pope Paul VI's encyclical condemning artificial
birth control sent shock waves through the Roman Catholic world.
</P>
<P>
   Humanae Vitae dashed the hopes of many Catholics who believed
church fathers might be willing to amend religious teachings on
certain thorny contemporary issues. Instead, the pope stood firm.
The repercussions of Paul's encyclical still reverberate.
Fundamentally, Humanae Vitae made the question of authority the
root of all tensions in Roman Catholicism today.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, author Roger LeBlanc argues that the spread of
dissent throughout the church on issues ranging from the role of
women to human sexuality is eroding papal authority and endangering
the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc, who holds a pontifical certificate to teach Catholic
catechism, believes the single biggest threat to the papacy is the
rise of religious relativism _ the rejection that there is one true
set of beliefs that emanate from the Holy See, whose authority can
be traced directly to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious relativism is a denial that there is one true faith
that is valid, the same for all people at all times and places,''
LeBlanc writes in ``Relativism As Religion: Tracing its Historical
Roots to the Modern Day Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in fact the very cause of religious division in the
world,'' he writes. ``In His eternal wisdom, Christ left something
among us by which we can say: `This is indeed the true faith.' He
left us a guide, a true rule of faith. It is the papacy, the
companion of sound reason.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc's book is sure to raise the hackles of non-Roman
Catholic Christians who bristle at any suggestion that the Vatican
possesses the sole copyright on how to be a proper Christian. After
all, it was fierce disagreements over the role of the pope that led
to the many schisms in Christianity over the centuries. And it is
questions over the papacy that present some of the biggest
stumbling blocks to Christian unity.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under a statue of the Virgin Mary in the living room of
his mother's Natick, Mass. home, LeBlanc said he doesn't want to
antagonize other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is not a call to arms,'' he said. ``I'm not raising
the swords. I would simply ask people to look at the question of
what gave birth to thousands of Christian denominations. And look
at the reason for the Catholic Church's claim to absolute truth and
the pope's claim to absolute authority. These are things that need
to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc said a main motivation behind the book is to lay down a
challenge to all Catholics to examine what it is that makes them
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite various polls suggesting that most American Catholics
oppose the Vatican on numerous controversial topics ranging from
homosexuality to a married clergy, Le-Blanc said there is a growing
cadre of younger Catholics whose views are more in line with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a Catholic, but you if you are going to
call yourself one at least accept what that means,'' LeBlanc says.
``If you look at the story of Adam and Eve, you realize that
religious relativism is what caused man to lose grace with God. How
do people expect to embrace religious relativism and still find
their way to God? And Christ gave back to man what he lost in Eden
by giving him the papacy.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc's book comes at a crucial moment for the church. Vatican
officials say Pope John Paul II is expected to release a major
encyclical attacking relativism in the fall. Angered by what he
sees as unjustified assaults on church teaching and authority, John
Paul has issued edicts that attempt to dampen dissent and increase
the power of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Recent pronouncements have been aimed at curbing theologians who
challenge church dogma, and limiting the role of lay people in
local churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the pope is afraid of losing his authority,''
LeBlanc says. ``He's trying to defend the faith. If you don't have
ultimate authority rest in the papacy, you reduce religion to
something of man's own invention _ and then there is no more reason
to discuss matters of faith because it's all purely subjective.''

   _In its first comments on the investigation involving President
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the official newspaper of the
Archdiocese of Boston says the president's private actions are a
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial in this week's Pilot takes issue with observations
by some political pundits that many Americans believe whatever may
have occurred between Clinton and Lewinsky is a private matter
between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without speaking from an Olympian perch of self-righteousness
... such talk is moral nonsense,'' the Pilot argues. ``Marriage
vows are public vows. And to those who are quick to call sexual
misconduct something `private' _ tell that with a straight face to
Chelsea Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   _Apparently seeking to increase its involvement in the highly
charged debate over homosexuality, a prominent conservative
Christian organization has hired two people who say they are former
practicing homosexuals to work on public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on the Family has hired Amy Tracy, former press secretary
for the National Organization for Women, and John Faulk, a former
male prostitute, to be active players in the organization's
campaign to combat gay activism.
</P>
<P>
   _Providing evidence of some softening in relations between the
United States and Cuba, the National Council of Churches has sent
its first direct relief flight to Cuba in two years. The flight
contained $143,200 in medical and other supplies bound for two
medical clinics in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   After Pope John Paul II's historic trip to Cuba in January,
President Clinton bowed to intense pressure and lifted restrictions
on direct humanitarian flights between the United States and the
Caribbean island nation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   _The Salvation Army, in a campaign to emphasize the
organization's religious foundation, has announced plans to begin
publishing a semi-annual academic journal this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of ``Word and Deed: A Journal of the Salvation
Army and Ministry'' will include articles by Salvationist
theologians on such topics as ``Biblical Foundations for the
Doctrine of Holiness'' and ``Wesleyanism and Holiness Teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal is intended to link the the Army's many social
ministries to its theological roots, according to Jeff McDonald,
managing editor of the War Cry, the Salvation Army's official
national magazine.

if Bruce Willis is going to swoop down on Sahalee in a summertime
sequel from Seattle. For our area, this golf tournament packs
significance because we have not had a PGA stop since 1966, let
alone one regarded as a ``major.'' But in a broader perspective, it
is not that big. The Masters is Michael Jordan. The PGA
Championship is John Starks. It is not the Masters, U.S. Open or
British Open, of course, yet every year the PGA gets an invitation

<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ The video experience at the Pequot Museum
is the creation of Tom Nicholson New York, a Manhattan company that
usually specializes in hot Web pages for cool corporations. Unlike
most museum interactive videos, the product at the Pequot museum is
not the museum curator's ideas translated by cyber-nerds. Nicholson
came up with the concepts, did the ethno-graphic work, recorded and
taped interviews with Native Americans and anthropologists, and put
the package on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Van Tuyl, a California native and a UC-Berkeley graduate
with a degree in American history, was working on Web sites at
Nicholson when the Pequot project started. Along with as many as 30
associates working full-time for more than two years, Van Tuyl
created two classes of video experiences. The first kind is
basically a filling-out and filling-in of two dioramas, the forest
scene and the caribou hunt. By navigating on a touch screen,
visitors can do everything from get close-ups of objects in the
diorama to interviews with the archeologists who authenticated the
substance of the displays. It is a very unusual museum experience.
You can take the display for what it is and ask for more detail, or
you can question the authenticity of what you are looking at and
hear real archeologists talk about the art and science and
imagination that goes into re-creating an extinct culture.
</P>
<P>
   The film clips in the videos are unusually high-quality for an
educational program. The speed and definition is achieved by
hard-wiring each video station to its own central processing unit:
39 stations, 39 cpus. ``Actually,'' Van Tuyl remarked, ``we
developed it all on Macintoshes, but the Pequots use IBM for all
their computing, so we had to convert it. The most expensive thing
we had to buy weren't the processors, it was the video cards,
they're $5,000 a shot, to get the quality and speed we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most creative, and if it's the right word, some of
the sweetest, material is entirely created by Van Tuyl and the
Nicholson team. Off in one corner of a small side room, far from
the complex and enormous dioramas, two video stations concentrate
on Native American languages. Van Tuyl found five native speakers
of languages related to the Pequot tongue, and has them each tell a
story _ a legend _ in their language. The audio is accompanied by
written text in the native language and a translation to English.
The effect is mesmerising. The native languages are musical,
complex, and have sounds totally unfamiliar to the English-hearing
ear. But with the translation scrolling along, you get the illusion
of sitting at an elder's knee, hearing, for example, how the world
was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one of the storytellers,'' Van Tuyl recalled, ``who
was getting upset with me for making him cut his story down by a
few seconds, something like from two minutes, 40 seconds to a
minute, 20. So I said to him, ``Now, if you wanted to tell the
story the long way, how long would it take?' And he waited a while,
and then he said: `Two or three days.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the stories are told (each is accompanied by stylized
graphics that resemble, but do not try to copy, the primitivism of
Cheyenne Ledger Books or paintings on hide), the viewer gets a
screen that invites looking up words in the several languages used
by the storytellers. You can ask for animals, get a screen of
perhaps two dozen birds, fish and beasts, and then choose to hear
them in the various languages. It is amusing, it is charming, it is
poignant stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tuyl's favorites are the onomatopoeic ones _ the Micmac word
for ``turkey'' is a short gobble, for ``owl,'' the first part of a
great horned owl's call. This is so familiar to the English ear
(after all, we call turkeys ``gobblers'' and have birds that say
their name, chickadee being the most common) that just for a
moment, viewers have some sense that they have crossed over the
barrier between their culture and the Native American society and
language represented in the program. After all, once you've heard a
Micmac say ``turkey,'' you will never be satisfied with an
unaccented, unrhythmical, boring English pronunciation of
``gobbler.'' Language can seem the most difficult aspect of a
foreign culture. Perhaps it is, but just to overcome that problem
for a moment gives a whole new sensation to a goal like ``getting
to know'' a Native American.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. If you were wondering how the creation story ends, Muskrat
makes the world. When he goes down to get the bit of mud at the
bottom of the sea of all creation and brings it up and makes it
grow so that everyone can have a dry place to live, and when he
does this after Loon and Beaver and Otter have failed, you almost
want to cheer for Muskrat, who made no boasts, gave no promises,
but just went down and got the beginning of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different kind of educational television. It's
emotionally rich educational television, a rare commodity.

   So what's it going to be, sports fans? The Patriots open at
Denver on Monday night, Sept. 7, while the Red Sox will be in the
third inning against the Yankees at Fenway. Which game are you
going to watch on television?
</P>
<P>
   Pigskins or hardballs? Route 1 or Kenmore Square? Ubiquitous Bob
Kraft or invisible John Harrington? Gil Santos or Joe Castiglione?
Players who love the Foxy Lady or players who love the Foxy Lady?
</P>
<P>
   What are we? That is the question. Are we a traditional,
peanuts-and-crackerjack baseball town? Or are we a trendy, yahoo
football nation? Are we the direct descendants of Nuf Ced
McGreevey's Royal Rooters, forever devoted to the Red Sox? Or are
we latecomer disciples of Mel Kiper Jr., Jerry Glanville, and John
Madden?
</P>
<P>
   There was a preliminary test Sunday night and there'll be plenty
more in the exciting two months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to use television ratings as a barometer of fan
interest, then football has taken over the New England region. The
Patriots drew a 12.3 rating for an exhibition game against the
Minnesota Vikings that started at 7:30 Sunday night. The Red Sox,
starting a half-hour later, drew a 7.7 for their final game of a
12-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   These comparisons are difficult and unfair. The Pats play only
one game per week, so they would be expected to attract more
viewers than the local baseball team. But it's hard to explain more
fans for exhibition football than for a red-hot baseball team,
bound for the playoffs. New Englanders actually chose to watch a
28-0 preseason blowout defeat instead of a two-Mo-homer Sox victory
over the Rangers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary stuff for those who hold baseball sacred.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a bye week on Sunday, Sept. 27, so there will
be no choice when the Red Sox end their regular season against the
Baltimore Orioles _ a game that could determine a playoff spot if
the Sox lose their wild card lead between now and late September.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Sox go to the playoffs? Suppose Sunday,
Oct. 4, features the Sox and Cleveland Indians in a fifth and final
game to decide who'll play the Yankees in the ALCS? Put that game
up against the Patriots at New Orleans and what have you got?
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Pats play at home against the Kansas City
Chiefs and it could fall in the middle of an Armageddon seven-game
series between the Red Sox and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any other split-screen choices for New England
sports fans. If the Sox make it to the World Series, none of the
games would go head-to-head with the Patriots. New England's first
mega-game with the New York Jets comes on a Monday night, Oct. 19,
between Games 2 and 3 of the World Series. The seventh game of the
1998 World Series would be played Sunday night, Oct. 25, several
hours after the Patriots have jousted with the Dolphins in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that we've had to debate this issue, because both
teams have not often been good at the same time. The Sox have been
to the playoffs only once since the recent Patriots resurrection
and that came in 1995 when the Patriots were staggering to a 6-10
finish.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Red Sox look to be playoff-bound and the Patriots
are supposed to have the best talent in the AFC East. The Pats have
owned the town for the last couple of autumns, but if the Red Sox
make a playoff push, which team interests more fans?
</P>
<P>
   I will go to the grave insisting that a Red Sox World Series win
would mean more to the region than a Patriot victory in the Super
Bowl. Of course, given the Sox' history, we'll never find out
whether this is true or not.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that while football fans are more loud and visible _
driving sports-talk radio with moronic mumbling _ baseball still
grips the region more tightly any time the Red Sox contend. This
may not show up in television ratings, but the hardball game simply
crosses more demographic barriers.
</P>
<P>
   It is my experience that more women, children, and old people
are devoted to the Red Sox. Patriot Nation is, for the most part,
populated by stout-hearted men between the ages of 15-55. These are
the guys who control the clicker, buy the beer, and bet on the
games. And, God love 'em, they are the ones who watched every
second of Sunday night's 28-0 exhibition loss to the Vikings while
the Red Sox were busy winning the West.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dreams, big dreams, roll down the highway in a long
white limo.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the four suburban ``chick rockers'' from Bad Kitty all
talk at once. Their eyebrows are tweezed to whispers, their lips
outlined in mocha, their nails painted blue and their 16-year-old
bodies dabbed with Bijon perfume and packed into clingy little
strap tops and tight pants.
</P>
<P>
   As the limo rolls, their words tangle over the rumble of the
road, four voices locked in one yearning thought, interrupted only
by the snap of bubble gum:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're headed for the top . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the top . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, really want to make it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, our dream . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's all we want in in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Matthew Lyons, sitting a mile away at the steering wheel
of the limo, smiles at his proteges in the rearview mirror. The
babble of these ``boy magnets'' is mana to his ears. These girls
believe, man.
</P>
<P>
   And they are, like, on the verge. Totally.
</P>
<P>
   Their eight-song CD, ``Scratch,'' recorded at the same Robert
Lang Studios in Richmond Beach, north of Seattle, where Nirvana cut
its last unreleased songs, is set for release next month. They've
done their slam-glam shtick on local TV, where ``Northwest
Afternoon'' host Kent Phillips hyped the underage, overamped
quartet as ``an all-girl band from Richmond Beach about to take
Seattle by storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, they've landed their first big-city, big-time
gig at Seattle Hempfest '98 later this month. Crowds could be major
_ like, 50,000 _ and the girls are wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Hempfest is huge for these girls. Huge!'' says Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   These little kitties have come a long way, baby.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Shana Weber (guitar), twin sister Sarina
(drums), Katherine Karlsen (bass) and Kellie Rinkler (lead singer)
were playing three-note songs in a Richmond Beach basement, with
visions of femme rockers L-7 and Seven Year Bitch dancing in their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The girls went by the name Vertigo. As in dizzy. As in what
happens when you're standing atop 6-inch platform sandals, feet
bedecked in toe rings, midriffs bared, belting out angst-ridden
lyrics and driving hormonally imbalanced teenage boys temporarily
insane.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie, a feline bottle-blonde with a smokey grrrrll voice full
of electric juice, hit up concert promoter Lyons at an Applebee's
restaurant, asking him to come hear them play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was kidding. I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah,''
says the thirtysomething manager, who looks like a misplaced
California surfer in faded jeans, tie-dyed T-shirts and long, limp,
blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he tripped down for a basement session. The room, he
says, ``smelled sweaty _ like a girl's locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Willowy, dark-haired Sarina was pounding away on a drum set held
together by a bobby pin and bubble gum. ``That bobby pin, it really
got to me,'' Lyons says.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' amps were no bigger than school lunch boxes. Chord
progressions were, like, majorly minimal. But the music was
original.
</P>
<P>
   And it was loud, really loud. The girls could rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard them play, it was, like, whoa,'' says
Lyons. ``I really, really dug these girls.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed on as manager in October, raising funds for new
equipment, pouring dough into studio time, and buying the Lincoln
Town Car to escort them from classes at Scriber Lake High School in
Lynnwood, north of Seattle, to practice and recording sessions.
</P>
<P>
   At Scriber Lake _ a non-traditional public ``school of choice''
_ reaction to the glam rockers in the long white limo was mixed.
``Some kids at school were like, `You think you're the sh--,'''
says Shana.
</P>
<P>
   Dating prospects, however, improved markedly. ``Some of the
guys, like, kinda tagged along and bugged us,'' says Katherine.
``We weren't really mean to them, you know. It's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball was rolling. All the girls needed were a few gigs, tons
of practice and a new name.
</P>
<P>
   The name _ and the provocative image created with high-style
makeup and low-riding hip-huggers _ evolved from a sidelong party
comment by one of Lyons' buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend took one look at the girls and said to me: `Them are
some baaaaad kittens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bad Kitties have a definite edge to them. ``A serious
handful,'' one mother says.
</P>
<P>
   In full war paint, wearing filmy see-through shirts that reveal
a tattoo here, a tender bit of cleavage there, the 16-year-old Bad
Kitties could be 20-year-old Bad Cats. They have the 'tude to match
the talent.
</P>
<P>
   When they played at the Apple Blossom Festival in Wenatchee
earlier this summer, someone shouted, ``Are you the Spice Girls?''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) no!'' one of the girls yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   They order clothes from Frederick's of Hollywood, and they brag
that when producers on ``Northwest Afternoon'' asked them to button
up their shirts, they ``only pretended'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But as determinedly uptown as the girls may be, their fangs,
claws and purring poses can dissolve in an instant. All it takes is
one giggle, one tickle, one goofy tease, and all four _ sugared up
from Cherry Cokes _ tumble into a heap of silly, playful kids
wrestling on the floor crying uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the girls _ Katherine and the fraternal twins _ have
been friends since junior high. Kellie joined later. The ties are
strong, as only 16-year-olds' ties can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not like just four people together jamming to make
songs. They're a unit with a bond and a vision,'' says Chip Butler,
the engineer at Robert Lang Studios who helped the girls master
their CD.
</P>
<P>
   The kitties have even taken blood vows, carving small crosses in
one another's backs to seal their friendship for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're, like, 24-7,'' says Katherine.
</P>
<P>
   That's 24 hours, seven days a week. The girls hit the beach
together, party together, talk on the phone together, go to school
together, where all are above-average students, according to
Scriber Lake principal Karol Gadwa.
</P>
<P>
   `The girls are very creative,'' she says. ``The school is pretty
excited to have this group here.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the kitties practice together. Hour after hour. Night
after night. They say they're so busy practicing or recording they
don't have time to get in trouble. Some studio sessions have kept
them going from noon till 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They spend so much time together, they talk in one long
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get in little cat fights . . .,'' begins one.
</P>
<P>
   The others pick up on the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, like married couples . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all, like, married . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't stay mad for more than a day . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid stuff . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stupidest you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   All are self-taught on their instruments. Katherine had eight
years of piano before picking up a bass guitar. Shana, who writes
most of the lyrics, and Sarina, four minutes older than her sister,
studied violin for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie _ called the ``loose cannon'' and the ``wild kitty'' for
such onstage antics as belly-baring and stage-diving _ got her
start in church choirs. ``I've, like, been singing all my life,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their sound is raw, aggressive, built on minor chords that moan
like a cat in heat, all cranked to maximum volume. Intensity
strains their faces as they play, and the simple words bleed
adolescent love and longing:
</P>
<P>
   Everything we had
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would never go bad.
</P>
<P>
   Oh you make me think for a while.
</P>
<P>
   It . . . makes me think . . . for . . . for a while,
</P>
<P>
   And you know all those memories
</P>
<P>
   And it's you I never could please.
</P>
<P>
   They call their high-energy sound ``bubble-gum metal.' Or
``chick rock.'' Or ``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever it is, it has transformed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, life was boring, boring, boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we started the band, I was, like, `What am I going to
do with my life?''' says Katherine, who has a sweet little
heart-shaped mouth. ``But now my life is more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, everything's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock groups come and go. The dreams that inspire them remain the
same: bright lights, searing decibels, celebrity, glitz and
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   For the four hard-working rockettes in Bad Kitty, the dream is
still new, wrapped in shiny paper with all kinds of fabulous
goodies inside.
</P>
<P>
   They're intoxicated with the thrill of the stage, the buzz of
the crowd, the rush of adrenaline that comes from performing.
``It's like you're up there and all these people are cheering for
you and it's cool _ it's like really, really, cool,'' says
Katherine.
</P>
<P>
   And they're totally psyched about playing Hempfest, a political
festival promoting medical marijuana use, agricultural hemp
production and reform of drug laws. One of the tunes they'll play
is a Bad Kitty original, a jaw-dropper called ``Weed'':
</P>
<P>
   Green and sticky and covered in resin
</P>
<P>
   It's weed
</P>
<P>
   It's all we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls know that song will get them noticed _ it's the
controversy thing,'' says Susan Karlsen, Katherine's mother.
``They're just trying to be bad kitties.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes Hempfest as both a good cause and good exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for girls on the verge, 50,000 people could be
make-it-or-break-it time. ``I'm really excited _ but I'm even more
nervous,'' says Kellie. ``It'll be my first time performing for
such a big crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Headliners for the festival are Northwest bands Floater, Second
Coming and Local 808. Sharing the stage with them is a major break
_ and festival organizer Vivian McTeak knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Kitty's a good band, a great band, and I like their music.
They're young and offer a very fresh perspective,'' McTeak says.
``Also, I'd like to see these girls succeed. I knew this event
would be a really good catapult for them.''
</P>
<P>
   How high they'll fly, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   But these four howlin' kitties in the long white limo are
prepared for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   They know what they want, and it doesn't include any more
``sucky'' after-school jobs at fast-food joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want fame . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame and fortune . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame and fortune and fun . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we just wanna have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds a suddenly serious Sarina:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, people forget about how when you're young you know
how to have fun. But when you get older, you, like, forget about it
and you have to do something you don't want to do just to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls all nod their heads. That is sooo boring.
</P>
<P>
   They're never gonna let it happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   They're 16, and anything's possible.
</P>
<P>
   They're 16, and everything's possible.

`CORONADO'S QUEST' GETS EDGE IN HASKELL INVITATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took time, and a great deal of trouble, but Coronado's Quest
has finally taken over the spot near the top of the 3-year-old
rankings that he long seemed destined to hold.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy son of Forty Niner, kept out of the Triple Crown by a
bad disposition and a bruised foot, ran away from Belmont Stakes
winner, and Kentucky Derby and Preakness runnerup, Victory Gallop
to win Sunday's $1 million Haskell Invitational. With Derby and
Preakness winner Real Quiet out for the year, Coronado's Quest has
as good a chance to be 3-year-old champioon as any other sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop, who fell a little over a
length short when second in the Haskell, are slated to meet again
in the $750,000 Travers Stakes at Saratoga. At the demanding
Travers distance of a mile and one-quarter, a closing Victory
Gallop may have an advantage over an on-the-pace Coronado's Quest,
who could not be caught over the mile and one-eighth of the
Haskell. We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud of the horse and extremely happy for the
owners (Stuart Janney and the Stonerside Stable),'' said trainer
Shug McGaighey, who has done a top job getting Coronado's Quest to
clean up his act. ``We'll go to the Travers and then I'll have to
make up my mind. Maybe the Super Derby (at Louisiana Downs Sept.
27).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that this was a two-race series, the
Haskell and the Travers,'' said Elliott Walden, who trains Victory
Gallop. ``That day will be to our advantage. Victory Gallop is
still in the running for championship honors. His record speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Oct. 26 and Nov. 30 of last year, Coronado's Quest won
the Cowdin, Nashua and Remsen at Aqueduct with great ease. Those
efforts established him as a true Triple Crown contender. He was
shipped to Florida to begin his 3-year-old campaign, but, between
Jan. 31 and March 14, lost the Hutchinson, Fountain of Youth and
Florida Derby. He acted badly in the paddock and post parade prior
to all three races.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after finishing fifth in the Florida Derby, it was
discoverd that he had an entrapped eppiglottis. He was operated on
and has not lost since, winning the Wood Memorial, Riva Ridge and
Dwyer prior to his success in the Haskell. He has not been
uncontrollable since the operation and McGaughey now believes that
it may have been the breathing problem that was causing his poor
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Both Real Quiet and Victory Gallop are overachievers. Real Quiet
was 8-1 in the Kentucky Derby, while Victory Gallop was 14-1. They
put on a nice show throughout the Triple Crown, but their duel
hardly resembled that of Affirmed vs. Alydar or Sunday Silence vs.
Easy Goer. Both horses are devoid of early speed and don't like to
be rushed from midpack, either. They always seemed susceptible to a
quality speed horse and Coronado's Quest fills that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop are going to have to
continue to run well in order to win an Eclipse Award. Real Quiet
still has a chance, even though a stifle injury has put him on the
shelf. Last year, Silver Charm did not run between the Belmont
Stakes June 7, in which he lost his Triple Crown bid to Touch Gold,
and the Malibu Stakes Dec. 26, in which he also finished second,
but he still was named 3-year-old champion. Touch Gold won the
Haskell to briefly take over the 3-year-old lead, but when he lost
the Pegasus and the Breeders' Cup Classic, Silver Charm vaulted
right back to the head of the class.
</P>
<P>
   What Silver Charm and Real Quiet have in common is that they are
both trained by the popular Bob Baffet and both narrowly missed the
Triple Crown. If Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop flop late in
the season, as Touch Gold did, then Baffert will have successfully
played the waiting game again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick, the 1997 Horse of the Year, won the Jim Dandy by
a nose in a driving three-horse finish on Sunday. The Jim Dandy is
Saratoga's prep for the Travers, but don't look for Favorite Trick
to take on Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop. Instead, Favorite
Trick's trainer, Bill Mott, is dropping broad hints he's headed for
the grass.
</P>
<P>
   It was nice that Favorite Trick proved he could win at a mile
and one-eighth, even if it was against Grade II opposition. But
compete against Grade I foes going a mile and one-quarter? Forget
about it. ``It's (the Travers) probably something that we're not
planning to do right now,'' said Mott. ``I do think that we will
stay away from that race, but we'd like to discuss it for about a
week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proved that he was a champion last year and he was named
Horse of the Year, and rightfully so. Grass is an option with him.
And it's something we may look to do down the line because he's
worked over it and we know he handles it. A flat mile may suit him
because we know, if we're thinking about the Breeders' Cup, we're
obviously not going to run in the mile and one-quarter Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, regular rider of Favorite Trick, agrees with Mott that
their charge would have a problem with 10 furlongs, something he
demonstrated when he ran eighth in the Kentucky Derby. ``A mile and
one-eighth is probably as far as he'll want to go,'' said Day. ``If
I call on him early, he may come up empty. Favorite Trick has had a
pretty good year, but, obviously, he's not handling the competition
with the authority he did last year. But, he's getting the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Favorite Trick appears headed for the $1 million Breders'
Cup Mile, which is raced over the turf. If he can't handle that,
there's always the $1 million Breeders' Cup Sprint, where Favorite
Trick, a son of noted sprinter Phone Trick, would surely feel at
home.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Mike Pegram, who owns Real Quiet, have come up with
a nice 2-year-old filly named Silverbulletday. The daughter of
Silver Deputy took the $100,000 Sorento Stakes at Del Mar on
Saturday, beating Excellent Meeting, who is also trained by
Baffert, by two lengths over six and one-half furlongs in the time
of 1:17 2/5. Silverbulletday, who is ridden by Gary Stvens, broke
her maiden by 11 lengths in her debut and then won the Debutant
Stakes at Churchill Downs. Now 3-for-3, she'll get her chance at
the big time in the Grade II Del Mar Debutante Aug. 29. Baffert
will also start Excellent Meeting, who runs for the Golden Eagle
Farm, in that event ... Silver Charm, most recently last in the San
Diego Handicap July 25, worked five furlongs in :59 1/5 over Del
Mar's main track on Saturday. His previous workout was held on the
turf. ``He went well and came back fine,'' said Baffert. ``I'm
slowly getting him cranked up again, with nothing in mind.''

HOUSE ROSE ABOVE LEADERSHIP _ WILL THE SENATE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Politically, it's like you just finished scaling
Mt. McKinley, got a soft pat on the head, and were told that three
days later you start on Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, your guides and leaders are being switched.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who supports an end to money politics as we know it _
and that includes most of the country, President Clinton, the House
of Representatives, and a recorded majority of the Senate _ the
near impossible, along with extreme frustration and the determined
delaying tactics of a desperate opposition, are the routine.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that the stunning leadership and guts shown
in the House by Republican Chris Shays of Connecticut and Democrat
Marty Meehan of Massachusetts now return to the sidelines. Back
onto the stage will come the Senate's bipartisan reform duo _
Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and GOP maverick John McCain
(the real key because all Democrats are already aboard, but reeling
under heavy pressure from angered fellow conservatives).
</P>
<P>
   The easy way out, especially for possible presidential candidate
McCain, is to observe that last week's passage of real campaign
finance reform in the House is about to be followed by a collision
with an impervious stone wall in the form of a probably unbreakable
Senate filibuster. But the problem with the easy way out is recent
history, which contains a message of hope for the determinedly
quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   One element of it is the simple power of the core proposal,
which is based on the sound proposition that while the record of
government in any kind of regulation is spotty, there's no question
the government can ban things successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of ``soft money'' literally gets rid of unlimited
donations from special interests and the wealthy, the main fuel
that has driven the stratospheric increases in partisan spending on
television propaganda this decade. And getting rid of outside
invasions by special interest propaganda in the closing weeks of
primary and general election campaigns does restrict these
laughably labeled ``issue ads'' to a period considerably removed
from election days.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that the American legislative process is designed
to make major change difficult and to empower minorities beyond
their numbers, as it probably should be. However, it is also true
that the system eventually bows to reform movements that attain
critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   With only a little time left to this Congress, the telltale clue
inside the Senate is the fact that several senators, primarily
Republicans up for reelection, do not want to vote on this issue
anymore. Several of them gave votes to Majority Leader Trent Lott
earlier this year to maintain the filibuster with eight votes to
spare beyond the 40 needed to gridlock the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a fact that the critical votes came with the
expectation that blocking action would bury the issue for the rest
of the year because there was no way reform could succeed in the
House over the opposition of Speaker Newt Gingrich. That
expectation was dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, underdogs beat the leadership by different means in
the House and Senate. In the House, leadership wields much of its
power by playing traffic cop for legislation on its way to the
floor; with the filibuster and other rules, the Senate is less
dictatorial, but the power to schedule bills for debate is
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, organization can sometimes force a
leadership-opposed measure to the floor and keep it alive against a
variety of tricks. That is precisely how Shays and Meehan won,
attracting 61 Republican votes, roughly one in four, to their side.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, what is required is In-Your-Face-ism _ a
willingness to keep offering a blocked proposal as an amendment to
anything on the floor. With discipline, it can break down
commitments to a filibuster or tie the Senate in different knots or
both, as Senator Edward Kennedy showed two years ago in pushing an
increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen on campaign finance reform, there has to be a
leader, which requires John McCain to take a deep breath and take
his colleagues on all over again. There also needs to be an early
convert, and the initial target of the advocates is New York's Al
D'Amato, whose ravenous hunger for cash is exceeded only by his
desire to be reelected. There are others. Some enjoy a reputation
for other than reflexive partisanship (in other words, they know
better): Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Bill Roth of Delaware, John
Warner of Virginia, Slade Gorton of Washington. Others have a
history of interest in serious reform and opposition to
filibusters: former Democrat Ben ``Nighthorse'' Campbell of
Colorado, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Sam Brownback of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The history of uphill struggles in Congress by majorities
against leadership-led minorities shows that the real struggle is
against manufactured senses of futility. The truth is there is
almost always a way. The outcome is usually determined by will.

TIGER WOODS RETURNS TO THE NMRTHWEST TRYING TO EET GAME, LIFE OF
TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Timer News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDIOND, Wash. _ The first and only time Tiger Woods teed it up
for a golf tournament in Washington state, he shot the equivalent
of 35-under par for 142 holes at Vancouver's Royal Oaks Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone knew who the wkinny kid from Cypress, Calif., was
when he was announced for the opening round of the Pacific
Northwest Golb Association's Men's Amateur Championship. Woods had
jurt turned 08 and was playing his first official men's amateur
event after winning three straight U.S. Junior champiojships.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the match-play event ended, with Woods winning every
match _ including the final 11 and 10 over Ovegon Amateur champion
Ted Snavely(_ no one would forget what he$did to a course with a
reputation as being one of the finest in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us look like a short, easy golf course,'' said Steve
Bnwen, the head pro at the 6(900-yard Royal Oaks, who refereed one
of Woods' matches that week in 1994. ``He was just that dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Woods comer to Redmond's Sahalee Country Club.
Only this time, everyone knows him.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated named Woods the Wport{man of the Year for
199? after he won the Masters and three other tournaments in his
rookie season on the PGA Tour. He also won $2.06 million and(the
hearts of sports fans across the world who tuned into golf in
unprecedented numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in his second full year on the PGA Tour, Woods seems
saddled by his own success a.d haunted by inner demons that drive
him to be a perfectionist. His signature fist pumps have been few
and far between and the questions about his game have started to
gnaw at the 22-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   As the!son of an African-American ex-Army officer with a quarter
American Indian and a Thai mother, Woods was reared outside of
golf's traditionan, pampered country-clqb set. With the smile of a
child and the intensity and power of, well, a tiger, he turned his
game loose on an unsuspecting world that seemed his for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   His galleries swelled beyond belief. His marketing empire grew
to $95 million thanks, in part, to endorsement deals with Nike,
Rolex and American Express. He appeared on no fewer than nine major
magazine covers. And his impact on youth was compared to the that
of a Michael Jordan or Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it cool to be a young golfer,'' said Gary Mofg, who
was the director of competitions for the PNG &LR;  tournament,
considered one of the finest amateur events outside of the U.S.
Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   A third-place finish at the British Open showed that Woods may
again be primed for winning on the course. He has nine top-10
finishes in his last 14 events and ranks fourth on the money list
at $1,453,567. 
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs of discord in the Tiger camp _ sagging
sales of his Nike line of apparel and reports(that Woods uses
off-color language, throws clubs and gets irritable. As he prepares
to regain his Masters form in the final major of 1998, Woods is now
faced with a very noticeable backlash from a glowing debut.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking about the media that covered him or vhe image
makers that surrounded him???
</P>
<P>
   TIGER TRASHING
</P>
<P>
   The first signs that Woods was vulnerable came(eazlier this year
at the Nissan Los Angeles Open when he lost a pliyoff to Billy
Mayfair, a paunchy former U.S. Amateur champion with only modest
success on the PGA Tkur. It was Woodr' first playoff loss since
turning pro, but still he handled it with as much grace as anyone
could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of putting something together, going nut
there and firing a good low round. You can't do it every time, and
unfortunately, I wish I could ccll upon it ever{ time, but it just
doesn't work out,'' Woods said after the playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   ( He's managed only one win on U.S. soil this year, the BellSouth
Classic in May, but he's still fourth on the money lict with $1.37
million in winninfs going into the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to know that you can play not all that great
but still be right there,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   But right there, in the max with the rest of the pack is not
where!we were promised Tiger Woods would be. Isn't thi{ the phenom,
the prodigy whose(own father called him the messiah ane promised he
would change the world in that Sports Illustrated sportsman of the
year articne?
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger may not have been entirely tamed, but Woods suddenly
appears caged by a sophomore year where expectations have become
barriers* Even those who first heralded his arrival have begun to
turn on him. And others are gleefully watching his return to
golfing mortality.
</P>
<P>
   One of his earliest biographers, Tim Rosaforte, writing in Golf
World after the British Open, harshly lamented: ``This Woods kid
was a fad, a fluke, a media creation. He hasn't transcended the
game. He isn't the messiah. Second coming? How about second rate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the British Open last month, The Sunday Times columnist Nick
Pitt wrote: ``Watching the golden boy fail was a particular
pleasure. It was a proper reward for his demeanor, and it borrected
the ignorant who, knowing nothing of golf, assumed that since Woods
was better than everybody, he would invariably beat everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods' golf game, the mistakes have come mostly in course
management, playing the ball to the wrong side of greens or on the
wrong side of a slope. But he always seems to be in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between this year and last year is that I'm
much more consistent. My bad rounds aren't as bad as they used to
be,'' Woods said. ``The majority of time, my best rounds are
usually on the weekends. I'm one of those kind of players like
(Greg) Norman or (Mark) Calcavecchia who is very streaky. And when
I get it going, I seem to run them off in bunches. I'm capable of
making clumps of birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   With his early success, Woods had to learn to put up with
jealousy from other players, as well as how to handle the pressure
with being constantly in demand from the media and the public at
large. He is the only golfer on the tour who is surrounded by
security guards on and off the course.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Woods, who helps runs the Tiger Woods Foundation and
declares that his son has ``the ability to be one of the biggest
influences in history,'' bristles at the critics.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that Tiger made mistakes backing out of several
appearances after his Masters win, and by being quoted telling
off-color and racially insensative jokes in a GQ magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming to terms with that,'' Earl Woods said of the
public-relations blunders. ``It comes with increased maturity and
understanding of the hierarchy of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash aimed at Tiger was not wholly unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in this country have a death wish. We create our heroes
only to tear them down,'' Earl Woods said. ``And if we can't find
anything wrong then we invent things. It almost becomes the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TIGER FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Woods last year angered many tour players when he would talk of
losing a tournament because he didn't have his ``A-game'' and
because his galleries often would be boisterous and disruptive as
they marched along with him, oblivious to other groups and the
normal reserved etiquette of golf spectating.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the ``Tiger factor'' is something most have
learned to live with and even come to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's PGA champion, Davis Love III, for example, says
Woods' influence is bringing a new athleticism to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he's a golfer or he plays any other sport, he's a
phenomenal athlete, and he's just going to overpower the game,''
Love said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara, a
close friend and neighbor of Woods', adds: ``I appreciate when I
see a person who has a lot of talent who can hit shots I'm not
capable of hitting. But that's OK. There are a lot of ways to play
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' astounding play last year caught the attention of his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was going crazy coming down the stretch (at the
Masters) last year ... I expected him to make birdie on all the
holes,'' O'Meara said. `` You have to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods likes the fact that other players are looking over their
shoulders at how he's doing in every tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that the other players expect it,'' he said.
``You've always got to watch out for somebody, and if those guys
are thinking that way, then that's good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   How will Woods do at the PGA? Last year at Winged Foot, Woods
was in contention through the first three rounds but shot 5-over 75
on the final day to end up tied for 29th place. The event left him
mentally drained, but emotionally unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable because every facet of your game is going to
be tested in a major, as well it should. ... But more importantly,
it's going to test your mind,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WORLD
</P>
<P>
   As his success steamrolled last year, Earl and Tiger started a
minority foundation to promote minority participation in golf and
related activities. Not only does he raise millions of dollars to
fund the program, but he makes dozens of appearances at clinics
across the country, where he's always met by rapt audiences who
hang on his every word and every swing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just kids who have been captivated.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Open in San Francisco, Lucien Ilangwa, 31, a
University of California-Berkeley student from Zaire with long
dreadlocks, was in Woods' gallery. He said he was an avid tennis
player until Woods came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won the Masters, I was flabbergasted. Who wasn't?
Obviously I've spent much time at the driving range since,'' he
said. ``My sisters live in France. They were really surprised when
I told them I started playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same event, Jose Flores, 27, a Mexican-American with a
group of nine relatives, including kids, followed Tiger's every
move at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started from the bottom. He's worked his way up,'' Flores
said of his interest in Woods. ``He's not high society. I think
what Tiger brings out there is no divisions. He's a person who has
brought everyone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods knows he's had an impact on young would-be golfers and
seems at ease with the adulation he's received as well as the
responsibility of being a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I have turned pro and since I've been doing my
foundation work, I have definitely seen an increase in minority
participation in the sport,'' he said as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   And, to hear Woods tell it, some of the people he is having an
effect on are having an effect on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable how good these kids are.'' he said during a
recent break. ``I'll never forget this little 5-year-old girl with
a perfect golf swing. I mean, absolutely a perfect golf swing. And
they said that she started taking up golf when she saw me on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that have definitely touched my heart.''

VERMONT FILM ICON MILKS THE SPOTLIGHT IN BID FOR SENATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNBRIDGE, Vt. _ Fred Tuttle is a 79-year-old man who milked
cows all his life and paid for it with his knees. He quit school in
the 10th grade to work on the farm, and those bib overalls are no
prop. When he gets pensive, he lifts his hat and scratches the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Being There'' in a feed cap.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Tuttle starred as himself in the 1996 arthouse flick ``Man
With A Plan,'' in which a retired dairy farmer gets himself elected
to Congress so he can pay his taxes and buy his father a hip
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fred Tuttle is running for the Republican nomination for
the US Senate. For real.
</P>
<P>
   And the truly wild thing? He might win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the strangest, most bizarre campaign I've seen in
covering Vermont politics for 18 years,'' said Peter Freyne, a
columnist for Seven Days, an alternative weekly newspaper in
Burlington. ``Fred has a great shot in the primary, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   The quirky little movie made Tuttle a Vermont icon whose
beguiling mug is one of the most recognizable in the Green Mountain
state. His face is on milk-mustache posters in convenience stores.
``Spread Fred'' bumper stickers are must-have Vermont kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go anywheres,'' said Dottie Tuttle, Fred's wife of 37
years. ``We have no privacy. Everywhere we go, they want to take
pictures with him, they want his autograph.'' At last year's
Tunbridge World's Fair, Fred never did have time to eat a hot dog.
He was shaking hands double-fisted.
</P>
<P>
   And while his entry into the race has been acknowledged by both
Tuttle and his campaign manager (and movie producer) John O'Brien
as a gag and a way to publicize this fall's airing of ``Man With A
Plan'' on PBS, it has set Vermont politics on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle is running against Jack McMullen, a Massachusetts
millionaire who owns a ski house in Vermont but established
residency here last year.
</P>
<P>
   In McMullen, Tuttle may have found his perfect foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy from Massachusetts coming up here _ whoever he is _
will not get voted in just because he's from Massachusetts,'' said
Michelle Barnaby, who runs the till at The Village Store in
Tunbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Fred wins just out of principle,'' said Barnaby. ``To
say maybe the average person does stand a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Fred Tuttle want to be a United States senator?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too old now,'' he said, in thick Yankee twang. ``If I was
younger I would like to go. I think most everybody in Vermont would
like to go and try to get things better. What's that Lewinsky thing
down in Washington? ... Costs what, $15 million of taxpayers'
money? I would stop all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle has pledged to spend $16 on the race. He spent the first
week of his candidacy recovering from knee surgery in the Veterans
Administration hospital in White River Junction, Vt. His doctor has
ordered him to stay home for a month. No matter.
</P>
<P>
   When he held forth from his front porch last week, the pack of
reporters was thick. He was on the radio three mornings this week.
He's already made The New York Times, The New Yorker, and the
British press. ABC called this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got used to it,'' said Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting here on the porch, as a brook of no particular name
flows through the valley, Fred Tuttle seems uncomfortable talking
about his opponent, or the primary.
</P>
<P>
   He will say this much:
</P>
<P>
   On Hollywood: ``Now, it's quite hard for the wife and I to find
a good movie on television. ... John's came out good. No actors in
it, no nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   On crime: ``How we gonna stop crime? Educate your children.''
</P>
<P>
   On the death penalty: ``Like that boy out West that blew up that
thing out there,'' referring to Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma
City bombing. ``Why don't they execute 'im 'stead of lettin' 'im
live so long? Why feed 'im?''
</P>
<P>
   On Vermont: ``Orange County, Windsor County, a few counties
around here, and the Northeast Kingdom looks good to me. But around
Burlington, it's all gone to ski tows.''
</P>
<P>
   On class: ``The rich are ruling the poor. Am I right on that?''
</P>
<P>
   On his fame (lifting his cap, scratching his head): ``What have
I done to be the great person they think I am in Vermont? I'm just
an ordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever accused Fred Tuttle of being qualified for the
Senate. But that doesn't mean they won't vote for him anyway _
perhaps out of a certain comic cantankerousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for 30 or 40 years,'' said Frank Boles the
other day, as he took a break from herding cattle in Royalton. ``He
had some good Jerseys when he was farming. ... I think he's going
to take the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont has an open primary, which means people can pick which
primary to vote in. With a lack of exciting races on the Democratic
side, many Democrats are expected to cross over on Sept. 8 and vote
Republican, for Tuttle. The Republican nominee will face incumbent
Senator Patrick J. Leahy in November.
</P>
<P>
   When Tuttle entered the race, the Republican establishment in
Vermont could have laughed it off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had a bilious fit.
</P>
<P>
   The state party chairman derided the gag, then challenged some
of Tuttle's signatures as bogus. When the secretary of state
ordered Tuttle to come up with 23 more signatures to make the
requisite 500, Tuttle came back with 2,300. McMullen even called
upon Leahy to get Tuttle to quit. Leahy refused.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, it was front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not genius on our part,'' said the 35-year-old O'Brien, a
Harvard man who is masterminding the campaign and serves as a
justice of the peace in Tunbridge. ``Every comedian needs a
straight man. Jack McMullen and the GOP have played the straight
man to perfection. We're in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Stokes, the executive director of Vermont's Republican
Party, said the party's original reaction was not to Tuttle's entry
into the race, but to O'Brien's publicity stunt, and to the
assertion that Tuttle would endorse Leahy if he won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Tuttle is out of the hospital and able to speak for
himself, Stokes said, ``Mr. Tuttle is being treated as a serious
Republican nominee. ... He's a legitimate Republican candidate. I
hope the entry of Mr. Tuttle engenders good, constructive debate.''
</P>
<P>
   To some Vermonters, McMullen's recent challenge to Leahy to cap
spending at $1 million threw kerosene on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we spending a million dollars on campaigns?'' the
67-year-old Boles asked, sneering. ``Fred's spending $16!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous calls to his campaign headquarters, McMullen
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody in Vermont loves Fred Tuttle. Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Many Vermonters are angry, saying that he and O'Brien are
mocking the political process. The two have been thoroughly
chastised in letters to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is received very well by upscale people,'' said
Frank Bryan, a University of Vermont political scientist. ``They
think he's cute. ... Vermont is becoming just kind of a theme park
of the past, and Fred is becoming a symbol of that and he's being
used to promote that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really very depressed that John O'Brien would use Fred
Tuttle like this,'' added Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   At this suggestion, the grizzly old dairy farmer bristles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no, no,'' he said, and the italics are his. ``I don't
b'lieve that; do you, Dottie?'' Dottie does not. ``John and I are
great friends. No, suh! Not for one second.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tuttle said now that he will not endorse Leahy if he wins
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said Leahy, who clearly is qualified to be a United States
senator, will beat either Republican handily. So Leahy can afford
to have some fun now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose about the one thing I'll have to do,'' if Tuttle
wins the primary, said Leahy, deadpanning. ``You know that cap he
wears that has `Fred' on it? If he wins, I'll have to go out and
spend some money and buy a cap that said `Pat' on it _ so people
know which one is which.''

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Renay Appleby would have told her husband, in

<P>
   ``Renay would say: `Get off your (butt), get back on the horse
and go,''' said Robert Allenby, Stuart Appleby's best friend now
that Appleby's wife is gone.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Renay Appleby died in an illogical accident outside a
train station in London on July 23. Unloading a bag from her car,
Appleby was crushed between her car and a cab. The cab driver
thought he was in reverse instead of drive and hit the gas pedal
instead of the brake.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Stuart Appleby was at Sahalee tuning up for the PGA
Championship, his first tournament since his wife's death. He
declined interview requests but plans to talk to reporters at a
news conference today.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby looked like all of the other pros, striding down
Sahalee's cathedral fairways, checking out breaks on the greens.
Normally focused, his mind must have been elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some tough times, quiet times,'' Allenby said.
``He has been home with Renay's family and his family. This will be
the first week he has been on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby flew from Greece to London to be with Appleby after the
incident. Other players have responded with their support. Nick
Price said a few nice words during his victory speech in Memphis
two weeks ago. Billy Mayfair dedicated Sunday's Buick Open victory
in Detroit to Renay Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, 27, is known as the Australian with potential for
prominence, winner of two PGA titles with earnings of nearly $2
million in three years on Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Renay Appleby did not even want to play golf with
Stuart Appleby, much less marry him. She disliked the man who would
become her husband. An accomplished golfer herself, Appleby met
Stuart on a trip to the United States for a series of matches
against college teams.
</P>
<P>
   She was supposed to play with Appleby against Texas Tech but
balked because of her misperception about the boy who grew up on a
dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought he was a stuck-up pig,'' Allenby said.
</P>
<P>
   Renay Appleby was funny, apt to crack a joke about anything.
Together, they were an inseparable tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would refer to them as the dynamic duo,'' said Carolyn
White, Renay's mother. ``Each one's weaknesses were the other's
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Renay caddied for her husband for three months in 1996 and was
at most of his tournaments after that.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby figures that ``Stuey,'' as he calls his friend, will be
looking for her outside the gallery ropes this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really tough for him,'' Allenby said.
</P>
<P>
   Known to playfully call his friend a country bumpkin from the
bush, Allenby used a different description Monday, referring to
Appleby as ``a tough bugger.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Appleby will make club selections and worry about life
choices later, grieving and grinding in the meantime at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would rather be busy than thinking about it at home,''
Allenby said. ``This will keep his mind occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tough for the reserved Appleby to open up in the best of
circumstances. He will admit that he can be a loner but
acknowledged that his marriage was highly influential, helping him
discover his bearings and goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was my own man for a number of years until I met Renay,'' he
told one publication. ``You need a degree of single-minded
direction of where you want to go. Sometimes you need to bump into
people to keep a clear track of where you're trying to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart and Renay Appleby were on their way to Paris for a second
honeymoon. Where is the destination now? And what about Appleby's
perspective? Without any of the answers, Appleby will respond to
those questions this morning, attempting to piece it together like
others have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my mom and dad,'' Fred Couples said. ``If I could have
them around 10 more years, I'd quit the game. Golf is very
unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has a positive outlook on life,'' said Jesper
Parnevik, one of Appleby's friends. ``It's not like it's over. He
just has to live it differently.''
</P>

`GRILL AND DRILL' SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM WORKS FOR CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It's not the sweltering classroom on the North Side
that is making 13-year-old Cherish Phillips sweat this summer. It's
the threat that she will be plunged into the student hell of having
to repeat a grade if she doesn't pass mandatory summer school.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the lack of air conditioning in classrooms and the
strict ``grill and drill'' teaching method, Phillips says she is
working harder than at any time in the regular school year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Chicago's new system serves as a useful blueprint &UR;  &LR; for other
cities. While controversial, it is producing improved test scores
and being embraced by parents, teachers, and even students.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first my daughter was upset she had to go, but now, she
likes it. I was surprised,'' said Shirley Alejos, parent of
sixth-grader Linda Maldonado, one of about 40,000 Chicago public
school students in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, students from third, sixth, eighth,
and ninth grade have been required to attend summer school in
reading and math if they either fail those courses during the year,
or fail the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching method is six or seven weeks of intensive drilling,
and there is no time for socializing. But school officials say it
works: About 54 percent of summer school students last year passed
the Iowa test when it was re-administered in August. Some students
jumped three grade levels in test scores after a single summer of
school, according to school statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, students say the summer program's intensity and
the concrete repercussions they face of having to repeat a grade if
they do not learn the material keep them focused in a way they are
not during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids play around during the year _ I did. And now they know
they have to study, or be held back. That would be so
embarrassing,'' said Phillips, who failed the Iowa sixth-grade test
in May. As her classmates from the Bateman School took turns
reading aloud in a classroom so hot the lights were turned off to
make it cooler, she declared, ``It's not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, sixth-grader Madiha Khan said, ``I'd rather be coming
here than sitting at home doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the intensely focused classes seem to motivate
students, critics charge they are not truly educating them.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of summer school, Khan's teacher, Carol
Schmitz, took the sixth-grade students' workbooks and wrote their
test scores on them in areas like comprehension and vocabulary, to
show exactly where they would have to improve to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they are going to ask you on the test, in this
way,'' Schmitz told students recently, as she quizzed 16
sixth-graders on the metric system. Juice boxes were stacked nearby
_ school officials' incentive to children to make it through hot,
humid days with no air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Showing students a map of geographical regions of the United
States, she said, ``There are lots of things on the test about
maps. You need to know &UR;  &LR; this.''
</P>
<P>
   Such direct ``teaching to the test'' fuels some of the loudest
protests against the mandatory summer school program. Other critics
of required summer school have said it penalizes thousands of
students who try hard in school and must attend in the summer only
because their teachers did not teach them well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are supposed to serve the students and be accountable to
them, and (Chicago) is putting children first in line to be
accountable,'' said Julie Woestehoff, executive director of Parents
United for Responsible Education in Chicago, a school reform group
dedicated to getting parents more involved in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are only doing this to raise students' test scores. ...
I'd rather &UR;  &LR; summer school be fun, more captivating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the $52 million summer school budget here should be
used to better train teachers and improve the school day during the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, similar arguments helped delay a plan to begin
mandatory summer school next year for Grades 3, 5, and 8. As many
as 50 percent, or approximately 7,600, of students in those grades
could be required to attend summer school in 2000 if they fail
strict promotion standards approved by the School Committee in June
that include passing coursework, a standardized test, and
attendance requirements.
</P>
<P>
   While school Superintendent Thomas Payzant wanted to start
required summer school next year, a divided School Committee balked
at that proposal and decided only to recommend it next summer and
require it in two years. Boston school officials have no specific
plan as to how students will be taught, but say they want to design
a program that will feature one-on-one tutoring and enrichment
programs as well as teach test-taking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been a promotion policy for more than a
decade before the new policy was passed this spring, in practice,
Boston students have rarely been held back if they did not meet the
requirements. The result has been thousands of students being
``socially promoted,'' or moving on to higher grades without
knowing grade-level work.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, school officials say their students' poor academic
achievement makes moot any arguments about who should be
accountable for what children learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still learning math,'' said Bateman teacher Schmitz.
``They are &UR;  &LR; not learning anything that is not going to help them
for the rest of their &UR;  &LR; life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear that Chicago, where Mayor Richard Daley has
largely &UR;  &LR; controlled the schools since 1995, is a summer school
success &UR;  &LR; story. School officials' goal is to have half of the
system's children &UR;  &LR; reading at grade level by 2003. Currently, only
about 35 percent do. &UR;  &LR; And while student standardized test scores
inch &UR;  &LR; up each year, it is usually only by two to four percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, parents remain hopeful, largely because they say any
reform is &UR;  &LR; better than the dismal state of the schools five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not the best thing, but it's something,'' said
Sandras &UR;  &LR; Hurley, picking up her ninth-grade son from summer school
recently in front &UR;  &LR; of Bogan High School on Chicago's Southwest
Side. ``I'm hopeful. &UR;  &LR; But I won't know if it works until my
son &UR;  &LR; graduates and gets a good job.''

PGA TOURNEY TECHNICALLY A MAJOR, BUT DOESN'T CARRY THE SAME
PRESTIGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With all of the bluster and hype, you would
think the PGA Championship is ``Armageddon II.'' As if Bruce Willis
is going to swoop down on Sahalee in a summertime sequel from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For our area, this golf tournament packs significance because we
have not had a PGA stop since 1966, let alone one regarded as a
``major.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a broader perspective, it is not that big. The Masters is
Michael Jordan. The PGA Championship is John Starks. It is not the
Masters, U.S. Open or British Open, of course, yet every year the
PGA gets an invitation to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Every golf professional grew up with goals of winning a major
tournament. It validates their careers more than, say, becoming
champion of the Quad City Classic.
</P>
<P>
   They revere Augusta. They persevere in the U.S. Open, hoping to
be the last survivor. They are blown around in the British Open,
coveting golf's oldest prize in the game's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA? It is normally played in an oven. You will never hear
anyone _ with the exception of last year's champion, Davis Love III
_ say, ``I have always dreamed of winning the PGA Championship.''
It is always one of the other three.
</P>
<P>
   This ``major'' tournament business is overdone, particularly
when it pertains to the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The word itself makes these tournaments sound so important,
rendering the rest unworthy. Just keep in mind how wrong we are.
Bobby Ayala is technically a ``major'' leaguer. ``G.I. Jane'' was
considered a ``major'' motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA does little to distinguish itself, even though it is the
fourth and final major of the year. This clean-up hitter draws
walks and runs the bases but supplies insufficient power to the
gaps. Again, that's all right. But it is Tony Gwynn in a society
that wants Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest feat in golf is winning the Grand Slam, collecting
all four major championships in the same year. No one has ever done
it, but one player (Ben Hogan) was close and another (Mark O'Meara)
is threatening to win three this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how much the PGA and Grand Slam meant to Hogan. After
winning the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in 1953, Hogan
declined to play in the PGA. In those days, the PGA was played one
week after the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who had been in a serious car wreck in 1949, thought the
physical strain and travel demands of playing in two straight
majors was too overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Walter Hagen? He won four straight PGA
Championships in the 1920s and apparently forgot he was supposed to
be in Baltimore to try for his fifth in 1928. Tournament officials
scrambled and found him on an exhibition tour. Hagen ended up
playing in the '28 PGA but lost in the semifinals to eventual
champion Leo Diegel (the PGA was a match-play tournament then).
</P>
<P>
   The intent is not to diminish the PGA. It has a stronger field
than The Masters, which allows golfing geezers, as long as they are
past champions, in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA furnishes occasional drama _ in 1991, the big blond
bomber from Arkansas won his first tournament, cutting doglegs with
rocketing drives, creating the John Daly legacy. The tournament has
added intrigue at Sahalee with O'Meara looking to place the
Wanamaker Trophy alongside those he won at The Masters and British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, the PGA is Sandra Bullock acceptable, just not
Pamela Anderson provocative. PGA really stands for Pretty Good
Action.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins at Sahalee this year could be a journeyman, a
grinder, a nondescript lifer whose otherwise inglorious record will
be highlighted by a victory in a housing development on the
Sammamish Plateau where there are more speed bumps than residents.
</P>
<P>
   He will clutch the big silver cup known as the Rodman Wanamaker
Trophy, which is the size of a pony keg with handles. He will look
to the sky and rub rain from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He will be heralded as one of the young guns who finally busted
through or a veteran who endured.
</P>
<P>
   It will in fact be a ``major'' accomplishment. But keep this in
mind: the PGA Championship is the picture-in-a-picture on your wide
screen, still visible, just not very prominent, much like Corvallis
in the Pac-10.

HOUSE ROSE ABOVE LEADERSHIP _ WILL THE SENATE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Politically, it's like you just finished scaling
Mt. McKinley, got a soft pat on the head, and were told that three
days later you start on Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, your guides and leaders are being switched.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who supports an end to money politics as we know it _
and that includes most of the country, President Clinton, the House
of Representatives, and a recorded majority of the Senate _ the
near impossible, along with extreme frustration and the determined
delaying tactics of a desperate opposition, are the routine.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that the stunning leadership and guts shown
in the House by Republican Chris Shays of Connecticut and Democrat
Marty Meehan of Massachusetts now return to the sidelines. Back
onto the stage will come the Senate's bipartisan reform duo _
Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and GOP maverick John McCain
(the real key because all Democrats are already aboard, but reeling
under heavy pressure from angered fellow conservatives).
</P>
<P>
   The easy way out, especially for possible presidential candidate
McCain, is to observe that last week's passage of real campaign
finance reform in the House is about to be followed by a collision
with an impervious stone wall in the form of a probably unbreakable
Senate filibuster. But the problem with the easy way out is recent
history, which contains a message of hope for the determinedly
quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   One element of it is the simple power of the core proposal,
which is based on the sound proposition that while the record of
government in any kind of regulation is spotty, there's no question
the government can ban things successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of ``soft money'' literally gets rid of unlimited
donations from special interests and the wealthy, the main fuel
that has driven the stratospheric increases in partisan spending on
television propaganda this decade. And getting rid of outside
invasions by special interest propaganda in the closing weeks of
primary and general election campaigns does restrict these
laughably labeled ``issue ads'' to a period considerably removed
from election days.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that the American legislative process is designed
to make major change difficult and to empower minorities beyond
their numbers, as it probably should be. However, it is also true
that the system eventually bows to reform movements that attain
critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   With only a little time left to this Congress, the telltale clue
inside the Senate is the fact that several senators, primarily
Republicans up for reelection, do not want to vote on this issue
anymore. Several of them gave votes to Majority Leader Trent Lott
earlier this year to maintain the filibuster with eight votes to
spare beyond the 40 needed to gridlock the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a fact that the critical votes came with the
expectation that blocking action would bury the issue for the rest
of the year because there was no way reform could succeed in the
House over the opposition of Speaker Newt Gingrich. That
expectation was dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, underdogs beat the leadership by different means in
the House and Senate. In the House, leadership wields much of its
power by playing traffic cop for legislation on its way to the
floor; with the filibuster and other rules, the Senate is less
dictatorial, but the power to schedule bills for debate is
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, organization can sometimes force a
leadership-opposed measure to the floor and keep it alive against a
variety of tricks. That is precisely how Shays and Meehan won,
attracting 61 Republican votes, roughly one in four, to their side.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, what is required is In-Your-Face-ism _ a
willingness to keep offering a blocked proposal as an amendment to
anything on the floor. With discipline, it can break down
commitments to a filibuster or tie the Senate in different knots or
both, as Senator Edward Kennedy showed two years ago in pushing an
increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen on campaign finance reform, there has to be a
leader, which requires John McCain to take a deep breath and take
his colleagues on all over again. There also needs to be an early
convert, and the initial target of the advocates is New York's Al
D'Amato, whose ravenous hunger for cash is exceeded only by his
desire to be reelected. There are others. Some enjoy a reputation
for other than reflexive partisanship (in other words, they know
better): Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Bill Roth of Delaware, John
Warner of Virginia, Slade Gorton of Washington. Others have a
history of interest in serious reform and opposition to
filibusters: former Democrat Ben ``Nighthorse'' Campbell of
Colorado, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Sam Brownback of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The history of uphill struggles in Congress by majorities
against leadership-led minorities shows that the real struggle is
against manufactured senses of futility. The truth is there is
almost always a way. The outcome is usually determined by will.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Rev. Charles Stith, longtime activist and recently
named ambassador to Tanzania, is sitting in his Back Bay office,
his trademark bow tie around his neck, his cuff links securely
fastened, his checked sports jacket hanging squarely on the wooden
valet beside his desk. The oversize briefcase he uses as an
overnight bag, toothbrush and dirty clothes inside, rests at his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is just back from Washington, from a hurried trip to the
State Department crisis center monitoring the aftermath of the
bombings of US embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. Suddenly his
agenda the Monday morning after a three-week Caribbean vacation is
no longer winding up his tenure as head of the civil and economic
rights group he founded.
</P>
<P>
   Did that fax from the State Department arrive? What is the
telephone number of the Tanzanian ambassador in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   He may not roll up his sleeves or loosen his tie, but Stith the
ambassador is at work even though he doesn't move to Africa for
another month. He was on a plane to Washington early Sunday, 12
hours after he got home from St. Maarten. He is calling the
Tanzanian ambassador to the United States, thanking him for the aid
of the Tanzanian people after the bomb that killed 10 people in Dar
es Salaam. He is writing to Americans in various agencies in
Tanzania, thanking them for their efforts. He is considering how he
wants to start his tenure at a time when the embassy staff may need
as much pastoral care as diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A traumatic event like this, people are working 18 hours a
day. The adrenaline is pumping. It won't be until after this is
behind us in terms of the crisis mode that this is going to hit
home to folks,'' says the 48-year-old Stith. ``The other piece is
when you look at the plant, the physical plant itself, it is
nothing short of a miracle that more people were not killed. To
look at that physical evidence causes you to focus on your own
mortality. The need to really sort through some of that, to vent
and to heal, has got to be part of the agenda when I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith is the preacher who led the historic Union United
Methodist Church in Boston's South End for 15 years, stylish and
savvy, outspoken and personable and ambitious (he prefers
``driven''), who became one of the most prominent voices in the
city's black community, involved in everything from registering
voters to protesting racial violence and apartheid to pressing for
affirmative action and equal credit opportunities for Boston's
minority residents. He made news _ and controversy _ last spring
when he led the protest that greeted Boston magazine's headline
``Head Negro in Charge'' over a story about Harvard's Henry Louis
Gates Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what I am,'' Stith said in one of several
interviews before the bombings. ``And what I am is what I will be
because of the time in which I was born and the time I came of
age.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a St. Louis native who had no significant contact with
whites until he enrolled in Baker University in Kansas in 1971,
where, rumor had it, white fraternity brothers threw darts at a
photo of him. He had no white friends until he entered Harvard
Divinity School in 1975. Now he counts a president of the United
States, a white Arkansan named Bill Clinton, as a longtime friend.
Check a list of people who've slept in the Lincoln bedroom at the
White House and Stith's name is there. ``Hell,'' he says, ``it's a
hoot to have a friend who you refer to as `Mr. President.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's the civic missionary calling for banks in the inner city
and black faces in corporate offices who left his pulpit in 1994 to
work full time runing the Organization for a New Equality, which he
founded in 1985 after turning down an offer to succeed The Rev.
Jesse Jackson as head of the Chicago-based PUSH. Former Comptroller
of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, under whose tenure banks committed
$360 billion to poorer communities, calls Stith ``one of the
leaders in this country of the movement to economically empower
low- and moderate-income people.'' ONE's mission appealed to a
president who seeks to transform America's relationship with Africa
from one based on aid to one based on trade.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is as much part of Boston's social fabric as its political
fiber. He's half of one of Boston's more visible power couples. His
wife, Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, associate dean at the Harvard
School of Public Health and former state health commissioner, is a
nationally known specialist on youth violence. They have two
teenaged children and also raised their nephew after the death of
Prothrow-Stith's sister in 1982. Prothrow-Stith's mother has lived
with them _ and has run their household _ since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is classy enough to have a favorite corner table at the
Bristol Lounge of the Four Seasons Hotel and corny enough to
commemorate good times by leading his family in three rounds of
``hip hip hooray.'' When ONE honored Ludwig this spring, Stith paid
tribute by commandeering a roomful of bankers through the Stith
family cheer. When Stith's family and friends dined at Mr. K's
Chinese restaurant in Washington following his nomination hearing
in June, Stith's 19-year-old son, Percy, led the cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is an original,'' says his longtime friend Ira
Jackson, executive vice president of BankBoston. ``He's flashy and
he's quotable and he certainly is notable. He ain't perfect, but he
sure is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him operate in a number of venues and it's not obvious
unless you reach across the totality of those venues to understand
the magic he works. Some in Boston say where is his congregation?
Where are his disciples? But you go to that dinner for Gene Ludwig
and you see an extraordinary cross section _ people who were
previously adversaries and even enemies brought together by this
guy's savvy and charisma and interpersonal skills. He weaves a very
interesting mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been weaving that mosaic most of his life. In second grade,
his mother, Dorothy McLean, recalls, Stith was elected king of his
grammar school. In middle school, he was president of the student
body. In high school, he ran a social club called the Egotists _
the name, he insists, was the idea of a boy named Squeaky _ and in
college he headed the black student union. He and his wife have fed
everyone from former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld to
psychiatrist Alvin Pouissant at dinners known for spirited repartee
and post-supper songfests around the piano or heated games of
Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gazing at Kilimanjaro
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irony of his posting in Tanzania is that Stith decided to
enter the ministry _ and abandon any idea he had of becoming a
laywer _ when he was a college student building churches in Kenya.
``We were starting with boulders as big as these chairs,'' he says,
sitting in one chair in his office, with his arm resting on a
second chair and his feet stretched in a third, ``and with sledge
hammers beating them into gravel so we could lay the foundation.''
Evenings, his day's work done, Stith would lie on the African
earth, watch the sunset, and gaze at Mt. Kilimanjaro in neighboring
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was while I was looking at Kilimanjaro,'' he says, ``and
thinking about what life had been like for me and what life ought
to be like that I got the calling to the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Stith brings to Africa a politics that is more
pragmatic than ideological. ``I'm much more interested in getting
something done than in making a point,'' he says. ``but sometimes
you have to make a point to create a context to get something done.
At the end of the day I want the stuff to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On various issues that have divided Boston's black community,
Stith stood on the side of caution. He opposed as economically
unfeasible a referendum calling for minority neighborhoods to
secede from Boston. He supported an appointed school board.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Stith, the elder of two sons, rarely saw his father
after his parents divorced when he was very young, but he spent
summers with his paternal grandmother, trading the relative reserve
of the Methodist or Presbyterian churches his mother favored for
the ``knockdown, drag-out, shout, fall out, revival'' exuberance of
his grandmother's Baptist church. When Stith dressed in his Sunday
best to help integrate the Fox moviehouse, his mother admonished
him not to embarrass the race.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's mother still lives in St. Louis, and his brother, James,
died a few years ago of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Stith is in the pulpit _ he still offers guest
sermons _ the preacher in him remains. It's there in the cadence of
his speech, in the way he repeats phrases for emphasis, raising or
lowering his voice or elongating his words the second time around
for even more punch. It's there in the way he leans forward and
punctuates his points with his fingers. It's there in the way he
opens a meeting about economic literacy by saying, ``There's a lot
of stuff in the Bible on eternity, but there's only one reference
about what you need to do to get there. It's what have you done for
the least among you?''

<P>
   The preacher in him is also there in the way Stith thinks of
providence, most dramatically in the way he talks _ and preaches _
about the lingering impact of his brush with death when he was shot
in the chest at age 13. A friend had beckoned him to an alley near
his home where another boy had a gun. It's unloaded, the boy
assured as he pulled the trigger. The bullet just missed Stith's
heart. That night in the hospital, Stith heard a doctor tell his
mother he would probably be dead by morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear I could have been killed,'' he says. ``That I
wasn't really speaks to this kind of sense of responsibility and
destiny to do the stuff I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A subdued spender
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as Stith considers it his calling to better the economic
conditions of the inner city _ and now of Tanzania _ he also savors
the fruits of his own success. ``I've never tried to pass myself
off as a holy man committed to a monastic style of living,'' he
says, leaning back in his favorite chair at the Four Seasons, cigar
in hand, ``but I am a man of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Stith sips vermouth over lunch at the Four Seasons, where
the doormen and waiters know him by name and where the chef
prepares dishes he requests whether or not they're on the menu. He
smokes two cigars a day. His mother taught him a boy needs his gray
trousers and blue blazer and now he is so meticulously groomed that
he dons black eyeglasses when he's wearing black or gray and
tortoise shell when he wears gold. He drives a Cadillac
convertible, top down from March until December unless it rains. He
gave up basketball for golf. When his family travels each July to
their time share condo in St. Maarten they fly first class.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's spending, however, is less grand than his taste. The
Cadillac is nine years and 104,000 miles old. His favorite store is
Filene's Basement, and he used to make the sign of an ``x'' over
clothes he liked in hopes that he could buy them later at a lower
price. The courses where he regularly golfs, Franklin Park and
Newton Commonwealth, are public. Those first-class seats are
courtesy of the frequent flyer miles he and his wife accumulate
when they travel for work. The neatly trimmed hair is courtesy of
himself and $29 barber's clippers he bought (he's self-taught
because the instructional video featured only straight-haired
blonds).
</P>
<P>
   This style, combined with his ambition and an ego that his
longtime friend Rev. Joseph Washington, now a pastor in New
Rochelle, N.Y., laughs ``doesn't suffer from any malignancy or
disease,'' earns Stith his critics. He's been faulted for being out
of touch with urban youth, too connected to downtown and too
interested in his own stature. Stith shrugs at the criticism.
``Look,'' he laughs, ``if they crucified Jesus and assassinated
Martin, who's going to escape? Who's going to escape?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fence-mending Rev. Eugene Rivers (``Is it legal for
me to say something nice about Charles or is it illegal?''), a
staunch critic who's been known to mimic Stith smoking a cigar,
says, ``Charles Stith is one of the most brilliant and accomplished
brokers on behalf of the black community that we have had over the
last 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith's day begins at 4:30 or 5 a.m. when he rises with the sun,
and a few mornings a week he and his son, Percy, are on the golf
course at 6 a.m. ``Golf,'' Stith says, ``is the closest thing to a
zen-like experience in sports. You're ultimately playing against
yourself and the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Every morning Stith reads several newspapers _ Boston Globe,
Boston Herald, New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal,
Financial Times and International Herald Tribune _ and then he
reads from the Bible, a habit learned at the Interdenominational
Theological Center in Atlanta. ``A good Christian,'' he says,
``ought to read the newspaper and the Bible every day because you
get to juxtapose the temporal with the eternal.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not traveling _ he averages 15 days a month on the
road for business _ Stith spends days in his office at the back of
ONE's six-room suite, and then ``at day's end, whenever that is,
I'll make my rounds through the house, kisses all around, then
shwoosh to the third floor'' and his cigar room.
</P>
<P>
   These rooms, office and cigar room, are comfortable, lived in,
not unkempt, but certainly not as impeccable as the clothes Stith
wears. There's a stack of papers on the table in his office, and
half-hidden by them, a Bible. Stith never found a place for the
Louisville Slugger bat he got when he gave a speech in Kentucky, so
it rests against a cabinet. A hanging papier mache parrot has a
cracked head and wears the floppy bowtie a banker gave him because
Stith prefers smaller ones. In Stith's cigar room at home, a pile
of papers on Tanzania occupy the chair beside the one where he
smokes his cigar. The books lining the closet and one wall are
sometimes stacked askew.
</P>
<P>
   If any city shaped Stith intellectually and politically and
personally, then it is Atlanta, where he came in 1973 to study at
the historically black seminary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A level playing field
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everybody, whether he admitted it or not, who was in
seminary when I was in seminary wanted to be the next Martin Luther
King Jr. Everybody did,'' Stith says. ``Obviously it means
something in terms of ego, but in the most positive sense it was
that everybody wanted to play that kind of role in shaping history.
I reached a point that to ultimately be acquitted before the bar of
eternal justice I don't have to carry the burden of starting a new
movement. All I have to do is be faithful in the moment. That means
simply to do what I can how I can where I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is where Stith found an intellectual freedom that eluded
him at mostly white Baker. ``When I went to seminary I needed it,
and it was a great experience. Oh, it was a great experience,'' he
says. ``It was great to get to seminary because I could say stuff
and ... it wasn't a commentary about my humanity. It wasn't a
commentary about my race.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is the city where Stith encountered a black community,
with its large middle class, that ``almost, but not quite,''
mirrored the white community. ``It really is an affirmation of
something that all black people believe and that, quite frankly,
which most white people find unbelievable, which is if you level
the playing field black people will be all right,'' he says. ``That
really is what I've been about.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is also where, after working on Maynard Jackson's first
campaign for mayor and meeting people such as Andrew Young, Stith
first sensed that some day in the future ``I could keep counsel
with a president.'' After Jimmy Carter was elected president in
1976, ``I got to the outer edge'' because so many Georgians were
part of Carter's circle. ``By '76,'' Stith says, ``I figured
there'd get to be a point when I'd be really close.'' That point
came a decade later when he met the governor of Arkansas at a Cape
Cod weekend getaway with mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Atlanta is where Stith met a young Spelman College
senior named Deborah Prothrow in February 1975. Their courtship was
brief and intense, propelled in part by what Stith calls the
``providential'' fact that both had been admitted to Harvard, she
to the medical school and he to the divinity school. They wed in
August 1975. Asked to describe her husband, Prothrow-Stithuses
words like ``bright'' and ``humorous'' and ``hardworking,'' then
calls later to leave a message adding ``he's sexy'' to the list.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one, not she, to enjoy the thrill of jet skis. He's the
one who left his first ski lesson midstream with the words ``I get
this,'' she recalls, and bypassed the bunny hill to try a bigger
slope. The first time he ice skated he headed mid-rink to teach
himself figure eights. ``It's an intensity and drive to meet the
challenge,'' his wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is also a man rooted in routine. In courtship,
Prothrow-Stith recalls, they took a bus almost daily to a
Baskin-Robbins he liked for pralines and cream ice cream. As
newlyweds they tasted Baby Watson's cheesecake in Harvard Square,
then had some every day. Now the Four Seasons is Stith's venue of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles likes very nice things and very nice places,'' says
Prothrow-Stith. ``For a black man in America, being in a nice place
that is known for its service and knows you because you have it as
a routine lessens the chances you'll be mistreated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the White House approached Stith in 1997 about the
ambassadorship, he hesitated to upset his life and his wife
immediately looked for ways to make it happen. Now the family is
getting ready for two years in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Prothrow-Stith, for the first year at least, will travel between
Boston and Tanzania. Percy will take a leave of absence from Bates
College to serve as his father's aide-de-camp, 16-year-old Mimi
will finish high school at the international school in Dar es
Salaam, and Prothrow-Stith's mother, Mildred Prothrow, will live
with them in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the agenda for these last weeks before moving includes
a new urgency to previously scheduled security training, as well as
the job of packing his golf clubs for Tanzania, along with his
replica baseball caps from the old Negro League and a framed copy
of a South African ballot from his tenure observing elections there
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stith has noted the irony of returning to the place where he
decided to enter the ministry, of going to the home of Mt.
Kilimanjaro. ``It's the opportunity to go to the other side of the
mountain,'' he says. ``At the least there's got to be a sermon in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he knows what he could not foresee when he uttered those
words, that any sermon he culls from his experiences in Tanzania
will come in a city devastated by the terrorist attack. ``It really
does punctuate for me something that has been at the core of how
I've tried to live my life,'' he says. ``You have to have a sense
of urgency about the stuff you feel called to do and have an
opportunity to do because life and time are tenuous.''

THE PAPARAZZI'S DOLCE CURRICULUM VITA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first of the paparazzi died last month, less than a year
after the crash that killed Princess Diana and set off a worldwide
debate on the hit-and-run photographers' ethics _ and the origins
of their name.
</P>
<P>
   Tazio Secchiaroli, a Roman ``street photographer,'' had been
Fellini's model for the celebrity-chasing character in 1960's ``La
Dolce Vita,'' everyone agreed. But why had Fellini named his
character Paparazzo? Was it related to razzolare, to scratch around
in trash? Influenced by pappataci, an annoying sand-fly? Was it, as
one reader of this column suggested, a Riminese dialect word for
the part of the chicken sometimes known as the pope's nose?
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of us were scratching our heads, some amazingly
well-read source tipped off The Economist that the true Paparazzo
could be found in a 1902 travel book; thus, the London weekly's
post-crash coverage included a footnote informing us that Fellini's
scriptwriter ``took the name from `By the Ionian Sea,' a book by
George Gissing. Coriolano Paparazzo was the proprietor of the hotel
in Catanzaro where the British poet had stayed.'' Gissing was in
fact a novelist, and the magazine gave the wrong date for his trip,
but the squib was still a coup _ especially the smug last line,
which noted that ``Gissing's book is still on sale in Calabria, in
an excellent Italian translation.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark Secchiaroli's departure for the great darkroom in the
sky, Michael Quinion, proprietor of the World Wide Words Web site,
revisits the history of paparazzo in his most recent newsletter.
His account differs from The Economist's in one detail _ he has
Fellini rather than the scriptwriter reading Gissing's book _ but
otherwise it looks like the last word on the word, if not on the
subject. Concludes Quinion: ``I can only wonder at what the late
Signore Paparazzo, keeper of that unnamed hotel in Catanzaro, would
make of the coincidences that led through an English writer's
recording of a brief stay, and an Italian film producer's
accidental encounter with it, to the borrowing of his name as one
of the more pejorative in the English language.'' The World Wide
Words site, including this essay as well as searchable archives, is
at www.clever.net/quinion/words.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics who'd like to meet this Signore Paparazzo can find him
via the Internet, too. Among the surprisingly numerous
Gissing-related Web sites _ even discounting those that use him
only as a limerick rhyme _ there's one with the full text of ``By
the Ionian Sea.'' In the original English, of course, not the
excellent Italian translation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Witter watch
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of our British cousins, they've been wittering on for
years _ the verb, which means chattering idly, and often
annoyingly, goes back to the 1500s. But witter seems to be enjoying
a new vogue, and may at last be ready for a trans-Atlantic leap. If
anything can loft a word across the great divide, after all, it's
``Bridget Jones's Diary,'' the best-selling account of a
thirtysomething's life of comic desperation. And Bridget not only
knows wittering, she's even got a cutting-edge compound form of the
verb: She observes that her supervisor, Perpetua, ``spends the
entire time in full telephonic auto-witter to Arabella or Piggy,
discussing the half-million-pound Fulham flat she's about to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Witter's origins are somewhat obscure _ it could be related to
Scandinavian words for ``warning'' or ``sign,'' says the OED, or it
may be ``imitative'' _ simply meant to sound like the chatter or
prattle it denotes. But wherever it comes from, there's an obvious
role for witter in the American vocabulary: It can help to block
the metastasis of wax, a verb whose semantic boundaries are rapidly
melting.
</P>
<P>
   Wax is a synonym for ``increase gradually, grow'' _ the opposite
of wane _ and not simply another word for talk, as many writers now
seem to believe. No doubt misled by the cliche wax eloquent, they
have people waxing or waxing on when all they're really doing is
babbling: In a Globe story not long ago, for instance, students
``waxed street-smart philosophy over pizza and dessert.'' We can
wax our cars, but we can't wax on this way or the language gods
will wax wroth. Switch to wittering, though, and we can go on to
our heart's content.

WHAT'S LEFT OF HADRIAN'S WALL STILL AMAZES VISITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENHEAD, England _ This is a very small town (a one-pub
village) within sight of Hadrian's Wall. Actually, on close
inspection and some reflection, one realizes that most of the older
buildings in Greenhead and the miles of beautifully laid-up dry
stone walls that stretch across the hillsides actually are
Hadrian's Wall.
</P>
<P>
   This could be disappointing if you arrived expecting to find
that the famous Roman wall still stood in all its glory, spanning
England from South Shields on the North Sea to Bowness-on-Solway on
the Atlantic. But that would mean that nothing had happened since
the fourth century AD, or 1500 years BP (Before Present). For an
American tourist, with urban American legs, there is still enough
wall standing to make the feet ache after what all British
guidebooks (and all Britons) will describe as a ``brief walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Romans conquered southern England without any particular
difficulty. But near this narrow spot on the island, they began to
run into Picts, a fearsome crowd. (The Scots were still in Ireland,
and must have been awesomely fearsome to conquer the Picts a few
centuries later.) Hadrian's Wall does not cut across England at its
narrowest point; it was simply as far north as the Romans could get
without squandering more manpower than the game was worth.
</P>
<P>
   What boggles the visitor's mind is the scale of the thing,
whether much of the wall still stands or not. Ascending the hill
toward the finest stretch of remaining, standing wall from an
exceptionally charming bed-and-breakfast in the valley _ the
Holmhead _ there isn't a scrap of wall to be seen. What you do see
from the hillside is the Holmhead building, an adjoining massive
ruined castle (Thirlwall), and dozens of small houses and farm
buildings and several miles of stone wall, everything built from
stones pulled down from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   At first you ignore the farmer's wall. But after paralleling it
for a quarter mile or so, and climbing a few hundred feet next to
the wall, it suddenly sinks in that you are looking at the only
stone farm fence you've ever seen made out of squared-off
rectangular stones. From the height of land achieved, you can see
similar fences marking field boundaries to the eastern and western
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The original Roman wall had trimmed stones on the outside, the
inside filled with less geometric rubble. The farm walls tend to
use the squared stones up to three or four feet, with one or two
courses of less precise stones on top. As is often the case, there
is more knowlege of antiquities than realities. The fences may have
been raised in the lasthundred years, when local farmers shifted
from a dependence entirely on sheep to a mixed agriculture with
milk cows and beef cattle. The squared-stone walls would have been
more than sufficient for sheep, the few extra feet of rougher wall
would get the fences up above a cow's nose.
</P>
<P>
   The height of land above the Holmhead inn _ the Cawfields _ has
a subtle distinction. Although it is not quite the highest point
above sea level for the Roman wall, the remains of the wall are
higher above the ground than anywhere else. In fact, if you have
seen Cawfields, you have seen both the best and the most
accessible, well-preserved section of Hadrian's Wall. That you have
done this will not satisfy Pauline Staff, who, with her husband,
Brian, manages Holmhead.
</P>
<P>
   It will not do that the visitor see only a mile or two. One must
be off in the morning to Once Brewed National Park Center and
ascend again through fields full of the evidence of cows and sheep,
and occasionally also full of sheep and cows, and see Housesteads
and make a nice walk along the wall (``a nice short day's walk,''
according to Pauline) and catch the bus back from Hexham to
Greenhead.
</P>
<P>
   What Pauline did not say (and neither did Brian, after kindly
dropping the visitor at Once Brewed) was that Housesteads, although
only slightly higher in elevation than Cawfields, was more
precipitous. Nor did the visitor heed the advice of the local
visitors' map: ``Milecastle 42 sits prominently on the crags of the
Whin Sill. This is one of the most rugged sections of the Wall,
which reaches its highest point at Winshields Crag.''
</P>
<P>
   After a ``few minutes''' walk from the Once Brewed visitor
center (the pleasant woman had no idea what was brewed once), which
took this tourist a solid 20 minutes, one reached the Roman wall
where it snaked up a hill that appeared to be roughly a 60-degree
angle.
</P>
<P>
   Crude stone steps paralleled the wall and, as the remains of the
wall disappeared into the ground, topped the remnants and snaked
along north of the wall on the edge of a several-hundred-foot
precipice. It looked steeper than any set of stairs ever
encountered, considerably more difficult, and frankly unappealing.
The visitor's sense of inadequacy was only compounded by the sight
of a large male person in jogging gear who was (itals)running down
the wall.(unitals) And it was only increased by the arrival of a
group of Britons, all of whom appeared to be at retirement age or
past it, who proceeded to sturdily, effortlessly, march up the wall
and almost bound from stairstep to rock to mud to another cut-in
stone stairstep.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for the precipice-challenged, the Romans built a
military road along sensible terrain just south of the wall. This
Pennine Way is still quite obvious on pasturelands. The grass grows
shorter and thinner on the ancient stone pavement, and where the
Pennine Way comes to a farmer's stone wall, you will find a stile
or a gate. It has, apparently, been a public way since AD 400. It
makes an alternative path along the wall, and by judicious
exploration, the nervous visitor can see the best of the wall by
angling up the rolling hills rather than cravenly creeping along
the steepest sections of the wall and it's accompanying pathway.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, it became perfectly obvious that this
visitor was not going to make it to the excavations and museum at
Chesters (home of ``the important Clayton collection of sculptures
and Roman inscriptions,'' per the visitors' guide), let alone to
the town of Hexham and the bus to Greenhead. By following the
advice of passing (and relatively slow-moving) local walkers, it
was possible to find the village of Bardon Mills a mere three miles
farther on, find the Mill Pub, and find, not too long after, the
bus back.
</P>
<P>
   Upon remarking to Pauline Staff that the wall path really
required a walking stick, once one reached a certain age, the
visitor was told that she never used one. Asked how she got up and
down the steepest sections, Pauline explained: ``On all fours.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor trudged upstairs to change clothes and shower. He
had descended the steepest part of the path on all fives, which
explained why the seat of his trousers were all mud- and
grass-stained.
</P>
<P>

IF YOU GO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city of Carlisle is the hub of the Hadrian's Wall world and
has an excellent British Tourist office in the old city hall, a few
minutes walk (even for an American) from the train station and bus
station. You will be much better off checking for a hotel room, or
bed and breakfast, there than walking into the overpriced and
underfurnished hotel next to the train station. Carlisle is served
by rail from London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. The local bus service
is excellent for exploring Hadrian's Wall, provided you have spent
time at the tourist agency planning your visit.
</P>
<P>
   The city is mildly interesting, and the local cathedral boasts
the remnants of some great high Gothic stained glass and wood
carving. Untouched by war, famine or disease, the church was
trashed and gutted by a Cromwellian army in peace time.
</P>
<P>
   Hadrian's Wall deserves a couple of days visiting, and should be
thought of as part of a trip to the English Lake District just to
the south. For local reservations, Brian Staff, coproprietor of the
excellent Holmhead Inn, has a day job as a travel agent in
Carlisle. Inquiries about travel and lodging in northern England
and southern Scotland can be made to him by telephone (your
international code plus) 44 1228 48899, and by fax (your
international code plus) 44 1228 595238.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Rev. Charles Stith, longtime activist and recently
named ambassador to Tanzania, is sitting in his Back Bay office,
his trademark bow tie around his neck, his cuff links securely
fastened, his checked sports jacket hanging squarely on the wooden
valet beside his desk. The oversize briefcase he uses as an
overnight bag, toothbrush and dirty clothes inside, rests at his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is just back from Washington, from a hurried trip to the
State Department crisis center monitoring the aftermath of the
bombings of US embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. Suddenly his
agenda the Monday morning after a three-week Caribbean vacation is
no longer winding up his tenure as head of the civil and economic
rights group he founded.
</P>
<P>
   Did that fax from the State Department arrive? What is the
telephone number of the Tanzanian ambassador in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   He may not roll up his sleeves or loosen his tie, but Stith the
ambassador is at work even though he doesn't move to Africa for
another month. He was on a plane to Washington early Sunday, 12
hours after he got home from St. Maarten. He is calling the
Tanzanian ambassador to the United States, thanking him for the aid
of the Tanzanian people after the bomb that killed 10 people in Dar
es Salaam. He is writing to Americans in various agencies in
Tanzania, thanking them for their efforts. He is considering how he
wants to start his tenure at a time when the embassy staff may need
as much pastoral care as diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A traumatic event like this, people are working 18 hours a
day. The adrenaline is pumping. It won't be until after this is
behind us in terms of the crisis mode that this is going to hit
home to folks,'' says the 48-year-old Stith. ``The other piece is
when you look at the plant, the physical plant itself, it is
nothing short of a miracle that more people were not killed. To
look at that physical evidence causes you to focus on your own
mortality. The need to really sort through some of that, to vent
and to heal, has got to be part of the agenda when I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith is the preacher who led the historic Union United
Methodist Church in Boston's South End for 15 years, stylish and
savvy, outspoken and personable and ambitious (he prefers
``driven''), who became one of the most prominent voices in the
city's black community, involved in everything from registering
voters to protesting racial violence and apartheid to pressing for
affirmative action and equal credit opportunities for Boston's
minority residents. He made news _ and controversy _ last spring
when he led the protest that greeted Boston magazine's headline
``Head Negro in Charge'' over a story about Harvard's Henry Louis
Gates Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what I am,'' Stith said in one of several
interviews before the bombings. ``And what I am is what I will be
because of the time in which I was born and the time I came of
age.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a St. Louis native who had no significant contact with
whites until he enrolled in Baker University in Kansas in 1971,
where, rumor had it, white fraternity brothers threw darts at a
photo of him. He had no white friends until he entered Harvard
Divinity School in 1975. Now he counts a president of the United
States, a white Arkansan named Bill Clinton, as a longtime friend.
Check a list of people who've slept in the Lincoln bedroom at the
White House and Stith's name is there. ``Hell,'' he says, ``it's a
hoot to have a friend who you refer to as `Mr. President.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's the civic missionary calling for banks in the inner city
and black faces in corporate offices who left his pulpit in 1994 to
work full time runing the Organization for a New Equality, which he
founded in 1985 after turning down an offer to succeed The Rev.
Jesse Jackson as head of the Chicago-based PUSH. Former Comptroller
of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, under whose tenure banks committed
$360 billion to poorer communities, calls Stith ``one of the
leaders in this country of the movement to economically empower
low- and moderate-income people.'' ONE's mission appealed to a
president who seeks to transform America's relationship with Africa
from one based on aid to one based on trade.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is as much part of Boston's social fabric as its political
fiber. He's half of one of Boston's more visible power couples. His
wife, Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, associate dean at the Harvard
School of Public Health and former state health commissioner, is a
nationally known specialist on youth violence. They have two
teenaged children and also raised their nephew after the death of
Prothrow-Stith's sister in 1982. Prothrow-Stith's mother has lived
with them _ and has run their household _ since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is classy enough to have a favorite corner table at the
Bristol Lounge of the Four Seasons Hotel and corny enough to
commemorate good times by leading his family in three rounds of
``hip hip hooray.'' When ONE honored Ludwig this spring, Stith paid
tribute by commandeering a roomful of bankers through the Stith
family cheer. When Stith's family and friends dined at Mr. K's
Chinese restaurant in Washington following his nomination hearing
in June, Stith's 19-year-old son, Percy, led the cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is an original,'' says his longtime friend Ira
Jackson, executive vice president of BankBoston. ``He's flashy and
he's quotable and he certainly is notable. He ain't perfect, but he
sure is effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him operate in a number of venues and it's not obvious
unless you reach across the totality of those venues to understand
the magic he works. Some in Boston say where is his congregation?
Where are his disciples? But you go to that dinner for Gene Ludwig
and you see an extraordinary cross section _ people who were
previously adversaries and even enemies brought together by this
guy's savvy and charisma and interpersonal skills. He weaves a very
interesting mosaic.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been weaving that mosaic most of his life. In second grade,
his mother, Dorothy McLean, recalls, Stith was elected king of his
grammar school. In middle school, he was president of the student
body. In high school, he ran a social club called the Egotists _
the name, he insists, was the idea of a boy named Squeaky _ and in
college he headed the black student union. He and his wife have fed
everyone from former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld to
psychiatrist Alvin Pouissant at dinners known for spirited repartee
and post-supper songfests around the piano or heated games of
Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gazing at Kilimanjaro
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irony of his posting in Tanzania is that Stith decided to
enter the ministry _ and abandon any idea he had of becoming a
laywer _ when he was a college student building churches in Kenya.
``We were starting with boulders as big as these chairs,'' he says,
sitting in one chair in his office, with his arm resting on a
second chair and his feet stretched in a third, ``and with sledge
hammers beating them into gravel so we could lay the foundation.''
Evenings, his day's work done, Stith would lie on the African
earth, watch the sunset, and gaze at Mt. Kilimanjaro in neighboring
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was while I was looking at Kilimanjaro,'' he says, ``and
thinking about what life had been like for me and what life ought
to be like that I got the calling to the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Stith brings to Africa a politics that is more
pragmatic than ideological. ``I'm much more interested in getting
something done than in making a point,'' he says. ``but sometimes
you have to make a point to create a context to get something done.
At the end of the day I want the stuff to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On various issues that have divided Boston's black community,
Stith stood on the side of caution. He opposed as economically
unfeasible a referendum calling for minority neighborhoods to
secede from Boston. He supported an appointed school board.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Stith, the elder of two sons, rarely saw his father
after his parents divorced when he was very young, but he spent
summers with his paternal grandmother, trading the relative reserve
of the Methodist or Presbyterian churches his mother favored for
the ``knockdown, drag-out, shout, fall out, revival'' exuberance of
his grandmother's Baptist church. When Stith dressed in his Sunday
best to help integrate the Fox moviehouse, his mother admonished
him not to embarrass the race.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's mother still lives in St. Louis, and his brother, James,
died a few years ago of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Stith is in the pulpit _ he still offers guest
sermons _ the preacher in him remains. It's there in the cadence of
his speech, in the way he repeats phrases for emphasis, raising or
lowering his voice or elongating his words the second time around
for even more punch. It's there in the way he leans forward and
punctuates his points with his fingers. It's there in the way he
opens a meeting about economic literacy by saying, ``There's a lot
of stuff in the Bible on eternity, but there's only one reference
about what you need to do to get there. It's what have you done for
the least among you?''

`FIRST EAGLE' IS A COMPELLING THRILLER WITH A TRIBAL TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Hillerman's and Elizabeth Peters' mysteries are like
comfort food _ they always satisfy. And when one wants an
action-packed thriller, turn to Sean Flannery to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman's ``The First Eagle'' (HarperCollins. $25. 278 pages),
featuring Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, is a very enjoyable encounter
_ nothing flashy, just a well-crafted tale.
</P>
<P>
   Chee is now acting lieutenant in the Navajo Tribal Police, from
which Leaphorn has just retired. One day he comes across Hopi eagle
poacher Jano, who is huddled over the body of a tribal policeman.
There is blood on the Hopi, who says he got it when trapping an
eagle. But the eagle in the nearby cage has no blood on it, so Chee
arrests Jano and charges him with murder. The district attorney
agrees that it's an open-and-shut case and plans to ask for the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a wealthy woman from Santa Fe asks Leaphorn to look
into the disappearance of her niece, biologist Catherine Pollard,
who was on a field assignment to collect fleas from potentially
plague-carrying rodents in the same area where Jano was arrested
and on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Leaphorn goes to Chee to exchange information and
once again the two are working together. Meanwhile, Chee's former
fiancee, Janet Pate, returns from Washington, joins the public
defender's office and gets Jano for her first case. When Pate
insists that Jano is innocent, Chee begins reinvestigating the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman's mingling of Navajo lore with modern police
techniques is artfully accomplished. His seemingly simple plot in
reality is quite intricate and totally plausible. His descriptions
of the Southwest are so vivid that one yearns for a trip to the
desert.
</P>

<P>
   ``The Ape Who Guards the Balance.'' By Elizabeth Peters.
Avon/Twilight. $24. 376 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Peter's 10th mystery featuring Egyptologists Amelia Peabody and
her husband, Radcliffe Emerson, is a pleasant enough romp, but not
the best.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready to return to the Valley of the Kings, Peabody
attends a London suffragette rally that is used as a smokescreen by
the Emersons' arch-nemesis, the Master Criminal, to rob a very
valuable collection. Later, Amelia is invited to a suffragette
meeting, but en route goons try to grab her, and Emerson runs them
off.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Cairo, their grown son Ramses, his good friend, David,
and the family's ward, Nefret, go into a seedy section of Cairo to
purchase a rare papyrus of the Book of the Dead, ``the collection
of magical spells and prayers designed to ward off the perils of
the underworld and lead the deceased into everlasting life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the transaction is completed, thieves jump into the
chamber, the three flee, run into at least one would-be assassin,
but eventually escape.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in their Luxor quarters, someone breaks into
Nefret's room and tries to steal the papyrus, but is run off. Soon
after, the body of the man who sold the papyrus is found floating
in the Nile, apparently attacked by a crocodile. But there are no
crocodiles in the Nile near Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson's fearful temper and tactless behavior lead to his being
assigned to clear out previously discovered tombs. It looks as if
the Emersons are in for a very boring winter until David and Ramses
are kidnapped, beaten, then saved by Luxor's most infamous
prostitute. Then another body is pulled from the Nile, this time a
young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is convinced the Master Criminal is behind all the evil
doings. But other evil forces are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Peters' witty writing and her cast of outrageous characters move
the story along at a brisk pace. Her descriptions of Luxor and the
Valley of the Kings is very visual. The plot is a bit thin, but
still fun.
</P>
<P>
   (FYI: The title refers to the god Thoth, ``the little baboon who
protects the scales used to weigh such precious commodities as
hearts and souls.'')

</P>
<P>
   ``Achilles Heel.'' By Sean Flannery. Forge. $24.95. 351 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery's latest geo-political thriller is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military intelligence analyst Bill Lane thought he had
killed ex-KGB agent Valeri Vernin, aka the Surgeon. But a
voice-recognition test of an intercepted telephone call from
Karachi is a 98 percent match for Vernin.
</P>
<P>
   In the Barents Sea, Russia's dumping ground for nuclear
reactors, a crew prepares to scuttle a Romeo-class sub, an
explosion occurs and the sub sinks with all hands aboard.
</P>
<P>
   But Lane believes the sinking was a ruse and the sub is up for
sale. He gets a Russian Embassy official in Washington to give him
an introduction to a high-ranking official at their embassy in
London. Posing as a South African arms dealer, Lane makes an offer
for the sub and is told they'll get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   When British intelligence figures out what Lane is up to, they
want to throw him out, but eventually end up working with him. One
of the British agents is his lover, Lt. Comdr. Francis Shipley, who
will eventually be captured by Vernin.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery's characters are believable, both the good and bad
guys. The plot is well-designed, the dialogue crisp, and the pacing
speedy. Flannery is one of the top writers in his genre.

 BOSTON: ... among you.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The preacher in him is also there in the way Stith thinks of
providence, most dramatically in the way he talks _ and preaches _
about the lingering impact of his brush with death when he was shot
in the chest at age 13. A friend had beckoned him to an alley near
his home where another boy had a gun. It's unloaded, the boy
assured as he pulled the trigger. The bullet just missed Stith's
heart. That night in the hospital, Stith heard a doctor tell his
mother he would probably be dead by morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear I could have been killed,'' he says. ``That I
wasn't really speaks to this kind of sense of responsibility and
destiny to do the stuff I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A subdued spender
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as Stith considers it his calling to better the economic
conditions of the inner city _ and now of Tanzania _ he also savors
the fruits of his own success. ``I've never tried to pass myself
off as a holy man committed to a monastic style of living,'' he
says, leaning back in his favorite chair at the Four Seasons, cigar
in hand, ``but I am a man of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Stith sips vermouth over lunch at the Four Seasons, where
the doormen and waiters know him by name and where the chef
prepares dishes he requests whether or not they're on the menu. He
smokes two cigars a day. His mother taught him a boy needs his gray
trousers and blue blazer and now he is so meticulously groomed that
he dons black eyeglasses when he's wearing black or gray and
tortoise shell when he wears gold. He drives a Cadillac
convertible, top down from March until December unless it rains. He
gave up basketball for golf. When his family travels each July to
their time share condo in St. Maarten they fly first class.
</P>
<P>
   Stith's spending, however, is less grand than his taste. The
Cadillac is nine years and 104,000 miles old. His favorite store is
Filene's Basement, and he used to make the sign of an ``x'' over
clothes he liked in hopes that he could buy them later at a lower
price. The courses where he regularly golfs, Franklin Park and
Newton Commonwealth, are public. Those first-class seats are
courtesy of the frequent flyer miles he and his wife accumulate
when they travel for work. The neatly trimmed hair is courtesy of
himself and $29 barber's clippers he bought (he's self-taught
because the instructional video featured only straight-haired
blonds).
</P>
<P>
   This style, combined with his ambition and an ego that his
longtime friend Rev. Joseph Washington, now a pastor in New
Rochelle, N.Y., laughs ``doesn't suffer from any malignancy or
disease,'' earns Stith his critics. He's been faulted for being out
of touch with urban youth, too connected to downtown and too
interested in his own stature. Stith shrugs at the criticism.
``Look,'' he laughs, ``if they crucified Jesus and assassinated
Martin, who's going to escape? Who's going to escape?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fence-mending Rev. Eugene Rivers (``Is it legal for
me to say something nice about Charles or is it illegal?''), a
staunch critic who's been known to mimic Stith smoking a cigar,
says, ``Charles Stith is one of the most brilliant and accomplished
brokers on behalf of the black community that we have had over the
last 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith's day begins at 4:30 or 5 a.m. when he rises with the sun,
and a few mornings a week he and his son, Percy, are on the golf
course at 6 a.m. ``Golf,'' Stith says, ``is the closest thing to a
zen-like experience in sports. You're ultimately playing against
yourself and the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Every morning Stith reads several newspapers _ Boston Globe,
Boston Herald, New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal,
Financial Times and International Herald Tribune _ and then he
reads from the Bible, a habit learned at the Interdenominational
Theological Center in Atlanta. ``A good Christian,'' he says,
``ought to read the newspaper and the Bible every day because you
get to juxtapose the temporal with the eternal.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not traveling _ he averages 15 days a month on the
road for business _ Stith spends days in his office at the back of
ONE's six-room suite, and then ``at day's end, whenever that is,
I'll make my rounds through the house, kisses all around, then
shwoosh to the third floor'' and his cigar room.
</P>
<P>
   These rooms, office and cigar room, are comfortable, lived in,
not unkempt, but certainly not as impeccable as the clothes Stith
wears. There's a stack of papers on the table in his office, and
half-hidden by them, a Bible. Stith never found a place for the
Louisville Slugger bat he got when he gave a speech in Kentucky, so
it rests against a cabinet. A hanging papier mache parrot has a
cracked head and wears the floppy bowtie a banker gave him because
Stith prefers smaller ones. In Stith's cigar room at home, a pile
of papers on Tanzania occupy the chair beside the one where he
smokes his cigar. The books lining the closet and one wall are
sometimes stacked askew.
</P>
<P>
   If any city shaped Stith intellectually and politically and
personally, then it is Atlanta, where he came in 1973 to study at
the historically black seminary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A level playing field
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everybody, whether he admitted it or not, who was in
seminary when I was in seminary wanted to be the next Martin Luther
King Jr. Everybody did,'' Stith says. ``Obviously it means
something in terms of ego, but in the most positive sense it was
that everybody wanted to play that kind of role in shaping history.
I reached a point that to ultimately be acquitted before the bar of
eternal justice I don't have to carry the burden of starting a new
movement. All I have to do is be faithful in the moment. That means
simply to do what I can how I can where I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is where Stith found an intellectual freedom that eluded
him at mostly white Baker. ``When I went to seminary I needed it,
and it was a great experience. Oh, it was a great experience,'' he
says. ``It was great to get to seminary because I could say stuff
and ... it wasn't a commentary about my humanity. It wasn't a
commentary about my race.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is the city where Stith encountered a black community,
with its large middle class, that ``almost, but not quite,''
mirrored the white community. ``It really is an affirmation of
something that all black people believe and that, quite frankly,
which most white people find unbelievable, which is if you level
the playing field black people will be all right,'' he says. ``That
really is what I've been about.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is also where, after working on Maynard Jackson's first
campaign for mayor and meeting people such as Andrew Young, Stith
first sensed that some day in the future ``I could keep counsel
with a president.'' After Jimmy Carter was elected president in
1976, ``I got to the outer edge'' because so many Georgians were
part of Carter's circle. ``By '76,'' Stith says, ``I figured
there'd get to be a point when I'd be really close.'' That point
came a decade later when he met the governor of Arkansas at a Cape
Cod weekend getaway with mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Atlanta is where Stith met a young Spelman College
senior named Deborah Prothrow in February 1975. Their courtship was
brief and intense, propelled in part by what Stith calls the
``providential'' fact that both had been admitted to Harvard, she
to the medical school and he to the divinity school. They wed in
August 1975. Asked to describe her husband, Prothrow-Stithuses
words like ``bright'' and ``humorous'' and ``hardworking,'' then
calls later to leave a message adding ``he's sexy'' to the list.

   He's the one, not she, to enjoy the thrill of jet skis. He's the
one who left his first ski lesson midstream with the words ``I get
this,'' she recalls, and bypassed the bunny hill to try a bigger
slope. The first time he ice skated he headed mid-rink to teach
himself figure eights. ``It's an intensity and drive to meet the
challenge,'' his wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Stith is also a man rooted in routine. In courtship,
Prothrow-Stith recalls, they took a bus almost daily to a
Baskin-Robbins he liked for pralines and cream ice cream. As
newlyweds they tasted Baby Watson's cheesecake in Harvard Square,
then had some every day. Now the Four Seasons is Stith's venue of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles likes very nice things and very nice places,'' says
Prothrow-Stith. ``For a black man in America, being in a nice place
that is known for its service and knows you because you have it as
a routine lessens the chances you'll be mistreated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the White House approached Stith in 1997 about the
ambassadorship, he hesitated to upset his life and his wife
immediately looked for ways to make it happen. Now the family is
getting ready for two years in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Prothrow-Stith, for the first year at least, will travel between
Boston and Tanzania. Percy will take a leave of absence from Bates
College to serve as his father's aide-de-camp, 16-year-old Mimi
will finish high school at the international school in Dar es
Salaam, and Prothrow-Stith's mother, Mildred Prothrow, will live
with them in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the agenda for these last weeks before moving includes
a new urgency to previously scheduled security training, as well as
the job of packing his golf clubs for Tanzania, along with his
replica baseball caps from the old Negro League and a framed copy
of a South African ballot from his tenure observing elections there
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stith has noted the irony of returning to the place where he
decided to enter the ministry, of going to the home of Mt.
Kilimanjaro. ``It's the opportunity to go to the other side of the
mountain,'' he says. ``At the least there's got to be a sermon in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he knows what he could not foresee when he uttered those
words, that any sermon he culls from his experiences in Tanzania
will come in a city devastated by the terrorist attack. ``It really
does punctuate for me something that has been at the core of how
I've tried to live my life,'' he says. ``You have to have a sense
of urgency about the stuff you feel called to do and have an
opportunity to do because life and time are tenuous.''

<P>
   Millennium madness is upon us, but with luck and money, you
might be able avoid the wackiness surrounding the arrival of the
year 2000. (That's a year away from the actual millennium, but
people will celebrate anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons Hotel in London will be offering one special
suite to a couple who want to escape the frantic festivities of New
Year's Eve 1999 and snooze blissfully into 2000. The ninth-floor
Park Suite will have full blackout and soundproof facilities with
all clocks and calendars removed. A special menu, inspired by
pre-1950s menus, will be offered, and black-and-white movies will
be shown in the suite. Other requests in this vein will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   The couple who place the highest bid by June 1, 1999, will
secure the peaceful room. Money offered above the published price
of the Park Suite on that date (currently the room goes for about
$1,500 US) will be donated to the British Red Cross. Good luck and
happy snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   (To bid or seek more information about this or three other
millennium packages, write after Sept. 1 to Coordinator, Four
Seasons Hotel, Hamilton Place, Park Lane, London W1A 1AZ; or

BENDER EVOKES LAUGHTER SUBDUED BY ABSURDITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FIONA LUIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GIRL IN THE FLAMMABLE SKIRT 
By Aimee Bender 
Doubleday, 184 pp., $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the opening to ``The Rememberer,'' the first story in
Aimee Bender's gut-wrenching collection of stories: ``My lover is
experiencing reverse evolution. I tell no one. I don't know how it
happened, only that one day he was my lover and the next he was
some kind of ape. It's been a month and now he's a sea turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   This bizarrely comic tale would be rib-splittingly funny save
for the simple fact that Bender breaks your heart. Her stories have
a way of tenderly dissecting the fragility of the wounded human
spirit; in the process of their telling, you ache for each lost
character and looted soul. When the narrator in ``The Rememberer''
drives her lover, by then a ``one-celled wonder,'' to the beach to
release him into the waves, Bender lulls you into a state of
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Each story has a way of peering in on a character lost in a
labyrinth, and it is to Bender's abiding credit that each puzzle
compels rather than repels. Even with a protagonist who teeters on
the edge _ the disturbed heiress of ``Call My Name,'' who auditions
men with sexual abandon _ Bender manages to evoke sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Terse, at times twisted, embodiments of loss ensure that none of
the stories verges on the banal. ``Marzipan'' is a perfect example.
``One week after his father died,'' says the child narrator, ``my
father woke up with a hole in his stomach. It wasn't a small hole,
some kind of break in the skin, it was a hole the size of a soccer
ball and it went all the way through. You could now see behind him
like he was an enlarged peephole.''
</P>
<P>
   The child's mother then becomes pregnant, and nine months later
gives birth to her own mother. Trauma is elevated into the realm of
the absurd and fantastic, yet it transforms itself eventually into
a universe not without dignity and redemption. Through it all, a
child attempts to make sense of a world turned on its head, of a
family rent asunder. Maintaining that point of view, Bender knows,
is critical, and she renders it with justice.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Quiet Please,'' another sorrowful sojourn into the
landscape of loss, a librarian has sex with every man who comes
into her library on the day she is told her father has died. When
chaos ensues in the library and the quiet is ruptured, she is held
aloft by a muscleman; upon his shoulders she stands, comically
retouching with a pencil a mural of dancing fairies painted on the
library's ceiling. Though her grief expresses itself in the
grotesque, the heart-rending close to the story is pure Bender:
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't notice until the next day, when she comes to work
to clean up the books an hour before her father is put into the
ground, that the circle of fairies is altered now. That the
laughing ones now pull along one fairy with purple eyes, who is
clearly dancing against her will, dragged along with the circle,
her mouth wide open and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a shared skin in all Bender's characters, an ethos of
longing fused with aloneness, that make them so appealing. In
``Legacy,'' a pregnant girl falls in love with the hunchback
step-uncle who gives her shelter, only to tumble out of love when
his deformity is unmasked as a fake hump filled with injected fat
globules. Refracting life's absurd reasonings through a prism of
the bizarre is a specialty of this young author.
</P>
<P>
   Bender's taut prose works its wise melodies throughout this
debut first collection, which despite its seeming simplicity is not
a book to breeze through. Each short story packs quite a hefty
punch, and each should be savored. From cleverly comic to starkly
surreal, Bender's audacious characters surprise and delight.
Sometimes, they even make you weep.

INSURANCE BATTLE IS OVER, BUT IS THE WAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A long-awaited insurance industry tax-cut bill signed
into law Monday is designed to help Massachusetts cast off its
image as one of the least competitive places in the nation for
insurance companies. But while the tax break is a boon to insurers
headquartered in the state, it is unlikely to encourage bigger
industry players, which are based outside Massachusetts, to do
business here.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci signed legislation that grants $48
million a year in tax relief to Massachusetts-based insurers in
exchange for $200 million in investment commitments to low-income
communities over five years. In the works for years, the law
effectively means that Massachusetts is no longer the only state in
the nation to tax insurers headquartered here at rates above those
levied on out-of-state competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it offers insurers of any provenance a 1.5 percent
tax credit for making extra community investments, the new law may
not be enough to entice out-of-state insurers into the
Massachusetts market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that the larger companies will seek to do more
business in Massachusetts,'' said Sean F. Mooney, an analyst at Guy
Carpenter, a reinsurance firm in New York. He cited prohibitive
regulations not repealed by the new tax cuts, including a provision
requiring new companies to cover problem customers, such as drivers
with poor records, at a proportionately greater rate than small
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   With $17 billion in all kinds of premiums, Massachusetts' entire
insurance industry accounts for 2.7 percent of the national total
of $634 billion, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the top-selling national firms, such as State Farm
and All-State, has a large presence in the state. Some are not here
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the new tax law, there are a host of reasons.
Massachusetts is the only state in the country where legislators,
not the market, set auto premiums. Regulations dating back to the
1970s reward small, start-up insurers and penalize larger,
out-of-state firms. Only 30 percent of all insurance sold in
Massachusetts is written directly by providers rather than sold
through agents, compared to 70 percent nationwide. Agency-sold
premiums cost more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about insurance money, you're talking
about what companies have to do to keep their commitments to
policyholders,'' said Stephen Broadie of the Alliance of American
Insurers, a trade group. ``It's important that the money be
invested in safe investments with reasonable yields.'' The new law
phases out a passel of taxes that were among the highest in the
nation, including a 14 percent net investment income tax paid by
state-based life insurers, and a 1 percent investment income tax
and premium surtaxes, both paid by state-based property and
casualty insurers.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for tax relief, life insurers and property and
casualty insurers (the latter as a group) must each collectively
invest $100 million in two funds that will finance low-income
housing and disdavantaged businesses. Under the new law, insurers
that decide the tax breaks are not worth it are not forced to
contribute to the fund. But Thomas E. Maloney, chief financial
officer at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., said most
companies would opt for the tax breaks, which he said would improve
their bottom line even after the investment commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The tax package may not inspire large insurers but it has
encouraged community advocates, who want to see the industry invest
more in poor areas. ``Insurance companies ought to invest in the
neighborhoods in which they sell premiums,'' said Alan J. Fishbein,
general counsel at the Center for Community Change, a
Washington-based community advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Industry participants counter that insurers can ill afford to
use policyholders' money to invest in riskier projects.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of mergers among financial institutions, community
advocates have turned up the heat on insurance companies to secure
bigger investment commitments to poor regions. The strategy has
worked well with banks, which are required by law to meet the
credit needs of the communities they serve. But it has been tougher
with insurance companies, which have argued that they are
structurally different from banks. A California proposal to force
insurers to invest a percentage of premiums in poor areas failed
last April in the state's legislature.

opens Tuesday on the grounds of the Mashantucket Reservation in the
otherwise rural Thames River valley. At over 300,000 square feet,
and at a cost that surely exceeds, and may double, the original
estimate and current announced figure of $135 million, the
Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center is a monument to two
very different groups. It celebrates the ancestors of the tiny _
300-plus members _ but wealthy Pequots, and also the scattered
millions of other Indians in America north of Mexico. The visual
displays, and they are enormous, are about Pequots. The research
institution will be a study space for everyone from children in
elementary school (in their own center) to visiting scholars, who
will be given office space in the adult library. Reference
materials on all Native Americans will be collected and made
available.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, it is all a monument to the Foxwoods Casino and
Resort, buildings that rise like the Wizard of Oz's Emerald City
above the second-growth forest that dominates the hilly landscape.
The museum, with its own entrance road off Connecticut Route 2, is
just a half-mile from the dollar slot machines, but keeps its
distance. Visitors could come and go unaware of the funding source,
did not the hotel tower rise a dozen stories above the treetops,
gleaming in purple and green architectural accents setting off the
expanse of glass sliding doors that open to the guest room
balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of dollars for a museum seems almost unreal
in an age when just putting a new roof on the Peabody Museums at
Harvard took more than 10 years of white-knuckled fund-raising
effort. But to watch dozens of gamblers drop silver dollars and
quarters in the half-acre of slots (much more popular than the
nearby quarter-acre of card tables) at 9 on a weekday morning is to
understand that millions for research is achievable in just a few
years of dedicated effort at the one-buttoned (no longer are they
one-armed) bandits by middle-aged and senior citizens with time on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to understand the museum as a public space
is to follow along on a walk through the halls. The museum, created
by committee of Pequot elders and various architectural and
information companies, does not have a single spokesperson; it
speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The public viewing falls into two very distinct media or
concepts, both dictated by the sad fact that the Pequot culture is,
except for Colonial-era accounts by European settlers, completely
lost. The language is known only from a few word lists. The
material culture consists of no more than some durable stone tools
and a few objects, including a canoe, providentially preserved by
immersion in an anaerobic swamp. The social culture, kept alive by
story-telling, tends to stop remembering things much before the
19th century. That said, the exhibits in the museum are almost
entirely re-creations, either in three-dimenional, life-size
sculpture gardens full of Pequots, or they are pieces of culture
documented, amplified, explained on reactive, if not truly
interactive, television monitors. The electronic museum, although
overshadowed by the scale of the physical museum, sets a new
standard for user-operated media.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning, in all senses of the word, three-dimensional
exhibits are highlighted by a walk-through, half-acre, 16th-century
Pequot village. If the reader would recall either the standard
museum table-top dioramas, or the equally common
viewed-through-the-glass depictions of life-size Native Americans
doing interesting things _ frozen forever with the knife poised
above the deer's thorax or with the stone perpetually stopped in
mid-stroke as it grinds corn _ and then could imagine the dioramas
blown up to life-size (or the viewer shrunk to the size of a
beetle), but everything still as immobile, unmoving, and silent as
department store mannequins, he or she will get some idea of the
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Natural-size or monumental statues (think of the bronze Indian
forever aiming his arrow at the sky outside the Museum of Fine Arts
in Boston) constitute a genre we are all familiar with. The viewer
does not expect the archer's arms to tire, the back to itch, the
foot to cramp. Much the same is true with the miniature dioramas or
the realistic, authentically dressed, statuesque Indian figures in
a large museum exhibit. In both cases, the bodies inside the
clothing will be stylized, and the glass itself is a powerful
barrier, an insuperable threshold, between the viewer and the
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequot village dispenses with the glass barrier. The visitor
walks through a community of some 20 dwellings, past more than 100
silent figures. One is, of course, not supposed to touch, but with
the glass gone, one is also terribly aware of the true nature of
the exhibit's humanoid Native Americans, that they are somehow less
realistic the more accurate they appear.
</P>
<P>
   We accept the conventions of art, whether miniature, like the
figures in Keats's ``Ode on a Grecian Urn,'' or full-size, say,
Rodin's ``Burghers of Calais.'' There is a charm and a real
poignancy in the experience of art, as in Keats describing the boy
pursuing the girl on the Grecian urn, and neither losing, nor
getting:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
</P>
<P>
   Though winning near the goal _ yet, do not grieve;
</P>
<P>
   She cannot fade, though thou has not thy bliss,
</P>
<P>
   For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pequot village, although devoid of amorous persons, does
resemble Shelley's little town on the urn, ``thy streets forever
more will silent be.'' There are sounds, an astonishingly realistic
multi-speaker stereo system brings the sounds of a summer woodland
echoing through the paths in the village _ gulls mewing, crows
squabbling, echos and responses of songbirds. It is the plastic
Pequots who are, necessarily but eerily, silent.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to predict how visitors, especially children,
will react to the major dioramas. A woodland scene, with only two
persons, is a remarkable recreation of everything from blades of
grass to a choir of birds on a verdant, unruined branch. Another
huge diorama with dozens of early Pequots (or at least, early
occupants of New England) killing caribou is somehow more realistic
than the Pequot village. There are two possible reasons: both the
caribou and the human beings are covered with pelts, natural or
sewn together. This is not trivial, for it takes the viewer's eyes
away from body parts and allows one to concentrate on the total
effect of the hunting diorama. The Pequots in the village, captured
in mid-summer weather and activities, are minimally but decently
dressed, and the sheer footage of faux skin is noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   And both the hunting scene and the woodland scene are
accompanied by really user-friendly interpretative video programs
... touching the screen allows the viewer to do everything from
look at the diorama from each side in turn to calling up a film of
a modern Native American caribou hunt, to pulling down an interview
with an archeologist on how science tries to recreate such a
powerful tableau from just a few fragments of bone and shards of
stone left scattered on the ground some 10 or 11 thousand years
ago. The televised, reactive, information mediates between the
viewer and the exhibit. It provides not just information, but
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequot Village as a walk-through is powerfully close, and if
that is the intent, it works. The head, both the facial features
and skull shape of each individual Pequot mannequin, is in a
certain sense of the word, perfectly authentic. The faces are based
on life masks, plus careful measurements of the necks and skulls of
actual Native Americans. The examples come from tribes across
America. The donors, so to speak, of the faces were also measured
minutely from head to toe and down each arm, and when it came time
to put a head on a body, the sculptors hired live models whose
bodies very closely approximated the face-donors's individual
physiques.
</P>
<P>
   It will not matter to a visitor that the young woman emptying
garbage on the village dump has a head from say, the Northern
Cheyenne reservation in Montana on top of the body of a Caucasian
art student picking up some extra cash in New York City. What will
matter is that the search for perfection, for absolute realism,
only emphasises the fact that visitors are looking at a replica.
There is no artistic sense, no illusion created by technique, to
elevate the mannequins above what they are. And they are very
elegantly posed and copied bodies with a distinct and unvarying
brown covering that somehow does not resemble skin anymore than,
and perhaps less than, a patina-coated bronze mimics flesh.
</P>
<P>
   None of this may matter to children, surely the audience for
whom the Pequot Village will have the most appeal. It is a question
of suspending disbelief. To innocent eyes, the super-realism of the
Pequot village will encourage belief. The immediacy of the figures,
close enough to touch although that is strictly discouraged, will
probably overcome their patent artifice. It certainly should be
popular, it takes the successful attraction of a good wax museum to
a new level of scale and complexity. It will certainly make
visitors, of any age or background, think about the museum
experience.

FOR MALDEN MILLS, A PAINFUL FIGHT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Jan. 23, 1996, and the president of the United States was
addressing Congress and the nation in his annual State of the Union
message. The end of ``big government'' and the virtues of
traditional values were the topics of the night. Monica had not yet
entered the lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the gallery, seated strategically behind Hillary Rodham
Clinton, was Aaron Feuerstein, the owner of Malden Mills who had
just emerged as a national hero a month earlier for his pledge to
rebuild his burned out Methuen, Mass. complex against all odds.
President Clinton never mentioned Feuerstein by name that night,
but the White House invitation helped focus the nation on the mill
owner and the message of hope he represented.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, as they say. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Running a textile mill in a world of cut-throat competition can
be a dicey business, even for a national hero. Feuerstein's Malden
Mills Industries Inc. has been losing millions of dollars, and the
company's lead lender, BankBoston Corp., put pressure on Feuerstein
to make changes, says a person familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Malden Mills executives became
uncomfortable enough to explore moving the $120 million &UR;  &LR; credit
line to another lender, the person says. Malden Mills executives
have met with several other institutions, including Congress
Financial Corp., an asset-based lender, as late as last week.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston and Feuerstein said Monday they expect their 30-year
relationship to continue. ``The Bank of Boston is remaining with
us, and we are remaining with them,'' Feuerstein said. ``We are
treating them right, and they are treating us right.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Feuerstein said his company is ``now in the process of
restructuring our entire credit facility.'' But the effort
apparently has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Since rebuilding the mill after a devastating December 1995
fire, Feuerstein has grown his business based on the mill's popular
Polartec products, fabrics known for their insulating qualities and
sold to companies such as Eddie Bauer and Lands' End, which use
them to make clothing.
</P>
<P>
   That unit has done well, but Malden Mills' others have not,
despite investing tens of millions of dollars in them. Last winter
the company said it would &UR;  &LR; abandon &UR;  &LR; its velvet upholstery unit, a
move that cost about 300 jobs, and it never really returned to its
low-end upholstery, or ``flock,'' business after the fire, despite
what Feuerstein called several ``false starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems have led to big losses. Malden Mills lost roughly
$20 million in the &UR;  &LR; fiscal year &UR;  &LR; ending last October and is
projecting a loss of roughly $17 million this year, said &UR;  &LR; the
person familiar with the figures. The company said it would be
profitable, excluding the units that were being phased out,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein says those numbers are wrong, but he declined to
provide his own. ``Malden Mills is a privately held company and we
have never released details on our financial information,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has made a big bet on Malden Mills. The bank has
about $55 million of the $120 million Malden Mills loan, with
NationsBank Corp., State Street Corp., and others holding smaller
pieces, the source said. BankBoston executives were surprised at
Malden Mills' financial condition at the end of the last fiscal
year, and the loan was shifted into the bank's asset-based lending
group, which oversees higher-risk loans, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's unit worked with Malden Mills to finance the
company's seasonal Polartec business, but it also suggested some
conditions that Feuerstein found objectional, the person said.
Among them: asking Feuerstein to pledge his personal assets and his
own stock in the company to the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Over at least the last month, Malden Mills executives, including
chief financial officer Wesley Rydin and board member David
Ferrari, who works with troubled companies, have been talking to
other lenders. Among those institutions is Congress Financial,
which sometimes provides financing to struggling companies like
Grossman's and Rich's Department Stores. Edward I. Shifman Jr., who
heads Congress' Boston office, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The source says there were differences in opinion within
BankBoston on how hard to press Malden Mills. BankBoston's
chairman, Charles K. Gifford, eventually weighed in on Feuerstein's
side, and the issues that were objectionable to Feuerstein were
eventually changed.
</P>
<P>
   Said Feuerstein: ``As for me personally, there never was, is, or
will be a personal guarantee or pledge of stock.''
</P>
<P>
   A BankBoston spokeswoman said, ``We are working with Aaron and
his team, and beyond that we don't comment on our relationship with
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein is optimistic about the future of his company, which
employs more than 2,000 people. ``We are looking forward to a good,
strong, and healthy '99.''

GOP AD MAY AID DEMOCRATIC FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans believe they may have a chance this year to put
a dent in the labor movement by wresting back at least one of two
Massachusetts congressional seats they are targeting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 congressional seats in the Bay State, all held by
Democrats, the GOP has its sights on the 6th District seat held by
US Representative John F. Tierney of Salem and the 3rd District
seat held by US Representative John P. McGovern of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney and McGovern became congressmen two years ago by
defeating two GOP incumbents, Peter Torkildsen and Peter Blute.
During their first terms, the two Democrats demonstrated a full
support for labor's agenda, according to the Massachusetts AFL-CIO,
the 400,000-member umbrella organization for unions in the Bay
State.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP apparently feels that Tierney and McGovern have strong
Republican opponents this year. The Republicans view their GOP
candidate for McGovern's seat, State Senator Matthew J. Amorello of
Grafton, as popular enough in his district to upset McGovern's bid
for a second term. They also see Torkildsen as strong enough to
unseat Tierney this year in their third matchup. Torkildsen
defeated Tierney in their first meeting and Tierney won a close
race against Torkildsen two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's race, campaign reports show that Tierney is
comfortably ahead of Torkildsen in fund-raising, and is considered
to have an edge thus far among voters. But Tierney's supporters
feel that the election is still too close for them to feel assured
of victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern supporters believe that their candidate is doing well
thus far against Amorello, but they are aware that the GOP
apparently feels McGovern is vulnerable enough for the Republicans
to spend money on behalf of Amorello's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the state GOP recently developed a campaign
advertisement, scheduled to be aired later this weekcharging that
the Massachusetts congressional delegation is doing a poor job of
bringing tax dollars to the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, state GOP chairwoman Jean Inman criticizes McGovern,
a member of the House transportation committee, when she says that
the Bay State was the only state to have its highway funds cut by
Congress. Inman stated that the funds were cut by $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also charges that Tierney voted against the Highway Funds
bill. Ironically, the ad may end up helping more than hurting
McGovern's and Tierney's candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern received unexpected support from a top Republican, US
Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shuster contradicted
Inman's claim, stating that Massachusetts this year is actually
going to receive $488 million, or $105 million more in highway
funds than last year.
</P>
<P>
   As quoted in the Worcester Telegram, Shuster said the $1.1
billion ``Big Dig,'' namely the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel
project, was a ``one-time deal, an understanding. There is no
question about it. Both Democrats and Republicans can agree on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's response, of course, won praise from the Democratic
candidates and outrage from the executive director of the state
GOP, Marc DeCourcey, who described Shuster's remarks as ``a lot of
Washington gobbledygook.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Tierney campaign said that with this ad,
the state Republican Party ``shot themselves in the foot.'' Tierney
said he voted against the bill because in it the GOP had cut
programs for the elderly and for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the GOP compared its current ad campaign to the
AFL-CIO ad campaign in 1996 that targeted Torkildsen and Blute.
Most political strategists agree that these ads helped Tierney and
McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early reactions, this year's GOP ad may help Tierney
and McGovern retain their seats.

   The controversy over who should start apparently split the
Brazilian team, according to an interview with Dunga to be
published in France Football magazine. After Ronaldo fainted the
morning of the game, many of his teammates thought he had died.
Understandably, even the most spiritually oriented of them expected
to have Edmundo in the lineup instead of a reincarnated Ronaldo
against France.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the game, Edmundo was listed to start. What
occurred after that is a mystery. But whatever led to Brazil's
collapse deserves to be better explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo probably should not have played, just as Robert Baggio
should not have performed for Italy in the 1994 final. But the
magnitude of Brazil's failure raised many questions. Possibly,
Dunga, who was vacationing in Miami while preparing to return to
Japan, will clarify some issues.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
He's not there yet
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo cut short his vacation in Cancun after a report that his
mother could be a target for kidnappers. Ronaldo is an excellent
striker and an interesting personality, but he is not the
multitalented performer that Pele was, and he should not be
presented as a savior. He is in many ways still an innocent
youngster. In Mexico, Ronaldo was pictured swimming with his
fiancee, Susana Werner, and a dolphin, still exuding
gregariousness.
</P>
<P>
   At least Inter realizes this break is healthy for Ronaldo, and
he is not expected to report to practice until later this month.
Meanwhile, Inter begins Champions Cup play tomorrow against Skonto
Riga of Latvia in Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Latvians, Danes, and Hungarians are still
allowed to participate in the tournament. Super League proponents
would shut out anyone except the most glamorous clubs, regardless
of merit.
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Berlusconi, Leo Kirch, Rupert Murdoch, and the Saudi
Arabian prince Al Waleed Bin Talal would like to finance such a
Super League, through the J.P. Morgan investment bank of New York.
They want to dominate the competition, creating a monopoly using
the American sports franchising model.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, soccer is structured in an egalitarian way and will
resist such steamroller attempts. FIFA and the continental
federations are often criticized for their Machiavellian politics,
but at least their structure is democratic. The Union des
Associations Europeennes de Football was founded on the basic
principles of fairness and meritocracy, which includes promotion
and relegation. If the Berlusconis and Murdochs are in charge, we
will have sports dictatorships, and the definition of entertainment
and sporting activity will become further skewed to the advantage
of the ultra-rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (UEFA) won't back is a hand-picked competition on the
basis on size, reputation and status,'' Alex Fynn, an advertising
executive who helped set up the European Champions League, told the
Independent on Sunday. ``That would be outlawed by UEFA and FIFA,
so players wouldn't be able to play for their national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlusconi is a genuine fan, in his way, but he's an American
fan. Even promotion and relegation is too risky for him. The
mistake he makes is that this isn't the NFL or NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Win or else?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pressure has been relieved from Gigi Simoni, the
Inter coach. Simoni proved himself last year, when he was required
to win his opening match against Brescia or risk being fired by
Inter president Massimo Moratti, then nearly overcame Juventus in
the championship race. But there are more demanding presidents in
soccer. After defending Yugoslav champion Obilic tied newly
promoted Miliciner, 0-0, Saturday, Zeljko Raznjatovic fired the
coach, Okuka. Actually, the firing was carried out by Raznjatovic's
rock star wife, who is officially president while Raznjatovic is
being investigated for suspected war crimes in Croatia. Obilic is
expected to have a new coach by tomorrow, when it visits Bayern
Munich in a Champions League match.
</P>

<P>
   Where Edmundo will be tomorrow is uncertain. He is supposed to
report to Fiorentina, but there is a chance he will play for Vasco
da Gama in the Copa Libertadores final against Barcelona of
Guayaquil in Rio de Janeiro. The Copa Libertadores winner will meet
Real Madrid for the Intercontinental championship in Japan in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Like the European Champions Cup, the Copa Libertadores is on the
verge of change. The Libertadores is a fascinating competition but
it involves only 10 South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of the Copas MercoNorte and MercoSur, the
South American Confederation is hoping to encompass the CONCACAF
region. This could be a profitable move for both confederations.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is already in place for expansion, and the US is
projected to play a big part. The CONCACAF Champions Cup begins
tonight at RFK Stadium, with D.C. United representing the MLS.
Mexican clubs Cruz Azul, Leon, and Toluca, plus Costa Rica's
Alajeula and Saprissa are also entered. United will open against
the Trinidad and Tobago representative, Joe Public.
</P>
<P>
   United is also entered in the MercoNorte tournament, starting
Sept. 6, in a group with Alianza (Peru), Barcelona (Ecuador), and
Millionarios (Colombia).
</P>
<P>
   One CONCACAF team from these competitions and the Cup Winners
Cup will qualify for the first World Club tournament, sponsored by
FIFA, next year.

   France's season opened with fears that the league will continue
to export its most talented players. A total of 84 French players
were registered in first-division clubs outside the country. The
addition of Brazilian striker Adailton, Nigerian midfielder
Augustine Okocha, and German defender Christian Worns (Paris
Saint-Germain), plus Portuguese defender Oceano (Toulouse) is not
enough to compensate for the exodus. Olympique Marseille opened
with a 2-0 victory, but Paris Saint-Germain lost, 3-1, at Bordeaux,
and defending champion Lens lost, 3-2, at Toulouse. World Cup
champions Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira led Arsenal to a 3-0
win over Manchester United, the Gunners' first victory in England's
Charity Shield since 1953 ... African football remains in a
quandary over its teams' disappointing performance at France '98.
``The plain fact is that Africa is further behind Europe and South
America than it was four, or even eight, years ago,'' noted
Emmanuel Maradas, editor of African Soccer magazine. The pattern of
corruption and incompetence must be broken for African teams to
advance. This will require individuals of great courage and
credibility. Maradas said the future must be entrusted to former
players such as Cameroonian goalkeeper Joseph Antoine-Bell and
Nigerian defender Stephen Keshi, who retired soon after USA '94.

SO FAR, FOOTBALL ISN'T DRAINING CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For what it's worth, CBS Corp. is making a bunch of money, even
though it ponied up an exorbitant amount of cash for the rights to
broadcast AFC games for the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not clear how much CBS Sports is costing the
company, one thing is known: CBS said its second-quarter revenue
jumped 16 percent to $1.48 billion from $1.28 billion. Earnings
rose fourfold to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, CBS lost $11 million during the same period,
according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround is the result of increased earnings from CBS's
radio division, which has grown since acquiring Infinity
Broadcasting in 1996 and was aided by the purchase of American
Radio Systems during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from television rose 5 percent to $69 million,
CBS said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's return to the NFL came with a hefty price tag: $500
million per year. At the time of the purchase, CBS officials said
they would in essence squeeze local affiliates, such as WBZ in
Boston, to help offset costs.
</P>
<P>
   That plan became clear last spring at CBS's annual spring
affiliates meeting in Los Angeles. The network sought as much as
$50 million from its affiliates, but under the agreement, the
affiliates will give up $27 million of the roughly $200 million in
compensation the network pays them to carry its programs.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates also will give back to CBS an advertising spot
during ``Late Show with David Letterman'' and two more during
``This Morning'' to sell on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the network will give each affiliate one spot in
prime time every night to sell on the local level, where they can
earn the highest rates. Industry analysts estimate those coveted
prime-time spots amount to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports president Sean McManus repeated last week that CBS
will not lose money on the NFL. ``We are ahead of schedule,''
McManus said, referring to advertising revenue secured thus far for
the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Duquette discourse
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette was a little feisty when
asked by Gene Lavanchy on ``Sports Xtra'' in Boston about the
perception that he doesn't get along with big-time talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pay the dough, they will come,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette didn't break new ground on Mo Vaughn's contract talks,
saying the team will revisit the situation when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Lavanchy came away with a generally positive assessment of the
much-maligned general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the guy some credit,'' Lavanchy said. ``He
did bring a number of players here that have worked out well.
(Bret) Saberhagen comes readily to mind.''

ANN BEATTIE'S 36-STORY EFFORT IS TOO MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
PARK CITY 
Ann Beattie (Alfred A. Knopf, $25) 
 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad news about Ann Beattie.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle. That's all I have to say about ``Park City,'' a
collection of 36 of Ann Beattie's stories, including eight new
ones. I can't finish it. I just can't. I've tried and tried, but I
am going to have to give in.
</P>
<P>
   I've read maybe half of it, in fits and starts, and I couldn't
much tell you one story from another. Full disclosure compels me to
acknowledge that the day after I got the book, my wife had a baby,
so I've been a little distracted.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think it would have mattered. It's the stories.
Every single one seems just a variation on a theme:
</P>
<P>
   Tracy either lives in New York or is a graduate student at an
Eastern college, never named but clearly Yale, because the story
takes place 25 years ago in New Haven, Conn. A man named Steve has
the hots for her, but they never have slept together. Tracy has,
however, slept with most of Steve's friends, which drives him to
various forms of distraction.
</P>
<P>
   They work at jobs that are never described. Mostly they sit
around the living room of his apartment and smoke joints and drink
wine and notice tiny little details about each other _ he notes
that she has stopped painting her fingernails and started chewing
them to the quick; she senses that he no longer showers daily.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to put the moves on her, constantly plots a way to do
so but never gets around to it. She continues to disappoint him by
not making a play for him, and talks about her other boyfriends, at
least one of whom wears a leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It's cold outside. Occasionally Steve gets mugged. A friend has
left her husband and lives with their daughter. The story ends with
Tracy and Steve walking to a corner bar, or Tracy going off with
some other guy. And then it begins again, under a different title,
only now it's Margot and Harold.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say the stories are bad. It's just that after
however many in a row, who could possibly care?
</P>
<P>
   I've liked other things Beattie's written, and I know she has a
keen eye for detail and affairs of the heart and all that, but
please. Couldn't just every once in a while a tree fall on a house
or something?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am too young to appreciate sitting in living rooms
talking about old flames from 25 years ago with a wine buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the second half of the book may be full of plague and
pestilence, for all I know. But I just don't think I can do the
work to find out.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still interested in reviewing books. But I just can't do
this one. At least not for a while. I've got to read something else
to get out of the '70s-relationship rut. &QL;

CULLORS AWAITS HIS CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems everyone wants to hear that Derrick Cullors is
frustrated about not getting the ball much this preseason. They
want stories of him fighting with coaches, having problems with
teammates, running his mouth to the media. They won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors has been pushed to the back of the line so many times in
his football career that he hardly remembers the view from the
front. He's been criticized for his attitude and chastised for his
reputation, so the only opinion he remembers is his own.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the ink still fresh from his rags-to-riches story of
last year, when he fought from preseason bench-warmer to postseason
starter, curiosity is growing about his role this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors took the roughest path to the starting lineup and was
there for the Patriots when they needed him most; so how will he
take getting passed over for the starting running back position by
someone such as Sedrick Shaw or Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll approach this like last year,'' Cullors said. ``I was way
back in the hunt as far as running backs were concerned and then I
was starting by the end of the year. That's all. As long as I stay
positive, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors, who carried the ball only twice but gained 24 yards in
Sunday's 28-0 loss to the Vikings, made a big impact last year.
With injuries to Curtis Martin and Dave Meggett, the Patriots found
themselves in a situation not unlike today's _ wondering who will
step up and run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors made light of the question late last year, earning his
first start in the season finale at Miami and rushing 22 times for
86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing today with Derrick was that we
gave him the chance to get his rhythm,'' Drew Bledsoe said after
that game. ``With the injuries we have, he's going to have to carry
the load. I think what we saw today is that he can do it and we're
going to expect him to do it from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   So why throw him to the back of the line now? Why place hope in
rookie Edwards and second-year back Shaw when you know Cullors has
come through before?
</P>
<P>
   Cullors doesn't have an answer. He never has. He's been dealing
with the question since 1994, and he still can't give a ``why,''
only a ``how'' _ how he will rise back to the top, as he has
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you get on the field, you have to make it
happen,'' Cullors says. ``You can't worry about who's going in and
who's coming out. You have to know when you're in the game, you
have to do your job, whether you get five plays or 20 plays. I'm
not going to go around saying they should start me. I'm just going
to work hard until they notice.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that work ethic that got Cullors through the injury and
insult of a tarnished tenure at Texas Christian and drove him to
complete his senior year at Murray State as the NCAA's
second-leading rusher and a first-team All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors was described as an exciting and unique runner at Texas
Christian, but an injury in the first game of the 1994 season
sidelined him for the year and put the spotlight on teammate Andre
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Cullors realized that coach Pat Sullivan was
investing in Davis _ whom he had recruited _ and would bench
Cullors _ who was wooed by the school before Sullivan's arrival. At
that point, Cullors wanted to end his football career, frustrated
by a coach who saw his talents but gave him no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   His mother persuaded him to pack his things and go to Kentucky,
where he became what some consider the best running back Murray
State ever saw. But he wasn't welcomed with open arms there,
either. Again he had to prove himself. To the school, to the team,
to head coach Houston Nutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were telling Coach Nutt that he shouldn't take Derrick
Cullors _ they said he was a bad kid and had a reputation,'' says
Steve Parker, who was sports editor of the Murray Ledger and Times
while Cullors played at Murray State. ``They said he was a problem
kid and we didn't need him. That couldn't be farther from the
truth. Only now can we look back and say he's the best the school's
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors gained All-America honors with the Racers and was voted
the Ohio Valley Player of the Year after leading the team to its
first conference title in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   He proved his worth. He proved it by raising his hand at one of
his first practices and firing up the team with a pep talk. He
proved it by suiting up for the biggest game Murray State had seen
in two decades _ against Eastern Kentucky, which came to town with
a 28-game league winning streak. Cullors could barely walk during
warmups after injuring his knee in the previous game, but he
managed to play and distract the defense, freeing his wide
receivers to lead the team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But he received another shove to the back of the line when he
wasn't chosen in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at him and they see his small size and he's not
real quick,'' says Parker. ``So they think they can do better. But
he knows this game too well. No one makes the right cut every time
and sees the field all at once. But he does.''
</P>
<P>
   That went overlooked by scouts who saw only his 5-foot-11-inch,
180-pound frame and doubted that he could withstand an NFL beating.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Cullors proved himself. He went to the Baltimore Ravens
training camp and put on a performance so impressive that it piqued
two teams' interest. Bill Parcells finally convinced Cullors he
belonged with the Patriots and picked him up as a free agent in
1996. Cullors spent the entire year on the practice squad, bulking
up to almost 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibiting his trademark patience and positive attitude, he
never complained. He worked hard and waited for the payoff. It came
Oct. 12, 1997, when he played his first NFL game, versus Buffalo.
He thought back to his arduous road and smiled. But that wouldn't
be the day he'd remember most. That day would come one month later,
when the Patriots traveled to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors took a kickoff at the 14-yard line and went to the
races. At about the 25, he started to slip. Without regard for his
proximity to the ground, he saw a hole and instinctively regained
his balance, going all the way to the end zone. It was the first
Patriot return for a touchdown since Jon Vaughn in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors may be undersized for the job of running back, but he
has shown time and again that his heart, talent, and instincts
compensate for that.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots again searching for a runner, he is forced to
prove himself once more. He still isn't angry. He knows there's
none better and he'll wait until the world realizes that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a running back ever since I started playing
football,'' Cullors said. ``That just comes naturally to me. I know
how to do this job. Coach (Pete) Carroll knows what he's doing, and
I feel like if I continue to do what I'm doing _ working hard _
they may want to extend my role. So that's what I'm going to do
every time out.''

CAPTURE THE LITTLE CHILDREN: DROPOUT MAKES FAIRY TALE A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have children and enjoy a good scare, listen again to the
legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Browning prettied it up in his 1842 poem, but the facts
(at least part of the story is true) are dark.
</P>
<P>
   In 1284, the German town of Hamelin was overrun by rats _ its
citizens stepped on them wherever they went. One day a stranger
appeared and offered to get rid of the vermin, for a fee. Hamelin's
mayor, at his wits' end, agreed. The stranger took out a flute and
began to play, and mesmerized rats poured out of the houses and
followed him to a river, where they fell into the water and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The piper returned to collect his price, but the mayor was smug
and ungrateful. He refused to pay _ what, he asked himself, could
the piper do about it? But the angry stranger took out his pipe and
again began to play, and this time the creatures who came tumbling
into the streets were the town's children, who followed the piper
into the hills and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   One historical rendition said the piper was the agent of a rival
religious authority, on a mission to steal the town's little boys.
Another said he was simply a deranged vagrant who took the children
into the hills and murdered them.
</P>
<P>
   It might be literary opportunism, but Ridley Pearson prefers the
second version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pied Piper is one of history's first recorded serial
killers,'' he says with ominous pleasure. ``Over the years it has
been turned into this lovely little fairy tale about a guy playing
his flute and running through the streets with happy children. The
fact is, he was hired to get rid of the rats and he murdered the
city's kids when he didn't get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson found the story several years ago in an encyclopedia,
and it inspired his new suspense thriller, ``The Pied Piper''
(Hyperion, $23.95), which involves babies, kidnappers and an
illegal adoption scheme. Pearson is always looking for the kernel
of an idea, and when he finds one he extrapolates _ wildly _ until
he has something he can build into a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pied Piper'' is his 11th book, the fifth featuring
recurring characters Lou Boldt, a Seattle cop with a wife and kids,
and Daphne Matthews, a criminal psychiatrist and Boldt's one-time
lover. It is long (nearly 500 pages) and painstaking in its
re-creation of police work and of his characters' lives away from
the office. As in real life, the time line is not tidy _ there are
references not only to things that have happened in the past, but
also story lines that will jump into future books. In ``The Pied
Piper,'' Boldt's wife, Liz, undergoes treatment for cancer
(Pearson's real-life model for Boldt, a Seattle cop named Don
Cameron, lost his wife to cancer two years ago), but at the end of
the book her fate remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next novel I'll deal with Boldt's feelings about his
wife's new spiritual take on things,'' Pearson says. ``I want him
to deal with real-life issues. Too much crime fiction deals only
with the cop shop. When you go out into the field and meet these
guys, as I do, you discover that 80 percent of their day is
concerned with personal stuff, as it is with any of us. Sure, they
have to deal with criminals and dead bodies, but they also have to
worry about getting little Johnny to the dentist on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also not a big fan of a series where the characters never
get any older. My publisher would like me to hold Boldt at a
younger age, but I can't. He has to age, or he's not going to be
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, 45, grew up in Connecticut. He was a big reader as a
kid, but did not try writing fiction until he was in prep school.
Rock and roll was his first love. He was a premed student at the
University of Kansas and later studied music theory at Brown
University, but dropped out of both. He spent years writing songs
and playing in a band before he realized that there was no future
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a writer, although he went the corporate route
(working in public relations at Shell Oil),'' he says. ``So one day
I was crying the blues to my mother. I said I blew it by not
getting my degree. I'm in music, which I love and could do the rest
of my life, but I only make 50 bucks a night and that's worrying
me. And our family doesn't have a shoe business I can take over. My
mother said: `Your father's a writer. Maybe you should try that.'
And a light went off in my head and I thought well, yeah, I can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time he had fallen in love with the books of John D.
MacDonald and the early fiction of Ken Follett and Robert Ludlum,
but he took a slight detour before he landed in the genre of
suspense fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed to say this, but I loved the show ``Colombo''
on television and one day I saw Peter Falk on the Johnny Carson
show and he said he was going to leave ``Colombo'' if he didn't get
better scripts. I started work on my first script the next
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote several but sold none, and began to suspect that he
would not be the one to save Falk from mediocre scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I thought maybe the odds would be better with a novel,'' he
says. ``I heard, mistakenly I'm glad to say, that there were 5,000
novels published each year and I took that to mean 5,000 (itals)
first (end itals) novels. And I thought, hey! Great odds! Much
better odds than with the movie business! I'll try a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a novel based on one of his scripts and it went
nowhere, so he wrote another and another, encouraged by an agent
who took him on. They were published, but to limited success. Then
an editor gave him Thomas Harris' ``Red Dragon'' and told him to
write a book that was as riveting as that book was. The result was
1988's ``Undercurrents'' (the first Lou Boldt novel). It wasn't
``Red Dragon,'' but it brought Pearson an audience. Two years later
he became the first American to be awarded the Raymond Chandler
Fulbright fellowship at Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I submitted my stuff and someone liked it and I was selected
to go to England,'' he says. ``There I was at Wadham College, with
the title of visiting professor. I had a corner office that
overlooked the Bodleian Library. I had dining rights at lunch to
sit with some of the finest minds in the world and talk shop. I had
High-Table privileges for dinner, which meant I sat up on a little
raised platform with people dressed in flowing black robes and
drank way too much wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a complete imposter. I (itals) was (end itals) an
imposter, because you can only wear a black robe at High Table if
you have a degree from a college. And I didn't. So for a year I ate
at High Table without a black robe. The discussions I had there I
could never have anywhere else in the world. And these illustrious
people were all thinking, who is this schmuck?''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson came home and wrote four more novels, each selling
better than the last. Today he rises early in the Idaho home he
shares with his wife and 15-month-old daughter, and puts in 12-hour
days. It takes him a little more than a year to complete a novel
(he is already talking about ``the book after next year's book'').
He plays in a band, but now it's the Rock Bottom Remainders and his
fellow musicians include Dave Barry, Stephen King and Amy Tan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his books have been optioned for films, although none
have been made yet. He submits outlines to his publisher before he
begins writing (Hyperion rejected two of his ideas but as his books
have become bestsellers he is chafing somewhat under that
agreement. He does not lack for fans at his readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one tonight, and I intend to read both the ``Publishers
Weekly'' review, which was very complimentary, and a review off of
Amazon that says I'm the worst hackneyed writer who ever came down
the pike,'' he says. ``You're always aware of your shortcomings.
They make sure of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is energetic, successful and appealingly modest. And he
thinks that someday he might just have the chance to combine his
writing and his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big dream and ambition is to write a book and write the
screenplay of the book and write the score to the movie,'' he says.
``That's what I'd really like to do. If I can get there by the time
I'm 60, I'll be elated.'' &QL;

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ZARAFA &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Allin (Walker, $22)
</P>
<P>
   In 1827, a giraffe arrived at le Jardin des Plantes in Paris,
having walked from Marseille after sailing from Egypt, a gift from
the viceroy of Egypt to King Charles X of France. The gift was a
gamble. The viceroy hoped to befriend Charles and gain France's
neutrality in Egypt's war against Greece. The ploy didn't work, but
the giraffe did _ she was the first France had seen, and the
country fell in love with her. Her walk to Paris, writes Allin, was
``a 550-mile parade'' with crowds attending her every step, coming
from vineyards and villages to marvel at ``this living mythological
combination of creatures _ a gentle and mysterious sort of horned
camel whose hump had been straightened by stretching its neck, with
legs as tall as a man and the cloven hoofs of a cow, and markings
like a leopard or a maze of lightning and that startling blue-black
snake of a twenty-inch tongue.'' This is Zarafa's story, and it's
difficult to know whether to praise it more for its
otherworldliness or for the history and people that fill its pages.
It's Allin's first book, and as odd and endearing as they come. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HELEN KELLER: A LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; Dorothy Herrmann (Knopf, $30)
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, she always will be not quite 7 years old, with
the face of Patty Duke and hands that clutch frantically at a water
pump. The scene in ``The Miracle Worker'' froze Helen Keller in
time at the moment she discovered language (after ``water,'' she
learned 29 other words that day). But her adult life was just as
intriguing as her journey from isolation to triumphant awareness.
Herrmann explores questions that were beyond the movie's reach: Was
Keller's turbulent relationship with her half-blind teacher, Annie
Sullivan, limiting or liberating? Was her beatific public persona a
front devised and managed by Sullivan to create mass appeal? How
would her life have been different if she'd had more than one
teacher, if she were less protected, if she had been permitted to
marry? It's fascinating, because so many people found transcendence
and inspiration in her triumph over disability. She was cremated
after her death, and her ashes placed next to Sullivan's in a
chapel where, to this day, schoolchildren visit her grave and learn
about her life. The place is marked by a bronze plaque, written in
Braille. So many people have touched it that it has been replaced
twice because the dots were worn away. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SIGHT-READINGS &QL; 
 &UR; Elizabeth Hardwick (Random House, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Here is Hardwick on Edith Wharton: ``(She) had her turf, that
almost forgotten sepia New York, to be turned over and over again,
like setting the plow to the family farm every spring.'' And on
Philip Roth: ``His themes are Jews in the world, especially in
Israel, Jews in the family, Jews in Newark, New Jersey; fame, vivid
enough to occasion imposters (``Operation Shylock''); literature,
since his narrators or performers are writers, actually one writer,
Philip Roth. And sex, anywhere in every manner, a penitential
workout on the page with no thought of backaches, chafings or
phallic fatigue.'' Among her other subjects: John Updike, Richard
Ford and Gertrude Stein. The essays are wonderful fun even if you
have not read half of the books she has. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE AMERICAN WAY OF DEATH REVISITED &QL; 
 &UR; Jessica Mitford (Knopf, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1963, the original edition was an unflinching and
dumbfoundingly funny look at the funeral industry and its promotion
of ornate and costly services that left survivors in financial
shock. The book wasn't an easy sell the first time (an early
response from Houghton Mifflin: ``We think that you make your book
harder to sell by going at too much length and in too gooey detail
into the process of embalming . . .''), but once it was released
the public loved it and turned toward cremation in droves as a
result of it. Mitford died in 1996, but not before she gave funeral
directors a shock of their own by embarking on this updated
edition. Now, we learn, even cremation is pricey, and mourners who
think they're dealing with independent mortuaries really might be
paying corporations that run many funeral homes. Industry insiders
called the first edition ``the Mitford war dance,'' and condemned
the fight for cheaper funerals as a ``Red plot.'' That delighted
Mitford. She ends this one with a listing of not-for-profit funeral
and memorial societies in each state. May their phones ring, and
may Mitford hear them wherever she is. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE HAND &QL; 
 &UR; Frank R. Wilson (Pantheon, $30)
</P>
<P>
   The hand, one reviewer wrote, is ``the tool of tools,'' but in
reality it is more. Wilson, a neurologist, discovered this when he
showed a video about a problem called ``musician's cramp'' to a
group of musicians. In it were hands that looked normal but had
been mysteriously debilitated _ ``formerly graceful, lithe,
dazzlingly fast hands (that) could barely limp through the notes
they sought to draw out of pianos, guitars, flutes and violins.''
Not far into the film, a guitarist in the audience fainted. The
same thing happened at other presentations, and Wilson began to
understand that ``when personal desire prompts anyone to learn to
do something well with the hands, an extremely complicated process
is initiated that endows the work with a powerful emotional
charge.'' In other words, the hand's contributions to our lives are
more profound than we ever imagined. Wilson interviews people who
use their hands in special ways (a rock climber, a magician),
explores the phenomenon of ``handedness'' and takes his book in
enough beguiling directions to balance its more laborious technical
passages. &QL;  &QL;

TOBACCO REMAINS A PLAYER TO DEFEAT IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The minor-league pitcher, fresh out of high
school, reached into the round tin with his thumb and index finger,
pulled out a generous pinch of tobacco and inserted it between his
bottom teeth and lower lip. Minutes later, his stomach churned, and
he felt like vomiting. Two days later, he tried again, and felt
sick again.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 11 years ago. Today, San Francisco Giants reliever
John Johnstone, 29, is addicted to smokeless tobacco, also called
chewing tobacco or spit tobacco. And Johnstone has been diagnosed
with leukoplakia, a condition that, if not properly contained,
could lead to cancer of the mouth or throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stupid for doing it, no doubt about it,'' said Johnstone,
who goes through a half-can of Copenhagen-brand smokeless tobacco
each day. ``For 11 years, I've been doing it. I know the problems
that come with it, and that's what scares me. Definitely, I need to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite baseball's ongoing campaign to reduce the use of
tobacco, an estimated 35 percent to 40 percent of big-leaguers are
users, of either the leaf variety that's packaged in bags or the
fine kind in round tins.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are a microcosm, with eight of their 25 players using
some form of smokeless tobacco _ including Robb Nen, who takes tiny
samples of leaf tobacco during batting practice, and Johnstone, who
dips constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Dusty Baker curbs his addiction by biting on toothpicks
during games, but two of his coaches are users. Baker still uses
smokeless tobacco, about a can a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna quit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When?
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball prides itself on being aware of the problem and
assisting with a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling National Spit Tobacco Education Program (NSTEP),
which educates players and helps them curb or quit their habits,
has gained support from the owners and players' union. On Monday
night at Candlestick Park, NSTEP _ represented by ex-umpire Doug
Harvey, a cancer survivor and former spit tobacco user _ honored
the Giants organization for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. John Greene, dean emeritus of the School of Dentistry at
the University of California at San Francisco, said there were too
few trained counselors for baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team has an employee-assistance program, but most work
with drugs and alcohol, and few have experience in smokeless
tobacco,'' Greene said. ``We hope to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene has seen results. While examining players in spring
training as part of NSTEP, he detected a precancerous white lesion
in the mouth of pitcher Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia
Phillies. The lesion was removed in March, and Schilling gave up
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Of 141 players tested from nine teams, 83 had tissue damage
(leukoplakia), and 15 required biopsies. Greene estimated that half
of baseball's users had tobacco-related lesions, which can lead to
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen very little change in Major Leaguers dating back to
when we first started with the Giants,'' said Greene, who used the
Giants as a pilot team when he began his baseball-related research
in 1986. ``It's still running about 40 percent. But I am
encouraged. They're getting the message, which is more than what
they got in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict a big decrease in the next two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants insist they don't officially supply tobacco
in the clubhouse, it's readily available and easy to find. Rolls of
tobacco tins are stored for any player to grab.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has tried alternatives. He used sunflower seeds, but he
quit because of the salt content and the fact that high blood
pressure runs in his family. He used bubble gum, but quit because
of its effects on teeth. He used sugarless gum, but disliked the
taste.
</P>
<P>
   The latest alternative is toothpicks. ``Toothpicks are the best
thing I could come up with,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Giants who use tobacco, two are relievers, two are
reserve outfielders, one is a backup infielder, and one is the
second-string catcher. It's a clear pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players with more idle time have a tendency to migrate to
habits,'' said Giants trainer Mark Letendre.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Barry Bonds started using smokeless tobacco as a
child and was hooked. He said he quit two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dipping when I was 13,'' Bonds said. ``I did it in high
school; I used to sleep with it. I just quit. No special reason.
Just don't need it. It wasn't hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minor leagues, there is a ban on tobacco products. A
minor-leaguer caught with smokeless tobacco is fined $300, and his
manager also is docked $300.
</P>
<P>
   When minor-league catcher Doug Mirabelli was busted last season
in Triple-A ball, he paid his own fine plus the manager's.
Then-manager Ron Wotus, now the Giants' third-base coach, warned
his players that they'd also pay the manager's fine if they got
nabbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mirabelli was caught, he was sitting right next to me,''
Johnstone said. ``A guy with a pair of binoculars spotted him, and
that was it. You've got to make sure it's not seen at your locker,
in your pocket, anywhere. It could accidentally roll into your
locker, and you'd be to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1994 ban, studies show a decrease in use among minor
leaguers to 29 percent from nearly 40 percent, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even that's disappointing,'' he said. ``It's banned, but
they're still using it. They use it in the back of their mouth, so
it's not seen. Or they use it away from the field. Umpires are
asked to police it, but some umpires use it, too.''

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Congress is worried that impeachment
hearings against President Clinton could backfire. So the idea of
censuring him instead is being floated: If the Monica Lewinsky
allegations appear true, he would be reprimanded for immoral
conduct but remain in office. It is not clear how this would work,
however, since only one president, Andrew Jackson more than 160
years ago, has ever been censured. By MARIANNE MEANS.

of 10 million sandwiched between Poland and Russia, has been noted

since the Soviet Union disintegrated. Yet huddled around a computer
terminal, Olga Zauyalova, 20, and her partner Pavel Bintsarovski,
18, perform an uncanny exercise in this country with little in the
way of a market economy: They create, produce, advertise and sell
products, competing via the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, their
company -- appropriately called ``Alien'' -- is mere fiction, and
their profits are all on paper. But the whiz kids have excelled as
part of an international competition of young entrepreneurs. They
are among eight teams from six nations scheduled to compete in

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY _ MOSCOW _ Trading in Russian stocks was
temporarily halted Tuesday because of a sharp selloff by investors
fearful that the economy is not strong enough to withstand capital
flight in emerging markets. Russian stocks and bonds have plummeted
in the past two sessions, amid widespread flight from emerging
markets. Investors fear that Russian markets in particular are too
feeble to withstand another onslaught of such selling. Traders said
the ruble was also slightly lower today, despite the heavy
intervention of the Russian Central Bank. Investors also worry the
loan won't be enough to allow Russia to prop up its currency.
Before the suspension of trading was announced, Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristiyenko tried to calm the jittery markets:
``Default is not an issue here,'' he said. (Holmes, Cox News

Herman. Under a special side agreement to NAFTA, this is the second
report issued on complaints about working conditions at the the Han
Young auto-parts factory in Tijuana. A previous report on Han Young
that attracted international attention found that Mexico had failed
to enforce laws guaranteeing the right to freely organize unions.
If health and safety laws are not enforced by a NAFTA member, that
country can face economic sanctions. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

HISTORIAN TACKLES A CITY'S PAST FROM THE BOTTOM UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE A. SCRUTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although he has made a 20-year-plus career of
studying and researching this city's early population, and has come
to know most of the residents on a first-name basis, Steve
Bielinski doesn't know them as he'd like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to live back then,'' he said recently. ``But
to go back for a day. The smells. The sounds. To hear an
18th-century (Albany resident) talk. The character of courtship.
How does a garrison soldier sweet-talk a local girl?''
</P>
<P>
   Bielinski's expertise puts him in the public eye several times
each year with a slide show featuring the faces and places of
Colonial Albany, set to the music he writes and performs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect much about the ``rich and famous,'' as
Bielinski calls those whose names appear in history books and on
old Albany mansions. That class of people has been studied the
most, because they were the ones who left ``stuff,'' like letters,
clothes, homes and furnishings. Because they were rich, and later
famous, they could afford to get new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For the middle and lower classes, however, it was ``re-sew,
recut, reuse until it's all used up,'' said Bielinski, leaving
little tangible stuff for modern historians to view. Even the act
of writing their name on a document maybe only happened once or
twice in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first 10 years of his career, Bielinski, 52, spent
his time studying the rich and famous. In 1975, he published a book
on Abraham Yates Jr. _ born into the lower class but, through work
and taking on causes, he climbed the social ladder to become a
famous Albany resident in the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years after his book, Bielinski was giving a lecture
on Yates and his interaction with the common man of the time when
someone asked him ``But who were those people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know, and it dawned on me, neither did anyone else.
So I set out to find out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While little was known about the middle and lower classes, there
were some names. One was a 1766 document, ``The Constitution of the
Albany Sons of Liberty,'' with 94 signatures. Another source was
the official census of New York Colony, taken in 1697. That census
included the 174 names of heads of families in Albany, and further
broke down the family names into numbers of men, women and
children. Ironically, not included in the list, that he can account
for, were the mayor at the time and the sheriff who took the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a precise count of slaves, who made up about 10
percent of the population. By going into marriage, birth and other
records, Bielinski and his associates accounted for 714 people
living in Albany that year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years Bielinski says he has compiled
biographies for thousands of people, tracing their roots from the
1697 census through the first U.S. census in 1790, which listed
3,300 residents of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   With his memory and names in hand, Bielinski set out to find the
community's economy and how the three social layers _ rich and
famous, makers and fixers, and unskilled laborers interacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we earn our living in a quarter to a third of the day.
These (Colonial) people worked all the time. It took much energy to
survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What has evolved is the Colonial Albany Project, a look at the
city from the bottom up and inside out _ who stayed and who came
later, the people who made the basic necessities of life and the
merchants who sold them.
</P>
<P>
   Bielinski still is doing research and is trying to fill in
blanks in the history of some families.
</P>
<P>
   Old city directories, property transactions and even mentions in
letters often cross-reference to other information to give a
historian an insight to another aspect of life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for Bielinski, the academics can fill in only so much. It's
the day-to-day things like smells, and sounds and the human
condition that interest him. ``Something simple,'' he said, ``Like,
just how did they cope with the mosquitoes and black flies?''

   SCI-BALLOON-FOSSETT (Undated) _ Speeding along at more than 100
miles an hour, millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett on Tuesday
became the first balloonist to cross the South Atlantic Ocean. As
he passed the southern tip of Africa on his way eastward from
Argentina he passed the 5,000-mile mark _ one fifth of the distance
he will cover if he succeeds in becoming the first balloonist to
circle the world non-stop. Fossett began his journey last Friday
from Mendoza, Argentina, in his quest for ballooning glory and a
$1-million prize. By Malcolm W. Browne.

<P>
   In early 1939, when the news reached me of the discovery of
fission, I was working in the Radiological Laboratory in Warsaw. I
had already begun to experiment with uranium, so it did not take me
long to set up an experiment to see whether neutrons are emitted at
fission.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it soon became clear that they are _ more neutrons are
emitted than produce fission. From this discovery it was a fairly
simple intellectual exercise to envisage a divergent chain reaction
with a vast release of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The logical sequel was that if this energy were released in a
very short time it would result in an explosion of unprecedented
power.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists in other countries, doing this type of research,
went through a similar thought process, although not necessarily
evoking the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my first reflex was to put the whole thing out of my
mind, like a person trying to ignore the first symptom of a fatal
disease in the hope that it will go away. But fear gnawed at me all
the same, and my fear was that someone would put the idea into
practice.
</P>
<P>
   At that time my life was centered on doing ``pure'' research
work, but I always believed that science should be used in the
service of mankind. The notion of utilizing my knowledge to produce
an awesome weapon of destruction was abhorrent to me.
</P>
<P>
   In my gnawing fear, the ``someone'' who might put it into
practice was precisely defined: German scientists. I had no doubt
that the Nazis would not hesitate to use any device, however
inhumane, if it gave their doctrine world domination. I convinced
myself that the only way to stop the Germans from using it against
us would be if we too had the bomb and threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   My scenario never envisaged that we should use it, not even
against the Germans. We needed the bomb for the sole purpose of
making sure that it would not be used by them.
</P>
<P>
   During this time I moved to England to spend a year with
Professor James Chadwick at Liverpool University on a grant to work
on the cyclotron, which was being completed there.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out two days after I got to Liverpool. Within a
few weeks Poland was overrun. The stories that Hitler's military
strength was all bluff, that his tanks were painted cardboard,
turned out to be wishful thinking. The might of Germany stood
revealed, and the whole of our civilization was in mortal peril.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1939 I approached Chadwick directly with an outline
of my plan for research on the feasibility of the atomic bomb. My
main idea was that for the atom bomb the chain reaction would have
to be propagated by fast neutrons. Otherwise it would not differ
much from a chemical explosive.
</P>
<P>
   We built up a small team of young but devoted physicists and
used the cyclotron to tackle some of the problems. Later we were
joined by Otto Frisch who measured fast-neutron fission
cross-sections for uranium-235. I had the idea of using plutonium,
but we had no means of making it.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that in order to make the bomb, a vast
technological effort would be required, far exceeding the manpower
and industrial potential of wartime Britain. A top-level decision
was reached to collaborate with America. And so I found myself
eventually in that ``wondrous strange'' place _ Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March 1944 I was living with the Chadwicks in their house on
the Mesa. Gen. Leslie Groves, when visiting Los Alamos, frequently
came to the Chadwicks for dinner and relaxed palaver.
</P>
<P>
   During one such conversation, Groves said the real purpose in
making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Whatever his exact
words, his real meaning was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Until then I had thought our work was to prevent a Nazi victory,
and now I was told that the weapon we were preparing was intended
for use against the very people who then were making extreme
sacrifices against Hitler's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Bohr used to come to my room at 8 a.m. to listen to the
BBC news bulletin. Sometimes Bohr stayed on and talked to me about
the social and political implications of the discovery of nuclear
energy and his worry about the dire consequences of a nuclear-arms
race between East and West which he foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   All this, and the growing evidence that the war in Europe would
be over before the bomb project was completed, made my
participation in it pointless.
</P>
<P>
   When it became evident, toward the end of 1944, that the Germans
had abandoned their bomb project, the whole purpose of my being in
Los Alamos ceased to be, and I asked for permission to leave and
return to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why did other scientists not make the same decision? The most
frequent reason so many of them stayed on the project apparently
was pure and simple scientific curiosity _ the strong urge to find
out whether their theoretical calculations and predictions would
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scientists felt that only after the now-legendary
test at Alamogordo should they enter into the debate about the use
of the bomb. Only when peace was restored would they take a hand in
efforts to ensure that the bomb would not be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, while agreeing that the project should have been
stopped when the German factor ceased to exist, were not willing to
take an individual stand because they feared it would adversely
affect their future career.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of scientists were not bothered by moral scruples.
They were quite content to leave it to others to decide how their
work would be used.
</P>
<P>
   As for myself, work on the atom bomb was proof that even pure
research soon finds applications of one kind or another. If so, I
wanted to decide how my work should be applied. I chose an aspect
of nuclear physics which would definitely be beneficial to
humanity: the applications to medicine. Thus I completely changed
the direction of my research and spent the rest of my academic
career working in a medical college and hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While this gave me personal satisfaction, I was increasingly
concerned about the personal aspects of the development of nuclear
weapons, particularly the hydrogen bomb, about which I knew from
Los Alamos. Therefore I devoted myself both to arousing the
scientific community to the danger, and to educating the general
public on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   I was instrumental in setting up the Atomic Scientists
Association in the United Kingdom, and within its framework
organized the Atom Train, a traveling exhibition which explained to
the public the good and evil aspects of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   Through these activities I came to collaborate with Bertrand
Russell. This association led to the foundation of the Pugwash
Conferences, where I met again with colleagues from the Manhattan
Project, who were also concerned about the threat to mankind that
has arisen partly from their work.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years it seems to me that our concepts of morality
seem to get thrown overboard once military action starts. It is,
therefore, most important not to allow such a situation to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Our prime effort must concentrate on the prevention of nuclear
war because in such a war not only mortality but the whole fabric
of civilization would disappear. Eventually, it is clear, we must
aim at eliminating all kinds of war.

 By OSCAR ARIAS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

 By OSCAR ARIAS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   While the end of the Cold War transformed the political
landscape of Europe, it did little to ameliorate India's security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of China and continued strains with Pakistan made the
1980s and 1990s a greatly troubling period for India. At the global
level, the nuclear-weapons states showed no signs of moving
decisively toward a world free of atomic danger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was extended
indefinitely and unconditionally in 1995, perpetuating the
existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of five countries busily
modernizing their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after they had conducted more than 2,000 tests, a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature,
following two and a half years of negotiations in which India
participated actively. This treaty, alas, was neither comprehensive
nor related to disarmament but rather devoted to ratifying the
nuclear status quo.
</P>
<P>
   India's options had narrowed critically. India had to ensure
that its nuclear option, developed and safeguarded over decades,
was not eroded by self-imposed restraint. Such a loss would place
the country at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a difficult decision, New Delhi realized that its
lone touchstone remained national security. The nuclear tests it
conducted this year on May 11 and 13 were not only inevitable but a
continuation of policies from almost the earliest years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   India's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic
tenet: that the country's national security in a world of nuclear
proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in exercise of
the principle of equal and legitimate security for all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when a free India took its rightful place in the world,
both the nuclear age and the Cold War had already dawned. Instead
of aligning with either bloc, India rejected the Cold War paradigm
and chose the more difficult path of nonalignment.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, India's foreign policy was based on its
desire to attain an alternative global balance of power that,
crucially, was structured around universal, nondiscriminatory
disarmament. Nuclear technology had already transformed global
security. Nuclear weapons, theorists reasoned, are not actually
weapons of war but, in effect, military deterrents and tools of
possible diplomatic coercion.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Indian nuclear policy, therefore, remains that a
world free of nuclear weapons would enhance not only India's
security but the security of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of universal disarmament, India could scarcely
accept a regime that arbitrarily divided nuclear haves from
have-nots. India has always insisted that all nations' security
interests are equal and legitimate. From the start, therefore, its
principles instilled a distaste for the self-identified and closed
club of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, nuclear weapons were routinely tested above
ground, making the mushroom cloud the age's symbol. Even then, when
the world had witnessed only a few dozen tests, India took the lead
in calling for an end to all nuclear-weapons testing, but the calls
of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, India's security concerns deepened. In 1962, China
attacked India on its Himalayan border. The nuclear age entered
India's neighborhood when China became a nuclear power in October
1964. From then on, no responsible Indian leader could rule out the
option of following suit.
</P>
<P>
   With no international guarantees of Indian security forthcoming,
nuclear abstinence by India alone seemed increasingly worrisome.
With the 1962 war with China very much on his mind, Indian Prime
Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri began tentatively investigating a
subterranean nuclear-explosion project.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Indian nonproliferation initiatives had scant
impact. In 1965, to make matters worse, the second war between
India and Pakistan broke out. Shastri died in 1966 and was
succeeded by Indira Gandhi, who continued the fruitless search for
international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, India reaffirmed its commitment to disarmament but
decided not to sign the NPT. In 1974, it conducted its first
nuclear test, Pokharan I.
</P>
<P>
   The first 50 years of Indian independence reveal that the
country's moralistic nuclear policy and restraint paid no
measurable dividends, except resentment at home that India was
being discriminated against. Disarmament seemed increasingly
unrealistic politics.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent five's possession of nuclear weapons increases
security, why would India's possession of nuclear weapons be
dangerous? If the permanent five continue to employ nuclear weapons
as an international currency of force and power, why should India
voluntarily devalue its own state power and national security? If
deterrence works in the West _ as it so obviously appears to, since
Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear weapons _
by what reasoning will it not work in India?
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear-weapons powers continue to have, but preach to the
have-nots to have even less. India counters by suggesting either
universal, nondiscriminatory disarmament or equal security for the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11 India successfully carried out three underground
nuclear tests, followed on May 13 by two more underground,
sub-kiloton tests. These five tests, ranging from the sub-kiloton
and fission variety to a thermonuclear device, amply demonstrated
India's scientific, technical and organizational abilities, which
until then had only been vaguely suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight later, on May 28 and 30, neighboring Pakistan
predictably carried out its own tests in the bleak fastness of the
Chagai Hills in Baluchistan, near the Afghan border. Suddenly the
strategic equipoise of the post-Cold War world was rattled. The
entire nonproliferation regime and the future of disarmament were
at the forefront of international agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, India has consistently advocated global
nuclear disarmament, convinced that a world without nuclear weapons
will enhance both global and Indian security.
</P>
<P>
   India was the first to call for a ban on nuclear testing in
1954, for a nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation in 1965,
for a treaty on nonuse of nuclear weapons in 1978, for a nuclear
freeze in 1982, and for a phased program for complete elimination
of nuclear weapons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of these initiatives were rejected by the
nuclear-weapons states, who still consider these weapons essential
for their own security. What emerged, in consequence, has been a
discriminatory and flawed nonproliferation regime that damages
India's security.
</P>
<P>
   For years India conveyed its apprehensions to other countries,
but this did not improve its security environment. This disharmony
and disjunction between global thought and trends in Indian thought
about nuclear weapons is, unfortunately, the objective reality of
the world. Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power.
</P>
<P>
   India could have lived with a nuclear option but without overt
weaponization in a world where nuclear weapons had not been
formally legitimized. That course was no longer viable in the
post-1995 world of legitimized nuclear weapons. What's more, the
Sino-Pakistani nuclear weapons collaboration _ a flagrant violation
of the NPT _ made it obvious that the NPT regime had collapsed in
India's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations on the CTBT in 1996, India for the first time
stated that the nuclear issue is a national-security concern for
India and advanced that as one reason why India was unable to
accede to the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this persuaded the nuclear hegemons to introduce a
clause at the last minute pressing India, along with 43 other
nations, to sign the treaty to bring it into force. This coercive
clause violates the Vienna Convention on Treaties, which stipulates
that a nation not willing to be a party to a treaty cannot have
obligations arising out of that treaty imposed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Even more galling, this clause was introduced at the insistence
of China _ the provider of nuclear technology to Pakistan. When the
international community approved the coercive CTBT, India's
security environment deteriorated significantly. India's plight
worsened as the decade wore on. In 1997 more evidence surfaced on
the proliferation between China and Pakistan and about U.S.
permissiveness on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
Washington, the United States insisted on a separate agreement with
China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan, which the
Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence. Both the U.S.
unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as
a threat to India's security.
</P>
<P>
   After all these assurances, China continued to pass missile
technology and components to Pakistan. Despite this, the Clinton
administration was still willing to certify that China was not
proliferating or _ even worse for India _ that the United States
was either unable or unwilling to restrain China.
</P>
<P>
   As the range of options for India narrowed, so too did the
problems of taking corrective action. The tests of May 11 and 13
were not directed against any country. They were intended to
reassure the people of India about their own security.
Confidence-building is a continuous process to which India remains
committed.
</P>
<P>
   India's motive remains security, not, as some have speciously
charged, domestic politics. Had the tests been motivated simply by
electoral exigencies, there would have been no need to test the
range of technologies and yields demonstrated in May. In the
marketplace of Indian public life, a simple low-yield device would
have sufficed. Since that marketplace did not govern the decision
to experiment, the tests encompassed the range of technologies
necessary to make a credible nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   India is now a nuclear weapons state, as is Pakistan. That
reality can neither be denied nor wished away. India's strengthened
nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility _ the
obligation of power. India, mindful of its international duties, is
committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to
mount threats against any country. These are weapons of
self-defense, to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   India remains committed to the basic tenet of its foreign policy
_ a conviction that global elimination of nuclear weapons will
enhance its security as well as that of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the tests, India stated that it will henceforth
observe a voluntary moratorium and refrain from conducting
underground nuclear test explosions. The basic obligation of the
CTBT is thus met: to undertake no more nuclear tests. Since India
already subscribes to the substance of the test-ban treaty, all
that remains is its actual signature.
</P>
<P>
   India has also expressed readiness to participate in
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a
fissile material cut-off treaty. Its basic objective is to prohibit
future production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   India's approach in these negotiations will be to ensure that
this treaty is universal, nondiscriminatory and backed by an
effective verification mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War did not result in the end of history.
The great thaw that began in the late 1980s only melted down the
ancient animosities of Europe. We have not entered a unipolar
order. India still lives in a rough neighborhood. It would be a
great error to assume that simply advocating the new mantras of
globalization and the market serves to make national security
subservient to global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will not be the century of trade. The world
still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries.

   Even more galling, this clause was introduced at the insistence
of China _ the provider of nuclear technology to Pakistan. When the
international community approved the coercive CTBT, India's
security environment deteriorated significantly. India's plight
worsened as the decade wore on. In 1997 more evidence surfaced on
the proliferation between China and Pakistan and about U.S.
permissiveness on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
Washington, the United States insisted on a separate agreement with
China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan, which the
Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence. Both the U.S.
unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as
a threat to India's security.
</P>
<P>
   After all these assurances, China continued to pass missile
technology and components to Pakistan. Despite this, the Clinton
administration was still willing to certify that China was not
proliferating or _ even worse for India _ that the United States
was either unable or unwilling to restrain China.
</P>
<P>
   As the range of options for India narrowed, so too did the
problems of taking corrective action. The tests of May 11 and 13
were not directed against any country. They were intended to
reassure the people of India about their own security.
Confidence-building is a continuous process to which India remains
committed.
</P>
<P>
   India's motive remains security, not, as some have speciously
charged, domestic politics. Had the tests been motivated simply by
electoral exigencies, there would have been no need to test the
range of technologies and yields demonstrated in May. In the
marketplace of Indian public life, a simple low-yield device would
have sufficed. Since that marketplace did not govern the decision
to experiment, the tests encompassed the range of technologies
necessary to make a credible nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   India is now a nuclear weapons state, as is Pakistan. That
reality can neither be denied nor wished away. India's strengthened
nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility _ the
obligation of power. India, mindful of its international duties, is
committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to
mount threats against any country. These are weapons of
self-defense, to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   India remains committed to the basic tenet of its foreign policy
_ a conviction that global elimination of nuclear weapons will
enhance its security as well as that of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the tests, India stated that it will henceforth
observe a voluntary moratorium and refrain from conducting
underground nuclear test explosions. The basic obligation of the
CTBT is thus met: to undertake no more nuclear tests. Since India
already subscribes to the substance of the test-ban treaty, all
that remains is its actual signature.
</P>
<P>
   India has also expressed readiness to participate in
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a
fissile material cut-off treaty. Its basic objective is to prohibit
future production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   India's approach in these negotiations will be to ensure that
this treaty is universal, nondiscriminatory and backed by an
effective verification mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War did not result in the end of history.
The great thaw that began in the late 1980s only melted down the
ancient animosities of Europe. We have not entered a unipolar
order. India still lives in a rough neighborhood. It would be a
great error to assume that simply advocating the new mantras of
globalization and the market serves to make national security
subservient to global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will not be the century of trade. The world
still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries.

IN ERA OF CORPORATE MERGERS, SAN FRANCISCO FEELS THE SQUEEZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA and VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First the phone company. Then the banks. Now,
the landmark Transamerica Pyramid. Quick, someone slap a lock on
the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Many nationally known corporations based in San Francsico _
including BankAmerica Corp., Wells Fargo, Pacific Telesis Group,
Montgomery Securities Inc., Robertson Stephens Inc. and the Pacific
Exchange _ recently have been swallowed up in billion-dollar deals,
fueled by the merger and acquisition mania of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Transamerica Corp. There's talk that the San Francisco
life insurer might be an acquisition target.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the corporate trysts, some San Francisco-based
companies are either packing up their headquarters, or being run by
a parent company in another city.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Antenore, a San Francisco planning commissioner, said the
long-term ramifications of these megamergers and acquisitions could
be costly to San Francisco's economy and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the transfer of jobs and basic economic influence out
of the city. The more you remove the power to make decisions in a
place and have that power elsewhere, the more you're likely to have
bad decisions made that aren't in the interest of people living in
that place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica, which plans to merge with NationsBank Corp. in a
$64 billion deal that would create the country's largest banking
system, will move its executive suite to Charlotte, N.C., where
NationsBank is based.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many BankAmerica jobs will be lost in San
Francisco, where the company employs 9,500 workers, but the merger
is expected to result in the loss of 5,000 to 8,000 jobs out of a
combined work force of 180,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Norwest of Minneapolis announced plans to acquire Wells
Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, in a deal worth about $31
billion.
</P>
<P>
   At Pacific Telesis, the phone company's top-level executives
have been replaced by officers of SBC Communications, the San
Antonio-based telecommunications giant that acquired the San
Francisco Baby Bell for $17 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Brazer, managing partner of the San Francisco Partnership,
a privately funded economic development corporation that helps
attract businesses to the city, said a buyout of Transamerica Corp.
would be markedly less dramatic than the BankAmerica merger, mainly
because it would affect far fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   She added mergers often make good business sense for companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to mergers, companies have to pay attention to
their shareholders and what will give their shareholders better
value,'' Brazer said. ``For people in San Francisco the brand
identity lives on _ no matter who owns it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, mergers announced by corporations nationwide hit record
highs: 10,000 deals worth $845 billion, according to Securities
Data Co. in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Companies filed a record 3,702 merger notices last year with the
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which must
sign off on all proposed deals over $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said the deals work out nicely for investors,
executives and financial advisers, but workers and consumers often
get slammed in the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of employees lose their jobs as companies merge units and
slice the fat. And bigger companies can mean poorer service and
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Federal Reserve study found that large multistate banks
charged higher service fees than smaller companies that did
business in only one state.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's three minutes to air, and Randy Tate, head of the Christian
Coalition, is stuck in traffic on a Miami freeway, cheerfully
singing the toothbrushing song from ``Barney.'' (``While I'm
brushing my teeth and having so much fun, I never let the water
run. No, I never let the water run.'') He was to have been on a
morning radio show that reaches 15,000 Spanish-speaking
evangelicals _ folks the coalition desperately wants to enlist _
and his local organizer, who had insisted this drive would be just
a short hop, is on the cell phone begging the producer to let them
come anyway.
 &HT;    The answer is no, but Tate is perfectly pleasant about the lost
opportunity, just as he is later in the day when the same man makes
him so late for a lunch with some big-money donors that he can only
stay a few minutes before racing back to the airport.
 &HT;    The fact is, Tate is a perfectly pleasant guy. And no one would
tag him with the word critics so routinely applied to his intense
predecessor, Ralph Reed: scary. (You can't help thinking, on a day
spent hurtling nowhere, that Reed would never have put up with this
wasted motion.)
 &HT;    Back in Washington, Tate has often been seen as a little too
nice _ and not too effective. But after a year in the job, with
fall congressional elections just around the corner, he is trying
to change all that. And the centerpiece of his strategy seems to be
a lot of tough talk about homosexuals.
 &HT;    Tate was among the first to defend Trent Lott after the Senate
majority leader compared homosexuals to kleptomaniacs. He also
signed on to co-sponsor an ad campaign that says homosexuals can be
cured through religious faith. ``It wasn't a tough call,'' Tate
says.
 &HT;    While that effort has put the Christian Coalition back in the
news, it has also added to doubts about Tate, convincing his
critics that he is neither nice nor effective. Even Reed has said
that remarks like those Lott made are a big tactical mistake.
 &HT;    With that strategy, Reed has said, ``the Republican Party has
tripped over its own shoelaces and found itself on the defensive.''
In an interview in his tiny Capitol Hill office, Tate sighs and
says he doesn't really like talking about gay people.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years ago, this wasn't an issue _ it isn't like we
decided to bring it up,'' he says, tossing an empty Coke bottle
into the air and catching it. ``Is there foam coming down the side
of my mouth?'' he cracks.
 &HT;    But he has been bringing it up plenty lately. After Lott said
homosexuality is a sin, Tate sent him an ``atta boy'' and went on
``Good Morning America'' opposite Rep. Barney Frank, the
Massachusetts Democrat who is gay, to complain that it was Lott who
had been the true target of bigotry, discriminated against for his
Christian views.
 &HT;    ``Senator Lott expressed his private religious views,'' Tate
explained on the show, ``and the White House referred to him as
extreme because he believed in the Bible. It's the religious
intolerance that really bothers me in this debate.''
 &HT;    Tate calls the ad campaign that followed ``a message of hope,
love and tolerance'' for homosexuals, but when asked, several
times, says no, he himself has not ever really known a gay person
very well: ``I've known people I've worked with that are. If you
work in Washington, D.C., you're going to run into all kinds of
people.''
 &HT;    Still, Tate insists it is the ``other side'' that forced the
issue by calling Lott's remarks ``backward.'' And there have been
other recent provocations, he says.
 &HT;    In May, President Clinton signed an executive order protecting
federal workers from job discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. Last October, Vice President Al Gore gave a speech
praising the now-long-gone TV show ``Ellen,'' whose star, Ellen
DeGeneres, received almost Seinfeld-level coverage when she and the
character she played announced their sexual preference for women.
 &HT;    ``We needed to speak out and the issue took off,'' Tate says.
``But when people say this is done to energize the base, I'd say
this is being pushed by Clinton to energize their base because
homosexuals are a key constituency.''
 &HT;    The head of the liberal People for the American Way, Carole
Shields, believes all this talk about the gay agenda will help Tate
raise some quick cash and turn out conservative voters _ as he
must, if he is to prove the group is still strong under the current
management. But she believes it will cost him in the long run as
the coalition tries to grow.
 &HT;    Moderates in the Republican Party agree. And even some
conservatives are skeptical. Rep. Steve Largent, a Christian
conservative from Oklahoma, says he has to wonder if the issue
hasn't been resurrected to fill a vacuum in a campaign season short
on substance.
 &HT;    ``I really oppose the homosexual agenda, but I think it's wrong
for political purposes to try to capitalize on that, and I'm not
saying the Christian Coalition is doing that,'' he says. ``But if I
were the Christian Coalition, the week after I ran those ads I
would also run an ad about how destructive adultery is to families.
I don't think there's a hierarchy of sin.''
 &HT;    Especially in recent years, Reed worked overtime to position the
coalition as squarely in the mainstream. Though Tate too insists
the coalition is in the mainstream, he was hired to reheat the old
rhetoric. And his biggest problem is Reed.
 &HT;    In his eight years with the Christian Coalition, Reed used
political instinct and media savvy to build the mailing list left
over from Pat Robertson's presidential run into the most important
lobbying group on the right. As his successor, Tate is probably
bound to feel constantly compared with the other guy and found
lacking. As Largent says, ``I'm not sure anybody could fill Ralph
Reed's shoes.''
 &HT;    In a way, nobody did. When Reed left the coalition a year ago to
start a political consulting business, Robertson split his old job
in two. First he hired Tate, now 32, a true-believing,
old-fashioned retail politician from Washington State who was
looking for work after losing his congressional seat.
 &HT;    Then Robertson paired Tate _ undercut him, some say _ with
Donald Hodel, a 63-year-old former Reagan energy and interior
secretary.
 &HT;    As Robertson says in a telephone interview: ``Randy's a
different kind of guy. Ralph is more analytical and cerebral in
terms of political strategy. They're both young and energetic and
dedicated, but Ralph is unique. He has a strategic mind that few
have.''
 &HT;    And Tate? Robertson mentions his youth, tempered by Hodel's
experience, and then says: ``He really is an extremely dedicated
person, to the Lord, his family and American and conservative
values. He's constantly up, always cheery, and it seemed he could
help mobilize the troops.''
 &HT;    Cheery? Seemed? Some conservatives wonder if Robertson didn't
also choose Tate in part because he wanted to take back some of the
power that Reed had assumed. ``I have in my own, quiet way,''
Robertson says, ``been setting the agenda for a long time.''
 &HT;    Robertson also notes that Reed left the organization with a few
challenges beyond wondering how his successors could possibly
measure up. Contributions had dropped off steeply, perhaps because
Reed had announced he was leaving. But as his old boss sees it,
``The direct mail wasn't good, the vendor was poor and Ralph was in
transition and not focusing.''
 &HT;    And though Tate never speaks other than respectfully of the act
he has had to follow, his chief spokesman, Arne Owens, says that
Tate and Hodel inherited some major problems after years of
phenomenal growth, the result in part of poor financial planning
and a comptroller who embezzled from the group.
 &HT;    Last year at this time, Owens says, the organization was $1.2
million in the red. ``Don and Randy took over and that's what they
were greeted with,'' Owens says. ``That's versus about $1 million
in the black now.''
 &HT;    (The normally ultra-accessible Reed returned the umpteenth phone
call left for him over several weeks on a Friday evening, very much
like someone who wants to leave a message rather than talk to the
person they are calling. When the call was answered, he passed on
the chance to talk on the record.)
 &HT;    Whatever the true state of the coalition's books, which have
always been closed except for the tiny peek provided by a
bare-bones annual report, Robertson's decision to give Tate only
half of Reed's old job was seen as more evidence that Tate is not a
player on Reed's level.
 &HT;    The plan was that Hodel would raise money and oversee finances
and Tate, who had found his calling to the political life as a
volunteer in Robertson's 1988 presidential bid, would serve as
chief lobbyist, spokesman and operational head.
 &HT;    And things do seem to have gone well for Tate on the local level
in the last year, with major wins in helping defeat an Oklahoma
casino expansion bill and a gay-rights referendum in Maine, where
the coalition distributed some 250,000 voter guides.
 &HT;    But the lobbying and quote-mongering aspects of the job have
clearly not been such an easy fit, in no small measure because Tate
has failed to pull off Reed's great trick of magnifying the
strength of both his grass roots and lobbying with more or less
constant media attention _ which brought in more money, which
strengthened the grass roots and lobbying, which got him more
attention and so on.
 &HT;    When Tate calls on former colleagues, there is none of the
menacing background music that seems to thrill official Washington,
no sense that if attention is not paid, he could tie up every phone
line of the Hill and go home laughing.
 &HT;    Tate has also been drowned out by other voices on the right as
more-camera-ready conservatives have scrambled to fill the
personality void left by Reed. Gary Bauer of the Family Research
Council has been so encouraged by the new windfall of attention
that he's talking about running for president. (Robertson advises
that he should ``go take a cold shower'' instead.)
 &HT;    Before his stroke in June, James Dobson, the Colorado religious
broadcaster whose radio program reaches millions, was the man to
see. He was seen as the one who brought the Republican leadership
around to the religious right's agenda this spring, when he
threatened to bolt the party if his people were not romanced with a
little more feeling. Soon, Gingrich and the rest were vowing to
make good on their old promises, swearing they would kill the
National Endowment for the Arts this time.
 &HT;    Tate is disarming in appearance, a 5-foot-8, prematurely bald
guy who has trouble keeping weight on. He says he has felt picked
on as a Christian from the day he first announced for the state
legislature at age 22. ``I had horns,'' he says.
 &HT;    He feels particularly vilified by the press, and in Chesapeake,
Va., at his group's style-free concrete headquarters, where no
visitor could conceivably accuse the coalition of wasting money on
amenities, the local paper, The Virginian-Pilot, is better known as
The Virginia Plot.
 &HT;    Tate's wife, Julie, who stays home with their two young children
and meets him enthusiastically at the door in the middle of a
workday _ ``You're staying here till dinner, right?'' _ says she
thinks stereotypes about Christians are the result of plain old
guilt. ``People don't like to think there's a right and a wrong, so
imagine how they feel about Randy. But truth is truth, whether you
believe it or not,'' she says, serving espresso and almond bread on
the patio out in back of their new home in a new subdivision.
 &HT;    Tate grew up in Puyallup, in the state he calls ``the real
Washington,'' the third of five children in a highly political and
extremely religious family. His ambition coming out of school was
maybe to start a construction business with a few friends, but his
mom talked him into continuing his education while working full
time.
 &HT;    He met his wife, who calls herself ``the helpmate,'' at age 17
on a blind date set up by another girl Randy had dated a few times.
They are alike, it is easy to see, and convinced that God wants
them right where they are. Their life together is ordered, with the
kids in bed every evening at 6:30.
 &HT;    ``It's hard sometimes,'' Julie Tate says, ``like when he went to
the White House Correspondents dinner. He's meeting Sharon Stone
and I'm scraping Cheerios off the floor in my jammies. But I have
to keep in mind that he gets to go to that dinner because I'm
taking care of his kids. It's important to be a team.'' She adds
that she never thought their team would be in and out of Congress
by the time they were in their early 30s.
 &HT;    In this job, Tate allows, ``the odds are against us. I've kind
of been an underdog my whole life.'' Still, he can't help sounding
like a really good salesman when he talks about the virtually
untapped market of religious conservatives who aren't even involved
in the political life _ yet. The coalition wants to sign up 100,000
new contacts in churches around the country by the year 2000, and
is recruiting them at a series of small coffees, with a teaching
video starring Tate.
 &HT;    This low-tech approach, ``water cooler politics,'' as he calls
it, obviously appeals to Tate, who seems happiest recalling the
mornings he spent as a candidate, standing on traffic medians in
the rain, waving at potential voters. It is possible that Tate's
tactics will prevail, that they will strengthen the coalition
around the country.
 &HT;    But in Washington, perception _ as measured in television
appearances and phone calls returned _ is power. And the perception
there is that Randy Tate, unlike his predecessor, does not quite
understand that.

   SCI-BALLOON-FOSSETT (Undated) _ Speeding along at more than 100
miles an hour, millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett on Tuesday
became the first balloonist to cross the South Atlantic Ocean. As
he passed the southern tip of Africa on his way eastward from
Argentina he passed the 5,000-mile mark _ one fifth of the distance
he will cover if he succeeds in becoming the first balloonist to
circle the world non-stop. Fossett began his journey last Friday

   SWEET-CORN (Undated) _ Now, at the peak of the sweet-corn
season, is when I get cranky; no matter how fresh and sweet the
corn at Greenmarkets and roadside stands, I can't find a single ear
of my grandfather's beloved Silver Queen. For 150 years, breeders
have experimented constantly with sweet corns to improve flavor,
texture, tenderness, appearance, growing time and hardiness. But
it's only in the last 20 years that corn engineers have rocketed
corn from sweet to sweeter to supersonic sweetness. Bio-engineering
has changed old-fashioned types like Silver Queen, now called
``normals,'' into sweeter types called ``sugar enhanced'' and
triply sweet types called ``supersweets.'' Bio-engineering is the
reason supersweet corn can be found in supermarkets year round _
and the reason Silver Queen can't be, even at the height of the
summer season. By Betty Fussell.

   BUTTERMILK (Undated) _ There's no two ways about buttermilk:
either you love its tart creaminess, or you shudder at just a
glimpse of its cloudy film clinging to an empty glass. Buttermilk
is as thick and creamy as its name implies, but it actually has far
fewer calories and much less fat than whole or low-fat milk.
Originally this was so because it was just the thin liquid left
over when butter was made, the equivalent of the cheese maker's
whey. Today most dairies make buttermilk by culturing skim milk,
but it retains a tartness that perfectly accents the flavor of
sun-sweetened summer berries. By Richard W. Langer.

   CHARWOOD (Undated) _ Charwood, also called lump or chunk
charcoal, is made from Canadian sugar maple wood that is burned in
an oxygen-free kiln to remove the moisture and wood pollutants such
creosote and resins. The result is a clean high-dry heat that seals
in flavor very quickly. Every kind of meat and poultry I cooked had
a wonderful sweetness and was juicier than anything I had ever
tasted over briquets: chicken parts, whole chicken, steak,
tenderloin of beef, rack of lamb, pork tenderloin, salmon and
assorted vegetables. By Marian Burros.

   DRINKING-VINEGAR (Undated) _ Clustered on a silver tray in the

and ruby red. Grappas? liqueurs? Guess again. The bottles are

   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: At this time of year you

IN PARCHED MEXICAN STATES, WATER BECOMES A RARE NECESSITY

   MANUEL, Mexico _ It has been more than three months since anyone
opened a faucet here with more than a passing expectation that
something wet would issue.
</P>
<P>
   Drained by nearly five years of El Nino-induced drought, the
stream-fed municipal water supply finally tapped out in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents of Manuel must wait for state-supplied tanker
trucks to fill the municipal water tank every three or four days.
But they complain that one tank full lasts no more than a few hours
_ at best.
</P>
<P>
   Between tanker deliveries, they must buy expensive bottled water
or do without.
</P>
<P>
   ``That faucet is wide open, but it's been since yesterday that
anything came out of it,'' said Carmen Caraceles, pointing at the
faucet in the yard where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   Caraceles, 50, is no stranger to poverty. She moved here three
years ago from Gonzalez, a truck stop nine miles up the
black-asphalt road snaking across the coastal plain of the state of
Tamaulipas, the traditional trade route between Monterrey and the
port of Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Her borrowed house has windows, but nothing to cover them; an
electric meter outside, but nothing electric inside; and no water
faucet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go around with the few little water bottles I have
asking people to give me water to drink,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Caraceles makes her living washing other people's clothes here
in Manuel, a task made more difficult by the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost days of work because there was no water to wash
with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, households in Manuel have continued to
receive their monthly water bills from the municipal water company,
said Consuelo Garcia Torres, 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are charging us for air,'' Garcia complained.
</P>
<P>
   Weather scientists hope this is the end of the El Nino weather
phenomenon, which has hit Mexico, Central America and other areas
particularly hard this year. Even normally lush jungles dried up
and then caught fire as peasants burned fields for spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   Thick smoke from the fires blew north this spring, blanketing
portions of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in most areas, seasonal rains finally returned, dousing the
fires and turning the countryside green.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, that is, but the northeastern states of Tamaulipas,
Nuevo Leon and Coahuila.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the last sector of the country that hasn't had normal
rains,'' Jorge Zertuche Rodriguez, Tamaulipas' secretary of
agricultural development, said in an interview in Ciudad Victoria,
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dams and reservoirs throughout the three states are at an
average of only 16 percent of their capacity, he said. No one is
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Monterrey, an urban sprawl of 3.5 million people in Nuevo Leon,
is shutting off municipal mains between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. in an
effort to save water.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers are thinning already thin herds, while growers are
planting drought-resistant, short-seasoned crops when they are
planting at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we predicted a spring grain harvest of 1.1 million
metric tons. We actually cut 300,000 metric tons,'' Zertuche said.
</P>
<P>
   In normal years, the towering peaks of the Sierra Madre Oriental
spear the moist clouds driven inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The swift, clear streams and rivers flowing down from mountain
canyons irrigate thousands of acres of orange and grapefruit
orchards. But now, with some rivers dry, the citrus industry is
headed for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we cut early and got a good crop, but without water,
there won't be much this year,'' Zertuche said. ``Some growers are
telling me that their trees are starting to die.''

   As in parts of the thirsty American Southwest, water is often an
explosive political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tamaulipas Gov. Manuel Cavazos Lerma has clashed repeatedly with
Nuevo Leon political officials over the distribution of water from
Nuevo Leon's huge El Cuchillo Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the early 1990s to ensure Monterrey's drinking water
needs, it cut off the flow from the Santa Catarina and Rio San Juan
rivers into neighboring Tamaulipas, where farmers depended on it to
irrigate corn, sorghum and cotton fields. Although scientists
predicted near-normal rains between August and November, Zertuche
said they won't help much.
</P>
<P>
   Like a dry sponge, the bone-dry soil will soak up normal
rainfall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get normal rainfall, those people who dry-farm sorghum
and corn will probably make a crop, but those who depend on
irrigation from reservoir water will not benefit because the dams
will not fill up,'' he said. ``To do that, we need a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Water and agricultural officials in the three states are
scrambling to supplement the dwindling water supplies. Bigger,
deeper, larger are the methods used to capture and store water. But
without rain, the race is being lost.
</P>
<P>
   State workers are building tanks for cattle and drilling new
wells to fill them. But as soon as wells are drilled, the falling
water table exceeds their reach, and so thousands of wells are
being redrilled and refitted for larger capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In communities like Manuel, the water sources have either slowed
or disappeared altogether. And so the states are now trucking water
to thirsty residents.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, 40 tanker loads of water _ 100,000 gallons _ are being
sent to nine communities throughout Tamaulipas, said Jose Hernandez
Cuesta, assistant director of administrative systems for the state
water commission.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the worries and many of the ambitious projects and
plans generated by politicians and engineers is the belief that
people can resolve the region's water problems.
</P>
<P>
   Within limits, that is true, Zertuche said.
</P>
<P>
   But a report from Tamaulipas to federal water officials this
spring suggested that even the optimists know that no matter how
fine it is sliced and distributed, water is not created by people.
</P>
<P>
   After a rundown of state programs initiated to deal with the
water problems, the report concluded by first calling for the
promotion of a water-saving culture among Tamaulipas residents.
</P>
<P>
   The second simply advocated ``hoping that the normal rain cycles
return and that the dams fill up.''

 By DAVID SAMUELS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In Washington, tennis is something of a ritual sport. And of all
the hardened Beltway competitors at the St. Albans Tennis Club,
from Jack Valenti to Vernon Jordan to Strobe Talbott, not one is
more famous for his flat-out desire to win than the middle-aged man
on court No. 8 serving this morning, down two games to one.
 &HT;    Facing the net, he fiddles with his glasses, then squares his
shoulders like a football lineman. He tosses the ball in the air,
grunts as he serves, rushes the net, then grimaces as the ball
whizzes by him.
 &HT;    ``Did you see him scamper?'' asks his opponent, Timothy Wirth,
the former senator from Colorado. ``It's nice to see him scamper
like that.''
 &HT;    Wirth looks like a senator, the one that Robert Redford played
in ``The Candidate,'' with aging good looks and a penumbra of
slightly fuzzy charm. He likes looking good on the court.
 &HT;    His opponent, Terry Lenzner, doesn't much care how he looks. The
object of his game is to win. When he hits his next serve long, his
eyes narrow.
 &HT;    ``Want to change the rules, Lenzner?'' Wirth asks.
 &HT;    Whether Lenzner plays by the rules is the subject of much
high-powered speculation in Washington these days. As the private
investigator hired by President Clinton's lawyers, Lenzner is a
front-line soldier in a new kind of war, in which embarrassing
information about political and legal opponents is provided for use
as ammunition in today's partisan culture of scandal.
 &HT;    Within the past year, Lenzner has testified before a Senate
committee about the president's legal-defense fund and, most
recently, before the grand jury of the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, about his activities on behalf of the president's lawyers.
 &HT;    It's a far cry from the young lawyer who sat at Sam Ervin's
elbow during the Senate Watergate hearings 25 years ago. In recent
months, the New York Times columnist William Safire has called
Lenzner a ``big bully'' for his aggressive style, while Safire's
colleague Frank Rich referred to him as a ``creep'' for
investigating the tobacco company whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand.
 &HT;    ``To hire plumbers, to affect the trials of people through
adverse publicity, that's wrong,'' says Ronald Rotunda, a professor
of law at the University of Illinois who served with Lenzner on the
Senate Watergate committee and is currently a special consultant to
Starr. ``Assuming that it was all legal, and people weren't bribed
somewhere along the way, I still think it is wrong.''
 &HT;    Citing what he believes to be a deliberate tactic of digging up
dirt on the president's accusers, such as Paula Jones, and then
leaking it to the press, he adds, ``For Terry to be involved in
this is sad and appalling.''
 &HT;    Yet what Lenzner has actually done (or not done) for the
president remains a mystery. After a long series of denials,
half-denials and evasions, the president's lawyers, David E.
Kendall and Robert S. Bennett, admitted in a news release dated
Feb. 24, 1998, to having employed Lenzner and his company,
Investigative Group International (IGI), since 1994.
 &HT;    ``It is common for private counsel to retain commercial
investigative services to perform legal and appropriate tasks in
the defense of a client,'' they stated.
 &HT;    Dick Morris, the former Clinton strategist (and no stranger to
hyperbole), puts it a different way: He calls Lenzner the head of
``the White House secret police.''
 &HT;    Lenzner's activities _ at least now _ may not be quite as
extensive as many published reports have implied, according to a
prominent source close to the president's legal defense. The source
says that IGI has performed a variety of legal-defense-related
tasks, not all of them publicly reported, including digging up
information on Paula Jones' sexual history through interviews and
public-record searches, tracing the financing of the anti-Clinton
network surrounding the millionaire publisher Richard Mellon Scaife
and compiling public-record dossiers on ``likely courtroom
opponents'' _ presumably including the independent counsel.
 &HT;    This is, at first glance, strange work for a man who helped
solve the murders of three civil-rights workers in Philadelphia,
Miss., in 1964 (the ``Mississippi Burning'' case), who headed the
Office of Legal Services in 1970 and who slapped a subpoena on
Richard Nixon in 1974 as assistant chief counsel to the Senate
Watergate committee. If this sounds like the resume of a
soft-boiled idealist, however, Lenzner would be the first to set
you straight. He is not interested in ideals. He is interested in
facts.
 &HT;    Since 1984, when he founded a small investigative group with a
staff of three, Lenzner's empire _ his own private FBI _ has grown
to include nearly 100 full-time investigators working out of the
Washington headquarters of Investigative Group International, as
well as field offices in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago,
Seattle, San Francisco and London.
 &HT;    Among IGI's investigators are lawyers from some of the better
law firms in the country, as well as former police detectives and
FBI, CIA and DEA agents, reporters and news producers from ABC, NBC
and CBS. Raymond Kelly, now an under-secretary of the treasury
department, is a former IGI investigator, as is Brooke Shearer, now
at the Interior Department.
 &HT;    ``One of the real pleasures of this job, to me, is that I get to
deal with people that I've worked with for the last 25 years,''
says Larry Potts, a former deputy director of the FBI who now runs
IGI's worldwide operations. ``I get to work with people who left
the Bureau and became directors of security. I get to work with
former United States attorneys. I mean, to me, it's like being at
home. You're just working with the same folks you've always worked
with.''
 &HT;    If this morning's case meeting at IGI is not entirely
representative of the company's clientele (usually Fortune 500
corporations, high-tech firms, investment banks, law firms and
prominent politicians of both parties), it is a good example of how
the company does its work.
 &HT;    Seated around the long table in the conference room, with two
Robert Motherwell-like abstractions on the walls and a pair of
faceless Kabuki dolls on either side of the door, are two IGI
investigators and a freshly showered Lenzner. This morning's client
is Robert Nixon, who represents a Washington environmental group
and has agreed to the presence of a reporter.
 &HT;    The group wants IGI to look into a complicated real-estate deal
related to a mysterious London-based contessa, Bina Sella di
Monteluce, who has reportedly spent $11 million to persuade
Congress, the Interior Department and the District of Columbia City
Council to allow her to build an ``educational theme park'' on
national parkland in the Anacostia River.
 &HT;    In 1996, Congress passed a bill transferring the land _ now
known as Children's Island _ from the National Park Service to the
District of Columbia. Nixon explains that last December the City
Council voted to approve the contessa's lease, which included a
99-year term, plus a number of other sweetheart provisions. The
contessa's lobbyists, Nixon continues, include close associates of
Washington's mayor, Marion Barry.
 &HT;    ``We need to pull registration statements on all the lawyers,''
says Margot Critchfield, a former NBC news producer. ``There should
be an IRS Form 990 that has to be filed. That's one of the few tax
forms that's open to inspection.''
 &HT;    Lenzner is getting more excited. ``There's money moving
around,'' he says, tugging on his black-framed Nixon-era glasses
and slowly massaging the knuckle of the ring finger on his right
hand. ``There's legislation being introduced. There's Interior
Department movement.''
 &HT;    As he talks, I notice that the knuckle is swollen to two or
three times the normal size and that his ring finger is bent at a
distinct angle. It is an old football injury that never healed
right, and it gives him a slightly dangerous, back-alley look,
thoroughly in keeping with his broad shoulders and powerful hands.
With his glasses off, however, his eyes look surprisingly soft and
a little sad.
 &HT;    ``The ultimate question here,'' he says a moment later, ``is
what we can do with these facts to stop the development from
proceeding. Because getting the facts is only going to be helpful
if they meet some larger goal. There could be a PR strategy here.
There could be a legal strategy.''
 &HT;    This is the stuff of which politicians' nightmares are made. The
initial trace of the backgrounds and holdings of the people
involved in the project _ information such as their names,
addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, the make and
the value of the cars they own, the value of the mortgages on their
homes, any federal political contributions they may have made, as
well as any mention of their activities in the news media _
involves little more than the press of a button.
 &HT;    ``Try the dentist,'' says Robert Walters, a former newspaper
reporter and syndicated columnist, referring to a man whose name
appears on the Children's Island corporation documents. ``I'm
fascinated by him.''
 &HT;    Connie Manwell, IGI's resident Washington information
specialist, taps a few keys on her computer and waits for the
information to download. The information services that IGI uses are
all commercially available. They include news and legal databases,
such as Dow Jones, Lexis-Nexis and Pacer, commonly used by
reporters and law firms.
 &HT;    They also include a service called Auto Track, which finds
current and previous addresses, allowing investigators to interview
neighbors, and which connects people to cars and property,
bankruptcy records and professional licenses. Another tool is CDB
Infotech, which provides financial information on individuals,
including the value and source of current mortgages and loans. And
there is more.
 &HT;    ``Some states will sell you driver's license information,''
Manwell explains, as she waits for the dentist's Auto Track file to
load, ''including your address, Social Security number, your
height, weight and the color of your eyes. Nearly anything you can
imagine is out there, including the illegal stuff, like your
medical records, credit-card bills, bank balances and the rest. We
don't touch it, but it's there.''
 &HT;    As the Children's Island investigation enters its initial phase,
Lenzner sits in his office and takes calls, his shoulders slightly
hunched, his attention tightly centered on the phone, as if he were
inhaling something vital from the receiver.
 &HT;    Scattered around his office are the big-game trophies of his
investigative career: the famous Nixon subpoena and a banner
headline, ``Alaska Wins, Oil Companies Lose,'' as well as a framed
picture of himself as the Harvard football captain, No. 60, making
a flying tackle of a quarterback from Yale.
 &HT;    On the other end of the line is Terrence Burke, a highly
decorated former CIA officer and onetime acting director of the DEA
who now runs IGI's foreign operations. Burke's active case file,
displayed on the screen on Lenzner's desk, reveals the company's
bread-and-butter casework: investigations into bid-rigging,
bribery, high-tech theft, counterfeiting and other possible crimes
in Egypt, Bangladesh, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Norway, Kuwait,
England, Chile, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. Fees range from
several thousand dollars for a simple inquiry to hundreds of
thousands of dollars for a complex case.
 &HT;    IGI's ability to combine powerful computer technology with the
field experience of investigators such as Burke represents a
quantum leap over the gumshoe methods of a Philip Marlowe or Sam
Spade. It can also cause a great deal of trouble if you happen to
be the target of the investigation.
 &HT;    The Wigand investigation, conducted by IGI's New York office
under the direction of Ray Kelly, a former New York City police
commissioner, along with investigators not hired by IGI,
illustrates just how nasty this kind of work can get. Documents
portraying Wigand as a liar, shoplifter and wife-beater were leaked
to The Wall Street Journal, which published the allegations in
1996. While the documents were real, the accusations they were
intended to support were ultimately shown to be without substantial
basis in fact.
 &HT;    In Lenzner's opinion, however, the Wigand case could just as
easily have gone the other way. What if Wigand was a liar? What if
the tobacco company was right? ``I'm not quick to make moral
objections about people,'' he says. ``What drew me to Mississippi,
I'm going to be candid with you _ I had no moral compulsion to go
down there and save the world.''
 &HT;    It is this ability to see the world in dispassionate shades of
gray, without making assumptions, he says, that makes him a good
investigator. ``What you need to do is to think about what's going
on, understand it and learn more about it. And if you think about
it, that's what the civil liberties stuff was about. That's what
Watergate was about. I enjoy asking questions and getting
answers.''
 &HT;    Our conversation about his work for President Clinton takes
place during a two-hour interview, which I am not allowed to
record. It is an interesting performance, a display of toughness, a
chance to answer his critics and, most of all, to let off steam
after four years of rumors and half-truths.
 &HT;    He describes his February appearance before the grand jury with
a combativeness that echoes the most recent pronouncements by White
House sources.
 &HT;    ``I spent a lot of my time making eye contact with the grand
jury members,'' he says. ``And before I left, I told them that I
would be happy to see them again, but to please call me at my
office and not to send two FBI agents to my house with a
subpoena.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the questions asked by the special prosecutor
Jackie Bennett, Lenzner is unusually specific. ``They wanted to
know if I knew Sidney Blumenthal,'' he says. ``And I told them
that, yes, I do know Sid Blumenthal. I just met him 10 minutes ago
outside. And they wanted to know if I had ever investigated Ken
Starr, and whether I had ever conducted an investigation of the
other prosecutors. They seemed most interested in whether or not I
had investigated them. They also asked me, `When was the last time
you reported to the president?' And I told them that I've never met
the president, and I've never talked to him in my life.''
 &HT;    Asked if he is proud of the work that he did for the president,
however, Lenzner's answer is surprisingly ambivalent. ``The overall
answer is yes,'' he says. ``But I include in that the work we have
done for the DNC, as well as the Paula Jones case and other matters
in which we have been involved.''
 &HT;    What is most surprising is how normal Lenzner makes all this
sound. If Lenzner's rise tells us anything about the scandal wars
of the '90s, it may be that the power once held by J. Edgar Hoover
_ someone who worked behind the scenes, who knew all the secrets
and exerted enormous influence on public affairs _ has passed into
the hands of private men.
 &HT;    ``There's something satisfying about walking around with a
reserve bank of information that nobody else has, or few people
have,'' Lenzner says.
 &HT;    ``With an understanding of things that go on inside companies
and universities and charities and governments. But I never would
have had that chance if I hadn't become what I have become. And I
love that part. I'll be frank with you on that.''

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire
and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly
telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of
the early short stories of Raymond Carver.
 &HT;    The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea
was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were
more his than Carver's.
 &HT;    No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who
died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them.
Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written
fiction too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people
care about his work?
 &HT;    As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the
subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe
he had rethought what his contribution had been _ or simply moved
on.
 &HT;    Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the
Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver
scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one
tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary
executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with
copyright cautions and pressure.
 &HT;    I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be
published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive
myself.
 &HT;    What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of
stories such as ``Fat'' and ``Tell the Women We're Going,'' were
pages full of editorial marks _ strikeouts, additions and marginal
comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a
temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories.
 &HT;    As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she
was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules.
But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver.
 &HT;    ``I started reading the folders,'' she said, ''but then I
stopped when I saw what was in there.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken
seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon.
When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by
many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories
were beautiful and moving.
 &HT;    At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the
editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, ``America has just lost
the writer it could least afford to lose.''
 &HT;    Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster
Wallace is today, but many of his stories _ ``Cathedral,'' ``Will
You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' and ``Errand'' _ are firmly
established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980s,
Carver has become establishment fiction.
 &HT;    That doesn't capture his claim on us though. It goes deeper than
his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an
alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write
through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered
multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30s. He struggled in a
difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk.
 &HT;    Through it all he remained a generous, determined man _
fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in
with Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life.
 &HT;    ``I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the
woods,'' he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at
the Lilly. ``But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it.''
Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
 &HT;    Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that
what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap
between the early style of ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
and ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' Carver's first
two major collections, and his later work in ``Cathedral'' and
``Where I'm Calling From.''
 &HT;    In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are
mostly about the working poor _ unemployed salesmen, waitresses,
motel managers _ in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early
collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are
minimalist in style with an almost abstract feel. They drop their
characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone,
drunk at noon. The later two collections are fuller, touched by
optimism, even sentimentality.
 &HT;    Many critics over the years have noticed this difference and
explained it in terms of biography. The Carver of the early
stories, it has been said, was in despair. As he grew successful,
however, the writer learned about hopefulness and love, and it
soaked into his fiction.
 &HT;    This redemptive story was burnished through countless retellings
by Gallagher. Most critics seemed satisfied by this literal-minded
explanation: Happy writers write happy stories.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Sitting under the coffered ceiling of the Lilly, I began pulling
out folders from the two boxes marked ``Carver.'' Here were the
stories from his first two collections as well as from
``Cathedral'' in versions from manuscript to printer's galleys.
 &HT;    I had previously seen some manuscripts in the Carver holdings at
Ohio State University, an archive to which Gallagher has said she
will ultimately give the Carver papers in her possession. The
manuscripts at OSU are clean, almost without editing marks, as if
they'd gone straight from author to typesetter. Where there are
multiple drafts of a manuscript, the procession is unremarkable:
The annotations in Carver's tiny handwriting drive the story
confidently from draft to draft until the story achieves its
finished form.
 &HT;    The Lilly manuscripts are different. There are countless cuts
and additions to the pages; entire paragraphs have been added.
Lish's black felt-tip markings sometimes obliterate the original
text.
 &HT;    In the case of Carver's 1981 collection, ``What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love,'' Lish cut about half the original words
and rewrote 10 of the 13 endings. ``Carol, story ends here,'' he
would note for the benefit of his typist.
 &HT;    In ``Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit,'' for example, Lish cut 70
percent of the original words. With a longer story, ``A Small, Good
Thing,'' in which a couple anxiously wait for their child to come
out of a coma, Lish cut the text by a third, eliminating most of
the description _ and all of the introspection. He retitled it
``The Bath,'' altering the story's redemptive tone to one of
Beckettian despair. In Lish's version, you no longer know if the
child lives or dies.
 &HT;    Lish was constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's
creeping sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's
characters talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When
they do bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they
stopped crying. They stopped feeling.
 &HT;    Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he freely wrote them in:
``The women, they weren't there when I left, and they wouldn't be
there when I got back'' (``Night School''). Other times, he cut
away whole sections to leave a sentence from inside the story as
the end: ``There were dogs and there were dogs. Some dogs you just
couldn't do anything with'' (``Jerry and Molly and Sam'').
 &HT;    On occasion, Carver reversed his changes, but in most cases
Lish's handwriting became part of Carver's next draft, which became
the published story.
 &HT;    ``Fat'' was one of the first stories Carver gave Lish to edit.
It became the lead story in ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
In ``Fat,'' a restaurant waitress recounts to her friend Rita a
large meal she served to a ravenous but melancholy obese man. The
waitress's lover, Rudy, the restaurant cook, feels jealous. When
they get home, he insists on having sex with her, but her mind
remains with her experiences in the restaurant: The fat man has
touched her in some way, made her feel dissatisfied with her life.
This was how Carver wrote it, more as an anecdote than a story.
 &HT;    It proved excellent material for Lish's talents. Some of what
Lish does is technical: He moves the story into the present tense,
for example. And he eliminates the waitress's self-reflectiveness,
so we seem more involved than she does in what she is feeling.
(Critics would later declare such touches to be trademark
techniques of Carver.)
 &HT;    Most important, Lish picks up on the ``long, thick, creamy
fingers'' Carver gives the fat man, and finds in this the story's
core _ the connection between longing and sexuality.
 &HT;    ``My God, Rita, those were fingers,'' the waitress tells her
girlfriend, who herself has ``dainty fingers.'' At the end, when
Rudy gets into bed with her, she observes, ``Rudy is a tiny thing
and hardly there at all.''
 &HT;    These lines _ and several others _ were written by Lish. In
Lish's hands, fatness becomes sexual potency, fullness, presence.
He finds the resonance Carver missed.
 &HT;    If ``Fat'' was a successful _ if unusually extensive _ edit,
Lish's efforts on another story, ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
seemed closer to a wholesale rewrite. Written by Carver in the late
1960s or early '70s, the story was unusual for him, one of the few
in which the violence implicit in his characters becomes explicit.
 &HT;    The story first made an appearance as ``Friendship'' in
Sou'wester, a small literary magazine. By the time it appeared in
the ``What We Talk About'' collection, Lish had retitled it _ and
cut it by 40 percent.
 &HT;    As I thumbed through various manuscripts at the Lilly, my face
was flushed. I wanted Carver to win, whatever that might mean. He
had shown writers the value of measuring your words. He had come
along in the early 1970s when the first ``post-modern'' novelists,
writers such as John Barth and Donald Barthelme, dominated the
literary scene. Their cerebral stories were admirable, but they
were hard to love. Carver broke up their racket.
 &HT;    Overall, Lish's editorial changes generally struck me as for the
better. Some of the cuts were brilliant, like the expert cropping
of a picture. His additions gave the stories new dimensions,
bringing out moments that I was sure Carver must have loved to see.
Other changes, such as those in ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
struck me as bullying and competitive. Lish was redirecting
Carver's vision in the service of his own fictional goals. The act
felt parasitic.
 &HT;    Lish's techniques also grew tired more quickly than did
Carver's. After a while, the endless ``I say,'' ``he says'' tags
Lish placed on so much of the dialogue felt gimmicky. In all cases,
however, I had one sustained reaction: For better or worse, Lish
was in there.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Back in New York I contacted Lish. Much has changed for
``Captain Fiction,'' as the once-dapper Lish was nicknamed during
his Esquire heyday. Now 64, he is a widower, living alone in a
spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He shuffles
around in his socks, his long white hair and loose clothes making
him look like a vanquished sorcerer.
 &HT;    ``I don't like talking about the Carver period,'' he said,
''because of my sustained sense of his betrayal and because it
seems bad form to discuss this. ... This puts me in an absolutely
impossible light,'' he continued. ``I can only be despised for my
participation.''
 &HT;    Lish already has plenty of enemies: By the 1990s his aggressive
editing, controversial private fiction seminars and taste for
publicity had cost him many friends. ``I said no to the people to
whom one doesn't say no,'' he said.
 &HT;    In 1994, after a decade in which the writers he was championing
found fewer and fewer readers, Knopf fired him. He now writes
fiction full time. His latest is titled ``Self-Imitation of
Myself.'' Reading his stories is like looking at the gears of a
clock that's missing a face.
 &HT;    It was in 1976 that Carver collected his stories in ``Will You
Please Be Quiet, Please?'' including a version of the title story
that Lish had cut.
 &HT;    In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Geoffrey Wolff,
who would later become a friend of Carver's, hailed the stories,
describing them as ``carefully shaped'' and ``shorn of
ornamentation,'' marked by ``spells of quiet and tensed
apprehension.'' In fact, Wolff wrote, Carver's prose ``carries his
mark everywhere: I would like to believe that having read the
stories I could identify him on the evidence of a paragraph.'' The
collection was nominated for a National Book Award.
 &HT;    Carver was gaining confidence from his success and writing more
ambitiously. And he was finding out the world wasn't so harsh. He
had friends now, acolytes even. He separated from Maryann and
became involved with Tess Gallagher. He bought a boat and
celebrated it in a poem in which he imagined it filled with his
friends.
 &HT;    His editor's confidence was also growing. Lish thought of
himself as Carver's ventriloquist. ``I could not believe no one had
stumbled on what was going on,'' he says. A collision was
inevitable.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Initially, Carver had been grateful for Lish's help _ or perhaps
just compliant or cowed. Carver was in a bad place in his life,
beset by drink and poverty. Lish was his way to a readership.
Nevertheless, Carver's unease was evident from the beginning.
 &HT;    Responding to an edit in December 1969, Carver wrote:
``Everything considered, it's a better story now than when I first
mailed it your way _ which is the important thing, I'm sure.'' He
echoed these sentiments in January 1971. ``Took all of yr changes
and added a few things here and there,'' he wrote, taking pains to
add that he was ``not bothered'' by the extent of Lish's edit.
 &HT;    Carver had a role in keeping the romance going too. ``You've
made a single-handed impression on American letters,'' he wrote
Lish in September 1977. ``And, of course, you know, old bean, just
what influence you've exercised on my life.'' He even offered to
pay the charges for any work Lish sends out to be retyped.
 &HT;    After ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' they began work on a
second collection, which Lish would ultimately title ``What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love.'' (Carver had called it
``Beginners.'') By that time, Lish was editing more heavily. He
treated Carver as if he barely had a vote.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carver was becoming a known literary figure. In 1978
he won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The next year he became a professor
of English at Syracuse University.
 &HT;    Carver began to object to Lish's editing, but he wasn't sure
what to object to. He wrote a five-page letter in July 1980 telling
Lish that he could not allow him to publish ``What We Talk About''
as Lish had edited it.
 &HT;    He wrote, ``Maybe if I were alone, by myself, and no one had
ever seen these stories, maybe then, knowing that your versions are
better than some of the ones I sent, maybe I could get into this
and go with it.'' But he feared being caught.
 &HT;    ``Tess has seen all of these and gone over them closely. Donald
Hall has seen many of the new ones ... and Richard Ford, Toby
Wolff, Geoffrey Wolff, too, some of them. ... How can I explain to
these fellows when I see them, as I will see them, what happened?''
 &HT;    He begged to be let out of his contract or at least to delay
publication: ``Please, Gordon, for God's sake help me in this and
try to understand. . . . I've got to pull out of this one. Please
hear me. I've been up all night thinking on this. ... I'll say it
again, if I have any standing or reputation or cedibility (sic) in
the world, I owe it to you. I owe you this more-or-less pretty
interesting life I have (but) I can't take the risk as to what
might happen to me.''
 &HT;    In the same letter, he wrote imploringly, ``(M)y very sanity is
on the line here. ... I feel it, that if the book were to be
published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write
another story.''
 &HT;    Lish does not recall being moved. ``My sense of it was that
there was a letter and that I just went ahead.'' He knew what was
best for Carver _ even if Carver didn't see it that way.
 &HT;    In the end, ``What We Talk About'' was published much as Lish
wanted. The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its
minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so,
Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He
insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would
have to keep his hands off.
 &HT;    ``I can't undergo (that) kind of surgical amputation and
transplantation,'' he wrote Lish in August 1982. ``Please help me
with this book as a good editor, the best ... not as my ghost,'' he
pleaded two months later.
 &HT;    Lish reluctantly complied. ``So be it,'' he wrote in December
1982 after giving the manuscript to ``Cathedral'' only a light edit
_ although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even
then, Carver feared a sneak attack. ``I don't need to tell you that
it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with
titles or text,'' he warned Lish.
 &HT;    Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of
telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his
stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when
he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through
again and took the commas out.
 &HT;    Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his
friends whether he should make his ``surrogate work'' public. They
advised him to keep quiet.
 &HT;    Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he
never looked back. He didn't need to. ``Cathedral'' was his most
celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow
wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for
both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
 &HT;    Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that
the title story ``went straight from the typewriter into the
mail.''
 &HT;    Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work _
stories such as ``Blackbird Pie'' and ``Errand'' _ as his best
efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the
Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national
attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended.
 -0- 
 &HT;    When interviewers used to ask Carver about his relationship with
``Captain Fiction,'' he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a
talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial
time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of
their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might
reveal for those interested in his work.
 &HT;    In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with
students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's
question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship.
 &HT;    He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's cutting of Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises,''
Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.
 &HT;    Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: ``It's
immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a
jot of difference who writes them.'' Then he paused. ``That's it.
That's it exactly,'' he said.

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire
and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly
telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of
the early short stories of Raymond Carver.
 &HT;    The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea
was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were
more his than Carver's.
 &HT;    No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who
died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them.
Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written
fiction too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people
care about his work?
 &HT;    As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the
subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe
he had rethought what his contribution had been _ or simply moved
on.
 &HT;    Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the
Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver
scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one
tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary
executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with
copyright cautions and pressure.
 &HT;    I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be
published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive
myself.
 &HT;    What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of
stories such as ``Fat'' and ``Tell the Women We're Going,'' were
pages full of editorial marks _ strikeouts, additions and marginal
comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a
temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories.
 &HT;    As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she
was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules.
But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver.
 &HT;    ``I started reading the folders,'' she said, ''but then I
stopped when I saw what was in there.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken
seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon.
When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by
many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories
were beautiful and moving.
 &HT;    At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the
editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, ``America has just lost
the writer it could least afford to lose.''
 &HT;    Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster
Wallace is today, but many of his stories _ ``Cathedral,'' ``Will
You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' and ``Errand'' _ are firmly
established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980s,
Carver has become establishment fiction.
 &HT;    That doesn't capture his claim on us though. It goes deeper than
his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an
alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write
through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered
multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30s. He struggled in a
difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk.
 &HT;    Through it all he remained a generous, determined man _
fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in
with Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life.
 &HT;    ``I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the
woods,'' he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at
the Lilly. ``But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it.''
Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
 &HT;    Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that
what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap
between the early style of ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
and ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' Carver's first
two major collections, and his later work in ``Cathedral'' and
``Where I'm Calling From.''
 &HT;    In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are
mostly about the working poor _ unemployed salesmen, waitresses,
motel managers _ in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early
collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are
minimalist in style with an almost abstract feel. They drop their
characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone,
drunk at noon. The later two collections are fuller, touched by
optimism, even sentimentality.
 &HT;    Many critics over the years have noticed this difference and
explained it in terms of biography. The Carver of the early
stories, it has been said, was in despair. As he grew successful,
however, the writer learned about hopefulness and love, and it
soaked into his fiction.
 &HT;    This redemptive story was burnished through countless retellings
by Gallagher. Most critics seemed satisfied by this literal-minded
explanation: Happy writers write happy stories.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Sitting under the coffered ceiling of the Lilly, I began pulling
out folders from the two boxes marked ``Carver.'' Here were the
stories from his first two collections as well as from
``Cathedral'' in versions from manuscript to printer's galleys.
 &HT;    I had previously seen some manuscripts in the Carver holdings at
Ohio State University, an archive to which Gallagher has said she
will ultimately give the Carver papers in her possession. The
manuscripts at OSU are clean, almost without editing marks, as if
they'd gone straight from author to typesetter. Where there are
multiple drafts of a manuscript, the procession is unremarkable:
The annotations in Carver's tiny handwriting drive the story
confidently from draft to draft until the story achieves its
finished form.
 &HT;    The Lilly manuscripts are different. There are countless cuts
and additions to the pages; entire paragraphs have been added.
Lish's black felt-tip markings sometimes obliterate the original
text.
 &HT;    In the case of Carver's 1981 collection, ``What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love,'' Lish cut about half the original words
and rewrote 10 of the 13 endings. ``Carol, story ends here,'' he
would note for the benefit of his typist.
 &HT;    In ``Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit,'' for example, Lish cut 70
percent of the original words. With a longer story, ``A Small, Good
Thing,'' in which a couple anxiously wait for their child to come
out of a coma, Lish cut the text by a third, eliminating most of
the description _ and all of the introspection. He retitled it
``The Bath,'' altering the story's redemptive tone to one of
Beckettian despair. In Lish's version, you no longer know if the
child lives or dies.
 &HT;    Lish was constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's
creeping sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's
characters talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When
they do bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they
stopped crying. They stopped feeling.
 &HT;    Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he freely wrote them in:
``The women, they weren't there when I left, and they wouldn't be
there when I got back'' (``Night School''). Other times, he cut
away whole sections to leave a sentence from inside the story as
the end: ``There were dogs and there were dogs. Some dogs you just
couldn't do anything with'' (``Jerry and Molly and Sam'').
 &HT;    On occasion, Carver reversed his changes, but in most cases
Lish's handwriting became part of Carver's next draft, which became
the published story.
 &HT;    ``Fat'' was one of the first stories Carver gave Lish to edit.
It became the lead story in ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
In ``Fat,'' a restaurant waitress recounts to her friend Rita a
large meal she served to a ravenous but melancholy obese man. The
waitress's lover, Rudy, the restaurant cook, feels jealous. When
they get home, he insists on having sex with her, but her mind
remains with her experiences in the restaurant: The fat man has
touched her in some way, made her feel dissatisfied with her life.
This was how Carver wrote it, more as an anecdote than a story.
 &HT;    It proved excellent material for Lish's talents. Some of what
Lish does is technical: He moves the story into the present tense,
for example. And he eliminates the waitress's self-reflectiveness,
so we seem more involved than she does in what she is feeling.
(Critics would later declare such touches to be trademark
techniques of Carver.)
 &HT;    Most important, Lish picks up on the ``long, thick, creamy
fingers'' Carver gives the fat man, and finds in this the story's
core _ the connection between longing and sexuality.
 &HT;    ``My God, Rita, those were fingers,'' the waitress tells her
girlfriend, who herself has ``dainty fingers.'' At the end, when
Rudy gets into bed with her, she observes, ``Rudy is a tiny thing
and hardly there at all.''
 &HT;    These lines _ and several others _ were written by Lish. In
Lish's hands, fatness becomes sexual potency, fullness, presence.
He finds the resonance Carver missed.
 &HT;    If ``Fat'' was a successful _ if unusually extensive _ edit,
Lish's efforts on another story, ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
seemed closer to a wholesale rewrite. Written by Carver in the late
1960s or early '70s, the story was unusual for him, one of the few

on the line here. ... I feel it, that if the book were to be
published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write
another story.''
 &HT;    Lish does not recall being moved. ``My sense of it was that
there was a letter and that I just went ahead.'' He knew what was
best for Carver _ even if Carver didn't see it that way.
 &HT;    In the end, ``What We Talk About'' was published much as Lish
wanted. The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its
minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so,
Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He
insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would
have to keep his hands off.
 &HT;    ``I can't undergo (that) kind of surgical amputation and
transplantation,'' he wrote Lish in August 1982. ``Please help me
with this book as a good editor, the best ... not as my ghost,'' he
pleaded two months later.
 &HT;    Lish reluctantly complied. ``So be it,'' he wrote in December
1982 after giving the manuscript to ``Cathedral'' only a light edit
_ although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even
then, Carver feared a sneak attack. ``I don't need to tell you that
it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with
titles or text,'' he warned Lish.
 &HT;    Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of
telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his
stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when
he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through
again and took the commas out.
 &HT;    Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his
friends whether he should make his ``surrogate work'' public. They
advised him to keep quiet.
 &HT;    Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he
never looked back. He didn't need to. ``Cathedral'' was his most
celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow
wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for
both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
 &HT;    Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that
the title story ``went straight from the typewriter into the
mail.''
 &HT;    Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work _
stories such as ``Blackbird Pie'' and ``Errand'' _ as his best
efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the
Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national
attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended.
 -0- 
 &HT;    When interviewers used to ask Carver about his relationship with
``Captain Fiction,'' he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a
talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial
time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of
their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might
reveal for those interested in his work.
 &HT;    In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with
students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's
question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship.
 &HT;    He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's cutting of Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises,''
Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.
 &HT;    Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: ``It's
immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a
jot of difference who writes them.'' Then he paused. ``That's it.
That's it exactly,'' he said.

 &HT;    RUSSIAN MARKETS TUMBLE ON CONCERNS OVER GOVERNMENT CRISIS PLAN
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Shaken by losses on Asian and European markets,
Russia's battered financial markets plunged again Tuesday,
prompting trade on the Moscow exchange to be temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Russia's main stock market index had fallen 11.8
percent on panic selling driven by fresh concerns that the
government will not be able to avoid a potentially ruinous
devaluation of the nation's currency, the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Trading resumed after a 45-minute halt, and the market ended the
day down 9.1 percent to its lowest level since May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristiyenko
sought to reassure investors: ``Russia's default in not on the
day's agenda. It is not an issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's formerly robust market was hailed by investors
throughout 1997 on a breathtaking surge that ended late last year
at the onset of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Russia deepened in May, with steep losses in the
markets, prompting the International Monetary Fund and others to
assemble a $22.6 billion bailout package. The package was designed
to restore investor confidence and buy time for President Boris
Yeltsin's government to enact badly needed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Russia received a $300 million loan on
Monday from the World Bank. But it was not enough to stem the
latest declines in stocks and bonds, which began late last week and
dealt a blow to government efforts to pull Russia out of its budget
mess.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off is part of a worldwide trend as nervous investors
retreat from high-risk emerging markets like Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble has remained relatively stable throughout Russia's
financial troubles, trading at about 6.2 to the dollar, and thus
most Russians -- whose average monthly salary equals only about
$200 a month -- have been unaffected by the market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors fear that the Russian government will be
unable to substantially increase its tax collections and reduce its
borrowing to provide enough cash for $20 billion in debt payments
to foreign banks due this year.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has had to dip into already low foreign
currency reserves to make interest payments and bolster the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost problem facing Russia is the inability of its
government to collect billions of dollars in unpaid taxes.
Yeltsin's government will ask parliament to approve seven new
measures at a special legislative session next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the lower house, the Duma, dominated by the Communist Party,
rejected a portion of the government's austerity program last month
that sought to raise taxes and will likely do the same next week,
Alexander Zhukov, chairman of the budget committee told the
ITAR-Tass new agency.

 &HT;    THEY'RE VICIOUS! THEY'RE HORRIBLE? THEY'RE MINKS?
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A band of vicious killers is stalking English farms and
forests in a relentless search for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Minks. Thousands of them, suddenly free and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, animal rights activists ``liberated'' as many
as 6,000 of the luxuriously coated predators from a fur farm in
Hampshire, near the English coast. Free from their cages, the
ill-tempered little carnivores have been doing what comes naturally
_ killing and maiming. Minks, which are related to weasels, will
eat smaller animals and attack larger ones. An unidentified
Chihuahua was reported by The Independent newspaper to be among the
first victims.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the situation, Hampshire authorities have set up a
24-hour hotline center to handle calls about marauding minks. They
are warning residents to protect their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have had a number pets _ particularly
rabbits and ducks _ that have been killed,'' Hampshire official
Anne Righton gravely told BBC television. ``A number of dogs have
been bitten or attacked by the minks. We are again urging the
public to secure their pets.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce Berry, the director of the New Forest Owl Sanctuary,
it has been a nightmare. Sunday morning, Berry discovered the body
of a rare tawny owl with its head surgically removed, presumably by
a rampaging mink.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has taken up arms, and was shown in The Express holding
the owl's mangled body in one gloved hand and a dead mink he shot
in the other. ``I will shoot any mink on sight,'' he told the
newspaper. ``They are nothing but a pest species and there is
nothing else you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even animal rights activists expressed alarm at the release of
so many of the animals into an alien environment, where they may
breed and permanently alter the natural balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are not crazy about minks being kept on farms,
releasing them into the wild is totally irresponsible,'' said Rob
Dazely, the regional manager for the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Harris, a wild animal expert from the University of
Bristol, believes the public and press are being unfair to the
minks. ``The point about minks is that they are constantly being
described as sadists who kill for pleasure,'' Harris said. ``But
they are only trying to look out for themselves.''

   The boy is 8 years old and he is barefoot, and his right arm is
in a cast and he is holding a paper bag containing chips and other
treats.
</P>
<P>
   He is standing in front of a house in the 6700 block of S.
Normal Avenue on the South Side of Chicago, squinting at the scene
a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood has been invaded by cops and reporters, camped
outside the residence of a little boy who is a murder suspect.
There are white vans from nearly every TV station in town, their
satellite hookups spiraling to the sky. Camera operators setting up
their tripods. Reporters in crisp dresses or shirts and ties,
notebooks in hand as they interview neighbors. Five Chicago Police
cars.
</P>
<P>
   You talk to the boy for a while and he tells you his name and
where he lives and how he got that cast on his arm _ and then he
asks you if it's true what everyone in the neighborhood is saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they get two little boys for killing that girl? Is that
why the TV is here?''
</P>
<P>
   You tell him indeed that's why the TV is here. In a world _ in a
city _ where murder is commonplace and many killings don't attract
even the passing attention of the media, this is one of those cases
that causes even hardnosed cops and cynical journalists to shake
their heads in sadness and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Harris, an 11-year-old honor roll student from south
suburban Lansing who had dreams of becoming a doctor, was riding
her bicycle in the 6600 block of S. Parnell on July 27 when a
7-year-old boy struck her with a rock, fracturing her skull, police
said. The 7-year-old and an 8-year-old boy then allegedly assaulted
the girl with a foreign object and suffocated the girl with a piece
of her own clothing and debris from the unkempt, open yard where
she was attacked, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we think killers can't get any younger, this.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sunny Monday morning, and news of the boys' arrest has
spread quickly through the Englewood neighborhood. Residents
cluster on porches and on street corners, many of them expressing
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe those boys did that,'' says Carolyn Cooper.
``There's just no way.''
</P>
<P>
   You wander away from the cop-and-media cluster, and that's when
you happen upon the small boy who is eight _ the same age as the
older of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``No little boys would do that,'' he says. ``(The killers) gotta
be older.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says something that stuns you, something that tells you
8-year-old boys either watch too much crime-TV or hear and see too
much of the real world at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they got those boys' fingerprints from the girl's
bicycle,'' the boy says.
</P>
<P>
   In the backyard of the suspect's home is a milk crate attached
to a wooden plank, nailed to a tree. It's a makeshift basketball
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the Benjamin Banneker Elementary School. A
sign outside proclaims: ``I Can and I Will. Children First.''
</P>
<P>
   You walk over to Parnell Avenue, behind a brown-brick,
boarded-up, two-story building, to the scene where the girl was
killed. Negotiating the weeds and broken glass and heavy rocks and
empty whiskey and beer bottles, you kick at a folded square of
paper.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the fliers that was handed out by Cook County Crime
Stoppers after Ryan's body had been found. An offer of a $1,000
reward; photos of Ryan and the royal blue Road Warrior bicycle she
was riding.
</P>
<P>
   She was killed right here. You try to get a sense of this as a
place of evil, but of course it's not. It's an eyesore lot like a
thousand others.
</P>
<P>
   There's a small shrine near the house next door. Shrinking
balloons, wilting flowers, a candle.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Eric comes out and scrapes the remainder of his
breakfast from a skillet into the garbage. He won't give his last
name but he's willing to talk about the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just shocked,'' he says. ``I have a son who's nine and I
can't even imagine him being involved in something like that. I was
expecting they'd catch someone a whole lot older.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to be this way. You don't care what town or
what year _ when it's a July afternoon and an 11-year-old girl is
riding her bicycle alongside an 8-year-old boy and a 7-year-old
boy, at the worst they're supposed to tease her or chase after her.
At the very worst.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects each weigh about 35 pounds. Neither has reached the
4-ft. mark in height. They are so small and young, there is no
detention facility in the Chicago area that is properly equipped to
house them.

of her own clothing and debris from the unkempt, open yard where
she was attacked, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we think killers can't get any younger, this.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sunny Monday morning, and news of the boys' arrest has
spread quickly through the Englewood neighborhood. Residents
cluster on porches and on street corners, many of them expressing
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe those boys did that,'' says Carolyn Cooper.
``There's just no way.''
</P>
<P>
   You wander away from the cop-and-media cluster, and that's when
you happen upon the small boy who is eight _ the same age as the
older of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``No little boys would do that,'' he says. ``(The killers) gotta
be older.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says something that stuns you, something that tells you
8-year-old boys either watch too much crime-TV or hear and see too
much of the real world at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they got those boys' fingerprints from the girl's
bicycle,'' the boy says.
</P>
<P>
   In the backyard of the suspect's home is a milk crate attached
to a wooden plank, nailed to a tree. It's a makeshift basketball
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the Benjamin Banneker Elementary School. A
sign outside proclaims: ``I Can and I Will. Children First.''
</P>
<P>
   You walk over to Parnell Avenue, behind a brown-brick,
boarded-up, two-story building, to the scene where the girl was
killed. Negotiating the weeds and broken glass and heavy rocks and
empty whiskey and beer bottles, you kick at a folded square of
paper.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the fliers that was handed out by Cook County Crime
Stoppers after Ryan's body had been found. An offer of a $1,000
reward; photos of Ryan and the royal blue Road Warrior bicycle she
was riding.
</P>
<P>
   She was killed right here. You try to get a sense of this as a
place of evil, but of course it's not. It's an eyesore lot like a
thousand others.
</P>
<P>
   There's a small shrine near the house next door. Shrinking
balloons, wilting flowers, a candle.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Eric comes out and scrapes the remainder of his
breakfast from a skillet into the garbage. He won't give his last
name but he's willing to talk about the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just shocked,'' he says. ``I have a son who's nine and I
can't even imagine him being involved in something like that. I was
expecting they'd catch someone a whole lot older.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to be this way. You don't care what town or
what year _ when it's a July afternoon and an 11-year-old girl is
riding her bicycle alongside an 8-year-old boy and a 7-year-old
boy, at the worst they're supposed to tease her or chase after her.
At the very worst.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects each weigh about 35 pounds. Neither has reached the
4-ft. mark in height. They are so small and young, there is no
detention facility in the Chicago area that is properly equipped to
house them.

<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that people were so terrified by the
disease that they wouldn't even utter its name.
</P>
<P>
   So they called it the ``Big C.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, cancer, which has resisted nearly every weapon
medicine has deployed against it since the ``war on cancer'' was
launched 27 years ago, is finally showing signs of vulnerability.
There's no miracle cure, and there may never be. But scientists and
doctors have come to know the enemy, intimately. They now know how
cancer starts, what it takes for tumors to grow, and even how
cancer cells sometimes commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   And they are using that knowledge to battle back in what
longtime cancer-fighters say is the most promising push ever
against the illness, a campaign being waged on numerous fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very optimistic,'' says Dr. Richard Klausner, who as
director of the National Cancer Institute is leading the charge.
``I am, as a scientist, continuously amazed at how much we know now
that we didn't know a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clear to anyone looking at it is that the number of
ideas and strength of those ideas has gone up remarkably. That's
real progress. That's the type of progress we have to make if we're
going to get, ultimately, to our goal of curing cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That progress is most evident in the laboratories of molecular
biologists who devote their lives to unraveling the intricate
machinery within microscopic living cells. Some are learning how to
turn off genetic growth switches that get stuck in the ``on''
position, and to replace tumor-suppressing genes that break and
allow cells to spin out of control. Others, relying on newfound
understanding of the immune system, are developing ways to marshal
the body's own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   And at Children's Hospital in Boston, Dr. Judah Folkman and his
colleagues have proven they can shrink tumors in mice by choking
off the tumors' blood supply. While recent media accounts raised
unrealistic hopes about how fast that strategy might be translated
into treatment for humans, researchers still say this is the most
hopeful weapon on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Emma Carey of Exeter, N.H., stands as living proof
of how such sophisticated knowledge of what goes on inside cancer
cells already is yielding important real-world applications _ and
of how much more it might yield in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When Emma was diagnosed with leukemia last year, doctors at
Massachusetts General Hospital used a new ``molecular diagnostics''
test to spot telltale genetic alterations in her blood cells. With
that genetic profile, ``we could tell her parents that she has an
excellent chance of survival, close to 90 percent,'' says her
physician, Dr. Howard Weinstein. Before long, Weinstein adds, such
genetic profiles may be used to tailor highly specific treatment
recipes to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Even while they are awaiting new payoffs from the laboratory,
cancer doctors are hard at work getting old tools to perform new
functions. &UR;  &LR; That means concocting promising cocktails of old and
new chemotherapy drugs, targeting radiation to tumors in ways that
make it more precise and potent, and fine-tuning surgical
techniques _ all of which are extending and saving the lives of
patients today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war on cancer has worked,'' says Dr. Vincent T. DeVita
Jr., the former NCI chief who helped launch that effort in 1971 and
led it until 1988. ``My projection is that the reduction in
mortality and incidence rates will deepen every year. We'll hit a
30-percent reduction for breast cancer alone by the year 2000, and
overall rates will be down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll do away with cancer,'' adds DeVita, who
now runs the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven. ``But it won't be the
major killer it once was. It will be controllable so people can
live with it, like they do with diabetes, and we'll be preventing a
lot of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disease has long been one of humanity's scourges
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand how far we've come, and how much remains to be
done, it is critical to understand the history of the long struggle
against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has always been one of humanity's scourges, but the
stakes were raised in the 1950s and '60s as more and more people
began dying of cancer. Part of that was attributable to the longer
average lifespan of most Americans, since cancer is primarily a
disease of aging. More sedentary lifestyles and increasingly fatty
diets probably contributed as well. Most of all, however, smoking
caught on widely among men during World War I. Women joined in not
long after. A generation later the toll began to surface in the
form of soaring rates of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As cancer rates rose, doctors fought back, but with few weapons.
Researchers worked to add to the arsenal, but their approach was
hit-or-miss, relying more on happy accidents than on scientific
acumen.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened near the end of World War II, when an
Allied ship loaded with sulfur mustard, a poisonous gas the Germans
had used during World War I, blew up in Italy's Bari &UR;  &LR; Harbor.
Doctors treating the injured soldiers noticed that the gas had
curious effects on key components of the immune system _ white
blood cells were sharply depleted, lymphocytes were impaired, and
blood-forming bone marrow was damaged. That made them wonder: If
the gas impeded the normal workings of those cells, could it also
curb the much-feared lymphomas and leukemias in those tissues
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in New York, and other cancer centers ran experiments,
using a related gas called nitrogen mustard. The results, which
were kept secret until the end of the war, confirmed that cancers
did in fact regress when exposed to the gas, and patients got
better.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that medicine for the first time had an agent
able to shrink tumors, a discovery that seemed especially sweet
since it had been derived from an insidious poison. Soon,
researchers were using what they knew about mustard gas to concoct
other anticancer drugs.

 UNDATED: ... anticancer drugs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news was that the tumors didn't stay down for long,
generally didn't respond to a second round of treatment, and the
scientists didn't know what to do when the ``cure'' fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in 1955 there were relatively few anticancer
compounds that were active, relatively few patients that would
benefit from such treatments, and relatively few scientific leads
we could address and develop and apply,'' recalls Dr. Emil Frei,
now 74 and physician-in-chief emeritus at Boston's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early '60s, when Dr. George Canellos joined the
National Institutes of Health, things had begun to turn around.
``There was a spirit of discovery,'' says Canellos, now at
Dana-Farber. ``It opened my mind to the idea that drugs, medicine,
could be used to successfully treat cancer, where up to that time
there was only surgery.... To resurrect people you thought were
destined to die, you have no idea the feeling that gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   All America seemed to share the feeling that cancer was beatable
when, on Dec. 23, 1971, President Nixon signed the National Cancer
Act and launched a war on cancer he said should yield a cure within
five years. To a country that had managed to put a man on the moon
two years earlier, anything seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs were encouraging, at least in terms of sheer
activity. In the five years after the act was signed, Congress
appropriated more money for cancer than over the previous 33 years.
Cancer centers were funded across the country, and many of the
country's best scientists were drawn to the field. And there were
advances, big ones: &UR;  &LR; researchers developed powerful techniques for
hunting down and isolating genes; physicians pioneered ways to save
the limbs of young patients with bone cancer; and the US Food and
Drug Administration approved early anticancer drugs like
doxorubicin and cisplatin.
</P>
<P>
   But on the cancer wards, progress in beating back the deadly
disease wasn't happening as quickly as the public, and many
doctors, had envisioned. Some of the disappointment came from
chasing false leads. In the late 1960s and early '70s, many
scientists were drawn to the idea that viruses caused most cancers.
In the early 1980s, they hailed the protein interferon as a cure
for everything from cancer to the common cold, which proved too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fundamental, and more disturbing, was the growing
realization that cancer cells had an uncanny ability to resist
almost every drug thrown at them; some even found ways to spit out
toxic chemotherapies as fast as they were applied, eventually
resulting in the death of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the insight that cancer was not a single disease, but
``at least 100 different entities,'' as Dr. Donnall Thomas, Nobel
laureate and Seattle-based bone marrow transplant pioneer, puts it.
Making progress on one form, such as leukemia, often didn't help
with cancer of the lung, bladder, and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   At the discouraging bottom line were the numbers. Cancer deaths
rose an average of 0.4 percent per year between 1973 and 1990, and
the number of new cases climbed by 1.2 percent a year. Especially
frustrating were increases in lung, breast, and prostate cancer and
the rising death toll from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanomas.
This, doctors and patients agreed, wasn't what was supposed to
happen when America declared war on a disease.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it looked like a medical Vietnam. Critics suggested we
were losing the war and needed to radically rethink our strategy,
focusing more on prevention and boosting the budget for alternative
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of what is now 40 years of focus on treatment have
been seriously disappointing,'' says Dr. John Bailar. Bailar, a
biostatistician who chairs the Department of Health Studies at the
University of Chicago, is a longtime critic of the cancer
establishment, and remains unimpressed even with the recent
downturn in cancer deaths and incidence. The NCI and its sister
agencies haven't achieved as much as they should have for the money
spent, he says, and a lot of what they have achieved has come
through prevention, not treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the '70s, most cancer doctors believed they were
making progress. While critics suggested that position was designed
to perpetuate the unprecedented flow of tax dollars for research,
in retrospect their arguments were compelling. Scientists were
learning how the cancer cell differs from normal cells, an
understanding that often was advanced as much through their
failures as their successes. And despite the rising overall cancer
toll, progress was being made with cancer of the bladder, uterus,
and ovary; the seemingly relentless increases in rates of other
important cancers would finally reverse in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, personally, that the war on cancer was one of the
greatest experiments the US government ever did,'' says DeVita, the
former NCI chief. ``The information we have today on molecular
biology, on developmental biology, all those things came out of the
cancer program.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the researchers were not narrowly focused on
curing cancer. The knowledge fueling today's new cancer therapies
``is a brilliant vindication of curiosity-driven research,'' says
Robert Weinberg, a leading cancer scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge.
The keys, he adds, were that basic science took precedence over
immediate bedside applications, and funding came not just from the
NCI but from a variety of public and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In 1976, `the pieces finally came together'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although cancer is an ancient disease, researchers didn't
discover its root causes until two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans remember 1976 for its celebration of the nation's
bicentennial. But to cancer scientists, it was a watershed year
because, after decades of false starts and wrong turns in seeking
to unmask the origins of cancer, things suddenly went right.
</P>
<P>
   As Weinberg put it in a recent book, ``In one stroke, everything
fell into place. The pieces finally came together.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in the San Francisco laboratory of two
scientists, Harold Varmus, now the director of the National
Institutes of Health, and Dr. J. Michael Bishop, now chancellor of
the University of California in San Francisco. They showed that
cancer arises in human cells when certain normal genes _ later
shown to be controllers of cell growth and division _ are damaged
and metamorphose into cancer-causing ``oncogenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, an articulate scientist with a love of English and
metaphor, and Varmus, an Amherst College grad and
physician-turned-researcher, had teamed up in the '70s to study a
virus that causes cancer in chickens. That virus, it turned out,
does its dirty work by carrying a cancer-causing gene into chicken
cells: The gene triggers the cell's move to malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most stunning insight was yet to come. In 1974, a
researcher in the Bishop-Varmus lab found that normal chicken cells
already contained a copy of that cancer-causing gene, but in a
slightly different, harmless form. The virus had only borrowed _ or
stolen _ it. And not only that: Further experiments showed that
most animals, including humans, have carried this Jekyll-and-Hyde
gene, which can become a cancer-causing oncogene, for eons.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; These genes, scientists now know, can serve reliably for many
years but, when altered by chance, a carcinogenic chemical, or some
other damaging agent, can unleash a malignant monster.
</P>
<P>
   Some people inherit a damaged gene, making them highly
susceptible to cancer, often at a dismayingly young age. But most
cancers arise when genes are disrupted by chemicals, radiation,
dietary factors, or the aging process itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since that singular discovery _ for which Varmus and Bishop won
the Nobel Prize in 1989 _ scores of oncogenes have been discovered.
And in 1983, another important type of gene came to light. These
tumor suppressor genes normally keep a lid on overly-zealous cell
growth, but when they are mutated or missing, they allow cells to
divide rapidly and endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   What all those discoveries mean is that today, scientists know
that the human cell is controlled by a highly-complex set of
genetic signals that normally let cells grow and divide in an
orderly way as they replace other cells or repair the body. Cancer
is what happens when that control system breaks down or has missing
parts. Then, like a car with a stuck accelerator or no brakes, the
normal cell evolves into a rapidly dividing tumor cell that escapes
regulation and spawns millions or billions of similarly renegade
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   With this detailed picture of cancer in hand, scientists have
forged a new set of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally gotten a handle on a variety of genetic events
within the tumor and events associated with the development of
cancers, (and now we can) intervene and block those signals or
molecular events to interfere with the progression of cancer,''
says Samuel Waksal, chief executive officer of ImClone Systems in
New York, a biotech company that is developing sophisticated new
cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scores of new drugs are pouring from pharmaceutical and
biotech companies, each aimed at a specific link in the Rube
Goldberg-like chain of events that turns cells cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those medications, like the nearly two dozen
``angiogenesis inhibitors'' based on research by Harvard's Folkman
and others, aren't aimed at the cancer cell at all. Instead, they
seek to destroy the network of tiny blood vessels that surround and
support growing tumors. And because the cancer cell doesn't ``see''
the attack, it can't plot an escape plan.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's most potent anti-angiogenesis drugs, endostatin and
angiostatin, got a huge media bounce this spring even though they
aren't ready for human tests. The enthusiastic stories misleadingly
spoke of a ``cure'' and ``brought premature attention a little
earlier than people in the field wanted,'' Folkman said in a recent
interview. They also raised expectations to unrealistic levels,
although Folkman remains optimistic the drugs will prove effective
in people.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner, the NCI chief, is also optimistic about many of the
new therapies. ``I recognize that most of the ideas we test will
not work out, or we'll have to worm our way through a long
discovery process,'' he says. ``But it's very reasonable to be
excited and hopeful about the significant increase, maybe even an
exponential increase, in the number of ideas.... It's so hard to
describe how important that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are more cautious. One enormous obstacle, they
say, is that tumors are made up of many types of cancer cells,
possibly requiring attacks by combinations of several agents. They
also worry that the new biologic drugs are hard to make and
expensive to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned over the years,'' says Dr. Howard Fine, who
is trying angiogenesis inhibitors in brain tumor patients at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, ``is that cancer cells are smarter
than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lots of progress, but cure is still elusive
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been emotionally and financially backing the
battle against the wily cancer cell for 27 years. Now they're being
told that, while there is clear-cut progress, an out-and-out cure
may never come. All of which raises the question: Does the nation
have the resolve to keep going?
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls suggest it does, in a big way. Eighty-four
percent of Americans think there will be a cure for cancer in the
next 50 years, and 64 percent are confident it will happen within a
decade, according to a nationwide Gallup survey conducted in May.
In another Gallup poll last fall, respondents ranked cancer as
America's second most urgent health problem, tied with rising
medical costs and trailing only AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems equally committed, even congressional
Republicans normally wary of expensive federal programs. While
President Clinton has called for a 50- percent hike in funding for
the NIH and NCI over the next five years, Congress seems determined
to spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress is, I think, poised to double funding for NIH
over a five-year period,'' says Representative John Porter, an
Illinois Republican who chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees funding for medical research. On the
Democratic side of the aisle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, an architect of the 1971 National Cancer Act, is
equally determined: ``I'm strongly in favor of doubling the NIH
budget now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that resolve, and with evidence that death rates are
declining, more than 1,500 Americans will die of cancer every day
this year. And the millions more who are suffering from the disease
are determined to know what's available now, as well as what's
happening in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the day you're diagnosed with cancer, you have no reason
to wonder whether or not what the scientists are saying is true,''
says Laurel Simmons of Cambridge, a graduate student in public
health who was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1987,
but is symptom-free today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are diagnosed,'' she adds, ``they tell you what your
chances of getting out of the hospital alive are. And one of the
first things people do, in a variety of ways, is confront the
possibility of their death.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One way cancer clinicians are trying to reduce such
possibilities is by using their new understanding of how the cancer
cell works to alter the diet, adjust workplace conditions, clean up
environmental carcinogens, change dangerous habits like smoking,
and take other steps to prevent cancer. ``The deep understanding of
the genetics of cancer development in cells that lead them to
become cancer may well have its most profound effect on prevention,
ultimately, rather than on treatment,'' says Klausner.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that and other new weapons, America and its leaders
seem determined to recommit the country to the war on cancer that
they launched 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem thinking about it as a war,'' says Varmus,
the NIH chief. ``The problem is, there's not going to be a day of
surrender. There will be continual battles _ and winning on one
front, like testicular cancer or childhood leukemia, or isolating
genes that let you make risk assessments _ are steps forward. But
they don't cause the other fronts to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a good deal of incremental advances on multiple
fronts... but this is unlike a war where all you need is to take
that last bridge.''

ENDANGERED WOLF APPARENTLY KILLED BY MOUNTAIN LION

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Another endangered Mexican gray wolf, one of 11
released into the wild in eastern Arizona this spring, is dead
after an apparent battle with a mountain lion over food.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and conservationists are lamenting the death of the
female wolf, which earlier this year gave birth to the first
Mexican gray wolf born in the American wilderness in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only seven wolves, including the pup, are roaming free in
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest under the watch of U.S. Fish
and Wildlife agents who hope to repopulate the species.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a wolf was shot and killed by a retired postal worker
who said he fired at it out of fear for himself and his family when
it approached their campsite.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities decided not to prosecute Richard Humphrey of Tucson
and are standing by their conclusion that he acted in self-defense,
a Fish and Wildlife spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, investigators are confident that nature is
responsible for the latest wolf death.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident, while unfortunate, is certainly nature at
work,'' said Tom Bauer, a spokesman with Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists monitoring the wolves were alerted to the death
Friday by a citizen who saw the animal lying not far from a gravel
Forest Service road just south of Williams Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf had a bite-sized piece missing from its shoulder and
had bled profusely. It appears she probably had an encounter with a
mountain lion over prey,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reached the conclusion after finding an elk calf
carcass just 5 yards from the body of the wolf. However, the wolf's
body was shipped to the National Forensics Laboratory in Ashland,
Ore., for a necropsy to determine the official cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the wolves set free under the conservation
program, the wolf killed was born and raised in captivity. The
mother wolf was born four years ago at the Binder Park Zoo in
Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer noted that the program is an experiment that requires the
wolves to adapt to the wild and acquire survival skills they never
needed in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until she was released into the wild, I doubt she'd ever seen
an elk, so I doubt if she'd seen a mountain lion either,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who have debated whether the wolves will be
capable of surviving in the wild, also are divided about what the
death means for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and it's a setback and it's hugely unfortunate that
it happened to the mother of the pup, but . . . it certainly
doesn't signal the failure of the reintroduction,'' said Craig
Miller, a representative of Defenders of Wildlife, a national
conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmentalists, however, are concerned for the safety
of the remaining wolves and are pushing for a reopening into the
April wolf shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is falling short of what it could be,'' said Shane
Jimerfield, assistant director of the Southwest Center for
Biological Diversity in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and biologists alike are united in hopes
that the pup will survive now with only one parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pup was born about May and had been weaned and was eating
solid food before this incident,'' Bauer said. After the death,
investigators saw the surviving mate return to the site and drag
the elk carcass back to the pup where both fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to increase our monitoring of our male and the
pup, but we will not attempt to capture and relocate them,'' Bauer
said. &QL;

CONTEST: GOD'S WOES USING A PC FOR CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What if God used a computer to create the universe?
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about that since my way-cool neighbors, Rick
and Jacquie, brought over a humorous posting they found online.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who wrote it, but it's all about how God tries to
create the universe with a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by problems at the DOS prompt, including the dreaded
``Abort-Retry-Fail'' error message, God finally goes out and buys a
Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Funny.
</P>
<P>
   It would explain a lot, though:
</P>
<P>
   - The Big Bang? No more mystery there. That was simply the first
recorded use of Pkunzip, the popular decompression software.
</P>
<P>
   - The difference between Mars and Earth? Turns out The Almighty
was testing a shareware program, Galaxy Lite, when he made Mars.
But he upgraded to Galaxy Pro before he made Earth.
</P>
<P>
   - Can't button your jeans anymore? God loaded Windows 98 and
switched to the FAT32 storage system. Now everything on Earth has
to fit into a smaller space.
</P>
<P>
   Got some examples of your own? Let's have a contest!
</P>
<P>
   Send me your best stuff. We'll collect entries for a few days,
then we'll publish the funniest and most interesting here.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Got a student heading to school? Then you may be in the market
for a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, parents go through the same agony.
Should they buy new or used? Should they buy a PC or a Macintosh?
Should they buy retail or mail order?
</P>
<P>
   The options are even more confusing this season, as Apple
Computer prepares to market its new iMac and as the sub-$1,000 PC
market has mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, with its cool shape and translucent blue case, is
expected to be a hot seller at about $1,200. It's compact, fast and
genuinely interesting _ just the machine your student might need
for the dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, PCs still dominate the market. The only
problem with going the PC route is choosing the right machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two suggestions if you are in the market:
</P>
<P>
   - Check Arizona Central's PC Page. We have a new story online
about how to choose a computer. It's complete with tips and links
to other online resources. Find the story at www.azcentral.com/com &QL; 
puting/news/pc/index.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   - Check the Sept. 1 edition of ``PC`` magazine. It's got a great
article on PCs that cost less than $1,000. The magazine tested 37
models, and rated each for things like reliability and value.
</P>
<P>
   While sub-$1,000 machines might not offer cutting-edge
components, they are not exactly junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC'' magazine points out that buy ers can expect such low-end
machines to contain Pentium II processors, 3- or 4-gigabyte hard
drives, 4 megabytes of video RAM and 32-speed CD-ROM drives. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
Password: h-e-a-d-a-c-h-e &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passwords are required everywhere these days _ the ATM, your
Internet account, logging on to your computer at work, unlocking
the keypad of your cellular telephone . . . the list goes on and
on.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to find someone with five or more passwords.
Charlie Pabst, a summer intern at Arizona Central, claims to have
10 passwords he uses regularly.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find advice on how to create passwords. Generally,
they should be six to eight characters long and include a random
mixture of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. They
shouldn't be actual words, because passwords that contain words or
word combinations are easy to crack. And you should change your
passwords every three months or so.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you remember passwords? Now that's my problem. I've
got a copy of Microsoft's Front Page 98 on my computer at home. But
I can't use it because I've forgotten the darned password. (I'm
sure there's a solution, but I haven't had time to worry about it.)
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do? Do you write them down somewhere? Scratch
them into the paint under your desk? Carry them around in your
wallet? Or do you just have a great memory?
</P>
<P>
   Send in your suggestions for remembering passwords to
dhoye(at)pni.com, and I'll share the best with everybody. &QL;

Be a part of history &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Did you once work on Eniac, the world's first large-scale
computer?
</P>
<P>
   Did you participate in the research and development of the first
microprocessor?
</P>
<P>
   Did you once own a TRS-80, an Amiga, an Acorn, an Apple II or a
PET?
</P>
<P>
   Have you been using computers all your life, and are you full of
interesting stories about the many makes and models you've gone
through?
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll stop asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the gig: We're looking for computer users of all ages and
backgrounds to help us with a special online project.
</P>
<P>
   Without letting the cat out of the bag, we can say we are
interested in talking to people with stories or experiences to
share about the computers in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you still own the machine or whether you
are working or retired or a student. If you can tell us a story or
two about a particular computer, let us know!

UNWARY AMERICANS JAILED IN MEXICO OVER GUNS, AMMO 
</HEADLINE>
 JAIL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Perhaps they missed the signs this side of the border,
warning travelers against carting guns and ammunition into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they thought they'd get away with it. Or perhaps they
didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, 29 Americans are jailed in Sonora, Mexico,
for violating Mexico's strict gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, a Scottsdale businessman, has been in a Nogales,
Sonora, jail for three weeks since Mexican customs officials found
ammunition and a pistol case in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   James Brunen, 45, went to Mexico on July 23 to buy some pots as
a gift for a relative and simply forgot he had the cartridges, his
wife, Merry Brunen, said Monday. When he realized the ammunition
was in the back of his vehicle, he alerted customs officials. But
it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder, his wife said, landed him in the middle of his
worst nightmare: a filthy holding cell with 46 other men, many
suffering from hepatitis. There are 20 cots and dozens of rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a cage that didn't have a chair, a bed, a sink or a
toilet and it was flooded with backed-up sewage,'' Merry Brunen
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story U.S. State Department and Mexican officials call
all too familiar since Mexican authorities began enforcing a
federal law that forbids U.S. citizens from taking firearms or
ammunition into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying even a single round of ammunition into Mexico can carry
a penalty of up to five years in jail, even if it is taken in
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At least 29 Americans are incarcerated in Sonora for firearms
violations committed during the first half of the year. And an
increasing number of Americans are getting nabbed along the
U.S.-Mexico border nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about these cases about visitors who
don't know the Mexican law,'' said Miguel Angel Isidro, acting
consul general of Mexico in Phoenix. ``This is a law that applies
to everybody in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a warning last week to inform
travelers of the firearm restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Where little was heard about gun arrests in the 1980s, Mexico
has stepped up enforcement of its 1972 munitions law over the past
three years, amid concerns that smuggled arms have been used in
rebel uprisings, assassinations and drug wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for people to understand that we cannot bail
them out and the long arm of the American law does not reach across
sovereign borders,'' State Department spokeswoman Maria Rudensky
said.
</P>
<P>
   James Brunen is learning that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   His wife has contacted a handful of attorneys, Arizona's
congressmen and the American Consulate in Hermosillo, but to no
avail. A judge ordered Brunen to remain in custody until he is
tried, which could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Sen. John McCain and Rep. J.D. Hayworth have spoken
with authorities in Mexico, but can't do much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in contact with the Hermosillo consulate and are doing
all that we legally can to make sure that he is being treated
fairly,'' said Hayworth's spokesman, Doug Nick. ``We can't do much
beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brunen's wife drives down nearly every day to deliver
bottled water, canned food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   She also brings cash to help pay for small perks, such as a swig
of clean water or a slightly bigger cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to buy a breath of fresh air. He had to buy protection
for his food. He had to buy the right to use a phone and the price
went up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry Brunen cautioned American travelers to make sure they are
not packing weapons if they head south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very dangerous,'' she said. ``I'm living it and it is
real.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All around me, a lively crowd lines the counter and
fills the booths at Florent, slurping up mussels and pate like
there's no tomorrow. Which is slightly unsettling, because there is
a tomorrow _ and it's only about four hours away.
</P>
<P>
   New York has always had a late-night subculture of 24-hour
diners. But now, with a growing number of affluent artists,
entrepreneurs and Wall Streeters working long, hard hours, the
city's high-end restaurateurs are beginning to stay up late
themselves, and offer serious food from fondue to sauteed skate,
all through the night.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Clementine expanded its late-night menu, tempting night
crawlers with dishes like grilled stuffed squid in a cumin broth as
late as 3:15 a.m. Match Downtown serves dim sum, braised short ribs
and a grilled tuna burger with green papaya slaw and miso mustard
sauce until 4 a.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   At One 3 Barrow, between midnight and 3 a.m., you can have
barbecue Asian pork with summer corn and a star anise broth or a
tandoori chicken pizza with fig chutney.
</P>
<P>
   After midnight at Astor Restaurant and Lounge, a featherweight
chilled cucumber soup with anise and dill goes head to head with a
brawny braised lamb shank with pistachio couscous, root vegetables
and a pomegranate lamb juice.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new Mercer Kitchen, a restaurant run by Jean Georges
Vongerichten, a four-star chef, plans in September to serve a
condensed dinner menu until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, is interested in short ribs at 4 in the
morning. As the hours get weer, the crowds in these restaurants
don't always shrink, but they do narrow, revealing a late-night
personality distinct from the suits, students, foodies and fashion
types of the regular dinner hour.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of a few of them. Not surprisingly, most of
the restaurants with late-night menus are downtown, orbiting the
nucleus of Manhattan's clubs and bars. Uptown, the pickings are
slim. On the Upper East Side, for instance, the Lenox Room has what
it calls an ``After Rush Menu.'' It begins at 9:30 p.m., about the
time genuine late-nighters are just digesting lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper West Side is no better. A French Roast outpost keeps a
dim flicker of life going on Broadway. So does High Life, which
serves sushi to drinkers spilling out of the bars on Amsterdam
Avenue, as well as Avenue, a casual French spot on Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENTINE Clementine gets the publishing crowd for lunch and an
eclectic mix for dinner, but once they flee around 11 p.m., in
flocks a rowdy group of young Wall Streeters in suits and women in
tight-fitting clothes. There is no velvet rope but you do have to
get by a bouncer with an earpiece _ Moomba-style _ to get into the
dimly lit bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the destination before the destination,'' said John
Schenk, the chef and co-owner of the restaurant. People drop in,
drink cocktails at the long 34-seat bar while waiting for their
friends to arrive. A disk jockey keeps the mood bouyant with a mix
of retro jazz, hip-hop and drum and bass.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, the oval booths go quickly and food starts
appearing. You see a burger here and there, but this is a sharing
crowd. And the kitchen, which is open until 3:15 a.m., has found
just the right food: quick hits of clean, sharp flavors, tender
bites of salty sausage or cheese, salads for slim figures and good
bread to soak up the cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, diners seem to spend most of their time on cell
phones, deciding where to go next. Personally, I'd rather stay and
eat. The salmon toasts are phenomenal. Small round toasts are
rubbed with just enough wasabi to make your nose tingle, the salmon
is rich and smoky and a little grated cucumber slakes the palate.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a fried soft shell crab BLT, veal paillard with
fava beans, chopped salad, caviar with toast points and creme
fraiche, and even Jiffy Pop popcorn. And the Clementini, made with
vodka and clementine juice isn't a bad drink, sweet but slick
enough to slide down with ease. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE RIBBON
</P>
<P>
   Blue Ribbon Sushi has long been a standard for downtowners, but
its late-night relative, Blue Ribbon, is the place that chefs and
people in the food industry flock to after work. And like everyone
who goes there, they, too, wait in line to get in. Even after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Flay, chef at Bolo and Mesa Grill, still goes there now
and then. ``I used to go with Mario Batali and Matthew Kenney and
my partner Lawrence, Alan Harding or Joe Bastianich and we'd be
there until 4 in the morning,'' he said. ``Mario would just keep
ordering wine.'' But then, he said, everybody got really busy with
more restaurants, cooking shows and the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a younger group of up and coming chefs is picking up the
slack. And they are no less zealous. After midnight on a recent
evening, Erica Miller, chef at Blue Star, met Chris Santos, the
chef at Time Cafe North, and Colleen Grapes, the pastry chef at
Time Cafe North, for ``dinner''.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite booth,'' said Ms. Miller, as she slid into
the tall, round, red velvet booth. ``I am soo hungry,'' she said.
``When you cook you don't eat, you know.'' An order of foie gras
terrine was delivered on cue.
</P>
<P>
   They studied the menu intensely and gossiped about the food
world. ``All day long you cook for people,'' Ms. Grapes said. ``So
it's nice to have people cook for you.''
</P>
<P>
   They kept the kitchen busy, ordering raw oysters, more foie gras
terrine, cheese fondue and beef marrow with marmalade, hallah and
sea salt.
</P>
<P>
   Around the room, oysters from the raw bar abounded, stacked on
top of the small square tables. Diners were well dressed, some in
silk, some in Polo. Meanwhile, others sat on benches outside and
stood sandwiched by the bar waiting for tables. It could have
easily passed for early evening.
</P>
<P>
   But it was indeed 2 a.m., and as Ms. Miller lamented, spreading
more foie gras on a piece of toasted brioche, ``I have to be back
at work by 8.'' The Sunday brunch crowd, now well into dreamland,
would soon be up and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   IL BUCO
</P>
<P>
   It began as an antique store. Then it was an antique store that
served wine and cheese. Then it was an antique store during the day
and a restaurant serving lusty Mediterranean food at night. And
now? Well, it's just a restaurant with a lot of antiques. The food
is still lusty, and the hours have only gotten later.
</P>
<P>
   Il Buco doesn't really warm up until 10 p.m. And once it does,
people linger for hours, lulled by the Spanish wines, the flamenco
music, and the candle lighting, which casts seductive shadows
through the rustic room.
</P>
<P>
   The menu changes daily, and house rules are contingent on
pleasure. Smoking, a regular customer said, is permitted after
11:30 p.m. as long as no one complains. At the copper bar, they
have only top shelf liquor, no soda and all juices are freshly
squeezed. ``Because the owner doesn't believe in serving any
junk,'' said Mark Henegan, the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Henegan slinks through the room like a cat, making sure everyone
is content and entertained. He points to a man at the bar having a
heart-to-heart with someone on his cell phone while hovering over
risotto with shrimp, ``He's French.''
</P>
<P>
   Then to a foursome at one of the long wood farm tables in the
corner, ``They're, I don't know, not American.'' And two more, ``Ah
yes, there's two Spaniards.'' The crowd is European, but not
Eurotrash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for a little drink, a little conversation, a
little I don't know,'' he says, then smiles.
</P>
<P>
   I do _ great food like warm roasted asparagus slathered with
goat cheese, grilled chicken livers wrapped in pancetta, a tangle
of grilled prawns sprinkled with sea salt and striped bass with
roasted clams and fresh corn. With the bread, comes a plate of
unfiltered Umbrian olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is currently open until 1 a.m. ``This isn't even
late though,'' Donna Lennard, an owner, said without an ounce of
irony in her voice. ``We're going to start opening late in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORENT
</P>
<P>
   Any self-respecting, late-night diner has been to Florent at
least once. The diner style restaurant is open all night, open to
anyone who will make the journey to the meat-packing district to
get there.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 a.m. on a recent morning, an Asian woman in a long,
straight dress, sitting with two friends, polished off a bowl of
steamed mussels, had a dessert of cigarettes, then laid down on the
long banquette to take a nap. The server came buy and picked up the
empty bowl without batting an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flotilla DeBarge, a cabaret performer, grooved to the
disco music on the sound system as she made her way through the
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hyped after doing a show,'' she said. ``I come for a cup
of coffee, the lentil salad and mussels and frites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know who or what you're going to see in here,'' she
said, paused, then smiled, ``Like me.'' Though she has spotted
celebrities like Matt Dillon and Marilyn Manson, she was quick to
add, ``I don't want you to think it's some celebrity-gawking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeBarge brings her own music for the restaurant to play,
too. ``Yeah, that's what drag queens do,'' said Jose Pita, the
manager, as he passed by with a plate of fried eggs. ``They bring
their own music. They don't tolerate anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   A tone of tolerance is the beauty of this place. Worlds that
might normally collide in daylight, seem to harmonize under
Florent's hazy pink light. While Ms. DeBarge continued to sway to
the rhythm at the counter, a man from Nashville in the fashion
industry with a starched plaid shirt and dress watch picked at a
plate of eggs and toast at a nearby table.
</P>
<P>
   He and two friends, one an investment banker, the other also in
the fashion business, had started the evening with dinner at
Gramercy Tavern, then went to Tramps and Automatic Slims. Their
evening nearly over, he added, ``You know, one thing you can say
about this place. It's the best music we've heard all night.''
</P>
<P>
   CAFETERIA
</P>
<P>
   By the looks of the crowd at Cafeteria, a new restaurant in
Chelsea, you might think that when you call for a reservation, they
ask you to wear either black or white (and bare shoulders, please,
if you are a woman), so that you blend into the cool, white,
minimal dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Until 11 p.m. the dining room is loud and crowded, the wait at
least an hour. But then it trims down. The noise level lowers to a
buzz, people hang on each other a little more, the people streaming
in wear less clothing and drinks get dealt out like cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the food _ which is part California, part diner and nowhere
in between _ keeps pumping out of the kitchen. There is a delicious
macaroni and cheese, a spicy fried oyster po boy that looks like
it's on steroids, as well as tuna tartare and a large, leafy salad
weighed down with sliced avocado. The men eat, the women pick.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Newton, a co-owner of the restaurant, said he got the idea
for Cafeteria while in Los Angeles. ``Because there's nothing to
eat after midnight in L.A.,'' he said. He seems to have hit a
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a scene,'' said Jared Kurtz, a bartender at
Bowery Bar, who was there celebrating a friend's birthday. ``Going
to these places reminds me why I left L.A.'' &QL;

VETO STYMIES PHILANTHROPIST'S SUPPORT OF AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Billionaire philanthropist George Soros is trying
to get around one of the governor's budget vetoes to share some of
his wealth with the state to fund after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, who is committed to finding ways to keep young people
occupied a few hours a day after school, planned on giving New York
state $3.33 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wanted to give a dollar for every $3 in government funding
for after-school programs, said Vincent Marrone, government
relations director for The After School Corp., the New York City
financier's not-for-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   However, that plan to partially match state funding got dashed
when Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, vetoed $10 million in
after-school funding approved by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost free money,'' said Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan,
chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. ``I think that the
governor's veto demonstrated, incredibly, short-sightedness and bad
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who liked the after-school program concept, provided $1
million in his budget plan in January for ``Advantage Schools,'' a
new after-school program that he promised to fund with $10 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the program would bring together schools,
parents and community organizations to provide a secure and
enriching environment for children before parents are home from
work. He planned to tap philanthropic funds from Soros to build the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, however, vetoed the $10 million along with $750
million in what he called ``new, unnecessary spending.'' Alan Ray,
an Education Department spokesman, said his department has provided
$5 million for after-school programs in recent years. This year, he
said, the budget increased to $15 million with 80 percent of the
increase available for school districts and 20 percent available to
community-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The money is available on a competitive basis and the criteria
for eligibility are weighted toward neediest districts and neediest
students.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wants to fund only programs in schools aided with public
money that offer structured activities in academic, athletic,
recreational, art, music, drama and other areas of educational and
cultural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Marrone said he was working with the state Office of Child and
Family Services in attempts to match its $500,000 budget for
after-school programs with about $166,666.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for as many places as we can to partner,''
Marrone said, adding that New York City schools will receive about
$3 million to match $9 million in public commitment.

 By BETTY FUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when everyone is singing ``This Is the Moment'' at the peak
of the sweet-corn season in August, I get cranky. No matter how
fresh and sweet the corn that shoppers are assaulting in a
strip-and-search frenzy at green markets and roadside stands, what
I want to know is, Why can't I find a single ear of my
grandfather's beloved Silver Queen?
</P>
<P>
   Silver Queen is the last of those old-fashioned sweet corns that
this generation's farming forebears loved to plant and eat _ corns
with names like Stowell's Evergreen, Country Gentleman, Golden
Bantam; corns that taste the way corn ought to taste.
</P>
<P>
   For 150 years, breeders have experimented constantly with sweet
corns to improve flavor, texture, tenderness, appearance, growing
time and hardiness.
</P>
<P>
   It's only in the last 20 years, however, that corn engineers
have rocketed corn from sweet to sweeter to supersonic sweetness
and thus changed the face of the sweet corn market.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineering has changed old-fashioned types like Silver
Queen, now called ``normals,'' into sweeter types called ``sugar
enhanced'' and triply sweet types called ``supersweets.''
Bioengineering is the reason supersweet corn can be found in
supermarkets year round _ and the reason find Silver Queen can't be
found in farmers' markets at the height of the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Building a sweeter ear of corn has its advantages _ a longer
shelf life, for one _ but it has left a lot of corn lovers with
only a remembrance of corn past.
</P>
<P>
   In my grandfather's day, rushing corn from field to pot was the
only way to get the optimum sweetness, because once the ear was
picked, its kernels would begin to convert their sugar to starch.
Not anymore. Nowadays, sweet corn is bred to delay conversion,
under refrigeration, for 48 hours or more, to retain sweetness
during shipping and storing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, breeders categorize all sweet corns as one of three
types, based on genetic characteristics that interfere to a greater
or lesser degree with the natural conversion of sugar to starch.
But there's a huge gap between those who breed and grow corn and
those who buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are likely to identify their favorite sweet corns by
color: white, yellow or bicolored. But it's the genetic variety,
not the color, that determines flavor and texture, and each of the
three ``sweet'' gene types comes in all three colors.
</P>
<P>
   Normals, or old-fashioned types like the white Silver Queen, are
``sugary,'' which means they contain 5 percent to 10 percent sugar
before any of it is changed to starch. Other normals, still grown
in backyard gardens but not commercially, include white varieties
like Pearl White and Platinum Lady and bicolors like Calypso, Sweet
Sue, Seneca Horizon and Cornfetti.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of yellow normals, Merit and Jubilee, are still the
standard commercial corns for freezing and canning because
production lines have been built around them and people have come
to expect a certain taste and texture in canned or frozen corn.
</P>
<P>
   At the next level of sweetness are the sugar-enhanced types,
with 15 percent to 25 percent sugar. Most farmers I've talked to
grow recent varieties of the enhanced types as their main-season
sweet corns, like white Argent and Incredible or yellow Miracle,
because they are quicker and easier to grow and market than
normals. These are the corns sold in green markets and sometimes in
grocery stores, when they are selling local varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the supersweet types, which produce as much
as 25 percent to 35 percent sugar. They are known as shrunken corn
because as they dry, their kernels tend to shrivel more than those
with less sugar. Any sweet-corn kernel will shrink some, said
Margaret Smith, a corn breeder at the Cornell University College of
Agriculture in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But supersweets, like yellow Sweetie, white Even Sweeter and
bicolor Twice as Nice, shrink more because the sugar solution they
are filled with doesn't maintain the kernels' shape as well as the
starch that's present in lower-sugar corn.
</P>
<P>
   Supersweets have captured the largest share of the commercial
fresh corn market in the last decade, Kristian Holmstrom of Rutgers
Cooperative Extension said, because producers want corn that ships
better and customers want corn that tastes sweeter _ and even
sweeter _ no matter what its texture. For 10 years, Florida has
dominated the commercial sweet-corn crop, shipping supersweet
varieties nationally from October to June, until summer crops ripen
locally.
</P>
<P>
   If only sweetness were all. Fooling with genes, said Don
Prostak, a corn breeder formerly with Rutgers Cooperative Extension
who now runs a company of his own, may mean giving up some
attractive qualities to get others.
</P>
<P>
   Supersweets tend to have tougher and thicker skins, which make
their kernels less tender and harder to remove from the cob. ``My
mother despises supersweets,'' Holmstrom said. ``She finds them
tough and chewy. She likes a kernel that pops like a grape instead
of crunches like an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complain that supersweets taste more like sugar than
corn, but what is the taste of corn?
</P>
<P>
   To a plant man like Holmstrom, ``corn should taste the way corn
smells when it's silking,'' when the silks push out of the tip of
the ear.
</P>
<P>
   To a chef like David Page, the owner of Home and Drovers Tap
Room in Greenwich Village, corn should taste like the yellow corn
of his childhood. ``With a yellow corn like Jubilee I'm seeing the
corn I grew up with in Wisconsin,'' Page said. ``Where I came from,
corn is yellow, and you put yellow corn in your mouth, you're
eating corn. It tastes different if it's white, you know what I
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, people have trouble describing what they mean. They
remember what good old-fashioned corn tastes like. But what is
that, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests, as reported by William F. Tracy, a
sweet-corn expert at the University of Wisconsin, flavor is
identified by aromas released in cooking and the aroma most often
described as ``corny'' contains the chemical compound dimethyl
sulfide. Corn's aroma _ which has so much to do with its taste _
ranges from from fruity and grainy to musty, sulfurous, fecal and
rotten egglike. Somehow, this collection of aromas can be
appealing, like the aromas of aged cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Creaminess is a quality that depends less on corn variety than
on the maturity of the ear when it is picked. Some roadside stands
label their picked corn ``light'' or ``heavy,'' depending on when
the farmer picked it.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the kernel is watery; later, the liquid thickens until
it gets as heavy as cream. My grandfather used to cut a kernel with
his thumbnail, and if it squirted ``milk,'' it was ripe for
picking. But creaminess also depends on freshness, and even though
supersweet corn will not lose sweetness during shipping, creaminess
is often long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Local farmers in the Northeast see big disadvantages in growing
supersweets, so they mostly grow sugar-enhanced varieties. The
supersweets don't tolerate cold well and they must be isolated from
other varieties to prevent cross-pollination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, I found a couple of farmers at the Union Square
Greenmarket who prefer supersweets. One is Alex Paffenroth, a
descendant of onion farmers in Warwick, N.Y., who now plants
bicolor corns for his main-season crop. But he's not about to
reveal their names. ``There's a lot of competition out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Tim Stanton of Bulich Farms in Catskill, N.Y. He
finds a supersweet white like Snowman far superior to Silver Queen
because it grows faster and is sweeter and more ``refined.'' Silver
Queen takes 92 days to ripen. Generally it's only older people who
want the tenderness of older types of corn; young people, Stanton
finds, look for a certain crunch.
</P>
<P>
   But most farmers I've talked to prefer the middle-ground
sugar-enhanced types, which balance sweetness with tenderness and
that evanescent corn flavor (even if it doesn't satisfy the
nostalgia for old varieties).
</P>
<P>
   Henry Smith, whose Sycamore Farms in Middletown, N.Y., supplies
one of the largest corn stands at the Union Square Greenmarket,
favors sugar-enhanced white Argent over Silver Queen because it
matures six days faster, weathers storms better (it's about three
feet shorter than the 11-foot Silver Queen) and has a better ``tip
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the ear where the silks emerge is the tip, and the
tighter the husks close over it the less it can be damaged by
birds.
</P>
<P>
   For a farmer, the main advantage of supersweet types is that
they allow more time for transport. Along with Argent, Smith plants
three more supersweet types, for protection against against
variations in the weather. And by planting a new batch each week,
he keeps corn coming until the first frost in the fall. Each batch,
he said, has its optimum moment every eight days, and that's what
he gets to the market as fast as he can, picking at 6 a.m. to sell
it at Union Square by 10.
</P>
<P>
   Customers should be aware, he warned, that no matter what
variety the farmer plants, drought or rain changes flavor. They
should not expect a perfect ear every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are very critical,'' he said with a sigh. ``They
can taste three days of rain, and they'll complain that the corn
isn't sweet enough. But they're not taking into account that the
plant can't put sugar into corn in the rain. It needs sun for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers, like many chefs, don't have a single favorite for
eating because they want a variety of types to play with. ``Of
course I want the freshest imaginable corn, whatever its kind,''
Page said. ``But it's like fish: I don't want to eat salmon each
time, no matter how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs who have sampled the world's field corns may agree
with the grilling expert Steven Raichlen: ``All corn is better
grilled,'' he said. It improves even a supersweet type, because it
adds charred and smoke flavors and textures to make the taste less
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   But for the uncompromising hunters of Silver Queen and kin all
is not lost. My current Seed Savers catalog lists 74 varieties of
heirloom sweet corns, including Golden Bantam and Silver Queen.
That's down from the 300 varieties listed by the government in
1934, but I needn't despair. ``Ten years from now we'll still be
talking `normals,''' said Stephen Reiners, a horticulturist at
Cornell. ``But maybe they'll be sold as very special gourmet corns,
valued for their rarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Just when I'd abandoned my quest for Silver Queen, I
came across a shy farmer from Ulster County at the Union Square
Greenmarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I grow Silver Queen,'' said the farmer, Bernie
Caradonna. ``Doesn't everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Caradonna doesn't grow a lot _ just 8 of the 80 acres he has in
corn _ but he has grown it since he started farming eight years
ago, even though the batch he planted in mid-May is just now ready
for picking. (He said he expects to take the first of the crop to
the Greenmarket on Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Queen takes a long time getting here, but it always
comes,'' he said. ``Very reliable, very productive _ at least two
ears and sometimes three per stalk. Our old-time customers upstate
always ask for it. It's got that big white ear, milky, full of
corny flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   As an old-timer, I could have kissed him. &QL;

   1 bright-skinned orange
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon anchovy paste (or salt to taste)
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon pureed chipotle chili in adobo
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped scallions
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon dried tarragon
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves
</P>
<P>
   6 ears fresh sweet corn, in husks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a sharp vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the
orange and set aside. Cut the orange in half, and squeeze and
reserve { cup of the juice. In the container of a blender, combine
the orange zest, orange juice, anchovy paste, chipotle puree, lemon
juice, scallions and dried tarragon. Puree until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the butter to
bubbling. With the motor of the blender running, add the butter
through the opening in the lid. When the mixture is smooth and
slightly thickened, transfer to a serving dish, and stir in the
fresh tarragon leaves. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare a medium-low fire on the grill. Turn back the husks
of the corn without removing them, and remove the corn silk. Rinse
the ears well in water, and replace the husks so they cover the
kernels. Place the corn on the grill, and cook, turning, to gently
steam, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the corn to a platter, carefully
remove the husks and put the ears back on the grill. Grill,
turning, just long enough to scorch slightly on all sides, 2 to 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, brush the hot corn lightly with the seasoned
butter. Pass the extra butter in a serving dish.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. &QL;

   Q: Does the Roman numeral IV have any significance with the
naming of the Ivy League?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Information Please Sports Almanac and other
sources, the term ``Ivy League'' was coined by a New York
Herald-Tribune sportswriter in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The name was inspired by ivy-covered walls at member schools:
Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Princeton and
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   There's unsubstantiated speculation that Columbia, Harvard,
Princeton and Yale were dubbed the ``IV league'' in the late 1800s
after forming a four-member football association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Columbia is replaced by Penn in the telling,''
Margaret Smagorinsky writes in a 1993 Princeton historical
publication. ``This is interesting, if true, but why did it take
over 100 years to enter into Princeton's history?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Matt Damon was my student in 1983 when I was teaching
language arts in Cambridge, Mass. He was very bright and talented.
Where can I write to tell him how proud I am to have known him?

   The actor, who turns 28 on Oct. 8, is currently appearing in
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Later this year he'll be reteaming with
Ben Affleck for ``Dogma'' and with Edward Norton in ``Rounders.''

CLINTON'S VISIT LUCRATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis doesn't care that
President Clinton will testify next week about whether he had a
sexual relationship with a White House intern. And aides say Davis
doesn't pay much attention to talk of impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee for governor is less interested in the
president's sex life than in his ability to attract money _ big
money _ for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in California Tuesday for three fund-raising events
to help the Davis campaign, which expects to rake in upwards of $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little bit helps,'' said Michael Bustamante, Davis'
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Party officials say Clinton remains their
``No. 1 asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party strategists question why Davis and his campaign
would seek the president's help now, just days before the president
testifies before a federal grand jury about his relationship with
former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking a huge gamble,'' said Mike Madrid, political
director for the California Republican Party. ``They're saying
let's get him here and raise a million dollars, and it doesn't
matter what may happen in a month. Here is a man (Davis) who will
have taken in a million dollars from someone involved in perhaps
the greatest sex scandal in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Clinton remains popular, even though many Americans
believe he lied when he denied having an affair with Lewinsky. A
CBS News poll last week found that 76 percent of those surveyed
said they believed the president had an affair. Yet 63 percent said
the matter should never have been investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's support has remained strong in California. Analysts
and allies of the president say people here see the investigation
as a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to see a resolution to this,'' said Rep.
Ellen O. Tauscher, D-Calif., who said she believed the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see the president doing the job he was elected to
do,'' said Tauscher, a first-term House member running for
re-election this fall. ``They want more attention paid to the
things that impact them every day. They want a good public
education system, they want to be able to get good jobs, and they
want to make sure we are able to save the Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations have done little to diminish Clinton's
popularity among Democratic candidates. He has traveled the country
helping them to raise money, raising a total of $1.4 million on
Monday alone for candidates in Kentucky and Illinois.

   Cardboard cans capable of holding carbonated drinks have been
created by British researchers. It's the first time anyone has
designed a cardboard container strong enough to hold a pressurized
beverage. If used widely, the cans should eventually be cheaper to
make and recycle than aluminium ones.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Freeman and his colleagues at Scientific Generics in
Cambridge make their can with four layers of thin cardboard. The
layers are staggered so that the seams of each sheet meet at
90-degree intervals around the can. The seams are usually the point
of failure in a tube, Freeman says, but with this design each seam
gains strength from the sheets above or below it.
</P>
<P>
   A thin aluminium membrane is sprayed onto the inside of the cans
to make them airtight, and the ends are plugged with shallow cones
that point outward. Opening the can involves removing one of the
cones, turning the sealed tube into a beaker. Freeman says that
prototypes have been able to withstand pressures of up to 480
kilopascals (about 5 atmospheres), higher than the 275 kilopascals
fizzy drinks are usually pressurized to.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific Generics is looking for a partner to develop the
idea. Freeman fears that large soft drink companies will be wary,
because they have so much invested in aluminium cans. He says:
``The challenge is finding someone with the will to make it
happen.'' &QL;

   Algae blooms often kill other marine life by depleting oxygen in
the water or producing toxic chemicals. But now researchers in
Australia have found that prawn larvae feeding on blooms are mainly
dying from starvation, because the algae do not provide sufficient
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Blooms of the blue-green alga Trichodesmium are common in
tropical and subtropical waters. Nigel Preston and Michele Burford
of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
Marine Laboratory in Cleveland, Queensland, reared banana prawns,
Penaeus merguiensis, in enclosures in Albatross Bay on the northern
Australian coast. They found that few larvae survived during
Trichodesmium blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Larvae fed with Trichodesmium in the laboratory did not progress
beyond the first stage of their development. Most larvae fed on
another green flagellate, however, developed successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Deb Stenzel of the Queensland University of
Technology in Brisbane, Preston and Burford found Trichodesmium
filaments in the prawns' guts. But these were of such poor
nutritional value that the prawns were starving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early feeding stages are feeble swimmers, at the mercy of
currents,'' Preston says. So the type of food they eat depends on
chance. In a bloom, the only food they are likely to find is
Trichodesmium.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over seven years of plankton surveys, the team
found that numbers of prawn larvae were lowest during summer blooms
of Trichodesmium. They say understanding how banana prawns respond
to blooms may help researchers to better manage Australia's
Northern Prawn Fishery, which nets over $100 million in exports
each year. &QL;

   Dentists who check a tooth's health by wobbling it with their
fingers may soon have a more scientific method at their fingertips.
A Japanese firm has developed an electronic wiggler that detects
loose teeth before it's too late to repair them. If a tooth is
loose enough to be jiggled by hand, it may already be too sick to
save.
</P>
<P>
   Being loose is a common symptom of gum diseases such as
gingivitis, in which the membrane and even the bone to which the
tooth is attached become infected. The British Dental Association
estimates that 10 percent of adults will lose teeth because of gum
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new instrument fits on the end of a probe. When touched
horizontally against the center of a tooth it vibrates at 5
kilohertz for one second. Data on the tooth's movement are analyzed
by a computer, revealing how well the tooth is anchored in the jaw
and the strength of the membrane supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probe is just a prototype, so it's still undergoing
tests,'' says Tetsuo Kakuno of Dental Edison, an instrument
developer near Hiroshima. ``We're not sure when it will be on the
market.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lasting relief may be at hand for the world's 1 billion tinnitus
sufferers. To cancel out the maddening ringing, a company in New
Jersey has invented a device that makes a bone behind the ear
vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Aurex-3, developed by ADM Tronics in New Jersey, works by
pressing a small vibrating probe onto the mastoid bone behind the
ear. The cochlea _ the coiled part of the inner ear that turns
mechanical vibrations into neural impulses _ is housed within this
bone, and the vibrations are effectively applied directly to it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the user tunes the frequency of the probe by
adjusting a slider on a portable control box until the sound stops.
This confirms that they have matched the frequency of the ringing
with that of the probe. Once the frequencies match, the Aurex-3
takes over and works out a complex harmonic tone based around this
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called beat harmonics,'' explains Andre Di Mino, whose
father developed the Aurex-3 to cure his own tinnitus. ``When the
frequency hits a specific harmonic, which is the opposite sine wave
of the tone that the person is hearing, it cancels out the
sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This technique, called masking, is already used in other devices
that give tinnitus sufferers short-term relief. Di Mino believes
the Aurex-3 takes masking further by offering long-term benefits
without interfering with hearing. He claims the harmonic helps mop
up all the residual noises, not just the main ringing or roar.
</P>
<P>
   Other masking devices fit into the ear canal and often use white
noise to blank out sounds. Because they fit inside the ear they can
impair ordinary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ADM Tronics is hoping to get permission from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to market the device as a short-term solution.
Eventually, it hopes to do clinical trials into the lasting effects
of the Aurex-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my father I can say there have been long-term effects,
but we can't make that claim until after these trials,'' Di Mino
says.
</P>
<P>
   Catherene McKinney, an audiological scientist studying tinnitus
at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People in Britain, is
skeptical. ``A lot of these devices fall down at the clinical trial
level,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney says treating the physical symptoms of tinnitus is only
part of the solution. The sufferer's own psychological reactions
often exaggerate the severity of the condition, making them unable
to ignore it. ``To change this you have to change people's
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like the vibrotactile device might help,'' she says.
``But whether it has a placebo-type effect or whether it is having
some actual useful effect is difficult to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the Aurex-3, Alfonso Di Mino, claims to have
clearly benefited from his device. He says that before he used it,
the noise from his tinnitus was so deafening that it was like
sleeping next to a roaring 747 jet. &QL;

<P>
   Lasting relief may be at hand for the world's 1 billion tinnitus
sufferers. To cancel out the maddening ringing, a company in New
Jersey has invented a device that makes a bone behind the ear
vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Aurex-3, developed by ADM Tronics in New Jersey, works by
pressing a small vibrating probe onto the mastoid bone behind the
ear. The cochlea _ the coiled part of the inner ear that turns
mechanical vibrations into neural impulses _ is housed within this
bone, and the vibrations are effectively applied directly to it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the user tunes the frequency of the probe by
adjusting a slider on a portable control box until the sound stops.
This confirms that they have matched the frequency of the ringing
with that of the probe. Once the frequencies match, the Aurex-3
takes over and works out a complex harmonic tone based around this
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called beat harmonics,'' explains Andre Di Mino, whose
father developed the Aurex-3 to cure his own tinnitus. ``When the
frequency hits a specific harmonic, which is the opposite sine wave
of the tone that the person is hearing, it cancels out the
sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This technique, called masking, is already used in other devices
that give tinnitus sufferers short-term relief. Di Mino believes
the Aurex-3 takes masking further by offering long-term benefits
without interfering with hearing. He claims the harmonic helps mop
up all the residual noises, not just the main ringing or roar.
</P>
<P>
   Other masking devices fit into the ear canal and often use white
noise to blank out sounds. Because they fit inside the ear they can
impair ordinary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ADM Tronics is hoping to get permission from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to market the device as a short-term solution.
Eventually, it hopes to do clinical trials into the lasting effects
of the Aurex-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my father I can say there have been long-term effects,
but we can't make that claim until after these trials,'' Di Mino
says.
</P>
<P>
   Catherene McKinney, an audiological scientist studying tinnitus
at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People in Britain, is
skeptical. ``A lot of these devices fall down at the clinical trial
level,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney says treating the physical symptoms of tinnitus is only
part of the solution. The sufferer's own psychological reactions
often exaggerate the severity of the condition, making them unable
to ignore it. ``To change this you have to change people's
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like the vibrotactile device might help,'' she says.
``But whether it has a placebo-type effect or whether it is having
some actual useful effect is difficult to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the Aurex-3, Alfonso Di Mino, claims to have
clearly benefited from his device. He says that before he used it,
the noise from his tinnitus was so deafening that it was like
sleeping next to a roaring 747 jet. &QL;

<P>
   This is Dennis Elenburg's worst nightmare: It's Saturday
morning, Jan. 1, 2000, and Elenburg's alarm clock doesn't go off.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't go off because the power is out.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the power out, but the phones don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Since midnight, the temperature in the house has dropped 10
degrees, and his kids are cold.
</P>
<P>
   But Elenburg has planned for this. He already lives far enough
from Dallas to avoid urban rioting. He has been storing food and
water for nearly two years. His generator powers a radio, and
through a rudimentary network of amateur broadcasters, Elenburg
finds out he's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Regional brownouts plague the country. Groceries and drugstores
can't open. Hospital equipment has failed. Even if Elenburg could
call the police, the department's emergency vehicles may not
operate.
</P>
<P>
   And the banks? Completely inoperative.
</P>
<P>
   All because our computers don't know what day it is.
</P>
<P>
   Elenburg hopes this is an exaggerated scenario, but no one, he
says, can be sure. Like a growing minority, Elenburg believes a
computer glitch known as the millennium bug, or Y2k (short for Year
2000), could throw the world into chaos. They're storing food and
water, converting their assets from paper to gold, even moving to
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsayers, in most cases, aren't your traditional
survivalists or religious radicals. Many, Elenburg included, work
in the computer industry and understand the technology behind the
bug. When the clock rolls over to the next century, they say, it's
possible that everything from electric power grids to cameras could
quit functioning, with terrifying results.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who sees Y2k as a significant problem is convinced
that anarchy will ensue. In fact, the voices of moderation far
outweigh the alarmists. The world still has 17 months to rectify
the most significant problems, stresses Leon Kappelman, an
associate professor of business computer information systems at the
University of North Texas in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of it is, it's bad. It's real bad,'' Kappelman
says. ``But that doesn't mean you leave. It means you redouble your
efforts. You focus where you can do the most damage, and you fight
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, computer experts point out that about one-third of
companies have yet to confront the Y2k issue and, as of May, only
40 percent of the most crucial government computers were compliant.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   To save money and space, early computer programmers decided to
drop the first two digits of the century date. That means most
computers read 1998 as ``98.'' When the year rolls over to 2000,
date fields will read ``00.'' Some computers will simply spit out
bad data when they encounter ``00''; others will crash or shut
themselves down.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch has already wreaked sporadic havoc. The computer
system that schedules patient appointments for three hospitals and
75 clinics in Pennsylvania went down in April after someone tried
to type in an appointment for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1996, Visa was forced to recall 12 million credit
cards with expiration dates of 2000 after credit card authorization
systems around the country refused to accept them, according to
computer expert Ed Yourdon.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street tested its mettle against Y2k in July, turning its
clocks ahead to the week of Dec. 29, 1999. Preliminary results
showed no Year 2000-related problems, but experts stress this
doesn't mean the stock exchanges will be free of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the problem is mind-boggling: Programmers
worldwide will need to examine 250 billion to 300 billion lines of
software, and companies must hunt down several billion microdevices
(self-contained computers) embedded in products as unimportant as
coffee makers and VCRs and machinery as crucial as coolant systems
on nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   A typical oil rig, for example, has 10,000 embedded chips
throughout its circuitry. An electric company's power grid may have
10 times that, notes Yourdon, a software engineering consultant and
leading Y2k activist.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated costs to correct the problem run between $300 billion
and $600 billion. The federal government alone will spend $4
billion. In the private sector, Chase Manhattan bank will dole out
$250 million, The Prudential Insurance Co. $110 million and Federal
Express Corp. $75 million. There's enough Y2k business to keep the
3 million U.S. computer programmers working overtime for years to
come. Problem is, they've only got 17 months.

A SUMMER VEGETABLE STEW WITH DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the last of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman. Next
week: the first of eight columns by Charlie Palmer, the chef and
owner of Aureole in Manhattan.)  
 (HLW)  
 By DEBORAH MADISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twice a week during the summer, I come home from the
farmers' market with a huge assortment of vegetables. The
possibilities abound, but I often feel an overwhelming urge to use
this bounty to put together a colorful, fresh-tasting vegetable
stew. Others might choose to stir-fry, but I prefer these little
braises because I like to get the vegetables tender, drawing out
all of their delicious juices and allowing them to mingle.
</P>
<P>
   Because mid- and late-summer vegetables are typically quite
sweet, there is a balancing act to a dish like this. First of all,
you need to add some complexity, as well as a unifying element. I
provide that at the last minute with a drizzle of a quickly made
basil oil, a kind of stripped-down pesto that smacks of basil and
little else. Then you need acidity, in the form of vinegar; not so
much that you actually taste it, but enough to offset the sugar in
the peppers, corn and tomatoes and to tie their flavors together.
Handled correctly, this stew provides the same kind of depth of
flavor you would get from one containing meat.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the pieces large so that the stew retains some form on the
plate, and add the vegetables sequentially so that each one cooks
the right amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that the freshness and wonderful color of vegetable
stews do not last long. Although the dish will be delicious the
next day, its best flavor is really fleeting, and the colors begin
to fade as soon as the cooking is complete. So I like to serve it
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a starchy element provides a foil for all of the colors
and flavors of the vegetables. Sometimes I slip a few simmered
ravioli into the stew at the end, or serve it with biscuits or
popovers. But I really love it spooned over some freshly mashed
potatoes, which also take well to the basil oil. The result is
comfort food to the nth degree.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLE RAGOUT WITH MASHED POTATOES AND BASIL OIL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, longer with dried beans
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh or dried shell beans, like cranberry or navy
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   Several sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 red, orange or yellow bell peppers, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed basil leaves, washed and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 medium new potatoes, about 2 pounds, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   3{ tablespoons butter (or use more oil)
</P>
<P>
   4 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   About 1 pound zucchini, cut into quarters the long way with
3-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   2 cups green beans, trimmed and cut into 1{-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   2 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cups corn kernels (about 5 ears)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon wine or other vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1. Cook beans, onion, garlic, and thyme in water to cover until
tender; fresh beans will take 30 minutes or so, dried beans
considerably longer. Salt to taste, and drain the beans, reserving
their liquid. (While beans are cooking, proceed with the recipe.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut peppers in half, scoop out cores, trim white membranes,
make a couple of small slits on each end, and press down to flatten
them. Place them skin side up on a baking sheet, and brush with 1
tablespoon olive oil. Broil about 6 inches from heat source,
rotating so they are exposed evenly to heat (but always with skin
up), just until skin puffs up and separates, 5 to 10 minutes. Stack
halves on top of one another, skin to skin. Allow them to cool for
a few minutes, and then peel and cut into strips.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make basil oil, place basil in a blender with the 1/3 cup
oil, and turn machine on. While it is running, add 1 or 2
tablespoons water, just enough to loosen mixture; it should have a
creamy consistency. Add salt to taste, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Boil potatoes in salted water until quite tender. Place 1{
tablespoons butter in large, deep skillet or casserole, and turn
heat to medium-high. When it melts, add shallots, and turn heat to
medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are translucent and
soft, at least 10 minutes. Add zucchini and green beans; when
zucchini begins to brown, add about { cup of bean-cooking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   5. As soon as zucchini begins to soften, add peppers, tomatoes
and cooked beans. Add bean-cooking liquid as necessary to keep
mixture stewy but not soupy, as much as 2 cups. When everything is
tender _ in about 10 minutes _ add corn and vinegar. Turn heat to
low, and keep warm while you mash the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Mash the potatoes with remaining butter, about { cup of
remaining bean cooking liquid, and salt and pepper to taste. Place
potatoes in center of large bowl, and spoon stew around it. Drizzle
everything with a bit of basil oil, and sprinkle with pepper.
Serve, passing remaining basil oil at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<P>
   GLOBAL `STRESS TEST': A dozen people fill a row of tables in the
back room of the Denny's at Midway Road and Interstate 635 in
Dallas. Financial adviser Randy Flink has passed around eight-page
outlines titled ``Constructing Your Y2k Personal Insurance Plan,''
and the group peruses them silently between bites of burgers and
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Elenburg heads the Dallas Area Y2k Community Preparedness Group,
or DAYCPG, which gathers here weekly. Flink, president of
Championship Financial Advisors and today's featured speaker, met
Elenburg on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The lone woman at the table divides her attention between
Flink's handout and a packet from Storm Chasers Shelters Inc., a
Fort Worth company selling a ``full line of subterrain utility
shelters.'' Her three kids wait in a nearby booth.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentation, a former Merrill Lynch financial
consultant approaches Flink. The man says that after he heard about
Y2k, he wrote his clients a letter and quit his job. ``I told them
I thought it was time to get out of the market,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Elenburg, an independent computer consultant, experienced his
Y2k awakening six weeks after starting as Year 2000 project manager
for ``a major telecommunications company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw all the complexity and the depth (of the problem) and
how it really affected a company that was high-tech,'' explains
Elenburg, a young, articulate and perfectly normal-looking husband
and dad. ``All at once, we're going to get a massive stress test of
the global computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Elenburg, who co-operates the Web site Y2k Watch and dubs
himself the Y2k Weatherman, says ``the likeliest scenario will be a
serious financial crash.'' Still, he has purchased more than $1,000
in dehydrated and bulk food and converted most of his assets to
precious metals or cash. ``I like to call myself the most pragmatic
optimist you'll ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   BUGGING OUT: The Internet nurtures a burgeoning Y2k subculture,
with Web sites hosted by computer programmers, professors,
survivalist groups, financial experts, religious organizations and
concerned citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gary North, perhaps the best-known of the so-called
``safe-haven'' advocates, calls Y2k ``the biggest problem that the
modern world has ever faced'' on his Web site. North, a historian
who believes Y2k is God's way of punishing man for his reliance on
technology, has already taken refuge in rural Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   At www.yardeni.com, respected Wall Street economist Ed Yardeni
predicts a 70 percent chance of a worldwide recession. Captain
Dave's Survival Center warns of shortages of batteries, candles and
toilet paper, even the possibility of martial law. ``Sales of
survival-related food are really reaching record levels,'' Dave
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dave himself will be ``in an isolated mountain region'5 on New
Year's Eve 1999, sharing a house with another family, he says in a
phone interview. ``We will have at least six months' worth of food
... water-purification systems ready and two wood-burning stoves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking the Year 2000 (bug) would be an annoyance,'' he
adds. ``You wouldn't be able to make a phone call for a few days.
And now I'm looking at it as having potentially longer-term
effects. Is this something that's going to be gone in two weeks?
Not necessarily. So why not take the vacation time and bug out, so
to speak?''
</P>
<P>
   The Cassandra Project, an independent Web site, contains reams
of information on ``areas of concern'' such as banking, nuclear
power, and gas and oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra's Research Director Paloma O'Riley came across Y2k
while serving as a computing security specialist in the Navy during
Desert Shield and Desert Storm. She left a job as Year 2000 project
manager for the British maker of Land Rover vehicles to return to
the United States and begin cajoling her state government into
action.
</P>
<P>
   O'Riley now works with the Colorado governor's office on Y2k
awareness, and the Cassandra Project's Web site last month drew
600,000 hits.
</P>
<P>

running off to the hills isn't going to accomplish anything.''

TANGY BUTTERMILK, SWEET MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no two ways about buttermilk: either you love its tart
creaminess, or you shudder at just a glimpse of its cloudy film
clinging to an empty glass. Having grown up in the Swedish
countryside, where fermented milks were more common than fresh, I'm
definitely in the first category, though I admit I never saw
buttermilk drunk from a glass until I arrived in America.
</P>
<P>
   Buttermilk is as thick and creamy as its name implies, but it
actually has far fewer calories and much less fat than whole or
low-fat milk. Originally this was so because it was just the thin
liquid left over when butter was made, the equivalent of the cheese
maker's whey.
</P>
<P>
   Today most dairies make buttermilk by culturing skim milk, but
it retains a tartness that perfectly accents the flavor of
sun-sweetened summer berries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the simplest ways to enjoy buttermilk is as a cold soup.
In Sweden, it is served up in a deep plate and sprinkled with sugar
and ground ginger. I prefer to eat it country style, adding
crumbled thick Swedish rye crisp, like Ryvita. In Sweden,
cornflakes now seem to have surpassed rye crisp as the ``bread'' of
choice for this dish.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I had the idea of using buttermilk to concoct a panna
cotta, an Italian-style eggless custard. Now although Italy and
Sweden are at opposite extremes in so many ways, I have always
found a certain similarity in the creamy smoothness of panna cotta
and filbunke, a thick milk dish of summer that my mother used to
set out on the windowsill to harden. (It used to be called
clabbered milk.)
</P>
<P>
   In my mind's eye I can still see those clear 50s Pyrex dishes in
which the cream would slowly rise to the top. The ``good
bacteria,'' I was told, would settle in as the milk solidified,
resulting in a cool, rich, creamy layer on top and a custardy panna
cottalike pudding on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned filbunke is so smooth it makes yogurt seem almost
gritty by comparison. Or I should say, it (italics)was:(end
italics) you can make filbunke only from unhomogenized milk, and I
haven't had any since Ginger, our Jersey cow, stopped giving milk a
dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that panna cotta uses gelatin to help the milk set,
while in Sweden the liquid firms up naturally with whatever yeasts
and bacteria are in the cooler air. But for me, the likeness
outweighed the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The buttermilk panna cotta came out tart and flavorful. It
shines as a summer dessert served with macerated fresh berries or
preserved lingonberries, the smaller wild Scandinavian version of
American cranberries, stirred with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual dish that uses buttermilk almost as a custard is
buttermilk pie. I first saw it in a local diner in Ohio during my
college days. I have since made a similar version using ground
ginger, the traditional topping for filbunke, as flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   And I came across buttermilk again recently at a stop at the
We-Li-Kit Farm ice cream stand in Abington, Conn. Tucked away in
the rolling farm country of northeastern Connecticut on Route 97
just south of Route 44, this small family-run operation draws
customers from miles around, especially for its ice cream. One day
recently there was a new item, strawberry buttermilk ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   I was used to making buttermilk shakes as summer coolers, adding
vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit from the garden. But using the
buttermilk as a base for the ice cream itself was something I had
never thought of.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor was spectacular, the tartness of the buttermilk
accenting the flavor of the strawberries and bringing back memories
of those northern summers where the dark of night was only dusk. &QL;

<P>
   BUTTERMILK PANNA COTTA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus about 3 hours' refrigeration &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Macerated blackberries (see recipe). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan, combine 1{ cups of the buttermilk with
the sugar. Sprinkle the gelatin over the mixture, and allow it to
sit 2 to 3 minutes. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and stir
constantly until the gelatin is dissolved; do not allow to boil.
Remove the pan from the heat, and add the remaining 1{ cups
buttermilk and the lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Transfer the buttermilk mixture to a covered container, and
refrigerate until thickened but not firm, 1 to 2 hours. Stir three
or four times during this period, to achieve uniform consistency.
When ready, the mixture will mound slightly on the surface when
dropped from a spoon; use it in the next step before it thickens
beyond this stage.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream and vanilla, and
whip until soft peaks form. Add about { cup of the whipped cream to
the buttermilk mixture, and stir in to smooth it. Then add the
buttermilk mixture to the bowl of whipped cream, folding in until
just combined.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spray the inside of a 6-cup mold with vegetable oil spray, or
wipe with a flavorless oil. Transfer the buttermilk mixture to the
mold, cover with foil or plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set,
about 2 hours. To serve, unmold onto a serving platter, and top
with macerated blackberries.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MACERATED BLACKBERRIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes, plus 1 hour resting time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kirsch liqueur, if desired. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a small mixing bowl, combine the blackberries, sugar and
kirsch. Stir gently to mix. Set aside in a warm spot, like a sunny
windowsill, and allow to macerate for 1 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RASPBERRY BUTTERMILK SHAKE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup raspberries
</P>
<P>
   1 large scoop premium vanilla ice cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a blender, combine buttermilk, raspberries and ice cream.
Blend at medium speed until smooth. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 serving (about 2{ cups). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GINGER BUTTERMILK PIE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1} cups plus 3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { cup light vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground ginger. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare the pie crust, preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a
medium mixing bowl, sift together 1} cups of the flour, and the
salt. In a small bowl, combine the oil and milk, and blend with a
fork. Make a well in the center of the flour, and add the oil
mixture. Stir with a fork to mix lightly; then add 1 teaspoon cold
water. Continue to blend the dough, handling as little as possible
to produce a flaky, finished crust.
</P>
<P>
   2. Shape the dough into two balls of equal size. On a lightly
floured surface, roll out the remaining ball into a 9{-inch disk.
(Refrigerate or freeze the other one, and use for another purpose.)
Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie pan, folding under and fluting the
edge. Prick the dough with a fork, and lightly cover with foil,
pressing gently to conform with the shape of the dough. Bake 10
minutes, and remove from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the crust is baking, prepare the filling: in a medium
mixing bowl, combine the sugar and remaining 3 tablespoons of
flour. Add the eggs, melted butter, buttermilk, lemon juice and
ginger. Transfer to the container of a blender, and mix briefly at
the lowest speed; do not allow the mixture to become foamy.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pour the filling into the pie shell, and bake 10 minutes. If
necessary, cover the crust edge with strips of foil to prevent
further browning. Reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees, and bake
until a knife or toothpick inserted into the center comes out
clean, about 20 minutes. Serve at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 to 10 servings (one 9-inch pie).

WINE OF THE WEEK: MERLOT'S SECRET  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Lambert Bridge Merlot 1995, Sonoma County, Calif. About $20. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A deep, intense wine, this Lambert Bridge merlot benefits
considerably from the addition of 22 percent cabernet, both
sauvignon and franc.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics in the trade say that the only reason so much cabernet
was used in so many merlots was that there was so little merlot to
go around. They call it stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but a lot of merlot turns out to be soft and
characterless: a nice, forgettable red wine. Cabernet sauvignon and
cabernet franc, on the other hand, add hard tannins, which we wine
writers variously describe as ``structure'' or ``backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The fact is that the merlot-cabernet blends have more
life, more interesting flavors, more complexity. Could that be why
the Bordeaux people have been blending these grapes for a couple of
centuries?

VINEGAR'S SECRET LIFE, AS AN APERITIF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)

<P>
   Clustered on a silver tray in the center of the elegant dining
room at Seasons, the restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel in
Chicago, are slender hand-blown flasks filled with liquids in
enticing tones of pale straw, amber, deep burgundy and ruby red.
</P>
<P>
   Grappas? liqueurs? Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   The bottles are filled with vinegars, and not for some
table-side salad toss. These were made to be sipped, and are served
as aperitifs or as palate-refreshers between courses, for $4 a
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big eye-catcher,'' said Andreas Kappenhagen, the
director of the restaurant and bar. ``People see others order it
and want to know about it and try it. Most are pleasantly
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The handmade vinegars are from Weinessiggut Doktorenhof,
Germany's first estate to produce wine just for vinegar. Grapes
like gewuerztraminer, riesling, sylvaner and pinot noir, some
allowed to mature to make beerenauslese and eiswein, are grown for
the vinegars. Some are mellowed with honey and others are made with
berries or seasoned with herbs like lavender and sage. One is
flecked with bits of gold leaf. They are aromatic and very smooth,
with tart acidity but no real throat-grabbing bite.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, they are even served in special, narrow,
long-stemmed glasses designed for tasting vinegar by Georg
Wiedemann, the owner of the estate. Of the nearly 30 vinegars the
estate makes, Seasons restaurant carries nine.
</P>
<P>
   Wine buffs need not fear that a few sips of vinegar will spoil
the taste buds for that bottle of fine Bordeaux with dinner. After
all, when it comes to vinegar, these are Chateau d'Yquem.
</P>
<P>
   Weinessiggut Doktorenhof sipping vinegars are not served in any
New York restaurants, but are available at Fairway, 2127 Broadway
(74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street), where a
17.7-ounce bottle is $22. In a hand-blown flask, the vinegars are
$85 each.

UNDATED: the third issue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anderson, who lives in the Fort Worth suburb of Colleyville with
her Y2k consultant husband and their children, leans toward North's
version of Year 2000 repercussions. ``I really believe there are
going to be severe problems,'' she says. ``But regardless of
whether you buy into it hook, line and sinker, you should be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is storing buckets of whole wheat and filling liter pop
bottles with water. She recently discovered a Los Angeles company
that sells a ``hospital in a box'' _ sort of an advanced first-aid
kit that Anderson may help to market.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Susan Powter interviewed Anderson on her syndicated
radio talk show. The former family therapist is in the midst of
writing her first book, tentatively titled ``Mars and Venus Look at
Y2k,'' a millennial take on John Gray's bestseller about men and
women's communication styles.
</P>
<P>
   Religion informs Anderson's Y2k beliefs, but only to a certain
extent. ``There are a whole boatload of Christians who believe this
is related to Armageddon,'' she says. ``I don't fall into that
camp. Gary (North) is saying that man's idolatry to technology is
kind of catching up to him, and that I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   `ONE GIANT HEADACHE': Ed Yourdon, co-author with his daughter
Jennifer of ``Time Bomb 2000,'' a personal preparation guide for
the millennium, has spent 35 years in the computer field, the past
20 as a consultant to Fortune 500 companies and government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He recently moved to Taos, N.M., from New York City, a change of
address partly based on his Y2k concerns. ``There's enough of a
chance that the disruptions might make major cities like New York
totally unlivable for a year that I would plan accordingly,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Computer professionals have known for decades that the problem
was looming. Yourdon was warning programmers of the glitch in the
1970s. But it wasn't until 1995, when companies began having
trouble computing five-year financial forecasts, that Yourdon
started focusing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the ramifications of 10 percent of the banks going
down? If 10 percent of the utility companies go down, is that
enough to take down the (power) grid?'' Yourdon asks. ``That's the
area where we're all totally in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Y2k activists, Yourdon believes the world will witness
the effects of the upcoming crisis months before Jan. 1, 2000. ``By
the summer or fall of next year, it will be abundantly obvious
whether this thing has been exaggerated,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The great moral debate in the computer industry these days is
whether programmers should stick around past the stroke of midnight
to help troubled businesses, or get out of Dodge before their
neighbors start looking for scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows what's going to happen,'' says William
Ulrich, author of ``The Year 2000 Software Crisis'' and president
of Tactical Strategy Group Inc. in Soquel, Calif. ``I believe there
are going to be a lot of little problems spread across a lot of
companies and government agencies. It's going to cause one giant
headache for almost all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich places himself ``on the optimistic side of the curve.''
Still, he advises folks to do some ``personal contingency
planning.'' Be judicious about investments. Have some extra cash on
hand. Prepare for some telecommunications and power problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay off airplanes at midnight,'' he cautions. ``If you're
traveling, make sure you have alternative ways home.''
</P>
<P>
   The most proactive step citizens can take is to organize a
community-based program to work with local businesses. Hold a
series of public meetings and include local government in
contingency planning. ``Awareness and communication will reduce a
lot of the fear,'' adds Ulrich, who suspects that the doomsayers'
warnings will do nothing more than incite panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world,'' adds O'Riley of the Cassandra
Project. ``The worst that could happen is we'll go back to living
in 1900, and what was so bad about that?''

PALE, DRY SHERRIES: THE FRESHER THE BETTER

 (JT)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bordeaux region of France runs on Champagne. Whether it is
an anniversary dinner at a back-country chateau or a business lunch
in town, the table wine will be red Bordeaux, but the aperitif will
always be Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it was in Margaux when my old friend Alexis
Lichine, the wine writer, shipper and chateau owner, was alive.
Anything from a late breakfast to a midnight supper with his guests
and family at his winery there, Chateau Prieure-Lichine, was reason
for a bottle of Champagne. Except for Alexis. Once he had seen to
everyone else's glass of Krug or Pol Roger, he opened a bottle of
fino sherry for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through Spain, which isn't too far from Bordeaux, he'd
stop the car suddenly and dash into a shop. Minutes later, he'd
emerge holding a bottle of La Ina or Tio Pepe. ``It's good and
fresh,'' he'd say. ``We'll have it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime in the wine trade, he knew that a good fino
sherry or a manzanilla _ an even more delicate-tasting sherry _ was
one of life's secret joys. A secret because most of us think the
best sherries are dark and sweet and that the pale, dry finos are
inconsequential. Nothing could be further from the truth. In
Andalusia, where sherry is made, the finos and manzanillas are the
most prized. In the great sherry houses like Domecq and Gonzalez
Byass, they are thought of as the most complex of all sherries and
equal to any aperitif wines in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And not just to aperitifs. On my own visits to the Spanish towns
where sherry is made I've been served a fino or a manzanilla with
every meal. ``What do I have to do to get some red wine around
here?'' I once asked one of the sherry makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly up to Rioja,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was before I came to understand what Lichine had known for
a long time: that fino and manzanilla are extraordinary wines.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it's nearly impossible to discover how good these two
wines can be unless you can be close to the source. ``Delicate'' is
not just an idle descriptive: these wines probably should never be
bottled. But bottled they must be, so the trick is to drink them as
soon after bottling as possible, ideally within seven or eight
months. Which is why Lichine would jump from the car in San
Sebastian or Bilbao, Spain, when he saw a place he knew would keep
only fresh fino.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, that usually means a good Spanish restaurant,
like Solera in New York, where the staff knows how to handle and
serve these wines. The wines should be served chilled but not
freezing, and they should be consumed once the bottle is opened.
Half bottles make a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's difficult to get Americans to try drinking sherry
with meals, it's even harder to find restaurants that will serve
finos in half bottles. To most restaurateurs, sherry of any kind is
an aperitif, to be sold more profitably by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that most finos come to this country with too
much alcohol _17.5, even 18 percent _ to make them easy to
preserve. In Spain, they are often sold at 15.5 percent or, in the
case of manzanillas, 14.5, which isn't much more than some of the
macho zinfandels California turns out as table wines.
</P>
<P>
   Most sherries come from the blazing white-chalk vineyards around
the inland city of Jerez, in Andalusia, the southernmost province
of Spain. Manzanilla comes from Sanlucar de Barrameda, just a few
miles away from Jerez on the coast, where the weather is cooler and
the breath of the sea is always in the air. It is said that the
salt of the sea also flavors manzanillas.
</P>
<P>
   Both wines are made from the palomino grape, probably a native
Andalusian variety. As it ages in the barrel, sherry develops a
flor _ a white film that is a kind of yeast, which consumes
whatever sugar is left in the wine after fermentation. The flor
lasts for a few years, then dies and sinks to the bottom of the
barrel. The flor is left behind when the sherry is bottled, but it
contributes directly to the unique taste of the sherry,
particularly the light finos.
</P>
<P>
   I've already mentioned the two best-known finos, La Ina and Tio
Pepe. I'd be remiss in not also highlighting the wines of Emilio
Lustau. This house specializes in single-cask, or unblended,
sherries, some of them 30 years old. Most of these sherries have
been produced for investors, who keep them strictly as commodities:
they sell them to the big sherry firms when those firms need
something very special for a certain blend. They are called
almacenista sherries.
</P>
<P>
   At any particular time, Lustau may also have five or six
separate manzanillas and finos on the market. It only remains to
find a retailer who appreciates their quality and knows how to
stock them. These are not wines that should remain in a back
storage room until space is made for them on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that with these exceptionally delicate wines there
are no regulations requiring the bottles to be dated. Which is why
Alexis Lichine dashed into shops in Spain, where he knew he'd find
the youngest, freshest wines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps its just another good reason for visiting Spain.

NO WOOD-BURNING OVEN? CRANK UP THE GRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, Calif., this spring, a friend and I were
treated to a wonderful home-cooked meal of rack of lamb grilled
over a wood fire. The chops were so succulent and so delicately
flavored that we immediately started thinking about building a wood
oven in the backyard of the house in rural Vermont where we spend a
lot of time in the summer. Then we thought better of it, because
the remnants of meals might be just one more attraction for the
wildlife that frequents the place _ deer, porcupines, bear.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine my excitement when I learned that you don't
need a wood-burning oven to cook over wood _ all you need is an
ordinary barbecue grill. The man who told me this, Don Hysko, is
the president of Peoples Woods/Nature's Own, a company in
Cumberland, R.I., that sells not only chunks of wood cut for
grilling but also an alternative to briquets called Chunk Charwood
that he said would produce much more succulent grilled food than
traditional briquets.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one way to find out for myself. After five days
of cooking over Charwood, and also over Hysko's aged chunks of wood
in oak, ash, cherry, apple and pecan, I'm a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Chunk Charwood looks like pieces of charred wood, because that
is what it is. It is also called lump or chunk charcoal. Canadian
sugar maple wood is burned in an oxygen-free kiln to remove the
moisture and wood pollutants. The result is a clean, dry heat that
seals in flavor. Everything I cooked _ chicken parts, whole
chicken, steak, tenderloin of beef, rack of lamb, pork tenderloin,
salmon and assorted vegetables _ had a wonderful sweetness and was
juicier than anything I had tasted over briquets.
</P>
<P>
   The high heat the Charwood produces caramelizes the natural
sugars in the food. No wonder the wood-grilled pizzas at Al Forno
in Providence are so good. They use the same product.
</P>
<P>
   Even for me _ someone not that skillful around the barbie _ the
Charwood was easy to work with. Using a charcoal chimney starter
and two sheets of newspaper balled up in the lower part of the
chimney, I simply poured the chunks of Charwood into the top
chamber, lit the paper in two or three places and went back inside
to do other chores while I waited for the Charwood to obtain a
glowing red color. This took about 15 minutes. Then I added it to
the grill the way briquets usually are. The Charwood seems to burn
more quickly than briquets, so be prepared to grill when it's
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to cooking over wood chunks. If you want a smoky
flavor, this is the way to get it. The pork tenderloin, chicken and
vegetables that were cooked over wood were superb. Whether the
grill was covered or open, the smoky flavor of the wood came
through. It was particularly appealing in the vegetables _
eggplant, red peppers and zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   And the wood chunks were almost as easy to light as the
Charwood, using the same technique; the chunks are small enough to
fit into a large chimney. As soon as they are blazing _ 15 to 20
minutes _ add them to the grill and spread them evenly over the
bottom. When they are glowing red, in another 5 to 10 minutes, they
are ready. Wood burns hotter than Charwood, so you might not need
as much. But keep in mind that not all wood that you buy is aged
and may not be so easy to light.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells wood chips that can be placed over the
hot Charwood to impart the flavor of the wood. (They come in the
same flavors as the wood chunks.) But for the life of me, I could
not taste the difference between one wood and another, except for
the mesquite, which has a distinctive flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Woods/Nature's Own Chunk Charwood, wood chunks and wood
chips are available in many markets around the country, by mail
order from (800) 729-5800 and on the Web at www.peopleswoods.com. A
17.6-pound bag of Charwood is $8.90 plus shipping; a 20-pound bag
of wood chunks, $11.95 plus shipping.

A GERMAN MUSEUM HONORS AN ARTIST, LOST TO THE HOLOCAUST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSNABRUECK, Germany _ Gustel Moses-Nussbaum knew that her
cousin, Felix Nussbaum, had been a painter. She also knew that,
along with his parents and most of her family, he had died at
Auschwitz. But it was only in 1960 that she learned that many of
his oils were stored in a Brussels basement. Nussbaum had once
said: ``If I perish, do not let my paintings die. Show them to the
people.'' Mrs. Moses-Nussbaum felt duty-bound to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, this northwestern German city where he was born in
1904 opened the new Felix Nussbaum Museum to house some 160 of his
paintings. As a measure of the importance that Osnabrueck gives to
the initiative, the museum was designed by the Polish-American
architect Daniel Libeskind and inaugurated by Gerhard Schroeder,
the president of Lower Saxony and the front-runner to become
Germany's next chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   That all this has come about is, of course, a tribute to the
efforts of Mrs. Moses-Nussbaum and her sister, Shulamith
Jaari-Nussbaum. But it also tells the story of a German city's
determination to turn its back on its own all too vivid Nazi past
and reinvent itself as a symbol of peace. When Mrs. Moses-Nussbaum
first brought the paintings here in 1970 in the hope that someone
would be willing to restore the works of a local though largely
unknown artist, she needed Osnabrueck. Today, the city needs Felix
Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum left Osnabrueck in 1922 at the age of 18 to study art
in Hamburg. He returned to visit his parents, but he never again
lived here. In 1925, he moved to Berlin and continued to study
while setting up a studio and sharing an apartment with his
girlfriend, an artist from Poland named Felka Platek. He was a
prolific painter, his figurative oils evocative of van Gogh and his
landscapes influenced by de Chirico, but he sold little. Indeed,
his main client and fan was his father, Philipp, a prosperous iron
merchant who donated several of his works to friends in Osnabrueck.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum and Platek moved to Rome in October 1932 after he won a
scholarship as a guest student at the Prussian Academy in the Villa
Massimo. That December, a fire in his Berlin studio destroyed 150
of his paintings. According to some accounts, it was set by Nazi
youths. In May 1933, with Hitler now firmly in power, Nussbaum was
ejected from the Prussian Academy and began wandering through
Italy, Switzerland and France, eventually reaching Oostende,
Belgium, in January 1935.
</P>
<P>
   By then, at least half of Osnabrueck's 500 Jews had fled the
city, including Nussbaum's parents, who successively lived in
Switzerland, Cologne and Amsterdam. Osnabrueck was a hotbed of
Nazism and anti-Semitism: it had a flourishing Nazi party as early
as 1926, and its Roman Catholic archbishop, Wilhelm Berning, was
known as the Nazi prelate. Osnabrueck's large synagogue, like those
of many German cities, was burned on the night of Nov. 2, 1938. And
during the war, says Peter Junk, a local historian, ``no one here
hid a single Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oostende, where he was befriended by the painter James Ensor,
Nussbaum's life was unsettled by the refusal of the Belgian
authorities to grant him and Platek, who was also Jewish, identity
papers. In 1937, they married and moved to Brussels, where
Nussbaum's work was still mainly portraits, still-lifes and
landscapes, although the gathering darkness of Europe was evoked in
a handful of oils. In May 1940, after Germany occupied Belgium,
Nussbaum was arrested and interned in a camp at St. Cyprien in
southwestern France. Six months later, he escaped and somehow made
his way back to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The years that followed became increasingly difficult. In the
spring of 1942, Nussbaum hid his paintings with two acquaintances,
including a Belgian dentist whose name is remembered only as Dr.
Grosfils. Nussbaum and his wife also went into hiding, first in an
attic and then in a basement. Remarkably, he continued painting.
Indeed, as if his greatest talent were unlocked by terror, it is
the work done during this period that has earned him a place as a
rare artistic witness to the persecution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known painting is perhaps ``Self-Portrait With Jewish
Identity Card'' from August 1943, which shows Nussbaum wearing an
overcoat, the collar turned up to reveal a yellow star, and his
right hand holding up an identity card stamped ``Juif-Joud.'' Other
works, like ``Organ Grinder,'' show scenes of desolation. Several,
like ``Couple Grieving,'' ``Jew by the Window'' and ``Jaqui in the
Street,'' capture the fear and solitude of defenseless Jews
awaiting their fate at the hands of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   On June 20, 1944, Nussbaum and Platek were arrested, and, five
weeks later, they were deported to Auschwitz. Nussbaum's parents
and brother were arrested in Amsterdam and sent to the death camp.
Mrs. Moses-Nussbaum and her sister were in hiding in the southern
Netherlands, but their parents, a brother and a sister also died in
Auschwitz. After the war, the surviving sisters made their way to
Israel, where they live today.
</P>
<P>
   What they call their life's work to rescue Nussbaum's paintings
began in 1960 when they heard that Grosfils had a collection of
their cousin's work. Because the Belgian dentist refused to hand
them over, demanding proof that the cousins were legitimate heirs,
it was nine years before a Belgian court ruled in their favor. The
177 paintings they recovered were in dismal condition, damaged by
dirt and moisture and in some cases ripped.

OSNABRUECK, Germany: cases ripped. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We wondered what would be the best way of letting people know
what a great artist he was,'' recalled Mrs. Moses-Nussbaum, who was
visiting Osnabrueck for the inauguration of the museum. ``No one
knew him in Belgium. The Israel Museum in Jerusalem said they
couldn't help. Eventually, a curator told us to go to the only
place where Felix was known, to Osnabrueck. It wasn't easy. I had
been here in the 1950s, and it was still full of Nazis. But we had
no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing proved fortunate. Walter Borchers, the director of
the local Museum of Cultural History, offered to have the paintings
restored. The next year, 1971, the first retrospective of
Nussbaum's work was held here. Osnabrueck had changed, along with
the rest of Germany. The Holocaust was no longer a taboo subject.
Opening the show, the city's mayor, Willy Kelch, said it
represented ``a contribution to reparation of the injustice which
Jewish citizens in Osnabrueck and all over Germany suffered in the
name of an inhuman ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, as Junk, the local historian, and others set
about researching Nussbaum's life, more of his works appeared. A
handful were in Osnabrueck, owned by families that had been given
them by Nussbaum's father. In 1975, a Belgian antique dealer
offered eight paintings from Nussbaum's critical 1942-1944 period,
paintings that were probably recovered from the artist's basement
after his arrest. Others were traced to Amsterdam and acquired by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, Osnabrueck had begun to embrace Nussbaum as a
native son. An exhibition of his major works was organized at the
Jewish Museum in New York in 1985. Soon after, the Museum of
Cultural History here set aside two rooms for a permanent
exhibition. Finally, in 1991, the decision was made to build a
museum extension dedicated to the collection, although it was not
until 1996 that the money was available and Libeskind's design was
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind, who is also the architect for the new Jewish Museum
in Berlin, chose to juxtapose the existing late-19th-century museum
with his ultra-modern extension in an almost aggressive manner.
``The violent geometry reflects the displacements of Nussbaum's
life to create collisions within the building,'' he explained of
his sharply angled construction, which from the air resembles three
broad lines of a triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 70 of Nussbaum's works are on display, the full
collection will not be installed until February 1999 so room will
be available for an exhibition later this year linked to the 350th
anniversary of the Treaty of Westphalia, signed here in 1648 to end
the Thirty Years' War. Just as Osnabrueck now likes to publicize
that it is the birthplace of the antiwar German writer Erich Maria
Remarque, its celebration of the Treaty of Westphalia is part of a
campaign to identify itself with peace.
</P>
<P>
   The new Felix Nussbaum Museum is clearly the cornerstone of this
strategy. The catalogue to the collection notes that if Osnabrueck
had never before invested so much in a single artist, it was
because the preservation of Nussbaum's memory and legacy was ``a
political task.'' Or as the museum's director, Thorsten Rodiek, put
it more simply: ``It's important to have a museum like this because
we should never forget.''

NEW `JOY' IS CAUGHT IN A CLASH OF FOOD PHILOSOPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Joy of Cooking'' is the most famous American cookbook. That is
both an advantage and a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Early editions of ``Joy,'' first published in 1931 by Irma S.
Rombauer, are commonly described as the family bible. The recipes
are simple; the directions are clear. A revised edition published
last year by Scribner has sold about 900,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its fame, the book also gets its share of
potshots. Writing in the April issue of Food Technology, a
publication of the Institute of Food Technologists, Dr. Christine
Bruhn, the director of the Center for Consumer Research at the
University of California at Davis, criticized the book's food
safety and nutrition information, saying that the new version is
full of ``contemporary counterculture myths.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruhn, whose doctorate is in consumer behavior, claims that
the book is rife with scientific inaccuracies. But what Dr. Bruhn
is really criticizing is the book's philosophy, which runs counter
to hers and that of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Its 28,000 members work in food science and technology and
related professions. The organization's belief that every
technological advance in food production _ irradiation and the
creation of fake ingredients like the fat substitute olestra _ is
good runs contrary to the book's philosophy that natural and
organic foods are more healthful and that factory farming is bad
for the animals and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruhn said that she felt ``betrayed'' by the new edition and
that ``the work was not carefully researched.'' ``I don't mind a
different philosophical approach,'' she said in an interview, ``but
if they are embracing an alternative culture, they should say so.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book's philosophy nothing new. It was even more clearly
stated in the 1975 edition, which adamantly called for taking care
of the environment and eating more legumes, grains and vegetables
and less meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy'' is not entirely blameless in Dr. Bruhn's attack. Like
many cookbooks, it has a few errors, some having to do with food
safety advice. But Dr. Bruhn and the institute weaken their case
against the few mistakes by taking statements out of context, by
ascribing statements to the book that it does not contain and by
oversimplifying.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Guarnaschelli, the editor of the revision, acknowledged
that the book contains mistakes but said that Dr. Bruhn and the
institute ``made so many false claims it was hard to take the rest
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Joy of Cooking' was never a health book,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute's press release on Dr. Bruhn's
article, the book says that ``food additives lower the nutritive
value of food.'' The book contains no such statement. In fact, it
says that some additives, like vitamins, are good.
</P>
<P>
   A charge that the list of food allergens in the book does not
include peanuts and eggs, two common sources of food allergies, is
half right. Eggs were omitted and will be added in the next
printing, Ms. Guarnaschelli said.
</P>
<P>
   On food safety, the press release accuses ``Joy'' of saying that
``it is OK to use raw eggs in no-cook recipes.'' Such a statement
cannot be found in the book, which in fact has an extensive section
about the safety problems with uncooked eggs.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest philosophical differences between the institute
and the authors of the book relate to farming practices. Dr. Bruhn
and the the institute believe that factory farming and conventional
agriculture, both of which rely heavily on synthetic chemicals, are
safe and that organic farming is just one of those ``counterculture
myths.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guarnaschelli makes no apologies. ``If anything the book has
a bias toward organic food and local agriculture,'' she said. Still
it does not make either of the following statements attributed to
it in the press release: ``Pesticide residues on fruit are at
unacceptable and hazardous levels,'' and ``Organic produce does not
need to be washed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruhn also said she did not appreciate the book's statement
that ``as poultry production moved from the barnyard to the
processing plant, both the quality and the safety of our poultry
were compromised.'' That is blaming ``animal agriculture for a
variety of sins without regard to scientific support,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But few scientists _ or people in the industry _ dispute the
fact that high levels of the harmful bacteria salmonella and
campylobacter in chickens are attributed to the conditions under
which they are raised and processed.
</P>
<P>
   There is one serious error in ``Joy of Cooking,'' the
recommendation to cook ground beef to 155 degrees: the Agriculture
Department recommends 160 degrees. And the book gives confusing
advice about washing fruits and vegetables. Ms. Guarnaschelli vowed
that these would be fixed in the next printing, expected within the
next few months.

   Dr. Marion Nestle, professor and chairwoman of the nutrition and
food studies department at New York University and a consultant on
``Joy,'' said that if Dr. Bruhn and the institute were really
interested in fixing the errors, all they had to do was write a
letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a more insidious purpose,'' she said. ``To blame
problems of food safety on the `Joy of Cooking' and home cooks,
rather than on the food producers who are truly responsible.'' Dr.
Bruhn's column, she said, ``is not really about the book; it is
about the politics of food safety.'' &QL;

`AVENGERS' GETS A STEALTH OPENING  
 (HLW)

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ How do you open a big-budget film like ``The
Avengers'' that appears to have fallen short of studio
expectations?
</P>
<P>
   Carefully. Very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   A remake of the British action-adventure television series
involving a debonair and wry secret agent, John Steed, and his
unflappable, jujitsu-kicking partner, Emma Peel, ``The Avengers''
is opening on Friday under highly unusual circumstances at about
2,800 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no advance screenings of the heavily promoted
film for most journalists. This is a sure sign that Warner
Brothers, which is releasing the movie, is so uneasy about ``The
Avengers'' that the studio doesn't want too much buzz about it
before it opens. Moreover, the studio clearly prefers to delay
critical appraisals until after the movie opens rather than face
the customary Friday reviews.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Warner Brothers is not planning the
traditional glitzy premiere, which is commonplace for a
high-profile action film with stars like Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes
and Sean Connery. The studio said the stars were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The film is expensive: it cost $50 million to $60 million to
produce and an additional $30 million to $40 million to market.
Warner Brothers had hoped that the film, directed by Jeremiah
Chechik, would become the basis for sequels, like the Batman
movies.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Warner Brothers grew especially worried about
the film when it was shown last week to theater owners and managers
in Sherman Oaks, Calif., in the San Fernando Valley. Word quickly
spread around Hollywood that the film was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   One person who attended the screening said that even though the
film had been pared down to only about 90 minutes, including
credits, several distributors walked out in the middle of it. One
of the stars, Connery, who plays an evil, weather-controlling
madman named Sir August De Wynter, was on-screen for only 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the screening there were also complaints that the plot was
confusing, and that Fiennes and Ms. Thurman seemed uncertain about
how to play their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Kandel, executive vice president for publicity at
Warner Brothers, insisted that the studio had high hopes for ``The
Avengers.'' Ms. Kandel said: ``We feel confident in the movie and
we're pleased at the result. We feel it will deliver big time to
the audience. We think it's a very hip and cool movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandel said that the film had ``tremendous baggage'' because
of the popularity of the television series, which ran on ABC from
1966 to 1969 and which, for most of that time, starred Patrick
Macnee as Steed and Diana Rigg as Peel. (The series ran in Britain
from 1961 to 1969.) ``We're dealing with a cultural icon, not just
in America, but around the world,'' Ms. Kandel said. ``We've always
been concerned that reviews of the film will have comparisons to
the original `Avengers.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, Warner Brothers decided to eliminate
advance showings to critics. ``Let the movie stand on its own,''
Ms. Kandel said.

   NEW YORK _ Faith Prince is returning to Broadway, this time
opposite Martin Short in the revival of ``Little Me.'' Ms. Prince,
who won a Tony in 1992 for her portrayal of the feisty Miss
Adelaide in ``Guys and Dolls,'' will play Belle Poitrine, a poor
girl who stumbles her way through a series of madcap adventures and
unfortunate men, all of whom will be played by Short.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, with a book by Neil Simon, lyrics by Carolyn Leigh
and music by Cy Coleman, is scheduled to begin previews at the
Roundabout Theater Company in late September. The casting,
announced Tuesday by the Roundabout's artistic director, Todd
Haimes, brings Ms. Prince back to Broadway for the first time since
she left the revival of ``The King and I'' in December.
</P>
<P>
   Opera Emerges
</P>
<P>
   It has been a while coming, but it looks as if Deborah
Drattell's first opera, ``Lilith,'' will finally receive its
premiere. It was scheduled to be unveiled in June by the Dicapo
Opera Theater in Manhattan but was canceled because of a
contractual dispute involving the theater, the American Federation
of Musicians and the 92nd Street Y, the opera's co-producer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``Lilith'' is being staged by the Glimmerglass Opera in
Cooperstown, N.Y., which will present the work on Sunday. The opera
follows the story of Lilith, known in Jewish myth as the demonic
first wife of Adam, and her encounters with Eve. Ms. Drattell, 42,
was named the first composer in residence at the New York City
Opera last year.
</P>
<P>
   Movement Interrupted
</P>
<P>
   Whoever knew classical music fans _ nay, English classical music
fans _ could be so rowdy? At a concert on Monday night at Albert
Hall in London, a group of ``anti-modern music activists''
disrupted a performance of Oliver Knussen's ``Coursing'' by the
Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. The Evening Standard reported
that the protesters took over a balcony box, set off an alarm and
proceeded to dump leaflets on the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets called the concert, part of this month's Proms
series sponsored by the BBC, a ``banal grab bag of other people's
musical effects.'' The protesters then fled. No arrests were
reported and the concert continued after a brief delay, the
newspaper said, ``to tumultuous applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Redux
</P>
<P>
   The King is gone, but he's not forgotten. Sunday will be the
21st anniversary of Elvis Presley's death, but in Memphis, Tenn.,
the annual Elvis Week celebration has begun. Panel discussions
Tuesday featured people who had known Presley, including several
actresses who starred in his films.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tribute concerts each night, other attractions
include a seminar at the University of Memphis on Elvis' place in
musical history, and a five-kilometer ``Fun Run.'' Festivities end
this weekend with an all-night candlelight vigil followed by a
gospel brunch.

A TASTE FOR THE OPERA  
 CEDAR-WRAP CHEESE

   Operas preserved on tapes, disks and videos have long been the
stock in trade of the Metropolitan Opera's gift shops at Lincoln
Center. Now, to benefit the Metropolitan Opera Guild, an
educational and fund-raising division of the opera, the shops are
selling fruit preserves with operatic themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love for Three Oranges'' marmalade, an obvious choice, is
a dense, sufficiently tart spread. There is a ``Hansel and Gretel''
strawberry preserve, because the children were sent into the woods
to gather strawberries; it is rich and high quality, with plenty of
lush berries.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a real opera buff to know that there is a ``Cherry
Duet'' in ``L'Amico Fritz'' by Pietro Mascagni, and the jam it
inspired is delicious, full of cherry flavor and thick with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   You're more likely to eat the jam than to see this rather
obscure work. The preserves, made for the Opera Guild by Clearbrook
Farms, are $13.95 for a 24-ounce jar. A set of three is $39.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   American cheese makers continue to create products that dazzle
the palate. Trade Lake Cedar sheep's cheese, named best cheese on
Sunday at the American Cheese Society conference in Madison, Wis.,
is one such newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   It is made by Mary Falk near the town of Trade Lake in northwest
Wisconsin. The five-pound wheels are more than a foot in diameter,
nearly four inches thick and wrapped in cedar fronds. It's an ivory
cheese, firm but silky, and has a fruity, slightly tangy flavor
with a whiff of evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   It is $19.98 a pound at Fairway Market, 2127 Broadway (74th
Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street). At Murray's Cheese,
257 Bleecker Street (Cornelia Street), it is $15.99 a pound. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Manhattan Chili, 1500 Broadway, is unfortunate enough to have
its entrance on 43rd Street, directly across from the Conde Nast
construction site near Seventh Avenue. While workers dismantle
unstable scaffolding, the restaurant is closed, as is 43rd Street
between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. But its
kitchen, which has an entrance on Broadway, is open.
</P>
<P>
   So Manhattan Chili will deliver its chili and other Mexican
specialties Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. To
order: (212) 730-8666.

FOUR QUICK WAYS TO BOOST A TOMATO'S POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time of year you hear people say, ``Give me a good
tomato and I eat it like an apple.'' But no one actually does that,
at least not more than a couple of times a summer. Unlike peaches,
whose raw glory can barely be improved upon, tomatoes are all about
potential. The difference between consuming a tomato out of hand
and slicing it, then sprinkling it with a pinch of salt and a few
drops of olive oil, is the difference between a snack and a dish.
And the great thing about tomatoes is that it takes so little to
convert them from one to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four recipes, none of which takes more than 20 minutes
to make, and all of which can contribute mightily to summer eating.
Cold tomato soup with rosemary is an almost instant starter,
requiring no cooking at all. It benefits from a period of chilling
after being put together, but if you use ice cubes in place of
chicken stock you can skip even that.
</P>
<P>
   Cumin-tomato relish and pan-grilled tomato salsa are both
multipurpose. The relish is uncooked _ simply chopped tomatoes
combined with seasonings. I add onion, red pepper and some cumin
seed for crunch, and serve it with grilled meats; it's also good on
hamburgers and sandwiches. Pan-grilled tomato salsa has a charred
flavor, combined with just enough oil and vinegar to make the whole
thing juicy; it's great on top of grilled fish or chicken, or as a
side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta with fresh tomato sauce is the dish I produce when good
plum tomatoes make their first appearance. It has a thick
creaminess that you can never duplicate with canned tomatoes, no
matter where they're from.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes should always be cored before using: use a paring knife
to cut a cone-shaped wedge out of the stem end and remove it. But
peeling and seeding, a cumbersome process called for in many
cookbook recipes, are almost always optional. Sometimes I think it
even detracts from the final dish by reducing the amount of juice
in the tomato _ juice that contains the essence of tomato flavor.
(If you doubt this, slice some tomatoes and place them on a board
propped up at an angle. Salt them lightly and collect the juices
that flow off the board, then drink them _ no tomato juice ever
tasted so good.)
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to peel and seed tomatoes, here's the drill: Bring
a pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, cut a small X on the smooth
(flower) end of each tomato. Place them into the boiling water. In
about 30 seconds, you'll see the skin begin to loosen. Immediately
remove them from the boiling water and plunge them into a bowl of
ice water. When they're cool, peel, then cut them in half through
their equators. Squeeze, and shake out the seeds. (You might
consider doing this over a strainer and recombining the reserved
juices with the pulp.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd perform this process _ which would nearly double the time it
takes to prepare the recipes here _ only in something like the cold
tomato soup with rosemary, where seeds and bits of skin might
interfere with the smooth texture of the soup. I also peel if I
have tomatoes that were coated with wax, an increasingly common
process that prolongs shelf life.
</P>

 &HT;    GINGRICH LAUDS IRISH FOR 'TAKING RISK FOR PEACE,' IGNORING
'EXTREME FACTIONS'
 &HT;    EDs: With optional add.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Midway through a bipartisan swing
across Ireland, House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday expressed
``cautious optimism'' for the sometimes fragile peace process here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that we have seen more movement in the last 12
months than one might have thought possible,'' Gingrich said after
meeting with representatives of both sides of the conflict that
ravaged this land for decades. ``The groups we met with today
consistently from every background wanted to see the process move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made the remarks standing on the concrete foundation of
a Habitat for Humanity house he and other members of Congress and
their spouses helped get underway in a poor neighborhood here. The
spare cinderblock house is being built in Glencairn Estate, not far
from some of the city's toughest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives, their
spouses and a number of staff people and security personnel are
with the Georgia Republican on the seven-day tour through both
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation met earlier in the day with representatives of
Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), as
well as Unionist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message again and again is very simple: The agreement is
there, it's clear, it needs to be implemented,'' Gingrich said,
wearing jeans and a blue denim workshirt. ``This is a tremendous
opportunity to move forward for everybody and we hope that we can
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he had spoken about the trip to President Clinton,
who expressed support. Leaders across Ireland hope that a planned
trip by Clinton next month will boost the delicate peace process.
Most political parties here support the process, but the ``Good
Friday'' accord rests on the strength of an alliance between
opposing pro-Irish republican and pro-British unionist politicians.
Violence over the summer has tested this alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire the courage of those who have taken the
risk for peace,'' the speaker said. ``(The future of the accord)
probably depends on leaders having courage, and leaders deciding to
place their children's futures and the opportunity for peace and
for prosperity ahead of posturing and appealing to most of the
extreme factions. I think it's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Option add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring a dozen or so shouting protesters who assailed Gingrich
as unsympathetic to gays and poor people, the speaker offered a
cagey response to a reporter who asked if he didn't harbor hopes of
returning to Belfast someday as president.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and responded: ``I hope to come back here someday
under any circumstances, as either the speaker, retired speaker a
college professor -- or in some other job.''
</P>
<P>
   One side issue of the trip is Gingrich's desire to trace his
heritage in Donegal. On Thursday he will meet with an expert on the
genealogy of the O'Doherty family, the ancestors of his mother,
Kathleen Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he knew little about his family's Irish roots.
``We think they came over in the 1840s, but beyond that I don't
really know,'' he said.

A WOMAN CRIES WOLF WHISTLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stalked and harassed, made to feel unsafe in public places, the
victims of street abuse in Maggie Hadleigh-West's ``War Zone''
often generate their share of sympathy. Too bad, because in a film
that means to decry the treatment of women, a lot of the victims
are men.
</P>
<P>
   And these tragically benighted wolf-whistlers are turned into
prey by the filmmaker who hounds them. Dressed to stop traffic (or
at least slow it down marginally), Ms. Hadleigh-West roams city
streets with her Super-8 camera, cornering any fool who dares to
look her over.
</P>
<P>
   By her own calculations, she was annoyed by 1,050 insensitive
men during the five-week period when the film was shot.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Hadleigh-West's confrontational tactics are meant to
turn the tables on male aggressors, they backfire spectacularly.
Out on the prowl, the filmmaker becomes her own worst enemy as she
refuses to make the slightest distinction between the smiling guy
who calls out ``Hello, beautiful'' and the vicious rapist who
prompts a 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of making what she has called ``a film that can
ultimately participate in the liberation of men,'' she dishes out
mocking sarcasm (``Oh, is that how you say hi, by whistling at a
woman on the street'') that discredits her arguments and even her
motives.
</P>
<P>
   Turning potentially serious material into a stunt that has made
her the toast of various talk shows, she appears to be having much
too good a time demanding attention and making men squirm.
</P>
<P>
   The pity of it is that within ``War Zone'' there are several
other women whose concerns about unwanted male attention sound more
serious and authentic and who describe them in much less
self-serving ways.
</P>
<P>
   But in those interviews with women of varied ethnic backgrounds,
the filmmaker typically treats racist slurs and lecherous
wisecracks as if they were interchangeable, showing no sense of
proportion about the abuses that are described.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, the other women aren't given much screen time.
The bulk of the film is devoted to watching Ms. Hadleigh-West
create ambushes and get into shrill disputes, daytime television
style.
</P>
<P>
   The men's responses _ not the antique feminism of a woman who
takes offense even at ``Have a nice day'' and finds it outrageous
that strangers size each other up on the street for any reason _
give this documentary more verve than the filmmaker's one-note
attacks do.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no, no, 'cause as a matter of fact I'm gay,'' protests
a man accused of staring. ``May I just be alone right now and smoke
my pot?'' asks another. Then there's the guy who insists that
``Give it up, freak!'' has worked well for him as a come-on line,
or the worker in the crowd at lunchtime who makes a smooching
noise. (``Who did that?'' the filmmaker asks indignantly. ``Did you
do that?'')
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man accused of noticing Ms. Hadleigh-West's breasts
insists, quite plausibly, that he was only looking at the black
band around her arm because he thought it was a bandage and had a
similar injury of his own.
</P>
<P>
   While ``War Zone'' may be enough of a conversation piece to draw
the attention that other, better documentaries deserve, its
counterproductive effects are truly regrettable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadleigh-West is a filmmaker who asks questions like ``Sir,
are you ashamed of yourself?'' and describes how she laughed over
Lorena Bobbitt's attack on her husband. She reduces men to
insulting stereotypes while complaining that they do the same to
women, and she makes snide remarks like ``You're not aware of the
fact that women are assaulted and raped, sir?'' None of this does
feminism any favors.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Slow improvement is expected across New England as low pressure
migrates into Nova Scotia. A large disturbance in the jet stream
will linger over the Northeast and this will trigger a few showers
into the Catskills and Poconos. Cooler air will combine with clouds
from Massachusetts northward to keep readings well below seasonal
levels. Drier winds from the North will promote intervals of
sunshine from the central Appalachians to the Middle Atlantic
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between seasonal conditions over the Middle West
and a sultry air mass occupying the South will become stalled from
the Carolinas to Oklahoma. Clusters of showers and strong
thunderstorms will attend the front. The focus of heavy rain will
likely be in southern Georgia and northern Louisiana. South Texas
will be rather hot and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure crested over the central Great Lakes will produce
fine weather from the Mississippi Valley to the western
Appalachians. Sunshine will be abundant and winds will be light
along with comfortable humidity. Nighttime readings will drop into
the 40s in parts of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The return flow of humid air into the Rockies will invigorate
the monsoon. Afternoon thunderstorms will be widespread from New
Mexico to the Grand Canyon and northeast into Wyoming. Flash floods
are possible in a few spots. A surge of warm, humid air into the
upper Plains will cause a few thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The interior West will be bright and a bit hotter. Offshore
winds from the Columbia River to near San Francisco will keep ocean
clouds away from the shore, but fog will return to the Northwest
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Sky Lights
</P>
<P>
   A red sunrise was observed over Illinois on Tuesday as smoke
drifted south from fires in Canada. Colors in the heavens are often
determined by the make-up and size of particles. For example, air,
which consists primarily of oxygen and nitrogen molecules, causes a
blue sky. Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, which
comprise sunlight, are scattered helter-skelter by air molecules.
But violet, blue, and green are scattered more than yellow, orange,
and red. Upon reaching the eye, the brain processes and integrates
the skewed assortment of colors so that we ``see'' the sky as blue.

 &HT;    U.S. CRITICIZES MEXICO FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS AT
TIJUANA FACTORY
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico has received another critical report from
the U.S. Labor Department, charging failure to enforce health and
safety laws at a Tijuana auto-parts factory.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Monday, is the first investigation under
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that could lead to
economic sanctions against a member country if Mexico fails to
address the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report is the second part of a probe into allegations
of unchecked poor working conditions and unfair treatment of
independent union supporters at the Han Young ``maquiladora''
factory in Tijuana, a border city south of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Using a labor side accord established by NAFTA, Mexican and U.S.
labor activists filed complaints last year that Mexican officials
were not enforcing their own labor laws at the factory. The first
part of the report, issued in April, found that Mexico had failed
to protect the rights of Han Young employees to organize an
independent union.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to guarantee the right to unionize is not grounds for
sanctions against a NAFTA country. But failure to enforce health
and safety, child-labor and minimum-wage laws can lead to millions
of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a financial incentive there, and the fact that there
could be substantial fines, brings pressure to bear in this case,''
said Mary Tong of the San Diego-based Maquiladora Support Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tong's group filed the complaints last year against the Mexican
government, along with the United Steelworkers of America, the
National Association of Democratic Lawyers of Mexico and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report on Han Young recommends that Mexican Labor
Secretary Jose Antonio Gonzalez and U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman hold ``ministerial consultations'' on allegations of health
and safety violations as well as union discrimination in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the safety and health of workers in the workplace
to be a high priority, and I'm certain the government of Mexico
shares this position,'' said Irasema Garza, secretary of the
National Administrative Office (NAO), a branch of the U.S. Labor
Department and issuer of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``By consulting on the safety and health issues raised in this
submission,'' Garza said, ``we hope to learn more about Mexican
efforts to improve in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Labor Department spokesman Fernando Irala said the
Mexican government had no comment because it had not yet received
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Under NAFTA, complaints about labor law violations can be
submitted to officials in Mexico, Canada, or the United States.
Mexican officials, for example, are investigating allegations that
U.S. labor officials have failed to protect the rights of migrant
apple pickers in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   But the Han Young complaint has become a primary test case for
promises that NAFTA would improve rather than degrade working
conditions in the member countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young factory assembles truck chassis for Hyundai
Precision America, which sells vehicles to American consumers. Last
year, welders at the plant tried to organize a union to address
economic grievances and complaints that workers had suffered broken
bones, burns and possible respiratory illnesses and hearing loss
because safety standards were not followed.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were told they already had a union _ which was
linked to the Mexican government _ that would represent them. A
battle over union representation ensued that is still not resolved
today.
</P>
<P>
   On a diplomatic note, the latest U.S. report on Han Young says
that Mexico, by enacting new federal regulations in April 1997,
``has undertaken a serious effort'' to improve the enforcement of
its safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Mexican officials had inspected the Han
Young plant and assessed fines of about $9,400. But U.S.
investigators also said they were unable to obtain proof that these
fines were ever collected, or increased as a result of subsequent
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious deficiencies continue at the workplace,'' U.S.
investigators add. ``The deterrent effect of inspections and
financial penalties is lost if they are not enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for a bilateral meeting to discuss these
allegations, but under NAFTA Mexico must respond to the U.S.
request for consultations.

FLEXIBLE ART OF PLAYING THE PONIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday Aug. 18)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dignified man seated next to me won on Constantly Classy and
I was impressed because I was holding a bet on another horse who
might have come in had she not decided to say ``whatever''
somewhere in the fourth furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Actually I had heard mention of Constantly Classy from the guys
who run a prerace seminar at the Sonoma County Fair - between the
pita sandwiches and the barbecued ribs stand - but was turned off
when they said this might be the day that Constantly Classy
``breaks her maiden.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed too gynecological for public discussion, even if it is
acceptable horse lingo and, I have learned, can refer to both a
male and a female horse.
</P>
<P>
   (For further edification, a maiden is a horse that has yet to
win a race. To break one's maiden is to win one's first race.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been learning something about horse racing, but alas not in
a moneymaking sort of way, since being asked by the sports editor
to be a guest handicapper. I told him that I take the common
people's approach to betting (clever names and jockey colors) and
mostly go to the fair for the sausage and pepper and onion
sandwiches but he said I would provide a good balance to the
horse-savvy handicappers.
</P>
<P>
   The guy next to me at the races didn't look like a long shot
sort of gambler. I had assessed him in the sidelong way you do
strangers with whom you share a close seat and narrow aisle and are
always apologizing for squeezing past.
</P>
<P>
   But I had decided from the way he stayed seated while all around
him people were yelling and doing victory wiggles over a $2 show
ticket that he was a more serious pony player.
</P>
<P>
   I was with my friend who knows more about horses than I do. For
example, she studies up on the jockeys and trainers and she can
explain the difference between a trifecta and a quinella wager and
so I begged her to be my phantom adviser.
</P>
<P>
   I continue to lose with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I invited her to actually go with me to the track so we
could play the horses up close. Some people had wrongfully assumed
I had been hanging out at the track every day, when what I've been
doing is studying the small print in the Daily Racing Form the
afternoon before the next day's race.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the grocery store on a recent 100 degree day and buying
a box of Eskimo Pies when a clerk said, ``Aren't you supposed to be
at the races?'' And I said, ``Like you really think I go there?''
</P>
<P>
   Going to the track was a lot more fun - nice afternoon breeze,
lovely view of the western hills - than looking at the racing
magazine and I took every opportunity to get inside real gambling
minds.
</P>
<P>
   When the man next to me announced that he had won big on
Constantly Classy, I asked about his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``dumb luck'' and I protested he was just being
modest but it turns out it was both. Dumb and luck.
</P>
<P>
   I have studied many approaches and believe that winning at
horses has something to do with horse sense and a little to do with
sixth sense (a psychic connection to names that remind you of
former boyfriends) and very much to do with dumb luck.
</P>
<P>
   The women in front of us at the races bet on horses with Irish
names and they didn't do that well. The women at my book club to
whom I passed out pages of the racing form tried to find names with
literary meaning. And we lost.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that the reason I don't win big at the races is
because I don't bet big. Had I a chunk of money to throw around, I
would probably score wildly, I maintained. But since becoming a
temporary handicapper I have discovered that is not true because I
have been given more than $1,200 (of hypothetical money to
hypothetically bet) and I still do about as well as when I'm
nervously considering whether I can bet $2 of my own real money.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my male friends accused me of picking only female names
and I told them I would never be that transparent and that in fact
I had even tried using gender balance to score. Some days I would
bet on female owners of male-sounding horses. And vice versa. I
tried exotic names. I tried sexy names. I thought Undulating
Treasure would be irresistible, but hers were not the moves that
won.
</P>
<P>
   A betting pair who were studying the horses in the viewing area
before the race said they looked for horses with ``a good butt and
an attitude,'' which made me think of a friend's description of her
dream man.
</P>
<P>
   So, back to the stranger and Constantly Classy.
</P>
<P>
   She was the No. 5 horse in the seventh race, but when the man
went to bet he looked at the wrong page in the racing program. He
bet on the favored horse in the ninth race, which was No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   So he bet on the right horse in the wrong race and won.
</P>
<P>
   And that's my hot tip for the day.

sandwiched between Poland and Russia, has been noted for its
repression and lack of free enterprise in the seven years since the
Soviet Union disintegrated. Yet huddled around a computer terminal,
Olga Zauyalova, 20, and her partner Pavel Bintsarovski, 18, perform
an uncanny exercise in this country with little in the way of a
market economy: They create, produce, advertise and sell products,
competing via the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, their company --
appropriately called ``Alien'' -- is mere fiction, and their
profits are all on paper. But the whiz kids have excelled as part
of an international competition of young entrepreneurs. They are
among eight teams from six nations scheduled to compete in Atlanta
on Thursday (Aug. 13) in the Global Business Challenge, sponsored
by Junior Achievement International and the computer-equipment
maker Hewlett-Packard. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY _ MOSCOW _ Trading in Russian stocks was
temporarily halted Tuesday because of a sharp selloff by investors
fearful that the economy is not strong enough to withstand capital
flight in emerging markets. Russian stocks and bonds have plummeted
in the past two sessions, amid widespread flight from emerging
markets. Investors fear that Russian markets in particular are too
feeble to withstand another onslaught of such selling. Traders said
the ruble was also slightly lower today, despite the heavy
intervention of the Russian Central Bank. Investors also worry the
loan won't be enough to allow Russia to prop up its currency.
Before the suspension of trading was announced, Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristiyenko tried to calm the jittery markets:
``Default is not an issue here,'' he said. (Holmes, Cox News

and safety violations at a Tijuana maquiladora. The department is
urging ``ministerial'' level consulations between Mexico's
Secretary of Labor and Welfare and U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman. Under a special side agreement to NAFTA, this is the second
report issued on complaints about working conditions at the the Han
Young auto-parts factory in Tijuana. A previous report on Han Young
that attracted international attention found that Mexico had failed
to enforce laws guaranteeing the right to freely organize unions.
If health and safety laws are not enforced by a NAFTA member, that
country can face economic sanctions. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

`PARADISE' FOUND

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you like the way Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche and
Joaquin Phoenix act together in the dramatic film ``Return to
Paradise,'' opening Friday, you're in luck. Vaughn and Phoenix will
come back in October in the darkly comic thriller ``Clay Pigeons,''
and by the end of the year we should see Vaughn and Heche check
into the Bates Motel for Gus Van Sant's controversial remake of
Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Though partially just an accident of casting, the three actors
couldn't be happier about the way their burgeoning careers are
dovetailing with one anothers' (``Pigeons'' was filmed before
``Paradise''; ``Psycho'' is wrapping up production now). ``I really
respect Vince as an actor,'' says Phoenix, whose work ranges from
Ron Howard's cuddly ``Parenthood'' to Van Sant's sardonic ``To Die
For.'' ``He's very talented and we both are really passionate about
making films. We just really hit it off on `Clay Pigeons,' which we
both really believed in, then in this second one together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thing is just to try to be real, try to be truthful
with all of it, with acting,'' says Vaughn, who made his first big
splash as the sublimely superficial party animal in ``Swingers,'' a
film made by another set of friends. ``I think that you're
perceived as something of a weirdo if you work that way, but Anne
and Joaquin have that approach, too. That really feels good for me
as an actor; it gives you a chance to honestly explore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very intriguing when you get a script like this, that
could really make people think,'' Heche (``Six Days, Seven
Nights'') says of ``Paradise,'' which was written by Wesley Strick
(``Cape Fear,'' ``Wolf'') and Bruce Robinson (``The Killing
Fields,'' ``Withnail &AMP; I''). ``And it's not just what's on the
page. When actors like Vince and Joaquin are attached, you start
going wow, there's even more potential here.''
</P>
<P>
   A kind of ethical suspense story, ``Paradise'' plots the
relationship of three carefree young American guys _ Vaughn's
Sheriff, Phoenix's Lewis and David Conrad's Tony _ who meet during
an extended vacation in Southeast Asia. Sheriff and Tony head home
to New York while Lewis, who wants to help endangered orangutans,
stays on in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, limo driver Sheriff is confronted by Beth
(Heche), a lawyer representing Lewis. He's been in prison since
they left, for drug dealing _ seems he was caught with the hashish
Sheriff and Tony didn't pack _ and will be executed within a week
unless one or both of his holiday friends returns to Malaysia and
admits some of the contraband was theirs. This would mean stiff
prison sentences for the confessors, but it's the only way Lewis'
life will be spared.
</P>
<P>
   Between Beth trying to persuade the reluctant Sheriff to do the
right thing and Sheriff's own nagging sense of responsibility for
Lewis' predicament, ``Paradise'' offers ample opportunity for
exploring complex motivations and ever-changing, emotion-charged
relationships. And that's just what the ensemble delivered,
according to director Joseph Ruben (``Sleeping With the Enemy,''
``True Believer'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince and Anne met on this movie, and from the very first
rehearsal it was clear that they just connected as people and as
actors,'' says Ruben. ``They both work in a way that directors just
love to have actors work. They really respond to what's going on in
a scene. A lot of actors, good actors, come in knowing exactly what
they're going to do. It can be strong, but they give you the same
thing take after take, regardless of what the other actors are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Vince and Anne, if one of them changed the other would
change; they would play off and react to each other. What you get,
if the actors really work that way, is really strong, in-the-moment
acting. You get a different level of reality and it gets very alive
and unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's previously established, professional friendship with
Phoenix informed their ``Paradise'' work in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cast Joaq, I didn't know they had worked together,''
Ruben recalls. ``But it added a level of emotion to the movie.
There are scenes where Vince is legitimately moved by Joaquin, and
when he imagined his friend in this situation, it just brought up
so much genuine feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think acting is acting. But the best acting, obviously,
is you're so in the circumstances of what you're doing that what
happens is real. Having somebody that you actually care about
sitting in that cell changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Clay Pigeons,'' Vaughn and Phoenix also
portray a beautiful friendship. From hell.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is Clay, a gas station attendant in a small Montana town
who innocently (more or less) finds himself implicated in a string
of violent deaths. Vaughn is Lester, a big-hearted, cowboyish
trucker who befriends the troubled young man _ and who just may be
the devil in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an internal exploration, so I wanted to play Clay
very subtly,'' Phoenix explains. ``Vince's character is the
animated one in the film, and his doing that allowed me to play
somebody who's discovering himself and trying to come to terms with
the good and bad that's inherent in all of us. Vince's character is
almost a figment of my imagination, the devil on my shoulder who
takes advantage of the time when I'm most vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Lester as not even literal,'' Vaughn adds. ``He's more
of a demon. Because Clay made mistakes in his life, this force came
into it and he couldn't get him out by fighting him or telling
anyone about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester was perhaps good training for Norman Bates, the most
infamous embodiment of mad evil in the annals of cinema. Still
Vaughn, as well as Heche, know that they're risking the wrath of
cineastes everywhere who simply don't want to accept anyone except
Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in the classic horror story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you don't get a fair shot out of the gate with it and
I understand why, because people like the first one,'' Vaughn says.
``But I just think people should be open to the fact that
everything _ music, plays _ is meant to be exploited and
reinterpreted. It's almost 40 years later and it's time. And so
far, it's been fun and, I think, really worthwhile. As actors,
we've been having a ball with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince and I were able to encourage each other much quicker
than we would have been able to with somebody else who we didn't
know or work similarly with,'' Heche adds. ``Especially since Vince
is really going into such strange depths, I'm glad to have been
there for him to get into that. We both trusted each other on these
new characters.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, in fact, that tabloids have speculated that the
``Psycho'' stars are having an affair _ which is about as absurd as
recent tab reports that Phoenix's girlfriend, Liv Tyler, was
responsible for the breakup of her ``Armageddon'' co-star Bruce
Willis' marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insane,'' notes Heche, whose relationship with comedian
Ellen DeGeneres has been an ongoing media obsession for more than a
year. ``How many times do I have to say I tell the truth? It's
gross. What's behind it is that some people don't want Ellen and me
to be in love as we are, and that's kind of sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I would like people to understand that
actors can just have joyous working relationships and let that
stand for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sometimes they do become more than that. Vaughn, for
example, is currently dating Joey Lauren Adams (``Chasing Amy''),
with whom he co-stars in another upcoming movie, the family drama
``A Cool, Dry Place.''
</P>
<P>
   But romance is one thing. Finding colleagues with whom you can
really enjoy creating different, daring movies is an almost equally
special _ and about as rare _ pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne and Joaq are both great actors, in my opinion, and
they're easy to get along with,'' Vaughn observes. ``You can go out
on a limb and they're there for you, and vice versa. And they're
also both bright, fun and easygoing. You don't have to call them by
their character names on the set and that junk. They jump in,
they're totally committed and you can trust them. But then they can
jump out and be regular, kid around and that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Vaughn, Phoenix and Heche deny that they're actively
looking for more work to do together. To at least one informed
observer, though, it seems inevitable that the team will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all three of these actors will work together again in
different combinations,'' director Ruben says. ``To me, they're
about as good as any three young actors working in this country
right now. In different ways, they're all exceptional.''

KIEV SAYING GOOD NIGHT TO LATE-NIGHT HOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's hello Michael Reagan and bye-bye Gregg
Hunter at local news-talk KIEV-AM (870), the longtime family-owned
station recently purchased for the largest amount ever paid for a
single Los Angeles radio property.
</P>
<P>
   First to leave when new owners Salem Communications Inc. take
over Aug. 26 will be Hunter, whose late-night
entertainment-oriented call-in program has been on the air at
Glendale's KIEV for 30 years. His last broadcast will be Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience is seriously affected by this,'' Hunter said.
``Hopefully, another station will pick up the show and run with it.
I'm certainly going to miss KIEV and my audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salem's Dave Armstrong, KIEV's new general manager, said the
good-natured Hunter program might not be gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to evaluate everything and maybe make some
additions or changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new KIEV schedule will focus on conservative talk hosts such
as George Putnam, Ray Briem, Michael Medved and Reagan, whose show
is syndicated out of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Camarillo-based Salem, which owns 45 stations across the
country, including Glendale religious talk outlets KKLA-AM/FM and
KLTX-AM, paid $33.4 million for KIEV, which had been owned by the
Beaton family since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, KIEV will move to KKLA's studios, also in
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MORNING MAN: Longtime morning man Charlie Van Dyke takes
over the KRTH-FM (101.1) morning show Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke replaces Jim Carson and Joni Caryl, who themselves
replaced the late Robert W. Morgan. Carson will continue at KRTH as
a part-time host while Caryl will work with Van Dyke.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hire Van Dyke ends a yearlong search for a
morning host at the venerable oldies station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie has one of the greatest voices in radio and many
stations have tried to lure him,'' said KRTH program director Mike
Phillips. ``He brings tremendous talent to KRTH and a familiar
voice back to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of radio outlets across the country, Van Dyke worked
at local pop station KHJ in the '70s. In the '80s, while working at
Phoenix station KTAR, he built his own recording studio in
Scottsdale and became the voice of more than 60 TV stations and 100
radio stations during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personifies the voice that lends identity to a radio
station,'' said radio insider Don Barrett in his ``Los Angeles
Radio People'' book.
</P>
<P>
   `AIRTALK' ADDS HOUR: Pasadena public-radio KPCC-FM (89.3) has

CALIFORNIA DEPUTIES DEFEND USE OF PEPPER SPRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sheriff's deputies were ``courteous'' and
``compassionate'' when they daubed pepper spray on the eyes of
several already immobile environmental protesters, their lawyer
told a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the demonstrators, however, described the
police action as the needless infliction of pain on defenseless
people, a ``new and unorthodox use of pepper spray that has not
been sanctioned by law enforcement anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as trial opened Monday on whether the use of
pepper spray by deputies in Humboldt County violated the
protesters' civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco is presiding
over the case brought by nine demonstrators against the Humboldt
County Sheriff's Department, Sheriff Dennis Lewis, Chief Deputy
Gary Philp and the Eureka Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that the protesters illegally trespassed and
refused to disperse, or that the deputies had the right to arrest
them. Rather, the suit stems from three separate pepper spray
episodes during the protests last fall against logging of ancient
redwoods along California's North Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Macon Cowles, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, began by
telling the jury of two men and six women that his clients were
nonviolent participants in what have become perennial ``symbolic
protests'' against harvesting of rare trees that ``date to the time
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 25, 1997, four protesters locked themselves to 25-pound
pieces of pipe at the Scotia office of the Pacific Lumber Co. When
they refused to unlock themselves, deputies used cottons swabs to
dab the noxious substance in the corners of the protesters' eyes.
Two protesters unlocked themselves, but deputies still had to cut
loose the other two.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, 1997, two demonstrators locked themselves between the
tracks of a bulldozer on the lumber company's property. This time
the deputies daubed their eyes with the caustic chemical and gave
each a ``full face shot'' from less than three feet away, Cowles
said. Even then, the men did not unlock themselves and deputies had
to cut the pipe, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1997, protesters deposited a tree stump and sawdust
in the Eureka office of Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., and four women
locked their hands and legs to it.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists targeted Riggs because they saw him as a
promoter for the logging industry, Cowles said. The deputies held
back the women's eyelids and swiped cotton swabs on their eyes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowles contended the incidents violated the county's written
rules on using the spray, an ``off the books'' use of what is a
``good tool'' when used properly.
</P>
<P>
   The spray incapacitates its subjects with severe pain, coughing,
twitching eyes, temporary loss of upper body control,
disorientation and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Delaney, the deputies' attorney, said they acted properly.
The deputies applied the spray safely to counter what they saw as
dangers posed by cutting through heavy locks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she said, the demonstrators used standard bicycle
locks that deputies could sever with bolt-cutters. Then they used
heavier locks that required grinders. In these incidents, they used
pieces of pipe weighing some 25 pounds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies feared using the grinders to remove the locks would
spark a fire or cut the protesters, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She described the spray _ made of cayenne pepper and known
scientifically as oleoresin capsicum _ as ``a natural, organic
food-grade product.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the incidents, Philp researched the issue and consulted
with the Humboldt County district attorney's office and the county
risk assessment officer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies intensified the applications only when initial
efforts did not achieve the desired effect, she said, adding that
they were ``courteous, compassionate'' and washed the spray off
with water as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who do not claim they were permanently injured,
seek unspecified payments for pain and suffering and a finding that
the applications violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on
unreasonable seizures of their bodies.

Annie Ernaux began in 1952, when Ms. Ernaux was 12 years old and
growing above her parents' cafe in Normandy in a town she calls Y.
``My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the
early afternoon,'' we learn in Ms. Ernaux's very first line. From
there, we plunge into a minute examination of that day, and then a
laconic evocation of images from a life perceived through the
narrow, intensifying frame of a girl's pain.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be noted at the outset that the father did not kill
his wife and that almost within minutes the couple resumed the
normal rhythms of their life together. Indeed, not very much
happens in ``Shame,'' which is Ms. Ernaux's sixth book to be
translated into English _ after ``A Woman's Story,'' ``A Man's
Place,'' ``Simple Passion,'' ``A Frozen Woman'' and ``Exteriors.''
The new book is as quiet as a bird in flight. What we hear is
something so light it could be the beating of wings, or of a heart
that is so reticent it almost dares not announce its presence.
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of the girl's feelings is inversely reflected by
the controlled simplicity of Ms. Ernaux's sentences. ``Shame,''
which takes off, as Ms. Ernaux's earlier books do, from her own
family experience, is the mature woman's vision of herself at the
moment when childhood innocence was replaced by shattering
childhood terror. It has a gloss of tragedy about it, and also
something sadly mysterious, like a mighty effort that one might
make to understand the meaning of a strange, inexplicable dream.
</P>
<P>
   The question posed by the book is why the feeling evoked by a
shocking but momentary family altercation was one of shame, rather
than something else _ grief, terror, resentment. Ms. Ernaux comes
close to an explanation as she patiently pieces together the mosaic
of her 12-year-old self, performing what she calls an
``ethnological study of myself.'' But in the end she faces the
ultimate unknowability of it all even after the fragments of the
past have been unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After evoking the images I have of that summer, I feel
inclined to write `then I discovered that' or `then I realized
that,' words implying a clear perception of the events one has
lived through,'' Ms. Ernaux says at the end. ``But in my case there
is no understanding, only this feeling of shame that has fossilized
the images and stripped them of meaning. The fact that I
experienced such inertia and nothingness is something that cannot
be denied. It is the ultimate truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also, Ms. Ernaux allows, ``the bond between the little
girl of 1952 and the woman who is writing this manuscript.'' As she
reviews the features of life in Y in the years when France was
still struggling from the destruction of World War II, Ms. Ernaux
summons up an existence of parochialism and piety that seems far
away from her now.
</P>
<P>
   Her Y, devastated by bombing, has outdoor toilets, no running
water, ``hardly any stores at all except a cafe-grocery-coal
depot,'' which is owned by her parents. Ms. Ernaux remembers with
her ethnologist's eye the features, the gestures, the distinctions
of money and language that gave the town its character, the things
``we all knew,'' like ``to stay clean without wasting the water,''
or ``to express silent contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our lives,'' Ms. Ernaux says, ``nothing is thought,
everything is done.'' As a girl, she dwelled in a network of
``rules and codes'' that did not allow for alternatives. ``There
was an outright condemnation of divorcees, Communists, unmarried
couples, single mothers, women who drank, who got an abortion,
whose heads were shaved at the Liberation, who didn't keep their
house tidy and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old comes from the modest circumstances of a
working-class family that keeps a cafe with hours of metronomic
regularity. She is one of those who go to a ``private school,''
meaning in the France of that era a Catholic school, which she
remembers with a kind of understated amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was forbidden to look out of any of the windows down into
the street,'' she says of the red brick building where the poor
girls were strictly segregated from the richer ones. ``Yet I am
sure I was perfectly happy there and could aspire to nothing
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It is from within that world of ``coherence'' and ``strength,''
of awakening sexual curiosity and infatuations with older girls,
that the terrible experience at the center of this novelized
remembrance takes place. ``I had seen the unseeable,'' she writes,
and later:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame became a new way of living for me. I don't think I was
even aware of it, it had become part of my own body.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading Ms. Ernaux's story, one is tempted to ask why an event
of such brief duration, replaced by an instantaneous return to
normal life, produced so powerful and unshakable an impression. But
that is just the point: It is the momentary, violent aberration _
the brief glimpse of a scythe in the hand of the father, the sound
of a mother's sobs _ and not years of ordinariness that leaves its
scar, and that one ponders for years afterward, striving to make
the connection between the frightened child of yesterday and the
quizzical, wounded adult of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different now and yet the same,'' the young Stephen Dedalus of
James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' says to himself as he looks at his image
in a cracked mirror. He is thinking of himself at that moment and
of himself from years before, seeing the adult forged out of the
child that he was. Ms. Ernaux's delicate, mystical exploration is
stylistically very different from anything Joyce ever wrote, but it
contains much the same sense of wonderment at the silently watching
child that never really leaves us.

TURTLE'S DEMISE A COSTLY TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The turtle died.
</P>
<P>
   For me, this is not as bad as the rabbit dying, but it's a close
second. As I write this, I am wearing black as a sign of mourning,
and because I really need to wash.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Tupac, my son's turtle, don't you? He was the
red-eared slider that I bought on credit three weeks ago. Well,
he's six inches under now in the good shoe box that my suede pumps
came in. Life really is a four-letter word isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was wrong with that turtle from the moment I
saw him at the pet store. He had beady eyes, and he wouldn't make
eye contact like the other turtles. He kind of weaved when we was
swimming, too, like he was on something, you know. Anyway, I tried
to get my son, Austin, to pick a box turtle like his brother, but,
no, he had to have a water turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Water turtles need water, and a bunch of other stuff that I
won't be able to get rid of at a garage sale. I'm telling you we
did everything for Tupac. That turtle got more attention than me,
and what thanks do we get? Two days after the guarantee was up, he
lost his will to live.
</P>
<P>
   The boys called me at work to tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I had noticed that Tupac looked a little odd that morning
when I peeked in on my son before leaving for work. But, then, I
never thought he looked all that healthy. He was sprawled out on
that heated rock we bought for him like he'd been partying all
night. But I just kissed my son and went on my merry way.
</P>
<P>
   My assistant called me to the phone later that day, even though
I was quite busy. I always take calls from my family.
</P>
<P>
   My son was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, can I put ice cream on a peanut butter sandwich? The baby
sitter said I could only put jelly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine, son,'' I said. ``But make sure you clean up the
kitchen when you're done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love ya, gotta go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost as an afterthought, he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, my turtle died. I think he killed himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   We bought a suicidal turtle, and I haven't even paid for it yet.
</P>
<P>
   A deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, I'm sorry about your turtle. I'm sure he didn't suffer,
and he's in a better place now. We'll have a little ceremony when I
get home and bury him. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, can I do an autopsy and see what killed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, leave the turtle alone. Just put him in a box or
something and wait for me or your father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have a dog? Dogs swim better than turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye, son.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, I felt a great sense of loss with the demise of
Tupac.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that I finally had formed an attachment to a
non-homo sapiens? Or could it be the astronomical interest rate on
my credit card? Maybe it was just the loss of a really good shoe
box. It's hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   This I do know: The next pet I buy will be a Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   No food, no filter, no fuss.
</P>

JUDGE FACES TOUGH CHOICES IN SENTENCING CONVICTED KILLER, 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An 11-year-old California boy convicted of
involuntary manslaughter for shooting his 13-year-old neighbor
could become the youngest of the 8,200 inmates in the California
Youth Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could go back to his parents and be placed on probation
and in an outpatient counseling program.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal justice system has a complex mission when dealing
with the youngest of violent offenders. For an adult, the gravity
of such crimes may merit lengthy terms behind bars. But judges and
criminal justice professionals have much more leeway with minors,
where the primary goal remains rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Juvenile Court Judge Lois Haight found the Antioch boy
guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the slaying of Larry Kiepert,
who was shot through the head with a 30.06-caliber rifle bullet
while he and family members were playing basketball in their back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Because she could discern no malice in the June 6 shooting,
Haight said, she was unable to find the boy guilty of murder. But,
she said, the defendant had known the weapon was loaded and
intentionally fired the gun.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the boy had shown ``deceptive behavior'' after the
shooting by lying about the incident and trying to hide evidence by
flushing the bullet casing down a toilet. But she found that he had
acted without malice, citing ``his age, his average intelligence
and his lack of serious misbehavior before this terrible
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases involving very young offenders, judges, prosecutors and
probation officers must make tough decisions as to whether the
offenders were aware enough of the gravity of their actions to be
held criminally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at the element of when they did what they did,
and did they know what they were doing is wrong,'' said Contra
Costa County Deputy District Attorney Harold Jewett.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial of the Antioch boy, prosecutors contended that
the boy had fired in revenge because Kiepert had shot him in the
leg with a BB gun two days earlier. But defense attorneys argued
the shooting had been an accident. They argued that the youngster
couldn't even have seen Kiepert when the gun went off.
</P>
<P>
   Haight is scheduled to sentence the youth Sept. 8. Depending on
what she decides, the boy could go to the Youth Authority, where he
could spend the next 10 years, or be sentenced to probation and
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney William Gagen expressed hope his client would
be rehabilitated instead of punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counseling is absolutely essential,'' he said, adding his
belief that there was no crime because his client, who was home
alone on the day of the shooting, didn't have the capacity to know
the consequences of his actions while playing with his father's
hunting rifle.

TROLLOPE'S STAR RISING AGAIN, WITH REASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My formal introduction to Victorian literature was in high
school. Charles Dickens was its centerpiece, and we read works by
William Makepeace Thackeray, George Eliot, the sisters Bronte,
Wilkie Collins, a few others ... but the name of Anthony Trollope
was not mentioned in the course, nor were any of his books on the
reading list.
</P>
<P>
   My first acquaintance with the Trollope byline occurred back
when hardbound Modern Library editions cost 95 cents. I bought
``The Eustace Diamonds'' but only read it sometime later when
Trollope was an obligation in college study, although still ranked
beneath those aforementioned others.
</P>
<P>
   An anecdote rendered professorially was that Anthony Trollope
would complete a novel in the morning, knock off for lunch, and
begin a new novel in the afternoon. From his first novel, published
in 1847, to the last one issued posthumously in 1883, the Trollope
writing machine ground out 47 large novels and a smattering of
nonfiction, including what may be the best autobiography by a
19th-century author.
</P>
<P>
   More amazing still, Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) was, over more
than half of his authorial tenure, a full-time employee of the
General Post Office in London. His strong work ethic was prodded by
happiness in his work; and as an author, he was enamored of a world
of his own invention.
</P>
<P>
   That world was and is Barset, an imaginary county in the west of
England. Barchester is its principal town; and of Barset, Trollope
in his autobiography reported that ``I had it all in my mind, its
roads and railroads, its towns and parishes ... throughout these
stories, there has been no name given to a fictitious site which
does not represent to me a spot of which I know all the
accessories, as though I had lived and wandered there.''
</P>
<P>
   The six Barset novels, appearing from 1855 to 1867, are ``The
Warden,'' ``Barchester Towers,'' ``Doctor Thorne,'' ``Framley
Parsonage,'' ``The Small House at Allington'' and ``The Last
Chronicle of Barset.'' With these books, Trollope effectively
established the novel sequence in English fiction. Thus he emulated
Balzac's ``La Comedie Humaine'' with the device of background
characters reappearing in the various novels.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Trollope fictions is a second six-novel sequence,
popularly known as the Palliser novels, after the family of
Plantaganet Palliser that populates every tale. These, issued from
1864 to 1880, are ``Can You Forgive Her?,'' ``Phineas Finn,'' ``The
Eustace Diamonds,'' ``Phineas Redux,'' ``The Prime Minister'' and
``The Duke's Children.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Palliser sequence was served honorably by
BBC's Masterpiece Theater. To what extent this raised Trollope's
stature internationally is difficult to determine; but for whatever
reasons, the Trollope star has risen, is rising still, and on both
sides of the Atlantic he now outstrips Thackeray and almost every
Victorian Brit except Dickens, whom he reasonably threatens.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, I knew little about Trollope's mother, who gets
short shrift in his autobiography. She was Frances Trollope
(1780-1863), who made an unfortunate marriage that produced many
offspring. To earn a living for her brood, she made several
business ventures and failed in all of them until, past age 50, she
took up a writing career.
</P>
<P>
   She then attained fame writing more than 40 books, mostly novels
that were quite popular in their time and are now forgotten and
probably worthless. But she was a woman of extraordinary energy, a
fitting subject for a biography, and now there is one _ ``Fanny
Trollope,'' on Viking's fall list. Perhaps the most provocative
aspect of Pamela Neville-Sington's study is the abrasive
relationship between Fanny and son Anthony, fueled by mutual
jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   The Trollopes, then, are a dynasty; and direct descendant Joanna
Trollope writes popular novels today. The recognition gap is
effectively closed, and we expect to hear more and more about
Anthony and other Trollopes.

A MODEL OF PERSEVERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Levitz knows a little about how hitting bottom feels.
</P>
<P>
   For a few weeks last fall in Milan, Italy, he felt painfully
close. Some days he was cold, hungry, low on money and living in
low-grade Italian hotels, all for the sake of modeling jobs that
did not come.
</P>
<P>
   When he told his mother, Meryl Levitz of Overland Park, how much
he weighed she was so alarmed that she shipped him vitamins. ``I
kept saying, `Why don't you just come home?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitz, 27, is a graduate of the University of Kansas and Blue
Valley North High School. These days his head is shaved as smooth
as marble tile. He has a formidable, complex tattoo occupying much
of his upper right arm, clear, piercing blue-green eyes, a thrift
shop wardrobe and a youthful sense of confidence that some might
call attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a gripping tenacity that kept him pushing until late
last year, when his modeling career suddenly went into orbit. In
January he was booked in eight of the prestigious Milan menswear
runway shows, including well-known names such as Krizia and Giorgio
Armani. He also appeared in the Giorgio Armani campaign, which will
be part of the print ads in U.S. magazines this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He worked even more of the fall menswear shows earlier this
summer. And to his own surprise, he was recently voted No. 10 among
the top 10 male models by a European fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want something bad enough, you get it,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Home for a brief visit recently, Levitz recalled how as a kid he
began to think modeling was ``kind of cool'' after watching models
on television and seeing photographs of his mother, who modeled
early in her life.
</P>
<P>
   He had a couple of jobs in high school and then nothing. He went
on to study advertising and marketing in college. ``I was a
terrible student,'' he said, remembering how he barely squeaked
through to graduation. A job in advertising lasted six months. ``I
just can't see myself sitting at a desk, holding a real job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago Levitz packed up his belongings and left
home for Los Angeles, where he made the rounds of agencies, waited
tables and picked up an occasional modeling job. His mother wasn't
surprised. ``When he was about 14, he started saying, `I'm going to
move to California.' I said, `No you're not.' And he said, `Yes I
am.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One late night after a long shift, the manager of a restaurant
where he worked _ ``my very beautiful manager,'' as he puts it with
a smile _ suddenly suggested that he shave off his collar-length
curly hair. He obliged without a second thought. The hair was
beginning to thin out up front anyway, and he found the idea of
transplants and other hair-growth treatments disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   His mother saw his new look for the first time when she spotted
him on a country music video, but she took it in stride. He was
always trying to be different, she said, even as a young teen-ager
when he insisted on dyeing his dark hair blond. He turned it orange
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry where image is everything and quirky is
rewarded, it often pays off to set yourself apart. Modeling work
began to pick up, he said, and he started to think about Milan.
Last summer after his truck was totaled in an accident, Levitz used
the insurance payment to buy a plane ticket. Life would never be
quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   Levitz's adventures started when he arrived in Brussels,
Belgium, prepared to sleep in the airport during a long layover. He
spotted a friend from Los Angeles, who invited him to come with her
and stay with her friends. They welcomed him into their home, and
when he left his thank-you gift was American toilet tissue he had
packed in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   When he first arrived in Italy, he stayed in youth hostels, but
because he had to leave with all his things every morning and
return that night, he kept moving around as one without a home.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, he was having no luck with modeling agencies.
``Sometimes the guy wouldn't even look at my book. He'd just be
thumbing through it and talking to someone,'' Levitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he signed with the Major agency. He ultimately moved
into a cold-water residence hotel with other models. He began to
make friends and found a certain camaraderie among other young men
with similar aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   He learned how to make his way around Milan and quickly mastered
the art of tricking the Milanese transit system by reusing his
paper metro ticket. ``Why not? You're poor. And you get bored. It's
something to do,'' he said as he explained how he and his friends
had a way of slipping through the turnstile when the transit
security wasn't watching or, on occasion, backing one another up to
intimidate the officers when they tried to apprehend them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Levitz found a supportive friend in his agency
booker, Mossimo Tacchini. ``He gave me money out of his pocket,''
Levitz said. ``I would go to his house and we'd talk for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   And toward the end of the year he started to get bookings for
print ads. He had used a credit card to buy a ticket for a quick
Christmas trip back to the United States, and he even postponed his
trip because of work possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned on New Year's Day from a Christmas with his
cousin in New Jersey, groggy from his own New Year's celebration
overnight, he was sent off on a round of go-see appointments to the
design houses.
</P>
<P>
   A few days into the week, as he tried to find his way from place
to place, Levitz stopped to call his booker, who told him what
turned out to be very good news. He was on reserve for the Emporio
Armani, a collection by Giorgio Armani, a youthful, less expensive
version of Armani's signature line. It was a turning point. When he
did the show he was so impressed with Armani the man, whom he found
to be so professional and polite, that he considered it the best
moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   After he worked for Armani the first season, he was
automatically booked for the next one. And then he was hired for
the Armani fall book, from which the ads were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a challenging year indeed. He credits his parents
with giving him encouragement and support. ``My dad took care of my
financial affairs. I mean, he made sure I paid my bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still a little incredulous about his life, Levitz is not sure
what happens next. ``I don't know if it was just luck or what,'' he
said of the past few months. When he left Kansas City recently, he
was to try out for a charity runway show in San Francisco and then
return to Milan. He hopes to hit the modeling scene in Paris soon
and then New York, certainly more competitive than European cities.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first to admit his life is not perfect. ``I don't have
a real apartment. I don't have a dog. I don't have a car,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows it's not bad. He has enough free time to read books
_ in recent months 30 something, including Jack Kerouac and some on
Buddhism.
</P>

   He is enjoying a certain visibility. His grandparents were
sitting in a doctor's office in New Jersey not long ago when they
were surprised to spot him in a magazine. Relatives in Florida had
similar experiences. His mother is busy collecting the books she
can find.
</P>

   As for the ideal? He sees himself working about five years,
saving some money and settling with a family somewhere in
California.

   Good leather ahead
</P>
<P>
   OK. Not everyone is up to sashaying about in a leather cat suit
and it's certainly not a sight we want to see. But when Uma Thurman
crawls into Emma Peel's skin (literally in leather) in the new film
remake of the television series ``The Avengers,'' her cool wardrobe
could provide some hot fashion do's and don'ts for the stylishly
inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Peel's image is rooted, of course, in the '60s, and the familiar
leather cat suit was a must, says costume designer Anthony Powell.
But she couldn't wear that every day, so his challenge was to go
beyond it with a wardrobe suited to Thurman's style, reminiscent of
the '60s and representative of the '90s. To make them fit in the
same image as the cat suit, everything else she wears is form
fitting or made of suede and leather, including the eye-catching
pink leather suit.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency is a ploy to consider if you think your clothes are
disjointed and project no particular fashion style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes wardrobe as John Steed could indeed be
inspiration for every man. His suits were made by Savile Row
tailoring shops, including the bowler hat, from a company in
service to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Man, you're looking good
</P>
<P>
   For men who are not sure whether to vent with suits, or are
slightly challenged when it comes to combing hair over the balding
spots, Men's Health magazine offers the quintessential Guide to
Style in the back of the September book. There is even a fold-out
``Cheat Sheet'' poster to prep you for shopping trips.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips:
</P>
<P>
   - If you wear a single vent jacket, don't put your hands in your
trouser pockets. The spread will expose your rear end. Bad form.
</P>
<P>
   - The correct length for trousers: With pants waist precisely at
your waist, the front of your trouser leg should rest on the top of
your shoe with a slight fold.
</P>
<P>
   - You'll know your comb-over ploy _ the practice of using hair
from thick spots to cover thin _ is too obvious and you need to see
your barber if your bangs begin at the back of your head and you
are not George Clooney or a cast member of ``Friends.''

COMPANIES TEST VACCINES TO KEEP HARMFUL BACTERIA OUT OF FOOD
CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) ... Traditionally these companies have made treatments
aimed at keeping herd and flock animals healthy. In recent years,
however, each has developed or is researching products that would
protect animals against salmonella or E. coli, which often don't
make animals sick but can be deadly to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines stimulate the body's natural defenses against an
infection. Similar treatments using what's called competitive
exclusion, stimulate good bacteria in animals' guts to keep bad
bacteria from getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense suggests that immunizing the animals we eat against
these bacteria is a good idea. To understand why this approach is
new requires understanding the anatomy of the meat and egg
industries and of animals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Chu, vice president of biological research development and
regulatory affairs for Fort Dodge, said animal producers saw no
reason to invest in drugs to treat against microbes that didn't
affect their animals. These bacteria generally live in the animals'
gut, instead of muscles, and are simply passed out in their
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Chu said, the companies that raised animals had no
faith that operators of meat-packing plants were doing enough to
guard against these microbes getting into meat. Without safeguards
in food-processing plants, the investment by the hog grower or
cattle producer would be for naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was fecal or environmental contamination,'' Chu
said, ``it might come at the packing plants or processing plant,
what used to be called slaughterhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an issue that still needs to be addressed, said John
Phillip, a vice president for research with Bayer Animal Health in
Merriam, Kan. ``The big issue is who pays and who gets the benefit?
A company can vaccinate but not get the premium payment from the
person who buys the meat.''
</P>
<P>
   This is changing, Chu said. Since January large meat and poultry
companies have been forced by new federal regulations to reduce the
level of pathogens in the animals they raise and process. They must
establish processes to guard against bacteria getting into their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was resistance to the new regulations, companies
now are making investments to reduce bacteria, said Bill Roenigk,
vice president of the National Broiler Council, a trade association
representing most of the food chicken producers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Many poultry producers, he said, now see the value of treating
chickens with vaccines or competitive exclusion products. These are
one of many ways producers are using to reduce pathogens in their
flocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irradiation can do the same thing but it is not something
consumers see as natural,'' Roenigk said. ``Consumers understand
vaccines and good bacteria and are more accepting of that.''
</P>
<P>
   These advances are what has prompted many animal-health
companies to begin investing in research on vaccines, thinking
there now may be a market. Research spending on biologicals has
increased 155 percent to $101.8 million since 1987, according to a
trade association for animal-health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and restaurant workers make up the final piece of the
foodborne illness equation. The general belief is that if they cook
food to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, then pathogens would be
killed and people wouldn't get sick. But it is isn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be avoided but probably that is asking too much of
mankind,'' said Joan Leonard, a partner in Biomune and creator of
its key vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers are ignorant of how to prevent food contamination
in their own kitchens. It might not occur to consumers that taking
cooked hamburgers off the grill and putting them on the same plate
that held the raw patties could contaminate the cooked food.
</P>
<P>
   There are many new programs by the meat industry and others to
inform consumers about how to prevent food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we expect consumers to take responsibility, you have to
educate them,'' said Scott of the National Food Processors
Association.

QUEEN OF HEARTLESSNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul McCartney once sang, ``Her majesty's a pretty
nice girl but she doesn't have much to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you believe the portrait painted of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II by Christopher Andersen in ``The Day Diana Died''
(William Morrow; $27), then nice is not the word that you'd apply
to her royal highness _ and what she almost didn't say is telling.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andersen's book, which hits stores today, the queen
showed ``an astonishing lack of emotion _ even for the reserved
monarch'' when informed of Princess Diana's death from a car crash
in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997. She then insisted that Prince Charles
not wake the children _ William and Harry _ to tell them of their
mother's death. Charles then waited until morning to break the news
to the boys, at which point they all ``wept unashamedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at breakfast, according to Andersen, neither the queen
nor Prince Philip hugged their grandsons, but in typical British
reserve did tell the children how ``terribly sorry'' they were, and
the queen insisted that they go to their scheduled morning church
service.
</P>
<P>
   The church service, at the queen's orders, made no mention of
Diana's death, but had a sermon that contained a number of jokes,
prompting Harry to ask Charles, ``Are you sure Mummy is dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the queen's real concern was the royal jewels. The
book says that after hearing of Diana's death, the queen called the
British Embassy in Paris, wanting to know if Diana had any royal
jewels when she died and demanded that they be ``returned
immediately.'' An envoy was dispatched to the hospital where
Diana's body lay, but the princess apparently wasn't wearing any
jewels when she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and even his girlfriend, Camille Parker-Bowles, come off
much better in this straightforward account by Andersen, who has
written two less-than-flattering books on the Kennedys (``Jack and
Jackie'' and ``Jackie After Jack''). Parker-Bowles is said to have
told Charles to ``concentrate on the boys. They need you.'' And
over his mother's objections, Charles flew to France to claim his
former wife's body and had white lilies (Diana's favorites) sent to
her room.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to Andersen, William was puzzled over why
the flag over Buckingham Palace was not lowered to half-mast right
after Diana died, (the flag was not lowered for several days) and
why the royal family stayed at its Balmoral, Scotland, retreat
while Diana's body was in London.
</P>
<P>
   What will make ``The Day Diana Died'' fascinating reading for
many is the behind-the-scenes struggles within the royal family. It
took Charles and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to prevail upon
the queen to speak to the nation. This was only after Charles, the
book says, told her he would go on TV and apologize for her
``apparent callous disregard for the people's suffering'' and that
it became clear that her silence would endanger the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Day Diana Died'' is likely to raise eyebrows _ if not
stiff upper lips _ with some of its revelations. Here are a few
others:
</P>
<P>
   Dodi Fayed, who was killed with Diana, intended to ask her to
marry him that night and was upset that the paparazzi was
interfering with his plans. He decided to play a game of
cat-and-mouse with them before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Diana intended to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's final words were ``My God, what's happened?''
</P>
<P>
   At her request, Diana's casket had a window above her face.
</P>
<P>
   Her face was virtually untouched after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Charles almost passed out when he first saw Diana dead.
</P>

TODAY'S TERRORISM IS FRIGHTENING IN BOTH ITS COMPOSITION AND
RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The terrorists who murdered Missourian Kenneth R.
Hobson II last week when they blew up the American Embassy in Kenya
almost certainly didn't know his name or face.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the rest of the more than 200 people they
killed or the 5,000 people they injured in the two almost
simultaneous embassy bombings. The casualties of Friday's terrorist
attacks were employees and pedestrians in the wrong places at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   But the terrorists were part of a new breed of extremists that
both puzzle and worry experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, we thought we understood something about
terrorism,'' said University of Kansas political scientist Philip
Schrodt. ``The classic example was some dramatic event that
attracted attention for a cause, a kidnapping or a hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was more like the Lockerbie airplane bombing or
Oklahoma City. There was no message attached to the action. No one
claimed responsibility. They don't seem even to have been out to
impress anyone. The only point seems to have been to kill people,
and maybe just to kill Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a problem for this country: How does a nation
deal with an invisible enemy?
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday announced a $2
million reward for information leading to the arrests of the
bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although terror can turn buildings to rubble and laughter to
tears, it can never, will never, deter America from its purpose or
presence around the globe,'' she told State Department employees.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the United States is sending several hundred investigators
to the bomb scenes to help determine who's responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is much deeper than that. What experts see
emerging from the embassy rubble is just one more puzzle piece from
the new world of international terrorism, which creates a picture
that is almost wholly random.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kisangani Emizet, a professor and expert in
African politics at Kansas State University, said that by logic,
the bombings should have happened elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no strong anti-American feelings in Kenya and
Tanzania,'' he said. ``That is why this is such a puzzle. Perhaps
those who did this came from elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after terrorism began replacing guerrilla warfare
as a violent outlet for those seeing themselves as oppressed, the
rules are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer Nudell, a counter-terrorism expert from Virginia, noted
that terrorists used to try to avoid mass death, especially among
those not involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think back 20 or 30 years to the attacks by the Red Brigade,
where extreme actions including kidnapping,'' he said. ``The
Weathermen did plant bombs. But they were attempting to publicize
their agendas. And killing people on this scale would have been
seen as counterproductive to the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims today are discounted as unimportant, at best. In many
cases, they are dehumanized. In the United States, this is seen
inside white supremacist camps, where minorities and Jews are
literally classified as subhuman. Among Islamic extremists, America
is classified as ``The Great Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   And in many cases, killing these targets is seen as the reason
behind the terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlike decades past, when the largest terrorist groups
had either nationalist agendas (a free Northern Ireland, a
Palestinian homeland, a free Albania) or ideological agendas
(pro-communism, anti-capitalism).
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd hijack a passenger plane and _ with cameras rolling _
blow it up in the desert,'' Schrodt said. ``But first they let off
the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   But such public actions may have led to this more secretive
brand of terrorists. Brent Smithy, a University of
Alabama-Birmingham terrorism expert, said that, over time,
counter-terrorism efforts thinned the ranks of those making public
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift away from the public action is so that terrorists
can survive to attack again,'' he said. ``In the past, terrorists
were looking to make a point. Today, they're looking to avoid
detection, detention and prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   They accomplish that in two diametrically opposed ways.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said many of the terrorists operating worldwide today are
actually professionals. The most successful among them build grand
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that on the other side of the spectrum there is a
growing threat from so-called ``uncoordinated violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new, leaderless, structureless tactic,'' he said.
``A communique saying simply `Kill Americans' is issued. That's all
there is to the order. It's not sent to anyone in particular, and
no potential sites are mentioned. But individuals of similar
viewpoints eventually see the communique and decide on their own
how to follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bomb finally goes off, there are no ties to an
organized group or a leader. It's a very frightening development in
terrorism and almost impossible to defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the number of terrorist attacks may decline, future
death tolls are expected to grow.

COMPANIES TEST VACCINES TO KEEP HARMFUL BACTERIA OUT OF FOOD

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Just beyond a parking area at a Lenexa, Kan.,
industrial complex sits a line of 10 wooden storage sheds, like one
would find in someone's back yard, only larger.
</P>
<P>
   From their open doors comes the crowing of roosters, back and
forth, up and down the line. A squawking cacophony of roosters,
hens and chicks. These birds, however, are not destined for the
dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are being used to test a vaccine to keep
salmonella out of chickens and their eggs and to reduce the amount
of bacteria that makes it into consumers' lasagna, hamburgers or
turkey sandwiches. One vaccine immunizes against a strain of
salmonella responsible for an estimated 2 million cases of food
poisoning a year, double from 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens belong to Biomune Inc., one of several
animal-health companies in Kansas' Johnson County and the area that
have or are developing so-called ``biologicals'' to immunize
animals against various bacteria. Although not a magic bullet,
vaccines are believed to offer a tremendous opportunity to cut the
number of food poisoning cases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Plylar, a founder of Biomune, said some countries are far
ahead of the United States in using vaccines to fight foodborne
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary use of our vaccine is to protect humans,'' Plylar
said about the vaccines Biomune sells to the egg industry. ``It is
required in Germany to keep salmonella out of the human food
chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that what people eat might make them sick, or kill
them, has become a greater concern in the last two decades. Because
of better reporting, more cases of foodborne illness are being
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a California juice manufacturer agreed to pay a
$1.5 million fine following an outbreak of E. coli bacteria that
killed a 6-year-old and made 66 other persons sick. Potato salad
from a Chicago caterer was implicated in an E. coli outbreak that
made at least 4,500 people sick.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made food safety an issue and
included $71 million in its proposed budget this year to improve
food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a finger on the magnitude of foodborne illnesses is
tricky. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate
between 6 million and 80 million cases of foodborne illnesses occur
in the United States each year, resulting in an estimated 9,000
deaths. Cancer will kill an estimated 564,000 people this year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because reporting of foodborne illnesses is so poor, it can't be
proved that the situation is worse than it used to be. However, the
potential for problems is growing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, these are the
reasons foodborne pathogens have become major public health
problems:
</P>
<P>
   Older people and people with impaired immune systems are more
susceptible, and those groups are growing.
</P>
<P>
   New pathogens are emerging. Some are impervious to antibiotics,
making them harder to treat. Some, such as E. coli 0157:H7, are
proving particularly deadly, especially to children.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of megafarms and huge meat processing plants
increases the chances of making more people sick. National shippers
can deliver contaminated foods far and wide. Meat is a common cause
of foodborne illness.
</P>
<P>
   In their milder forms, foodborne illnesses cause cramps,
vomiting and diarrhea. Some pathogens can cause miscarriages,
meningitis or lead to kidney failure in children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the breadth of the problem is unknown, infected food
breaks the unwritten contract with American consumers that they can
expect their food to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers expect their food to be safe and have a right to
expect that in general. But they have to realize there is no zero
risk,'' said Jenny Scott, senior director of food safety programs
with a trade association of food processors in Washington D.C. ``At
this point in time, eating rare ground beef is a greater risk than
in the past and one most people should be unwilling to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County is a hotbed of animal-health research and
development. Besides Biomune, a niche player in the industry, Bayer
Animal Health and Fort Dodge Animal Health, large players in the
multibillion dollar animal-health industry, have headquarters here.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until it suddenly ended, the friendship between V.S.
Naipaul and Paul Theroux, as mentor and protege, was mutually
rewarding over a period of more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the forthcoming publication of Theroux's book ``Sir
Vidia's Shadow: A Friendship Across Five Continents,'' and the
controversy surrounding it, there is only bitterness. As often
happens in a divorce, their friends are forced to choose sides.
</P>
<P>
   To someone who knows them both and has assiduously followed
their careers, the result can only be a subject of great regret.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, I wrote a profile of Naipaul for The New York Times
Magazine. Since then, we have been friends and in the intervening
years I have written other articles about him. At the time of that
original piece, I also met Theroux, and he was a thoughtful guide
to his mentor's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   Often when we talked, Naipaul would express curiosity about his
American friend, about his book sales as well as his literary
stature.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone conversation, Theroux said that it was ``a
forbidden thought to write about a friend, a wife, a child.'' He
added that when a friendship ends, as his did, ``in a surgical
way,'' then the rules are broken, and a writer is able to speak his
mind about matters that earlier would have been considered not for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   For a book that falls far short of revelation, a price has been
paid. Casual comments to a friend now become a matter of public
record. ``Sir Vidia's Shadow,'' part of which appeared in a recent
issue of The New Yorker, has aspects of revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Theroux may believe that he has simply uncensored his
thoughts, it seems more likely that he has altered previously held
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if he has gone through his diaries and colorized
events. Quirks of character that once may have struck him as
amusing he now condemns.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, his physical descriptions of Naipaul are etched
in malice. In its detailed re-creation of scenes and dialogue from
the past, the book almost reads like a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Theroux said that he wrote the book because, to his knowledge,
there had never been a full-length portrait of his literary mentor
by a younger artist _ at least not since Boswell followed Johnson.
Beckett had not written about Joyce, nor had Gorky written
extensively about Tolstoy.
</P>
<P>
   If Theroux had written the book that he seemingly intended to
write, it would have had interest beyond that of the clash of
personalities. But this is not a mentor memoir. It is the story of
a friendship turned feud. An appropriate comparison might be the
published correspondence between Edmund Wilson and Vladimir
Nabokov, who had a falling out over their differences about
translating Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Theroux feels that he had the provocation, but somewhere
along the line a trust has been broken, and by focusing on
idiosyncracies the book avoids the full complexity of its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the perspective, Naipaul is either a man without a
constituency or a citizen of the world. Born in Trinidad of Indian
parentage, he was educated at Oxford and has lived in England most
of his life. He is very English, with the manners and the interests
of a country squire who is equally at home in the city.
</P>
<P>
   When he writes about the Third World, it is as a visitor, a
traveler. As well as being a brilliant writer, he is one of the
most articulate and outspoken artists. A man of wide learning and
firmly held convictions, he is unafraid to speak his mind, even, or
especially, when he is taking an unpopular position.
</P>
<P>
   The candor of his opinions is offset by his acerbic sense of
humor, which is often directed against himself (one of many aspects
shortchanged in Theroux's book). At the same time his belief in his
talent is matched by a kind of creative suffering during a writing
process in which he undergoes ``despair, desperation, panic.'' He
is an extraordinarily complicated person, not easily captured in
print, even by a formerly close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The two first met in Africa in 1966 when Naipaul was already a
highly regarded novelist and Theroux was at the beginning of his
career. More than anyone else, Naipaul encouraged the younger man
to be a writer and to keep revising. He was specific in his
suggestions, acting as adviser as well as editor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Theroux was an unflagging acolyte, but also one of the
few people who could offer Naipaul critical suggestions about his
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Theroux is an American who has lived most of his life in alien
cultures, and his novels assume an international cast. He is a kind
of collector _ of places, adventures and other writers, whom he has
often written about.
</P>
<P>
   Although Theroux has never had the stature of Naipaul, whose
distinguished novels have made him a perennial candidate for a
Nobel Prize for literature, he has won a wide public following for
his books of travel as well as his novels.
</P>
<P>
   For both men, a deep intellectual curiosity is combined with a
devotion to their art. In recent years, each has moved away from,
or rather, has reinterpreted the form of the novel, though that is
what brought them their first recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sir Vidia's Shadow,'' Theroux says that nonfiction, as well
as fiction, is ``a version of the truth,'' an idea that is endemic
to his own work. When Naipaul crosses the fictional line, the
bridge is more stylistic than contextual, as in ``The Enigma of
Arrival'' and ``A Way in the World,'' in which he applies
novelistic principles to a retelling of moments in his life.
</P>
<P>
   His current book, ``Beyond Belief,'' is another Naipaul return,
in this case to the world of Islam for a work that is part
journalism, part contemporary political history.
</P>
<P>
   As for Theroux, his novels ``My Secret History'' and ``My Other
Life'' are a more overt merging of fact and fiction, with even, in
the second book, the use of a character named Paul Theroux as
narrator. His last novel, ``Kowloon Tong,'' deals with the
quick-changing life in Hong Kong. With Theroux, it is sometimes
difficult to determine what the author has seen and what he has
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Theroux has frequently written about Naipaul, in an adulatory
book of criticism, ``V.S. Naipaul: An Introduction to His Work,''
in 1972, and in articles published over three decades.
Paradoxically, the book of criticism has become one of Theroux's
most valuable works, selling for more than $1,000 at antiquarian
book fairs.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the two men was precipitated by what Theroux
called an ``abusive note'' that he received from Naipaul's wife and
her disparagement of a eulogistic obituary that he wrote about
Naipaul's first wife. Sometime later, the two authors accidentally
met on a London street and Naipaul reportedly told him to ``take it
on the chin and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux moved on by writing his book. In one of the stranger
sections, he claims that, as a judge for the Booker Prize, he was
instrumental in the prestigious award not being given to Naipaul's
novel ``A Bend in the River,'' a shortlisted finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Naipaul's ``A House for Biswas'' and ``A Bend in the
River'' were both on the Modern Library list of the 100 greatest
English-language novels of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir Vidia's Shadow'' is Theroux's version of the truth. Others
who know Naipaul will necessarily have their own portraits. To take
one example of the differing perspectives, Theroux repeatedly
writes about what he considers to be Naipaul's cheapness: the two
of them would go to elegant restaurants in London, and the younger
writer would always be forced to pay the bill. If this so disturbed
Theroux, he should have suggested that they go to less expensive
places.
</P>
<P>
   In my experience, after many luncheons and dinners, Naipaul has
always readily shared the cost (unless the meeting was in the
nature of an interview, and then the expense was paid by my
employer). We have also been guests in each other's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Theroux criticizes Naipaul for accepting a knighthood after
years of scoffing at the idea of titles and suggesting that they
should be sold at the post office. Naipaul accepted the knighthood,
but, in contrast to actors and others, he does not use the title.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, The New Yorker published a selection of letters
from Naipaul to Theroux revealing the older writer's artistic
generosity. In one letter, Naipaul asked his friend to be discreet
in personal matters. He said: ``I opened myself to you at various
times without reserve, and sometimes with flippancy, which may not
always be understood.'' Theroux's book confirms that
misunderstanding.

<P>
   UNDATED - The punishment should fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Most reasonable people could probably agree with that homily.
But what if the transgression is not a crime?
</P>
<P>
   What if the transgression is, for example, an athlete ingesting
a substance that has been banned by the official organization
regulating the sport?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the answers to that question are easy, sometimes they
are not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an easy one: Two years ago, Irish swimming sensation
Michelle Smith gathered more than three gold medals at the Olympics
in Atlanta. She also garnered troubling suspicion that she used
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Though she denied the charges and passed every drug test she was
required to take, the suspicion was understandable: Her husband,
Erik de Bruin, a Dutch track star, was serving a four-year
suspension for illegal testosterone use; and few world-class
swimmers have such precipitous drops in time, as did Smith,
especially at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago the international swimming federation (FINA),
banned Smith for four years after it was determined she manipulated
an out-of-competition drug test by adulterating her urine sample
with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could have been banned for life, but a four-year
suspension will mean she misses the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the
2001 world championships in Fukuoka, Japan. Her career might be at
an end.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a not-so-easy one: Gary Hall Jr. of Phoenix is battling a
suspension over a positive marijuana test that prevented him from
entering competitions which are essentially preliminaries to the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Though FINA officials say Hall tested positive for marijuana at
the 1996 Olympics, the rule prohibiting the drug - though passed
before the Games - did not take effect until a month after the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers to these difficult questions over
``crime'' and punishment, for elite athletes, save one: Don't do
drugs. Period. &QL;

 &HT;    MAJORITY OF TEENAGERS SAY SCHOOL CRIME AND VIOLENCE IS THEIR TOP
CONCERN
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six out of 10 teenagers say their top concern is
crime and violence in school, according to a nationwide survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey paints a picture of high school students who are
concerned with scholastic achievement, get along well with their
parents and are optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of nearly 1,200 students found that four out of 10
said they make homework a priority, with one-fourth receiving
mostly A's on their last report card. Half of the students said
they try to take the most difficult and challenging courses they
can, although girls were more likely than boys _ by a ratio of
three-to-two _ to sign up for tougher courses.
</P>
<P>
   Some boys said they try to hide their intelligence from peers
for fear of being called a ``nerd'' or ``geek.'' Girls indicated
they feel pride about their intelligence and don't try to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Among other survey findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Girls feel optimistic about achieving their career goals and
anticipate earning the same or more than men.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most teenagers said cheating exists in schools and they
believe more than half of all students cheat at one point in their
high school careers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Four out of 10 cite a family member as their role model; six
out of 10 said parents spend the ``right amount'' of time with
their children and that they like and respect their parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nine out of 10 feel that mathematics is the most important
course to take for future success.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The top career choices, in order, were: teacher, computer
hardware/software developer, medical doctor, business person and an
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by The Horatio Alger Association of
Distinguished Americans, Inc., a non-profit educational
organization, who sent self-administered mail questionnaires to
high school students between the ages of 14 and 18 nationwide in
June.

AGENT SAYS FBI KNEW OF MOB INFORMANT'S WHEREABOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than two years after mobster-informant Angelo
``Sonny'' Mercurio skipped town to avoid a racketeering indictment,
the FBI learned that he was at a Fourth of July barbeque with
drug-dealing partners who were setting up a big marijuana delivery
from the West Coast, an agent testfied Tuesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Joseph Hobbs, said Mercurio was not arrested that day
in 1991, or three days later, when agents were told he'd be
cruising Boston Harbor in a rented boat. Rather, Hobbs said, the
prized informant who had tipped the FBI off to one of its greatest
investigative coups _ the 1989 bugging of a Mafia induction
ceremony _ remained free for three more years until he was arrested
in 1994 in Georgia with 150 pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Hobbs testified, he was puzzled by his fellow
agents' lack of aggression towards Mercurio, even though Hobbs
believed the information he gave them was taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs, who was assigned to a squad that investigated drug cases,
was not part of the organized crime team that had cultivated
Mercurio as an informant. He testified that he did not know
Mercurio was providing information to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs was the latest witness to testify before US District Judge
Mark L. Wolf, who is considering whether to drop extortion and
racketeering charges against the region's leading Irish and Italian
gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for New England Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme,
Winter Hill Gang leader Stephen Flemmi, Mafia soldier Robert DeLuca
and Winter Hill gangster John Martorano argue that the alleged
conspiracy between the rival gangs is invalid because Flemmi had
been promised immunity from prosecution as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Through his questions Tuesday, Salemme's lawyer, Anthony M.
Cardinale, suggested that another valuable FBI informant _ Mercurio
_ received favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr.,
Hobbs said Mercurio was not arrested at the barbeque because agents
did not want to jeopardize their drug investigation or the safety
of their cooperating witness. Hobbs insisted that the FBI did not
know that Mercurio was at the Independence Day barbeque at the home
of his brother, Michael Mercurio, until a cooperating witness who
attended the party reported to agents afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The agent also testified that Sonny Mercurio was never part of
the drug investigation he worked on with agents from the US Drug
Enforcement Administration and state drug agents from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But DEA agent Michael Cunniff, who followed Hobbs to the witness
stand, said Sonny Mercurio was a target of the investigation, which
allegedly involved large shipments of marijuana from Los Angeles to
Boston _ and that Hobbs knew that.
</P>
<P>
   Cunniff claimed that Mercurio became a target after he was
spotted at the barbeque in Woburn, but Cardinale showed him a
document which indicated that the DEA named him a target of the
investigation on July 3, the day before the Woburn gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs said he told organized crime supervisor Edward Quinn and
agent Rick Carter that Mercurio was at the barbeque and also told
them that Mercurio was expected to join a party aboard a boat
docked behind the Marriott Long Wharf in Boston the following
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs said Carter later told him that agents staked out the boat
but Mercurio never showed up. But there is no report in FBI files
of the failed surveillance, according to testimony.

ANNA J. HARRISON, WAS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AT MT. HOLYOKE; 85 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mo.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna J. Harrison, a former teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in
Missouri who became a professor at Mount Holyoke College and the
first woman president of the American Chemical Society, died of a
stroke Saturday in Holyoke (Mass.) Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrison taught chemistry at Mount Holyoke from 1945 to
1979. During her tenure, the college produced more women who went
on to earn doctorates in science than any other institution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, she was elected the first woman president of the
American Chemical Society. In 1984, she became the fourth woman to
serve a two-year term as president of the American Society for the
Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   She was born and raised on a farm near Benton City, Mo., and
attended a one-room rural school.
</P>
<P>
   When she graduated from the University of Missouri during the
height of the Great Depression, there were no jobs for young
chemists. She went back home to live and taught at the one-room
school she had attended. Her students ranged in age from 5 to 21.
``It was excellent training in independence,'' she said in a story
published in the Globe on Jan. 23, 1977. ``If you got yourself in
trouble, you damned well got yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years teaching at the school, she received a graduate
assistantship at the University of Missouri, where she earned a
doctorate in chemistry. But she was still unable to find a job in
the chemical industry. ``I got letters saying there weren't any
jobs and, even if there were, they wouldn't hire a woman,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She then got a job teaching at Sophie Newcomb College in New
Orleans before joining the faculty at Mount Holyoke in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrison was the author of ``Chemistry: A Search to
Understand.'' In the introduction to the textbook, she discussed
her philosophy of teaching. ``It's not so much a question of
capturing their attention,'' she wrote. ``It's a question of not
turning it off. Most people are naturally curious about science if
they're not turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a niece and nephew.

THE POP LIFE: HE'S BACK BACK, BABY: A NEW (IMPROVED?) ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Swiftly and with little fanfare, one of pop's
strangest comebacks has been under way in a small studio in a wood
cabin in the hills of Malibu. At the mixing board there, Ross
Robinson, a hard-rock producer known for his work with heavy,
rap-influenced acts like Korn and Limp Bizkit, played some new
music, which hasn't yet been heard publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The guitars ground out brittle, clipped metal riffs, the bass
lines were thick and dark, and electronic effects evoked the
atmosphere of a horror film. But the voice screaming on top
belonged not to a young punk but to Rob Van Winkle, 29, better
known as Vanilla Ice, the white rapper whose hit ``Ice Ice Baby''
topped the charts in 1990 but whose reputation quickly faded from
hit maker to has-been and paradigm of inauthenticity in a rap world
that trades on credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice playing music for slam-dancing, skateboard-wielding
punks seems as unlikely as Hanson turning to gangsta rap, but just
such an album, ``Hard to Swallow,'' will be coming out on
Republic/Universal Records on Oct. 20, complete with a hard-rock
remake of ``Ice Ice Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept saying to me, `It might hurt your name, it might
hurt your reputation,''' Robinson said of his decision to produce
Vanilla Ice. ``I said, `Then I'm doing it.' It's the most punk-rock
thing you could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting nearby in the studio, sporting a blond goatee and black
shorts exposing tattoo-covered legs, Vanilla Ice interrupted, ``No
one's going to expect the Iceman to come up with something like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   When a photographer approached, he insisted, ``I don't pose
anymore,'' then proceeded to strike poses as she snapped. It is a
scene emblematic of Vanilla Ice's identity confusion. He insists
that he has abandoned all attempts at creating an image and is only
interested in music. Yet in some ways, he is just playing another
character.
</P>
<P>
   The real Vanilla Ice is probably somewhere between the boastful
faux rapper of ``To the Extreme'' and the troubled faux punk of
``Hard to Swallow.'' On the outside, he seems like a fraternity
jock; on the inside, he is a self-described hypochondriac with
attention-deficit disorder, anxiety and intimacy problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd come to California again,'' he said,
referring to his fear of Suge Knight, the chief executive of the
Los Angeles gangsta rap label Death Row Records, currently in
prison for parole violation. Vanilla Ice and others have accused
the enormous Knight of dangling him off a hotel balcony as an
inducement to share royalties on ``Ice Ice Baby,'' which a relative
of Knight's helped write. (Knight got his royalties but has denied
that he used intimidation.)
</P>
<P>
   Since his last album, ``Mind Blowin','' in 1994, Vanilla Ice has
been at work reinventing his sound and his life. ``I've had a big
comedown since selling 15 million records,'' he said, referring to
worldwide sales estimates of his 1990 debut, ``To the Extreme.''
``I turned to drugs and released a record called `Mind Blowin''
because that's what I had been doing. Now I've got a boy and a
beautiful wife, and I've promised them I won't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Ice says he quit drugs, turned to religion and started a
grunge band in Miami called Picking Scabs three years ago and got
married last year. He has also spent recent years motocross racing
and competing professionally in jet-skiing. Earlier this year,
Monte Lipman, a Republic/Universal executive who worked with
Vanilla Ice on his first album, introduced him to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper compared his experience in the studio with Robinson,
known as an emotionally demanding producer, to psychotherapy.
Though many of Vanilla Ice's lyrics rail against the music
industry, releasing a ``fire'' that he says has been building
inside after being used by the business and then left to suffer
humiliation alone, he also deals with issues from his deeper past
on a song called ``Family.'' ``Where did I get this anger? Where
did I get this hate?'' sings the man who once claimed to be a
wholesome alternative to negative-theme rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes twisted people to make good music,'' he said. ``A lot
of people didn't know that I was an abused child. My mother was
almost killed by whoever it was that made her pregnant with me.
Ross has a way of getting things like that out of you. And now I
feel like I am free, because I put it on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he seems to be telling the truth these days, Vanilla Ice
has a reputation for fudging his background to achieve musical
credibility. His biography in the early 90s falsely claimed that he
was raised in the ghettos of Miami, where he went to high school
with Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew and was stabbed by gang
members. He was really raised in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vanilla Ice blames his former manager for creating this
apocryphal biography and circulating it without his approval. ``He
didn't want people knowing I was selling drugs to pay for studio
time,'' he said. Vanilla Ice blames other people for most of his
career missteps. ``I was like a puppet to these people,'' he said
of his former label, SBK. ``I never thought I'd play for a white
crowd or cross over. It just wasn't me. Then they asked me, `Would
you do a song like M.C. Hammer for a million bucks?' I said, `Hell,
yeah.' Anybody would do that. And it worked in everyone's eyes but
mine. I knew it was going to backlash on me.''
</P>
<P>
   So would he do it for money again? ``You could have a number,
and maybe I'd do something now,'' he said. ``But it's got to be a
lot higher than a million.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Vying for Catatonia
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes record labels can be shortsighted. Two years ago,
Warner Brothers Records began gearing up to release ``Lost Cat.''
The album was by Catatonia, a four-year-old Welsh band led by a
charismatic tomboy named Cerys Matthews. The label brought the band
to America for three concerts and pressed advance CD's for the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many new Welsh bands _ Super Furry Animals, Gorky's
Zygotic Mynci, 60 Ft. Dolls, Dub War _ Catatonia, with fuzzy,
melodic music topped by Ms. Matthews' winsome rasp, seemed most
likely to find an audience among college-radio fans. But the record
was never released. Executive changes and layoffs were occurring at
Warner Brothers, and Catatonia was caught in the middle, with the
label refusing to tell the band whether it was going to release the
album and remaining executives doubting the band's prospects for
success in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly frustrating,'' remembered the band's
co-manager, Martin Patton, ``especially when you know you have a
band this great. If someone said `no' or `go away,' I would have
been happier.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Warner Brothers declined to discuss the matter,
but no doubt the label felt silly this year, when Catatonia's
single, ``Mulder and Scully,'' hit No. 1 on the British pop charts,
followed by its second album, ``International Velvet,'' which also
went to No. 1. Suddenly, the band was in the midst of a bidding war
in the United States, and because Warner Brothers hadn't committed
earlier, Catatonia was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Sony Music to Warner Brothers subsidiary labels
wanted to sign the group. In the end, a small Warner Brothers label
won out: Vapor, run by Neil Young and his manager, Elliot Roberts.
The label plans to release only two albums this year; one is by the
lovesick singer Jonathan Richman, and the other is ``International
Velvet,'' which entered record stores two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he first heard the group's music on a recent trip
to England. When he called Warner Brothers in the United States to
find out about the status of the band, he said, no one was even
aware of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anybody see this band and doubt what a great singer
and performer Cerys Matthews is?'' Roberts asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``International Velvet'' is a beguiling pop album, alternately
wispy and muscular, like a more rock-and-roll Bjork or the Cocteau
Twins with venom. Lyrically quirky, the album includes songs about
``The X-Files'' (``Mulder and Scully''), the Mafia (``I Am the
Mob''), momentary lust (``Why I Can't Stand One Night Stands'') and
Wales (``International Velvet,'' sung half in Welsh).
</P>
<P>
   ``My accent is such a mixture _ North, South, West Wales,'' Ms.
Matthews said in an interview last year. ``It's a bit embarrassing,
my voice. We moved around a lot and my parents are from different
areas.

TV NOTES: NEWS FROM AROUND THE TV DIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is intended to be one of the first big television
projects of the new century, ABC is to present an eight-hour
mini-series based on the civil rights-era books by Taylor Branch to
be broadcast in January and February of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lyne, the executive vice president for movies at ABC, said
Tuesday that she had closed a deal with Columbia Tri-Star Pictures
to bring to network television ``Parting the Waters,'' which won a
1988 Pulitzer Prize for history, and ``Pillar of Fire,'' the second
volume in Branch's planned trilogy on the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia had been trying to develop ``Parting the Waters'' as a
movie for nearly a decade, Branch said Tuesday, and he had
``absolutely despaired'' of the project's ever coming to fruition
because of trouble condensing the enormous amount of material to
fit a film format.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have been out promoting the second book I detected there
was less resonance of the 1960s,'' Branch said in a telephone
interview. ``I saw this history as perishable.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the deal was shifted to ABC, he was ``extremely
gratified,'' even though, he said: ``There are things about a
feature film that can be special. The movie `Gandhi' was always our
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Verno, the executive vice president for movies at
Columbia, aware of the problems of adapting the book to film, took
the project to Ms. Lyne and ABC. ``Telling this as a feature meant
cutting it into small pieces,'' Ms. Lyne said. ``Now we can tell so
many of the dramatic stories that Taylor includes in his books.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, that will mean capturing many of the stories of
lesser-known figures in the civil rights movement that Branch
included, though Ms. Lyne acknowledged that ABC would cast actors
to play familiar historical figures. ``John F. Kennedy, Robert
Kennedy, J. Edgar Hoover, and of course, Martin Luther King, we're
looking for actors to play all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch said: ``I have ideas about the casting. I'm going to try
to put my shoulder to the wheel on that without getting in the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch and Harry Belafonte, who had been developing the material
for the movie, will work on the miniseries as producers, Branch
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy this is going to get on in January of 2000,''
Branch said. ``You can make an awfully good case that this is the
freedom story of the 20th century. It's great to be able to tell it
at the start of the new century. I think it's a peculiarly American
freedom story when you can say the oppressors and the victims are
both liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedic Musical Chairs
</P>
<P>
   Craig Kilborn might get to keep his ``Five Questions'' comedy
bit when he moves from Comedy Central to CBS, but he shouldn't
expect to get on the air anytime soon, certainly not before Jon
Stewart slides into the chair Kilborn is vacating as star of ``The
Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the messages that Comedy Central executives sent to
CBS and Kilborn at a news conference Tuesday to introduce Stewart,
the comedian and onetime syndicated talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   The changeover will probably come in January, said Doug Herzog,
the president of Comedy Central. As for when Kilborn will be
allowed out of his contract _ which runs until August 1999 _ to
join CBS, Herzog said, ``We're working that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central made no secret of its displeasure with CBS for
hiring Kilborn away to succeed Tom Snyder as host of ``The Late
Late Show,'' and initially signaled its intention to tie the star
up as long as possible. On Tuesday, Herzog sounded a little more
accommodating. ``We're talking with CBS about it,'' he said. ``One
thing we want to be sure of is that Jon gets on the air for us
first.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what material Kilborn might be bringing to CBS, Herzog
used the dreaded term ``intellectual property,'' a legal reference
that harked back to the days when David Letterman left NBC and that
network claimed virtually everything he had done as its
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming host, Conan O'Brien, completely disavowed any
interest in repeating Letterman's comedy bits, and Stewart did the
same Tuesday regarding Kilborn's routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a show you want to establish your own
identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Smithberg, the executive producer of ``The Daily
Show,'' said the ``Five Questions'' bit, in which Kilborn asks a
guest five rather bizarrely related questions, sprang from
something Kilborn told her he often does on dates. Ms. Smithberg
suggested incorporating the idea into the show, which, she said,
gave them both a hand in its creation as intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who signed a four-year contract to take over ``The
Daily Show,'' acknowledged a paradox in his replacing Kilborn, who
is going to CBS to take the job Stewart had been thought to be in
line for: the host of the show following Letterman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's musical chairs,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog treated Stewart's arrival as a coup, and some reports
have the host earning $1.5 million to $2 million a year, among the
highest salaries ever for a cable star. As for the real reason he
chose to sign up for a show on cable, Stewart said, ``I value my
anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the Titanic
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Titanic, be they history buffs or romantics swayed
by the Oscar-winning movie, will have a rare chance on Sunday to
follow along live as explorers, both human and robotic, roam the
ruins of the sunken ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel will transmit the images as a manned
submersible unit with two small robotic-operated vehicles attached
ventures into unexplored areas, including the captain's quarters,
said Bob Reid, the executive producer of the two-hour program (8
p.m., Eastern time).
</P>
<P>
   And while ``live via satellite'' is a familiar concept, the idea
of images coming live via satellite from two and a half miles below
the ocean's surface is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a signal via a cable connected to the robotic vehicles
``is relatively easy,'' Reid said. ``What's difficult and has never
been done before is getting a live signal from the manned
submersible to the ship and to the satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be dangerous to connect a cable, or any tether, to such a
unit because the ocean's currents could entangle it in the wreck,
he said. So a robotic vehicle will be stationed on the ocean's
floor and the three-man sub will ``plug in'' to it ``as a sort of a
way station,'' he said. The men may have to disconnect if their
safety is jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   A special satellite is required, too. ``It has to be
gyrostabilized so it can rock and roll with the ship and stay in a
constant position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific expedition is being conducted by RMS Titanic
Inc., legal guardian of the wreckage site, with dozens of
scientists and historians aboard four companion ships.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to examine why ``the bow is relatively intact but the
stern is a mangled mess,'' Reid said, and hope to find and bring to
the surface the ship's Marconi radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel and NBC's ``Dateline'' are collaborating
on the production.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's edition of ``Dateline'' will include a report
on RMS Titanic's efforts to raise a chunk of the ship's hull out of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Change for Gumbel
</P>
<P>
   CBS News will shut down production of ``Public Eye with Bryant
Gumbel'' at the end of this month, a decision that may mean the end
of that news magazine but not the end of efforts to put Gumbel at
the center of a prime-time news magazine on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News executives said that Andrew Heyward, the president of
CBS News, told the show's staff Tuesday afternoon that ``Public
Eye,'' which was dropped from the CBS fall schedule, would not
continue to produce stories in anticipation of returning as a
midseason replacement for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel said this week that he hoped a recent surge in ratings
might cause CBS executives to rethink the decision to keep it off
the fall schedule. At the least, he said, he expected the show to
return by January.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision makes that less likely, though it is still
possible that CBS will revive the show. It is more likely, CBS News
executives said, that CBS will create a different news magazine for
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   As news magazines often do, ``Public Eye'' has shown signs of
ratings life in summer, finishing among the top 20 shows for the
first time last week. And there are high hopes for Wednesday
night's edition, a special about Tom Whittaker, a disabled climber,
and his assault on Mt. Everest. (Gumbel interviewed him in a hotel
in Nepal, 16,000 feet up.)
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel said he has had ``excellent conversations'' with Leslie
Moonves, the president of CBS Television, about his future at the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves has committed to another CBS news magazine for January,
``60 Minutes II.'' That led to widely circulated suggestions that
Gumbel would drop his show to join that one.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed those suggestions. ``I'm preoccupied with this
show,'' he said. He and Moonves have ``talked a little bit'' about
``60 Minutes II,'' he said, but added, ``I'm committed to making my
own show work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for why it didn't work this past season, Gumbel said: ``We
made some mistakes. I think what I've really learned is these
things do take some time. Would I prefer to be on the fall
schedule? Of course I would. But I recognize the realities of the
thing.''

   BILL'S WORLD
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is on the road for part of this week. No, it's
mostly a political trip, not Starr-approved work-release.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress want Ken Starr to file an impeachment
report so the matter can be settled quickly. Well, plus they want
to read about Monica's dress.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct,'' Mr. Clinton said this week. No, he was talking about
fighting terrorism, not Starrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if Starr submits an impeachment
report to Congress it will get much higher readership if it
includes pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony will be via closed-circuit
TV. That's probably how he should spend any future time with White
House interns.
</P>
<P>
   A New York publisher says Monica Lewinsky treated her stained
dress like a trophy. Apparently journalists aren't the only ones
who value leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The president calls acts of terrorism inhuman.'' Don't we all
wish.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released government statistics show July was the hottest
month on record. Bet Mr. Clinton would cast his vote for this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we act, says Al Gore, we can expect even more extreme
weather _
</P>
<P>
   more heat waves, more flooding, more powerful storms and more
drought.'' Plus, of course, the usual run of bad movies about all
that.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a scientist to know it's been hot this
summer,' Gore says. In fact, you can be way below a scientist. Like
vice president.

secret to his long life.
</P>
<P>
   `I never drank alcohol, I never smoked tobacco and I have been
married to the same woman for fifty years.` `Wow, that's really
remarkable!' said the reporter. `And how old are you?' he asked the
second man.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm 93,' said the man. The second man was asked the same
question on his secret to long life. `I drank on occasion, I
smoked, but not often and I dated some.' `And how old are you?'
asked the reporter. `I'm 91,' said the old man.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the reporter approached the third old man and asked his
secret to a long life. `I dated every woman that would go out with
me, I drank until I passed out and I smoked three packs of
cigarettes a day.' `Wow!' said the reporter. `And how old are
you?'` `29,' replied the man.

 &HT;    Some eyes are opened as teen health risk conference gets
underway
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Would you know a condom if you saw one?
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Rodriguez was surprised when one woman didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their faces were turning red when I was showing them condoms.
One woman had never seen a condom,'' said Rodriquez, a recent
graduate of Central High School in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a class of women, some of them in their 40s, she
was teaching about the basic of HIV/AIDS prevention. When she asked
the group for an example of how HIV can be transmitted, she kept
getting the same answer: ``Saliva.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is promoting
education as a means to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission, looking at
that and other teen health risks at a national conference here this
week. HIV/AIDS has become more common in young populations; 50
percent of people who contract HIV are teens and young adults. The
opening speech of the conference Tuesday stressed what CDC experts
think is a effective way to teach teens: Let the teens do it.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriquez is a lead peer educator of the Family Health Council
of Pennsylvania. She is concerned that some adults have ``no idea
how you get HIV,'' because they won't be able to teach their kids
the facts about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting classes should be given before they become
parents,'' said Rodriquez. She said teens want to get involved with
HIV/AIDS education, but few states have peer health education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want us to get youth involved, why don't you start
here. I don't see any youth here,'' said 25 year old Gary Artman to
the hundreds of health experts attending the opening panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to talk about us. But while it may be more
difficult, it is more advantageous to talk to us,'' he said. In
Pennsylvania, Artman participates in roundtable discussions
intended to educate youth about dangerous sexual activity. He is
amazed how often he runs into teens who think they don't need
condoms or that they are ``above the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Artman, who is gay, had no HIV/AIDS sexual education in high
school, only an insensitive gym teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it would come up, he would make a gay joke about
it,'' he said. Students were no better informed. During basketball
games in gym class, one student complained that Gary was going to
sweat on him and give him AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Pasquarelli and Scott Nelson of Brookwood High School in
Gwinnett County also grew up with little formal HIV/AIDS education.
They found a way to learn, and then to teach. With AIDGwinnett, a
community-based peer education program, the seniors run role
playing demonstrations at schools, churches and youth detention
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that having kids teach sex education is better than
learning from a teacher who turns red when reading from a sex
education textbook. ``I can talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Pasquarelli don't get paid a cent for their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an idea out there saying a lot of youth are slackers
and don't care about anything. We are living proof that is not
true,'' said Artman.

 &HT;    Author: `Never be satisfied with nothin' '
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one of nine black children in rural Louisiana in the 1960s,
Ernest Hill grew up in a tiny house on a dirt road with no running
water. There was no indoor plumbing but there were books. Lots of
books. And a mother and father who had a vision that went far
beyond the impoverished environment.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the nine children grew up to graduate from college _
three earned degrees from Yale(Conn.) _ and all succeeded in their
chosen fields. (Hill's older brother, Kenny, not only graduated
from Yale, but he also went on to win three Super Bowl rings with
the Oakland Raiders and New York Giants.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing thing,'' says Hill, 37, who recently
published his second novel, ``A Life for a Life,'' after earning a
bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley and
a master's degree from Cornell(N.Y.). ``They worked with us from a
very early age. Our mom would read to us and our dad always taught
us to do our best. He told us, `A man is a man from his shoulders
up.' They set these standards that were very, very high and they
shielded us from things we shouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in life, while his brothers and sisters fell in line and
made A's, Ernest Hill resisted. He read only what was necessary and
slid through high school on his athletic ability. He won a football
scholarship to Northeast Louisiana University, and then transferred
to Berkeley after suffering a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first week there, a group of students had congregated
outside and were having a discussion about the South,'' Hill
recalls. ``I was soon pulled into it and a girl from Norway asked
me what I thought about Richard Wright. I said, `Who?' and she
couldn't believe I hadn't read `Native Son.' The next day she
brought me a copy and I read the book out of spite. It was the
first book I truly enjoyed. I knew then that I wanted to write like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he postponed writing until he finished his master's
degree at Cornell. When a student from Lebanon asked him what he
was going to do next, Hill replied that he was going to UCLA to
work on his doctorate. After that, he said, he would write novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me if I knew any Ph.D.'s who had written a novel,''
Hill says, ``and I didn't. That night I started writing `Satisfied
With Nothin'.' That was my first attempt at creative writing. I had
taken no courses. It was all from my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The title for the novel came from a conversation Hill had with
his father when he was in the fourth grade. As they were driving
past a juke joint, Hill's father pointed to a group of men sitting
out front playing dominoes and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Tell me what you see.' I said I saw men having a
good time. He said, `What you see is something I don't ever want
you to be. Never be satisfied with nothin'. You have to believe you
can achieve anything you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   The novel painted a grim picture of a young black Louisiana man
who rises to fame as a star football player. His attempts to
succeed in a racist world, however, are thwarted and he ends up
being ``satisfied with nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Life for a Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) has a happier
ending. The novel is a powerful tale of a young African-American
man who is saved from violence and poverty by a humble hero. When
15-year-old D'Ray Reid unintentionally kills a college bound honor
student during a convenience store robbery, it appears that he is
fated to join his daddy, who is serving a life sentence in prison.
Instead of condemning Reid, Henry Earl, the victim's father, visits
the youth in prison and prods him to rehabilitate himself.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here, as in his own life, Hill says, is that a proper
role model can work miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Earl, who enters Reid's life, teaches him how to live
his life the right way. We had a father who knew how to succeed.
For me, that was the key.''
</P>
<P>
   But how did a family from the poorish parish with the highest
illiteracy rate in the state succeed when others failed, ended up
on drugs or in the penitentiary? Hill's father says there was no
secret to the family's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked day and night to support them and give them a
chance,'' says Charley Hill, 74, who taught high school, coached
and worked as a cannery supervisor. ``I never kept them out of
school to work. I allowed their mother to stay home with them. And
I talked with them a lot. I never drank or swore and I told them
quotations and tried to inspire them, things like `A job worth
doing is worth doing right,' and `Never be satisfied with
nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Hills also made sure their children were kept away from
places where they might get in trouble. Other children were
encouraged to come to the Hills' house to play so the mother,
Katie, 67, a former teacher, could supervise them.
</P>
<P>
   Education was always a priority, says Ernest Hill, now a writer
in residence at Southern University in Baton Rouge. There were
encyclopedias and other books, but there was no dining table. ``We
would eat out of aluminum pans, like a buffet. We'd sit on the
floor or on the bed and eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's father never made more than $10,000 a year in his life,
but he still managed to educate nine children and eventually built
a five-bedroom house with three bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set unbelievably high standards for us,'' Hill says. ``I
remember when he sent my oldest brother off to Yale, the whole
community said he was smart, but he was not prepared to leave Oak
Grove, La., and compete with the smartest students in the country.
A white lady came by and told my father this. He listened politely
and called my brother into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's going to be tough. Do your best. If things
don't work out, pack your bags, get on the plane, and when you come
to Monroe to deplane, pause at the top of the steps and wave your
transcript. If you're going to get an F, get the best one.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between reality and a pipe dream is to have
someone who can convince you it's true. And, just like Mr. Henry in
my novel, that's what my father did.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Old pals recall Fort Benning, the Vineyard
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is a friend of legend, my daughter's old pal Elsie Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   They were young Army wives at Fort Benning(Ga.) when their
husbands, newly graduated from Georgia Tech, were in the Army
engineers corps. They made friends immediately, an Atlanta girl and
a brisk, efficient young New Englander, who grew up on a farm on
Martha's Vineyard. They had their first babies at roughly the same
time, saw one another infrequently through the post-Army years, but
have stayed in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie happened to be in Atlanta when my daughter arrived from
Omaha for her son's wedding, and we had a gala time reminiscing. I
hadn't much to contribute except that my husband and I spent a fine
week on what Elsie called ``the Vineyard'' in her grandmother's
cottage, enjoyed visiting her father's farm, her own weekend
cottage set in the middle of 10 family acres, and all the points of
interest around that island, including a visit to Edgartown.
</P>
<P>
   But after they had caught up on family news, and reports on the
three children each of them has, the old friends started recalling
the long ago days at Fort Benning and later at the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie had strong ideas about being a thrifty wife and feeding
her family fresh home-grown vegetables. So she planted a garden and
gave my daughter canning lessons. The story my daughter is fondest
of is the meticulous, loving care Elsie took in planting and
harvesting spinach to feed her firstborn, a hefty boy called Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam was too good to eat canned baby food,'' my daughter said.
``He had to have the freshest spinach from the garden, picked at
just the right moment when it was dew-cooled in the early morning.
It was carefully washed and tenderly cooked, only the best for Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' she took a deep breath, ``after she had two more
babies, we were visiting with our children on the Vineyard, and
Elsie would take a bag of sugar doughnuts to the window and call,
`Boys! Breakfast!' and tossed it out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsie made a face. It was as my new Jewish friend would say,
``Enough, already!''
</P>
<P>
   Elsie, a nurse, once became concerned that her grandmother and
two ancient great aunts weren't getting the care they needed at a
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   She brought them home to the Vineyard and spent the summer there
with them, treating them more like girl campers than nursing home
patients. I always liked the stories of how she oiled their old
bodies and gave them sponge baths, how she took them shopping for a
new van and was guided by their preference, how she bought them
pretty shifts to wear in the afternoon and invited their friends
into tea.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of their old friends had died, Elsie was hard-pressed
to find enough guests for some afternoon teas. She asked the
postman and the grocer and sundry acquaintances from village
stores. It was all very merry, and the old ladies flourished.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of Elsie's wisdom, which I have tried to incorporate
into life on our island, is that boy young 'uns don't need clothes
at the beach. A pair of cutoff jeans will do for all occasions, she
decreed. Sleep in them, swim in them, don't bother about laundry,
they'll dry clean on young bodies after an ocean bath.
</P>
<P>
   Having Elsie in town for a little while was a bonanza for her
old Fort Benning neighbor, and for me.

 &HT;    Say Gesundheit! to start of ragweed season
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Snot a joke: The new season of sneezin' is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike spring pollen, which warns you with a thick powdering of
yellow on the car, the dog and anything else outside for more than
five minutes, fall's allergy season sneaks up without so much as a
dusty windshield.
</P>
<P>
   So this is your warning: The ragweed is coming! The ragweed is
coming!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you can predict,'' said Dr. Kathleen
Sheerin of the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Ragweed, a common and tenacious plant that likes moist areas
such as riverbanks, gets its cue to pollinate when the days shorten
and the nights lengthen to a certain point, sometime after Aug. 15,
Sheerin said. The clinic probably will resume its daily pollen
count next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And forewarned is forearmed, as they say, especially since
certain allergy medicines, such as the prescription drug Vancenase
and the over-the-counter nasal spray Nasalcrom, must be taken for
at least a week before they start to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to be on your medicine before the season starts,''
Sheerin said. ``Get your prescriptions in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also recommend the usual: keep the windows shut, change
the furnace filter, bathe the pets. Ragweed usually pollinates in
the morning, so if you're allergic, avoid that time of day for
outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few good things about the fall pollen season is that
it is shorter and less intense than the spring pollen season. In
colder climates, the season ends with the first frost, but here in
the South, the pollen just dissipates after about a month.
</P>
<P>
   But mold, another major allergen, also is expected to start
tickling noses in late summer or early fall. So keep the Kleenex
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic's pollen line for daily
pollen counts is 770-662-6100, or you can view the clinic's
Internet site at http://www.atlallergy.com.

 &HT;    Three groups to rock at annual Jekyll Island concert
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- The Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and their
super-wealthy cronies used to vacation at Jekyll Island, but now
the state of Georgia owns it, and anyone can enjoy a rich
experience on this Golden Isle.
</P>
<P>
   It gets even better on Aug. 22 at one of the Southeast's biggest
beach parties. Jekyll's 15th annual Beach Music Festival will
feature three golden oldies rock 'n' roll groups: Paul Revere and
the Raiders, the Tams and the Swingin' Medallions.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 people are expected to gather at noon for the
five-hour frolic at the Beach Deck, a large stage erected in the
sand just south of the causeway road (Ga. 520) from Brunswick.
Tickets are $7 in advance or $10 day of show; call the Jekyll
Island Welcome Center, 1-800-841-6586.
</P>
<P>
   Festival gates will be located just north and south of the
Jekyll Island Convention Center. No food, beverages, coolers or
pets allowed inside _ but food, soda and beer will be sold. And
don't forget the suntan lotion.
</P>
<P>
   Singer-keyboardist Revere and the Raiders, known for hits
including ``Indian Reservation,'' have sold 50 million albums and
been awarded eight gold records. The Tams are best known for their
1968 gold record, ``Be Young, Be Foolish, Be Happy.'' The Swingin'
Medallions are still helping people party to hits such as ``Double
Shot of My Baby's Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the festival will be the Coastline Band from Charlotte,
named ``1996 Group of the Year'' by the Carolina Beach Music
Industry.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Beach Music Festival Golf Tournament precedes the
seaside bash at 10:30 a.m. Aug. 21 at Jekyll's Pine Lakes Golf
Course. Entry is $70, including greens fees, cart, snacks, prizes
and two festival tickets. Registration deadline is Friday, call
912-635-2368.
</P>
<P>
   -- Also playing: A must-see attraction is the Jekyll Island Club
Historic District, a Victorian complex with its handsome turreted
hotel and ``cottages'' (actually mansions) where the wealthy
vacationed from the 1880s to World War II. Tram tours depart on the
hour from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., adults $10, students $6, children
under 6 free.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lodging and meals: Alas, the charming Jekyll Island Club
Hotel is booked solid for the weekend, but you can enjoy Sunday
brunch in the Grand Dining Room, $16. Among the island's 1,500
hotel rooms, best bets are the Jekyll Inn, Comfort Inn Island
Suites and the Beachview Club, with doubles from $99 to $159.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: By boat, Jekyll is only 2 miles south of St.
Simons Island (vs. 20 miles by road and causeway). So if you're
staying on the larger isle, you can avoid traffic by taking the new
Water Taxi Service, a 35-minute ride from the Golden Isles Marina
on St. Simons to the Jekyll Wharf Marina; $12.50 round trip, call
912-638-5678. The 330-mile drive south from Georgia's capital city,
Atlanta, to Jekyll is fastest via I-75 to Macon, I-16 to Savannah,
I-95 to Brunswick, then a quick dogleg on U.S. 17 and Ga. 520 to
Jekyll.

</P>
<P>
   -- About the hall: Impetus for the Alabama Music Hall of Fame,
which opened in July 1990, came from the Muscle Shoals Music
Association, an organization of recording studio owners, producers,
musicians, songwriters and other music professionals. The
12,500-square-foot hall houses hundreds of exhibits showcasing
Alabama's rich musical heritage, exemplified by such people as W.C.
Handy, Dinah Washington, Jimmie Rodgers, Sam Phillips, Tammy
Wynette and the Temptations. An exhibit on the Muscle Shoals
recording industry _ which claims to be ``the hit-recording capital
of the world'' _ offers background on the area's contribution to
music.
</P>
<P>
   -- A peek inside: Visitors can climb aboard the group Alabama's

Cole sitting at his piano. Elvis Presley's recording contract with
Sun Studios is displayed. And among the costumes are outfits worn

15-foot-tall jukebox and a 17-foot guitar.

   BILL'S WORLD
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is on the road for part of this week. No, it's
mostly a political trip, not Starr-approved work-release.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress want Ken Starr to file an impeachment
report so the matter can be settled quickly. Well, plus they want
to read about Monica's dress.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct,'' Mr. Clinton said this week. No, he was talking about
fighting terrorism, not Starrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if Starr submits an impeachment
report to Congress it will get much higher readership if it
includes pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony will be via closed-circuit
TV. That's probably how he should spend any future time with White
House interns.
</P>
<P>
   A New York publisher says Monica Lewinsky treated her stained
dress like a trophy. Apparently journalists aren't the only ones
who value leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The president calls acts of terrorism inhuman.'' Don't we all
wish.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released government statistics show July was the hottest
month on record. Bet Mr. Clinton would cast his vote for this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we act, says Al Gore, we can expect even more extreme
weather _
</P>
<P>
   more heat waves, more flooding, more powerful storms and more
drought.'' Plus, of course, the usual run of bad movies about all
that.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a scientist to know it's been hot this
summer,' Gore says. In fact, you can be way below a scientist. Like
vice president.

remarkable!' said the reporter. `And how old are you?' he asked the

<P>
   `I'm 93,' said the man. The second man was asked the same

The Arizona Republic plans to move the following stories for use by
clients of the NYTimes News service for Wednesday, Aug. 12. If you
have any questions, please call the Republic News Desk at (602)
444-8286. 
 
BULLETS-MEXICO (Undated) - Mexican diplomatic officials say that
Scottsdale, Ariz., businessman Jim Brunen really had some lousy
luck when it came to assignment of a Mexican judge after he crossed
the border with ammo in his vehicle. Turns out that the judge
earlier had been roundly chastized by a higher court for quickly
releasing another U.S. citizen with ammo. Meanwhile, an off-duty
Nogales, Ariz., police officer was released within three days last
month after customs people found 2 boxes of ammo in his car. He had
a different judge. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A``
category. 
 
BILBY-OBIT (Phoenix) - U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby has died
of a heart attack. We take a look at him and his record. By JERRY
KAMMER and MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. 
 
JAZZDANCE (Phoenix) - A look at the weekend's events at the 1998
International Jazz Dance Conference in downtown Phoenix: the
performances, the seminars, the people. By KENNETH LAFAVE. Story
will move in the ``E'` category. 
 
SAMESEX (Undated) - The United Methodist Church's judicial council
ruling on blessing same-sex union is released Tuesday. DEVELOPING.
By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the ``A`` category. 
 
ALLIED WASTE (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Allied Waste buys yet another
company, this one a biggie. The $1 billion-plus deal makes Allied
Waste the third-largest garbage company in the country and cements
its position as one of the largest public companies in Arizona. By
DAWN GILBERTSON. Story will move in the ``F`` category. 
 
WOLF KILLED (Undated) - Another endangered Mexican gray wolf, one
of 11 released into the wild in eastern Arizona this spring, is
dead after an apparent battle with a mountain lion over food.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists and conservationists are lamenting the death of the
female wolf, which earlier this year gave birth to the first
Mexican gray wolf born in the American wilderness in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only seven wolves, including the pup, are roaming free in
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest under the watch of U.S. Fish
and Wildlife agents who hope to repopulate the species. By GRACIELA
SEVILLA and STEVE YOZWIAK. Story moved in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAWDOG (Undated) - She's a barrister for the birds, a legal eagle
for greyhounds. And she'd go to the wall for a lowly lab rat if it
was being maimed or mutilated through product testing. Stephanie
Nichols-Young doesn't know why she feels so strongly about
defending and protecting the rights of animals, animals who are
more likely to cough up fur balls than her hourly fee. ``I just
do,'' said the Phoenix attorney who refused to eat meat as a child
after seeing a slaughtered calf hanging in a barn. Nichols-Young is
not alone in her interest, however. ``It's growing because we have
at least a dozen law schools now teaching classes on animal law,''
she said. PHOTO. By LINDA HELSER. Story moved in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOYE-COLUMN (Undated) - What if God used a computer to create the
universe? I've been thinking about that since my way-cool
neighbors, Rick and Jacquie, brought over a humorous posting they
found online. I don't know who wrote it, but it's all about how God
tries to create the universe with a PC. Frustrated by problems at
the DOS prompt, including the dreaded ``Abort-Retry-Fail'' error
message, God finally goes out and buys a Macintosh. Funny. It would
explain a lot, though. By DAVID HOYE. Story moved in the ``F''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ Offended by nudity on the cover of
``Rolling Stone''? The usual suspects are, but I'm not. By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS-NEW (Undated) _ Capsule reviews of new and notable books. By
ANNE STEPHENSON. Story moved in the ``E'' category.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BOOK-AUTHOR (Undated) _ ``The Pied Piper is one of history's first
recorded serial killers,'' Ridley Pearson says with ominous
pleasure. The story inspired his new suspense thriller, ``The Pied
Piper'' (Hyperion, $23.95), which involves babies, kidnappers and
an illegal adoption scheme. By ANNE STEPHENSON. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOK-PARKCITY (Undated) _ Bad news about Ann Beattie. Uncle. That's
all I have to say about ``Park City,'' a collection of 36 of Ann
Beattie's stories, including eight new ones. I can't finish it. I
just can't. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDITORIAL: Drugs and athletes: Just say no. Story moved in the
``K'' category. &QL;

   ATLANTA -- Would you know a condom if you saw one?
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Rodriguez was surprised when one woman didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their faces were turning red when I was showing them condoms.
One woman had never seen a condom,'' said Rodriquez, a recent
graduate of Central High School in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a class of women, some of them in their 40s, she
was teaching about the basic of HIV/AIDS prevention. When she asked
the group for an example of how HIV can be transmitted, she kept
getting the same answer: ``Saliva.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is promoting
education as a means to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission, looking at
that and other teen health risks at a national conference here this
week. HIV/AIDS has become more common in young populations; 50
percent of people who contract HIV are teens and young adults. The
opening speech of the conference Tuesday stressed what CDC experts
think is a effective way to teach teens: Let the teens do it.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriquez is a lead peer educator of the Family Health Council
of Pennsylvania. She is concerned that some adults have ``no idea
how you get HIV,'' because they won't be able to teach their kids
the facts about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting classes should be given before they become
parents,'' said Rodriquez. She said teens want to get involved with
HIV/AIDS education, but few states have peer health education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want us to get youth involved, why don't you start
here. I don't see any youth here,'' said 25 year old Gary Artman to
the hundreds of health experts attending the opening panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to talk about us. But while it may be more
difficult, it is more advantageous to talk to us,'' he said. In
Pennsylvania, Artman participates in roundtable discussions
intended to educate youth about dangerous sexual activity. He is
amazed how often he runs into teens who think they don't need
condoms or that they are ``above the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Artman, who is gay, had no HIV/AIDS sexual education in high
school, only an insensitive gym teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it would come up, he would make a gay joke about
it,'' he said. Students were no better informed. During basketball
games in gym class, one student complained that Gary was going to
sweat on him and give him AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Pasquarelli and Scott Nelson of Brookwood High School in
Gwinnett County also grew up with little formal HIV/AIDS education.
They found a way to learn, and then to teach. With AIDGwinnett, a
community-based peer education program, the seniors run role
playing demonstrations at schools, churches and youth detention
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that having kids teach sex education is better than
learning from a teacher who turns red when reading from a sex
education textbook. ``I can talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Pasquarelli don't get paid a cent for their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an idea out there saying a lot of youth are slackers
and don't care about anything. We are living proof that is not
true,'' said Artman.

 &HT;    Study reveals that chlamydia affects one in three sexually
active teen girls
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chlamydia, already considered a severe, silent sexually
transmitted disease among adult women, is striking earlier and more
frequently, a new study of teenage girls shows.
</P>
<P>
   Almost one in three sexually active adolescent girls between
ages 12 and 19 in the Baltimore area tested positive for the
infection during a 33-month study conducted by John Hopkins
University. Findings, released today in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, showed 14-year-old girls had the highest
proportion of infection, 27.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study is significant because chlamydia is considered the
Stealth bomber of sexually-transmitted infections, the one that
most often leads to infertility, chronic pain, and in some cases,
death during pregnancy. Chlamydia, a bacterial infection spread
through sexual contact, can easily be treated with antibiotics. But
women often don't have symptoms and the infection goes undiagnosed
until complications arise.
</P>
<P>
   Previous estimates had put the overall adolescent chlamydia rate
at one in 10 teens, but higher in urban areas and among poorer
women.
</P>
<P>
   Because some 75 percent of infected women are unaware they have
chlamydia, health experts have stressed the need to screen
annually. Now, the John Hopkins study recommends sexually-active
teenagers be screened every six months.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the time span between the initial negative test
and the first positive test was on average, seven months, among the
3,202 girls tested. Also, individual high-risk behaviors, such as
multiple sex partners and inconsistent condom use, failed at
predicting who would get the infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlamydia control programs have succeeded by screening all
sexually active adolescent females, regardless of sexual practices
or demographics,'' study author Dr. Gale R. Burstein concludes.
``Public health researchers should concentrate future efforts on
prevention and partner notification.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which has historically had one of the worst STD rates
in the nation, just started a program to detect chlamydia sooner.
Under legislation that took effect July 1, health insurance plans
must pay for annual screening of all women age 29 and under. The
legislation does not apply to large companies that self insure.

 &HT;    The facts about chlamydia
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Kathleen E. Toomey, director of the Georgia Division of
Public Health, and Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the National
Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention, a branch of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, talk about chlamydia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is chlamydia?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a sexually-transmitted disease caused by the bacterium
chlamydia trachomatis. It can be spread by an infected man or
woman, whether or not that person has any noticeable symptoms. It
must be spread through direct person-to-person sexual contact. Two
uninfected people with no other sex partners besides each other
cannot contract chlamydia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are its symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oftentimes, none. Up to 80 percent of women and 50 percent of
men have no symptoms, so they do not seek health care and
unknowingly spread it. Men sometimes experience swelling of the
testicles, or discharge from the penis. Women could have discharge
or burning upon urination.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How widespread is the infection nationally?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is the most frequently reported infectious disease in the
United States. There are an estimated 4 million new cases of it
every year, split evenly among men and women. Most of the cases
involving women occur in the under-24 age group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Georgia ranks eighth worst in number of reported cases. An
estimated 100,000 Georgia women are infected with chlamydia every
year, with the highest prevalence rate among 15 to 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are its consequences?
</P>
<P>
   A: Left untreated, chlamydia infections in women lead to
long-term and potentially life-threatening consequences such as
infertility, constant pain, tubal pregnancy and HIV exposure. Some
40 percent of women will develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),
which can be debilitating in pain and require repeated
hospitalization or repeated outpatient visits. Just one PID episode
of pelvic infection can leave a woman infertile because of
fallopian tube scarring. Of those contacting PID from chlamydia, 20
percent will become infertile. Another 9 percent will suffer a
tubal pregnancy, which is the leading cause of first-trimester
pregnancy-related deaths among American women. And 18 percent of
the women will suffer constant pelvic pain, which can lead some to
undergo hysterectomies. In addition, women infected with chlamydia
have a 3-to-5 fold increased risk of acquiring HIV, if exposed to
the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the consequences for men?
</P>
<P>
   A: Men exposed to chlamydia may develop urethritis _ pain while
urinating. If the infection reaches the testicles, it can produce
scar tissue that blocks sperm ducts, causing sterility.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If pregnant women are infected with chlamydia, can it affect
the fetus?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Between 35 percent to 50 percent of infants born to
infected mothers develop a relatively minor eye inflammation, while
25 percent may develop pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the estimated costs of chlamydia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nationally, the annual cost of the infection and its
complications is more than $2.4 billion. In Georgia, it costs $51
million. Every dollar spent on screening and treatment of this
disease saves about $12 in complications.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds so widespread , so dire and so costly. What can be
done?
</P>
<P>
   A: The consequences of chlamydia are completely preventable. The
key lies in widespread screening, early detection and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Just the past few years have seen improvements in easier and
less-expensive testing, and in quick-acting antibiotics. Growing
culture for 48 hours is no longer required. Instead, a swab taken
from a woman's cervix is run through a test that looks for the DNA
fragments of the bacterium. Urine tests are in the final stages of
research. Treatment no longer requires a one-week dose of
antibiotics; one single dose is now available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What progress has been made in curtailing chlamydia?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the past decade, many more clinics and doctors' offices
are screening for chlamydia. Significant decline in infection rates
have been made in regions of the country that have implemented
federally funded screening (a 65 percent decrease in the Northwest
from 1988 to 1995 was noted). And a randomized trial at a health
maintenance organization found a 56 percent decrease in pelvic
infections in the group of women screened for chlamydia.

 &HT;    British animated series is just a filler before the new season
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is retching. Is that what NBC thought would get the ``South
Park'' crowd?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say what NBC was thinking when it picked up ``Stressed
Eric,'' a six-episode animated series imported from England (9:30
EDT tonight on NBC ). Was it even thinking? It sure wasn't thinking
about attracting viewers. ``Stressed Eric'' has the short-timer
look of programming filler _ a cheap, mildly amusing stop gap
before the real stuff begins this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Feeble is a single father of two living in London. His wife
split to find herself (``I'm going for a swim in the lake of me''),
leaving frazzled accountant Eric to keep the household together.
It's not easy. His daughter is allergic to practically everything;
his son barely talks, but eats practically anything.
</P>
<P>
   His au pair is useless _ even when she's awake. ``When I ask you
to stay in and look after the kids,'' Eric says one morning while
trying to wake her, ``I don't expect you to go out and have 37
vodka slammers and come home at 4 a.m. with a rock band called the
Puss Doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the decadent air of ``Absolutely Fabulous'' wafting
through here, but it loses its pungence when displayed as a
cartoon. So we're left with the perfect network compromise: neither
risky enough, nor smart enough, to look like anything original.
</P>
<P>
   Or like anything you'd want to watch.

HOW WILL CONGRESS REACT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that President Clinton's ordeal in the Monica
Lewinsky saga is about to shift from the courts to Congress, the
prospect of launching an impeachment process looks far less
politically palatable than it did when it was merely distant
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy of bringing down a president over moral impropriety
and perjury is one thing; the reality of probable voter anger at
those hypocrites who would levy such a disproportionate punishment,
quite another.
</P>
<P>
   If Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr sends a report to Congress
accusing the president of lying about a sexual dalliance and
encouraging others to lie as well, Congress cannot ignore it.
Partisan zealots and moral purists will demand some action, no
matter how inconclusive and circumstantial the evidence may be.
</P>
<P>
   But a rush to impeach the president for conduct that was
reckless and disingenuous but posed no constitutional crisis or
serious abuse of power is unlikely to be a popular move. A majority
of Americans already believe that the president misbehaved but
think he's doing a good professional job and ought to stay in
office anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, kicking Clinton out would leave the Republicans with an
incumbent Al Gore to face in the year 2000 presidential contest,
not a pleasing prospect from their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? There is another way for Congress to kick Clinton
in the teeth without actually pounding him to smithereens. And that
is to consider censuring him instead.
</P>
<P>
   Since Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott recently suggested the
idea as a possible alternative, it has attracted increasing
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Congress has the constitutional authority
to formally rebuke a president, short of the somber ritual of
impeachment for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Such a move would
be plowing virtually untested ground.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have the momentary political charm of putting a
legislative and legal end to this tawdry tale more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Only one president, Andrew Johnson, has been impeached by the
House. It happened in 1868, during the post-Civil War turmoil, but
the Senate, sitting as a trial court, acquitted him _ by only one
vote short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. In
1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended the impeachment of
Richard Nixon, who then resigned to avoid that fate.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred sixty-four years ago Andrew Jackson became the only
president to be censured, setting an ominous example that
politicians have thus far not cared to repeat. Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W. Va., recounts the dramatic episode in his authoritative
two-volume history of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the censure, approved by the Senate on March
28, 1834, on a 23-18 vote, was that Jackson was acting like a
despot. The real issue, however, was strictly a power struggle
among the era's political giants.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had refused to recharter the elite United States Bank
and withdrew its government deposits, effectively ending the bank's
self-serving dominance over American monetary policy. This angered
the bank's powerful allies, who formed the Whig Party and demanded
Jackson's censure.
</P>
<P>
   After their victory, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, a Jackson backer,
dismissed the censure as ``nothing but an empty fulmination.'' And
so it proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   The House refused to go along with it. In the congressional
elections later that fall, Jackson's supporters increased their
majority in the House and took control of the Senate. Two years
later, the pro-Jackson Martin Van Buren was elected to the White
House and the Democrats tightened their grip on Congress. The
political climate became favorable to clearing Jackson's name.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1837, his Senate allies drew black lines around the
original recorded censure with the words ``expunged by order of the
Senate.'' The move was approved 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Whig Party, defeated on the bank issue and in the
congressional and presidential elections, lasted only another 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has been more effective in censuring its own members,
although it has applied the penalty only nine times, under great
provocation. Censure does not remove a member's right to vote or
speak or serve on committees, although it tends to isolate the
guilty person socially and politically.
</P>
<P>
   It is less harsh than the punishment of expulsion, a rarely used
remedy last recommended by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in
1995 against Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore. He was cited for sexual
misconduct, influence peddling and obstruction of the committee's
investigation. Packwood resigned rather than let the recommendation
go to a full Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious case was that of Sen. Joseph McCarthy,
R-Wis., whose witch hunt for supposed communists in government
trampled civil liberties and produced no substantial evidence of
subversion. He was censured in 1954 for conduct ``contrary to
senatorial traditions.'' He remained in the Senate but died in 1957
a shunned and broken man.
</P>
<P>
   In any Clinton case, the House Judiciary Committee would be the
first congressional entity to tackle the issue of impeachment,
censure, reprimand or no action. In past decades the House has
censured several members, mostly for criminal offenses, but it
tends toward lighter reprimands for ethical violations. Speaker
Newt Gingrich, for instance, received a fine and a reprimand in
1997 for improper use of tax-exempt dollars for political purposes,
and he was allowed to keep his post as House leader.

 &HT;    Players suspended for one year
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech football coach George O'Leary suspended
tight ends Mike Lillie and reserve Chris Myers for one year Tuesday
for unspecified violation of team rules.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary would not divulge what the players had done or when the
infractions occurred, saying only that they had violated team rules
and that it ``took a while'' to make the decision. The move came
two days before varsity players were scheduled to report to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to start off with this note, but we needed to
do it,'' O'Leary said. ``It was a hard decision, but that was the
decision that was made. I wanted to make sure I made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillie, a redshirt sophomore from River Ridge, La., and Myers, a
redshirt senior from Panama City, Fla., were listed as co-starters
at tight end on Tech's preseason depth chart. Myers plans to
complete the academic year at Tech, while Lillie plans to transfer
to another school, although he's not sure where, Tech spokesman
Mike Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   Tech returns three other tight ends _ senior Matt Gubba, junior
Conrad Andrzejewski and redshirt freshman Russell Matvay.
</P>
<P>
   A freshman at the position is Brian Lee, a 6-5, 243-pounder from
Florence, Ala. Sophomore fullback Ed Wilder also could be used at
tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a position we have some flexibility with,'' O'Leary said.
``But no question they'll be missed. . . . It has to hurt you down
the road because you've worked so hard to build depth. That's my
concern.''

 &HT;    Kentucky aims for a bowl year
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hal Mumme's comfort level is demonstrated by his steadfast
refusal to wear neckties in a button-down league that last fall was
forced to take notice of the Kentucky coach's swashbuckling
play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Couch's comfort level depends a lot on the fact that Mumme
fully turned him loose to steer a BYU-style offense that delighted
the citizenry of a basketball-crazed commonwealth and made football
more than a sporting diversion. But the Heisman quarterback
candidate acknowledges the honeymoon will be over if the Wildcats
can do nothing more this year than provide breathtaking
entertainment without the results required in the bottom-line SEC.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Mumme arrived from Valdosta State to give Kentucky
a badly needed football makeover, the Wildcats are still snarling
about a 5-6 finish in his first campaign. They're convinced that
two games, including a 23-13 loss at Georgia, shouldn't have
slipped away, taking some of the shine off the school's first win
over Alabama in 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   For just the second time in school history, a full complement of
40,000 season tickets is expected to be sold. The athletic
department already has begun its ambitious Heisman campaign for
Couch, a junior who finished ninth in last year's balloting and
could be playing his last season of college football. And while the
schedule isn't especially kind, with road games at Florida, LSU and
Tennessee, there are enough soft spots for Kentucky to earn its
first bowl bid in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to expect us to win those games we lost last
year, but that's a good feeling for us to have,'' Couch said.''
People believe in us now, and we believe in ourselves as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Kentucky understandably places its full faith and
trust in Couch, who led the country with 3,884 passing yards and 37
touchdowns and was second in total offense with 341.7 yards a game.
Returning to the no-huddle, shotgun formation are All-American
receiver candidate Craig Yeast, who had 73 receptions for 873 yards
and 10 touchdowns, all school records, and three others who caught
at least 31 passes each. One of them is a running back, Derek
Homer, who managed 502 yards on the ground to complement the
aerials. Couch's line also has four of five 1997 starters
returning.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the defensive side of the ball that still causes
shudders, despite Mumme's protestations that there was considerable
progess during the spring. The Cats were last in the SEC in total
defense (392 yards), scoring defense (33 points) and first downs
surrendered (20 a game). While there are some solid returnees in
linebacker Jeff Snedegar and free safety Willie Gary, Kentucky
simply cannot afford to give up points as easily as the offense
produces them. One possible solution for a shaky defensive line is
true freshman Dennis Johnson, the Atlanta Touchdown Club's national
prep player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we went with 14 guys (on defense) who had never
walked onto an SEC playing field before,`` Mumme said. ``We need
more numbers, and we need more speed. At the other places I've
been, we've won championships because of great defense. That's what
we're trying to do at Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch worked in the off-season and spring on greater precision
throwing longer passes, and he gained 18 pounds, to 230, and thinks
that it has helped his arm strength. Spicing up an already
flavorful attack with deeper patterns also figures to help him
prepare better for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the NFL has always been a dream of mine, but I'm
not thinking about it now,'' he said. ``I'm having too much fun
playing college football. We're going to put points on the board no
matter who we're playing, but the bottom line is we're going to
have to stop some people.''

 &HT;    Rookie Fisk risking his health, some doctors believe
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like many NFL rookies, Atlanta Falcons fullback Darren
Fisk has a vision of making it in pro football. Sometimes, though,
that vision gets a little blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, an undrafted free agent from Colorado, has been in three
head-to-head collisions in camp that produced blurred vision and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   At least one doctor thinks that Fisk, 24, has suffered from
post-concussion symptoms. At least one other physician thinks a
defective artery leading to Fisk's brain gets pinched easily when
his head is jarred to the left. A neuro-opthamologist believes the
problem could be migraines triggered by collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk has no history of such problems and isn't sure what to
think. Doctors have told him that playing poses a very slight risk
of vision loss and left the decision on playing to him.
</P>
<P>
   After missing practice Monday, Fisk was back out on the practice
field Tuesday, lowering the boom on linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to church Sunday, and the whole sermon was about how I
have to do what (God) wants me to do and not what I want to do,''
said Fisk, a 6-foot-1, 230-pound back from Los Gatos, Calif.
``(Team officials) said (Sunday night), 'We really don't think
there is a big risk; it's up to you.' I went to meetings (Monday)
night and thought about it, and something was just telling me to
keep going. Something's not right, but I honestly don't think I'm
going to lose my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, who said he previously had a concussion or two, said his
problem started on July 25, the third day of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a goal-line scrimmage, I had a hard head-to-head collision
with a linebacker, and about 10 seconds later I started having
blurred vision, kind of a headache, and I thought, 'Oh, no, I've
got a concussion,''' said Fisk, who was honored as the ``Tough
Buff'' at Colorado for his intensity and physical nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice was over, and I was like, 'Should I tell anybody?
Because it's the NFL and it might hurt my chances.' (Starting
fullback) Bobby Christian told me I should tell them. So I told
them, and it was no big deal. That next Wednesday, I got another
one, and it was like, 'Whoa! I better watch what I'm doing. At
Colorado, I was taught to lead with my head, more than my
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, in Jacksonville (Aug. 1), and I (hit) a linebacker, head
to head. I couldn't see for 45 minutes or so, and I got a
headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk didn't miss a practice the next week, and a CAT scan
revealed no abnormalities. But team doctor Andrew Bishop expressed
enough concern that Fisk was told there could be some risk if he
played Friday in the preseason opener against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk decided to play and had no problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, team officials had him undergo a magnetic
resonance imaging test (MRI), and it was revealed that Fisk has a
congenital defect _ an artery leading to the left side of his brain
is smaller than normal. But there was no conclusion that it was
causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   An eye doctor found nothing wrong, so Fisk was sent to
neuro-opthamologist Robert Spector, who concluded that the problems
are migraine-related. Although a small percentage of migraines
include vision-related problems, there are cases of it happening.
</P>
<P>
   Spector declined comment, and questions were referred to head
trainer Ron Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not really suffered a concussion, per se, but he did
see a white flash across the eyes which can be construed as a
symptom of a concussion,'' Medlin said. ``(Dr. Spector's)
conclusion was that it was migraine-related, brought on by the
blows he received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say 110 percent, 'Darren, you're at no risk,' because
that is an unknown.' There have been a couple cases in literature
of partial vision loss (in cases like this). (But) the risk is
greater of breaking an ankle or tearing up a knee.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fisk, who is fighting long odds to make the team, continues
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my parents, and they said, 'What are you going to do
if you lose your vision?''' he said. ``So they didn't think I
should do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it, and something was just telling me to keep
going. I don't know if they think I'm a problem now, but I love
this, and something is telling me to keep going.''

   SOUND-OF-MUSIC (New York) _ Audiences flocking to the Martin
Beck Theater for the current revival of ``The Sound of Music''
could care less that many critics find the musical irredeemably
saccharine. With its famously tuneful score, this 1959 show, the
last Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, is comfortingly
familiar. People watch dazed with happiness, bobbing their heads,
along with the Von Trapp children as they learn their do, re, mi's,
smiling with recognition as Maria lists her favorite things. There
is no glitz, no benumbing spectacle, no blaring rock-ified
orchestra, just good old-fashioned musical value and an uplifting
story. By Anthony Tommasini.

through Sept. 20. For students and knowledgeable admirers of
20th-century art, Munter (1877-1962) is little more than an elusive
presence in the annals of German Expressionism. For decades she has
been mentioned in these histories, when mentioned at all, as pupil

</P>
<P>
   AYCKBOURN-THEATER (London) _ It is no secret that, after 53
plays, Alan Ayckbourn relishes a challenge. And in play No. 49,
``Communicating Doors,'' the task he has posed for himself is this:
how to mold a comic thriller _ or even a scary farce _ while at the

   KRIS-KRISTOFFERSON-FILMS (Undated) _ If sentimentality is the
tendency to show more than one feels, Kris Kristofferson is the
opposite of sentimental: the man who feels so much that he cannot
help but show it. He is what he wrote about, a walking
contradiction _ a Rhodes scholar propelled though life less by
reason than by impulse; a Golden Gloves boxer blessed with a poet's
understanding of irredeemable loss and late-night yearnings. Rugged
yet capable of being wounded, solitary yet reachable, he veers
between two styles: supremely laid back and wound tighter than

LYCOS PURCHASE AIMED AT INTERNET GATEWAY STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., long regarded as a laggard in the race to become a
gateway to the Internet, &UR;  &LR;  hopes to leap to the head of the pack
with a $133 million purchase of WhoWhere Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lycos chief executive &UR;  &LR;  Robert Davis said the deal,
announced Tuesday, will help his firm become not only a doorway to
the Internet, but a major destination in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., will pay about 2 million shares
of &UR;  &LR; its stock for WhoWhere, a closely-held Mountain View, Calif.,
firm that owns the popular WhoWhere Internet white pages service as
well as MailCity, a free electronic mail system and Angelfire, a
free Web page hosting service.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is one of several firms building Internet ``portals'', or
Web sites that attract millions of visitors. While visitors aren't
charged for using the portal, advertisers and Internet retailers
pay millions of dollars to have their ads and electronic
storefronts on portal sites. The leading portals are run by the
America Online computer network and by the Internet search service
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us in a credible position to say we're challenging for
the No. 1 &UR;  &LR; spot in this space,'' said Davis, of the WhoWhere
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Portals generally offer popular services like Web page searches,
news headlines and free e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Lycos' &UR;  &LR; expansion plan is Angelfire, where
visitors can build their own Web site at no charge. Angelfire
presently has 1.3 million users, many of whom are adolescents or
adults over 40. That makes the company a good fit with Tripod, a
free Web site service that Lycos purchased earlier this year.
Tripod's 1.8 million members are mainly teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Both Angelfire and Tripod attract users who spend hours on-line
designing their Web sites and visiting other sites created by
members with similar interests. Lycos will thus be able to deliver
an audience of millions to Internet advertisers, in much the same
way television delivers millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The other parts of the WhoWhere acquisition are also supposed to
feed into this strategy. WhoWhere itself attracts thousands of
users trying to look up people's e-mail addresses and phone
numbers. MailCity has 9.3 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, an Internet analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, said that Lycos is doing a good job of establishing
itself as a major presence on the Internet. ``They've grabbed yet
another big community,'' said Delhagen. ``This gives them yet one
more opportunity to generate revenue for all those commerce
partners.''

RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET   TRADING HALTED TEMPORARILY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Amid new financial turmoil in Asia and nagging doubts
about the government's ability to stem Russia's economic crisis,
Russian markets took a beating so hard Tuesday that trading had to
be temporarily stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Russian treasury bill yields soared as high as 130 percent, up
from 100 percent Tuesday. Stocks plunged 11.8 percent on the main
RTS index, forcing a suspension of trading. Trading resumed after a
45-minute halt and the index closed at 109.91, still down 9.1
percent down from Monday's close of 120.91.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and analysts in Moscow partially attributed the rise
in interest rates and the drop in stock prices to worldwide flight
from emerging markets and new currency turbulence in Asia. But they
also pointed to investors' lack of confidence in the anti-crisis
plan of Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. Despite landing a
$22.6 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund
and other sources last month, the government has been unable to
convince investors that it can turn around Russia's economy. The
IMF and the World Bank have demanded Russia cut spending and reform
its much-criticized tax system, but analysts here are skeptical
that the government will be able to drastically increase revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation did not change after Russia received a credit
from the IMF,'' commented Sergei Babayan of Troika-Dialog. ``We
haven't noticed economic growth ... and there are no big amounts of
revenue coming into the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Russia outlined terms for the sale of a 5 percent stake
in the state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom and just under 25 percent
of Svyazinvest, the Russian telecommunications giant. The
government is desperate to raise cash after plans to auction off a
75 percent stake in the state-owned Rosneft oil company were twice
postponed earlier this year as potential buyers stayed away with
oil prices at a low.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Moscow is that the IMF-led package has bought
the Kiriyenko government a few month's breathing room. But even
Kiriyenko said last week that the country has not moved back from
the brink of collapse. At the same time, protests by miners,
nuclear power plant workers, teachers and doctors, many of whom
have gone unpaid for months, are increasing throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Central Bank continues to intervene heavily to support
the ruble, but a growing number of observers believe the government
will not be able to prop up the Russian currency indefinitely, even
with the new rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies it is planning a devaluation, which many
here fear could lead to increased social tension and a new round of
hyperinflation. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has been forced to fend off
a growing rumor that Russia will default on its foreign debts.
Recently, communist and ultranationalist politicians, saying that
six years of reform have produced nothing but a few rich people and
much pain among ordinary Russians, have vowed not to pay Russia's
debts to foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Default is not an issue here,'' Deputy Prime Minister Viktor
Khristiyenko said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the government can get its austerity package through
parliament is very much an issue. The lower house, the
opposition-dominated State Duma, refused to approve measures to
raise taxes last month, saying that they constituted an attempt by
the government to foist the toughest measures on the poorest
segments of the population. The Duma shows no signs of agreeing to
raise taxes in a special session planned for next week. Without
parliamentary approval, the government has decreed a number of tax
increases, but their legality is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has promised to improve
compliance with existing tax laws, and increase collection of an
estimated $50 billion in back-owed taxes and fines by 5,000 Russian
companies. But most of these companies are essentially bankrupt,
and will hardly be able to pay, something Kiriyenko acknowledged
Tuesday.

 &HT;    Say Gesundheit! to start of ragweed season
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Snot a joke: The new season of sneezin' is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike spring pollen, which warns you with a thick powdering of
yellow on the car, the dog and anything else outside for more than
five minutes, fall's allergy season sneaks up without so much as a
dusty windshield.
</P>
<P>
   So this is your warning: The ragweed is coming! The ragweed is
coming!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you can predict,'' said Dr. Kathleen
Sheerin of the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Ragweed, a common and tenacious plant that likes moist areas
such as riverbanks, gets its cue to pollinate when the days shorten
and the nights lengthen to a certain point, sometime after Aug. 15,
Sheerin said. The clinic probably will resume its daily pollen
count next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And forewarned is forearmed, as they say, especially since
certain allergy medicines, such as the prescription drug Vancenase
and the over-the-counter nasal spray Nasalcrom, must be taken for
at least a week before they start to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to be on your medicine before the season starts,''
Sheerin said. ``Get your prescriptions in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also recommend the usual: keep the windows shut, change
the furnace filter, bathe the pets. Ragweed usually pollinates in
the morning, so if you're allergic, avoid that time of day for
outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few good things about the fall pollen season is that
it is shorter and less intense than the spring pollen season. In
colder climates, the season ends with the first frost, but here in
the South, the pollen just dissipates after about a month.
</P>
<P>
   But mold, another major allergen, also is expected to start
tickling noses in late summer or early fall. So keep the Kleenex
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic's pollen line for daily
pollen counts is 770-662-6100, or you can view the clinic's
Internet site at http://www.atlallergy.com.

 &HT;    MAJORITY OF TEENAGERS SAY SCHOOL CRIME AND VIOLENCE IS THEIR TOP
CONCERN
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six out of 10 teenagers say their top concern is
crime and violence in school, according to a nationwide survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey paints a picture of high school students who are
concerned with scholastic achievement, get along well with their
parents and are optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of nearly 1,200 students found that four out of 10
said they make homework a priority, with one-fourth receiving
mostly A's on their last report card. Half of the students said
they try to take the most difficult and challenging courses they
can, although girls were more likely than boys _ by a ratio of
three-to-two _ to sign up for tougher courses.
</P>
<P>
   Some boys said they try to hide their intelligence from peers
for fear of being called a ``nerd'' or ``geek.'' Girls indicated
they feel pride about their intelligence and don't try to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Among other survey findings:
</P>
<P>
   Girls feel optimistic about achieving their career goals and
</P>
<P>
   anticipate earning the same or more than men.
</P>
<P>
   Most teenagers said cheating exists in schools and they
</P>
<P>
   believe more than half of all students cheat at one point in
their high school careers.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 cite a family member as their role model; six
</P>
<P>
   out of 10 said parents spend the ``right amount'' of time with
their children and that they like and respect their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 feel that mathematics is the most important
</P>
<P>
   course to take for future success.
</P>
<P>
   The top career choices, in order, were: teacher, computer
</P>
<P>
   hardware/software developer, medical doctor, business person and
an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by The Horatio Alger Association of
Distinguished Americans, Inc., a nonprofit educational
organization, who sent self-administered mail questionnaires to
high school students between the ages of 14 and 18 nationwide in
June.

QUEEN OF HEARTLESSNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (NOTE: Following is a corrected version of the Diana-Book story.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul McCartney once sang, ``Her majesty's a pretty
nice girl but she doesn't have much to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you believe the portrait painted of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II by Christopher Andersen in ``The Day Diana Died''
(William Morrow; $27), then nice is not the word that you'd apply
to her royal highness _ and what she almost didn't say is telling.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andersen's book, which hits stores today, the queen
showed ``an astonishing lack of emotion _ even for the reserved
monarch'' when informed of Princess Diana's death from a car crash
in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997. She then insisted that Prince Charles
not wake the children _ William and Harry _ to tell them of their
mother's death. Charles then waited until morning to break the news
to the boys, at which point they all ``wept unashamedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at breakfast, according to Andersen, neither the queen
nor Prince Philip hugged their grandsons, but in typical British
reserve did tell the children how ``terribly sorry'' they were, and
the queen insisted that they go to their scheduled morning church
service.
</P>
<P>
   The church service, at the queen's orders, made no mention of
Diana's death, but had a sermon that contained a number of jokes,
prompting Harry to ask Charles, ``Are you sure Mummy is dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the queen's real concern was the royal jewels. The
book says that after hearing of Diana's death, the queen called the
British Embassy in Paris, wanting to know if Diana had any royal
jewels when she died and demanded that they be ``returned
immediately.'' An envoy was dispatched to the hospital where
Diana's body lay, but the princess apparently wasn't wearing any
jewels when she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and even his girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles, come off
much better in this straightforward account by Andersen, who has
written two less-than-flattering books on the Kennedys (``Jack and
Jackie'' and ``Jackie After Jack''). Parker-Bowles is said to have
told Charles to ``concentrate on the boys. They need you.'' And
over his mother's objections, Charles flew to France to claim his
former wife's body and had white lilies (Diana's favorites) sent to
the room where her body lay.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to Andersen, William was puzzled over why
the flag over Buckingham Palace was not lowered to half-mast right
after Diana died, (the flag was not lowered for several days) and
why the royal family stayed at its Balmoral, Scotland, retreat
while Diana's body was in London.
</P>
<P>
   What will make ``The Day Diana Died'' fascinating reading for
many is the behind-the-scenes struggles within the royal family. It
took Charles and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to prevail upon
the queen to speak to the nation. This was only after Charles, the
book says, told her he would go on TV and apologize for her
``apparent callous disregard for the people's suffering'' and that
it became clear that her silence would endanger the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Day Diana Died'' is likely to raise eyebrows _ if not
stiff upper lips _ with some of its revelations. Here are a few
others:
</P>
<P>
   Dodi Fayed, who was killed with Diana, intended to ask her to
marry him that night and was upset that the paparazzi was
interfering with his plans. He decided to play a game of
cat-and-mouse with them before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Diana intended to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's final words were ``My God, what's happened?''
</P>
<P>
   At her request, Diana's casket had a window above her face.
</P>
<P>
   Her face was virtually untouched after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Charles almost passed out when he first saw Diana dead.

FOREIGNERS DETAINED FOR QUESTIONING IN BOMBING PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police in Tanzania have arrested 14 foreigners and
detained 16 others for questioning as authorities cast a wide net
for anyone who has information about last week's US embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and one Turk were arrested,
according to police there. They did not provide a satisfactory
explanation for their presence in the country and could not produce
their passports, a spokesman said. He declined to name the 14
people, who were arrested in Dar es Salaam at different times. None
has been charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley said US investigators on
the ground in Kenya and Tanzania have ``access to the information
they require.'' But he refused to say whether the suspects have
been questioned by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Sudanese suspects said that he worked for the Saudi
Arabian embassy in Dar es Salaam, and five claimed to be visitors.
The Iraqis included a civil servant, an engineer, a teacher, a
telecommunications technician and an agricultural engineer. The
Somali said he was working for the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees. No details were available about the Turk.
</P>
<P>
   A Tanzanian police spokesman called them ``dubious characters''
who might have been involved in the bombing that killed 10 people
near the American embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's former
capital.
</P>
<P>
   As details emerge from last Friday morning's events in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, intelligence officials have a better idea of the
size of the bombs and the type of explosives used. Experts now
believe the device in Nairobi weighed at least 500 pounds. Israel
army radio reported that investigators think the bombers used
Semtex, a sophisticated plastic explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Both those factors point to Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
exile thought be living in Afghanistan, according to Ariel Merari,
an expert on international terrorism at Israel's Tel Aviv
University. In February, Bin Laden and leaders of the Islamic Jihad
group issued a fatwa, or Islamic religious ruling, calling for the
killing of Americans, civilian and military. Just a few weeks ago,
Bin Laden warned reporters of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department cautioned against drawing conclusions from
the nationalities of those arrested. The investigtion ``is going to
take a long time, given the nature of the crime,'' said spokesman
James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence organizations of this country are now very
busy exchanging notes with the Americans,'' said Mirari. ``But they
don't know any more than the Americans at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Merari, who keeps extensive computerized files on terrorists,
said the authorities first try to assess what motivated an attack
and then analyze how it was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A day after announcing a $2 million reward for the capture and
conviction of the bombers, State Department officials said that US
agencies had received numerous tips, although it is too early to
evaluate how useful they will be.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also refused to confirm a report that a security
camera atop the American embassy in Tanzania, which was pointed at
the site of the bombing, did not have film.
</P>
<P>
   As the rescue effort entered its fifth day, the death toll in
Kenya reached 218, including 12 Americans. Another 10 died in
Tanzania, where the US embassy was in a less crowded residential
neighborhood by the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern African country of Swaziland, a bomb threat
Tuesday triggered fears of another attack. Two buildings housing
U.S. embassy offices were evacuated, but police found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Another six American embassies and consulates elsewhere abroad
have been closed temporarily because of threats, according to
Patrick Kennedy, an assistant secretary of state in charge of
administation. ``We are not shutting the embassies down. We are not
leaving,'' Kennedy said. ``We are taking, in effect, a timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few world leaders to speculate publically on the
identity of the bombers was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who said the initial evidence points to ``international
terrorism centered on Islamic fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with African ambassadors in Washington, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright alluded to the speculation. ``Terror is
not a form of political expression, it is certainly not a
manifestation of religious faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she will visit the sites of the destruction soon.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: LOWER FARES TO NORTH DAKOTA; SPECIAL DEAL TO HONG
KONG; LAPTOP UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in ``t'' category.) 
(mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from North Dakota politicians and local
airport managers, Northwest Airlines said Tuesday that it would cut
business fares to and from the state as part of a six-month trial
to stimulate passenger traffic. The fares, discounted as much as 60
percent on connecting flights and 42 percent on nonstop flights,
are available immediately for travel from Sept. 14 through March
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new discounts come against the backdrop of mounting
political pressures in state legislatures and in Congress to rein
in rising business fares. Just this Monday, a Democratic candidate
for attorney general of Minnesota said that if elected, he would
summon a task force to recommend ways of increasing airline
competition in the state and would also investigate whether
Northwest had violated antitrust laws _ a suggestion the carrier
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Tuesday's decision, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said:
``Community representatives and our airport managers have been in
ongoing discussions with Northwest on the issue of reducing fares
since last October. Northwest is responding to our analysis and
concerns that the current business fares are inhibiting some North
Dakota travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, in what it said was an effort to spur economic
development in the nine-county greater Des Moines, Iowa, area,
UAL's United Airlines cut fares between Des Moines and other
Midwest cities by 34 percent, to $249 each way. It also cut 50
percent off 14-day advance fares that do not require a Saturday
night stay. And by deploying bigger planes between Des Moines and
Chicago, it added 812 seats each week during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said
that both the United and Northwest decisions were directly related
to the increasing business, government and news media pressure on
the airlines. Tuesday's cuts, he said, ``underscore the usefulness
of federal government leadership on the competition issue in
providing local communities with impartial data and analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Northwest does not seem prepared to lose revenue
indefinitely on its North Dakota experiment. ``A substantial
increase in the unrestricted business fare traffic will be required
to maintain these fares after the test period,'' the carrier said
in a statement. ``For example on many routes, passengers in the
business fare category will have to double their current level just
to maintain present revenue levels for Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   During the test period, one-way fares between Bismarck, N.D.,
and Chicago, for example, will fall to $195 from $460, between
Bismarck and Washington to $325 from $680 and between Minot, N.D.,
and Chicago to $195 from $484. Reductions on flights from both
Bismarck and Minot to Minneapolis-St. Paul will range between 36
and 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said it would support its lower business fares with
increased marketing, advertising and by including the rates on its
World Wide Web site. Test results will be reported by early January
1999, and a final evaluation will be released about mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap Seats to Hong Kong
</P>
<P>
   From now through the end of the month, Cathay Pacific is
offering round-trip flights to Hong Kong from New York and Los
Angeles for $399 plus taxes and fees. Seats are limited and tickets
_ nonrefundable even in the event of illness _ are valid for travel
between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, among other restrictions. Moreover,
the fare is available only via the Internet, although there is no
charge for registration (www.cathay-usa.com/hop) and it takes only
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling With Laptops
</P>
<P>
   An American Express survey of business travelers has found that
65 percent of respondents always or almost always use a laptop
computer on overnight trips. Those travelers will probably be
pleased to learn that the new security gates at United Airlines'
Terminal 7 at Los Angeles International airport, scheduled to open
in early September, will allow passengers to go through without
switching on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Security-minded laptop owners may be glad to know that Port
Inc., which already offers a motion-sensitive system for
notebook-computer carrying cases, has developed a remote control
security system. When motion is detected, an electronic sensor
triggers an alarm that activates a siren, which sounds for up to 30
seconds. A key chain remote control, usable up to 40 feet, has a
panic button that signals an immediate alarm to find a lost
carrying case or to signal an alert if a thief grabs the case.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Mobile Computing &AMP; Communications magazine
reports on the results of a drop test of seven leading computer
bags, each one dropped from 29 inches (desk height) and 40 inches
(shoulder height). The winners, which tied for first place, were
Brenthaven's Computer Topload ($275) and Tumi's Safecase Basic
Computer Brief ($250).

FOREIGNERS DETAINED FOR QUESTIONING IN BOMBING PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police in Tanzania have arrested 14 foreigners and
detained 16 others for questioning as authorities cast a wide net
for anyone who has information about last week's US embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Six Sudanese, six Iraqis, one Somali and one Turk were arrested,
according to police there. They did not provide a satisfactory
explanation for their presence in the country and could not produce
their passports, a spokesman said. He declined to name the 14
people, who were arrested in Dar es Salaam at different times. None
has been charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley said US investigators on
the ground in Kenya and Tanzania have ``access to the information
they require.'' But he refused to say whether the suspects have
been questioned by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Sudanese suspects said that he worked for the Saudi
Arabian embassy in Dar es Salaam, and five claimed to be visitors.
The Iraqis included a civil servant, an engineer, a teacher, a
telecommunications technician and an agricultural engineer. The
Somali said he was working for the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees. No details were available about the Turk.
</P>
<P>
   A Tanzanian police spokesman called them ``dubious characters''
who might have been involved in the bombing that killed 10 people
near the American embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's former
capital.
</P>
<P>
   As details emerge from last Friday morning's events in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, intelligence officials have a better idea of the
size of the bombs and the type of explosives used. Experts now
believe the device in Nairobi weighed at least 500 pounds. Israel
army radio reported that investigators think the bombers used
Semtex, a sophisticated plastic explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Both those factors point to Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
exile thought be living in Afghanistan, according to Ariel Merari,
an expert on international terrorism at Israel's Tel Aviv
University. In February, Bin Laden and leaders of the Islamic Jihad
group issued a fatwa, or Islamic religious ruling, calling for the
killing of Americans, civilian and military. Just a few weeks ago,
Bin Laden warned reporters of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department cautioned against drawing conclusions from
the nationalities of those arrested. The investigtion ``is going to
take a long time, given the nature of the crime,'' said spokesman
James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence organizations of this country are now very
busy exchanging notes with the Americans,'' said Mirari. ``But they
don't know any more than the Americans at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Merari, who keeps extensive computerized files on terrorists,
said the authorities first try to assess what motivated an attack
and then analyze how it was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A day after announcing a $2 million reward for the capture and
conviction of the bombers, State Department officials said that US
agencies had received numerous tips, although it is too early to
evaluate how useful they will be.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also refused to confirm a report that a security
camera atop the American embassy in Tanzania, which was pointed at
the site of the bombing, did not have film.
</P>
<P>
   As the rescue effort entered its fifth day, the death toll in
Kenya reached 218, including 12 Americans. Another 10 died in
Tanzania, where the US embassy was in a less crowded residential
neighborhood by the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern African country of Swaziland, a bomb threat
Tuesday triggered fears of another attack. Two buildings housing
U.S. embassy offices were evacuated, but police found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Another six American embassies and consulates elsewhere abroad
have been closed temporarily because of threats, according to
Patrick Kennedy, an assistant secretary of state in charge of
administation. ``We are not shutting the embassies down. We are not
leaving,'' Kennedy said. ``We are taking, in effect, a timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few world leaders to speculate publically on the
identity of the bombers was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who said the initial evidence points to ``international
terrorism centered on Islamic fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with African ambassadors in Washington, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright alluded to the speculation. ``Terror is
not a form of political expression, it is certainly not a
manifestation of religious faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she will visit the sites of the destruction soon.

CLINTON SAYS U.S. WILL NOT BACK AWAY FROM GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES 

</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton called on Americans Tuesday to
``send a clear signal to the world'' that the United States would
not back away from its global responsibilities in wake of the
deadly bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is terribly frightening to people when something
like this happens, but ... I think it is important that we all, as
Americans, send a clear signal to the world that we are not going
to back away from our involvement with other people, and we are not
going to back away from our opposition to terrorism,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us more vulnerable as targets because we have taken
the toughest stand around the world against terrorism. Now is the
time to bear down, not back up, on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the Bay Area for fund-raising events, will return to
Washington at dawn Wednesday to hold meetings with his national
security staff and to attend memorial services Thursday for 10 of
the 12 slain Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One American, married to a Kenyan, will be buried in Africa and
another will be flown to Dover, Del., where her remains will be
released directly to the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   The president told Californians that the United States was
working with the governments of Kenya and Tanzania on rescue and
treatment efforts for victims in both countries. And, he said the
African governments were working closely with the United States to
find the terrorists responsible.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. allies are also providing help.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Norway,
Japan and South Africa have joined the United States in sending law
enforcement experts, soldiers, planes, blood or trauma teams to the
destroyed embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
said State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Friday morning bombings, the U.S. military has
completed more than 17 airlift missions to and from Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also notified Congress that he ordered 50 to 100
combat-ready troops to provide security around the damaged
embassies in Africa and to protect U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The notification was required by the War Powers Act, but Clinton
emphasized the troops were deployed for medical and security
assistance only and will return to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Six other U.S. embassies around the world were briefly closed
after receiving terrorist threats in the wake of the attacks in
East Africa, Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy refused to disclose which embassies had been threatened,
citing security concerns. He called the temporary shutdowns a
``brief timeout'' to assess security and said the safety measures
did not significantly interfere with the work of embassy employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shutting embassies down in a permanent sense,''
Kennedy said. ``We are not leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hopes to visit the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania soon, Foley said. However, Albright
will not make the trip until she is sure the visit would not
interfere with the ongoing investigation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to symbolize the fact that we will not be intimidated,
that we will rebuild our embassies,'' Foley said. ``Our foreign
policy is not going to be changed ... as the result of any
terrorist attacks.''.

HAVEN-SEEKING INVESTORS PUSH TREASURIES UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities made modest price gains Tuesday
as investors sought a haven from the stock market and from overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Treasuries pushed down the long bond's yield,
which falls as prices rise, close to its all-time low. One reason
for the demand was that the dollar surged to an eight-year high
against the Japanese yen, and investors grew concerned that Russia
might default on debt repayments. A strong dollar makes
dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more
attractive to foreign investors, not only for the return but also
for the potential gains from currency translations.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the 30-year benchmark issue was up 11/32, to
a price of 107 17/32, and its yield fell to 5.60 percent, from 5.62
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Treasury's $16 billion, five-year-note auction Tuesday,
part of its quarterly sale of notes and bonds, the yield came in at
5.327 percent, a little worse than expected, although not
surprising considering bonds were rallying at the time. Usually
dealers will raise yield levels ahead of an auction to attract
investors, but the rally may have cut into that pre-auction
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government will auction $11 billion of 10-year
notes by reopening the 5.625 percent issue due May 15, 2008, and on
Thursday it will sell $10 billion of a new 30-year bond. In
when-issued trading, the 10-year note was being offered at a price
to yield 5.36 percent and the 30-year bond at a price to yield 5.52
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus
Investment Management, said the bond market's strength came from
two sources Tuesday, primarily from the so-called flight to quality
from other assets like emerging markets and stocks. The second
source of strength, he said, was ``from people beginning to wonder
if Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would entertain the idea
of an ease in interest rates to offset some of the global weakness
that seems to be deteriorating further.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the close of the New York market, bond yields came off
their best levels of the day, in response, Whelan said, ``to a
stabilizing stock market and a mediocre five-year note auction,
which I thought was affected by the rally in Treasuries.'' He
added, ``Some investors will set up short positions ahead of an
auction, but the rally in the market caused those investors to
cover their positions prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even strong economic data Tuesday were overwhelmed by events in
overseas markets and in domestic stock markets. Second-quarter
nonfarm business productivity edged down at a two-tenths of 1
percent annual rate, which was in line with expectations given
Asia's economic crisis and the General Motors strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at
Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said: ``Clearly the
stock market decline is an indication of an asset reallocation play
going on. There is a question now being asked: What is the most
desirable asset? People are rethinking their positions, but it does
not reflect any change in fundamentals in the market. The economy
has not changed except to slow slightly.''

U.S. AGREES TO $1.9M SETTLEMENT IN SHOOTING OF YOUNG TEXAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The federal government will pay $1.9 million to
the parents of a young Texan who was shot and killed last year by a
Marine assigned to an anti-drug patrol near the Rio Grande, the
family's lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, was killed May 20, 1997, by Cpl.
Clemente Banuelos, who was leading a four-man patrol on the edge of
Redford, a remote West Texas village of mostly adobe and
cinderblock shacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosendo Ibaro, a friend of the Hernandez family, said the
out-of-court deal was tantamount to an admission of guilt by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they are offering money, that means they were
automatically liable. That's the way I see it,'' said Ibaro, who
drove the school bus that Hernandez rode to daily.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Watney, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said
the government didn't admit any wrongdoing in the settlement and
that privacy laws prevented her from discussing details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can confirm is that there was a settlement,''
Watney said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that would adequately compensate the family
for the loss they have suffered,'' said Bill Weinacht, a Pecos
lawyer who represented the Hernandez family in its pursuit of a
wrongful death lawsuit against the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Weinacht said the settlement involves structured payments from
the Justice Department and the Navy Department, which includes the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Marine officials from the start said the Marines acted properly.
Banuelos, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in June,
shot Hernandez once in the ribcage with an M-16 rifle after
Hernandez fired twice at the Marines with a .22-caliber rifle and
aimed the weapon a third time.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines were working in conjunction with the U.S. Border
Patrol on a mission to gather intelligence on drug traffickers
operating in the vicinity of Redford at a crossing area known as El
Polvo, or the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Hernandez family have said the young man likely
thought the camouflaged soldiers were wild animals or may have been
shooting at rocks as he tended the family goats. He carried the
rifle to protect the goats.
</P>
<P>
   The incident sparked a national debate about the use of the
military to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question problems occurred,'' Weinacht said of the
incident. ``They (the Marines) certainly need to alter their
procedures to better protect the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grand jurors who deliberated Tuesday in nearby Marfa
declined to indict Banuelos after considering charges of murder,
manslaughter and deadly conduct, said Albert Valadez, the district
attorney in Presidio County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them (jurors) to consider murder because of the
statement by Banuelos that he shot to kill,'' Valadez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the grand jury would reach a different decision, but
I was wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Presidio County grand jury that met last year also did not
charge any of the Marines in the case, but the matter was again
presented at the urging of federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Zimmermann, a retired Marine colonel who is representing
Banuelos, said that although his client committed no crime, the
Hernandez family deserved a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a humanitarian point of view, I thought there should be
some kind of compensation,'' Zimmermann said from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we need to let Clemente Banuelos know what he
did was what he was supposed to do and let it go,'' Zimmermann
said. ``Corporal Banuelos' actions were entirely justified under
the law and consistent with what he was trained to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has yet to decide whether to resume
anti-drug patrols along the border, and U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, who is head of the House subcommittee on immigration, is
investigating the shooting.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Figuring out how far Lynn Bartlett's erector-set grid
of sprinklers can reach as they pivot around his sun-cracked cotton
fields along the Salt Fork of the Red River is really not much of a
chore.
</P>
<P>
   The plants within the irrigated perimeter stand three or four
feet high, thick and bristling with moist green bolls of healthy
cotton, some of them as big as an apricot. Just beyond the water's
reach, though, the plants slouch only a foot above the scaly soil
and most have just two or three dusty bolls, none bigger than a
ping pong ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically burnt-up cotton,'' Bartlett said. ``We had a
good planting rain back in May, then a week or so later the tap
just shut off and it's been off ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   While many parts of the country, including the Northeast, are
suffering through dry months verging on drought, the situation is
particularly severe in Texas and Oklahoma. Just two years after a
drought ravished large swaths of the rich agricultural region, both
states are in the midst of a dry spell that officials say shows
signs of developing into the costliest and most devastating the
region has seen since the Dust Bowl years.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a corner of Texas that is not laboring under severe
or extreme drought conditions. President Clinton has declared each
of the state's 254 counties a federal disaster area, making farmers
eligible for low-interest loans. ``The crops have been lost, the
livestock has been liquidated and there's really no relief in
sight,'' said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry. ``I am
starting to hear reports that this is the worst ever.''
</P>
<P>
   During crucial growing weeks from April through June, Texas
received little measurable water at all. South Texas, which has
been hit hardest by the drought, received only 8 percent of its
normal precipitation, the citrus ranchlands of the Rio Grande
Valley only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma received only two-thirds of its normal rainfall from
June 1 to Aug. 1, and the southwestern corner of the state received
less than a third. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently
declared 66 of Oklahoma's 77 counties _ all but the northeast
corner of the state _ federal disaster areas, and state officials
are hearing the same sort of dire reports about the drought's
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of agribusiness if very much affected,'' said Oklahoma
Agriculture Commissioner Dennis Howard. ``The ag dollar goes around
Main Street six, seven, eight times, but it's not going around now,
because it's not there. Small town Oklahoma is really hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas and Oklahoma have changed a great deal since the Dust
Bowl years of the 1930s, growing more urban and more economically
diverse, particularly in the last two decades. So even though the
drought could have a ruinous effect on farmers, cattle ranchers,
small towns and agriculture-related businesses, it could well be
cushioned from leveling the overall economy of the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Washington, the U.S. Agriculture Department will
release its monthly crop report, estimating how many of the
country's planted acres will be worth harvesting and what they
might be expected to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not expected to be good for Texas or Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Already, officials in Texas have estimated that the drought will
cost farmers and ranchers $1.8 billion, and will result in a $4.9
billion drain on the state's overall economy. In Oklahoma,
officials last week predicted a total statewide cost of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But both Jared Hazelton, director of the Center for Business and
Economic Analysis at Texas A&AMP;M University, and Bernard Weinstein,
director of the Center for Economic Development at the University
of North Texas, have said that the drought will not have as dire an
effect as some are predicting. That is because, they say,
agriculture accounts for only about 1 percent of Texas' $641
billion economy, even though one of eight acres used for
agriculture in the nation is in Texas. ``The wonderful thing about
the growth in the '90s is it isn't tied to a single-sector
economy,'' Hazelton said. ``There is no dominant industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that while the drought will inevitably affect
prices at supermarkets all over the country, it is too early which
products will be affected and by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Oklahoma, where agriculture remains the state's leading
industry, the state's economy has thus far been able to withstand
the drought's impact. ``Now, thank goodness, Oklahoma's economy is
more diversified than it was,'' Howard said. ``The whole state
isn't being impacted like it was during the drought in 1982, when
we really went into a nosedive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without such a nosedive this year, agriculture officials
say, the drought will still be crushing to those corners of the
region where agriculture remains at the center of life. In rural
Texas and small town Oklahoma, they say, businesses will close,
tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, cattle herds will be
affected for years to come and nervous bankers will refuse to lend
money to more and more struggling farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In metropolitan cities, the impact will be felt in consumer
prices and in those businesses connected to agriculture,'' said
Carl Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&AMP;M. ``But the
real impact will be felt in smaller farm communities, and it's
going to be devastating. They're going to have problems collecting
taxes to keep open their schools. It's going to speed up the drying
up of these small, rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   A $500 million federal aid package is in a House-Senate
conference committee, but agriculture officials in Texas and
Oklahoma are complaining because half of that money is earmarked
for farmers in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Glickman told officials
during his recent swing through the region that he wanted the total
raised to $1 billion, maybe more.

</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma organized a Plains
States Rural Crisis Summit meeting meeting in Oklahoma City, where
he and the governors of three other states concerned about the
drought _ South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska _ adopted 22
emergency and long-term recommendations, including urging President
Clinton and Congress to act more quickly to pump drought relief
into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the Texas agriculture commissioner, is pushing a plan to
use some of Texas' budget surplus for a fund to provide aid during
natural disasters. But the Texas Legislature, which meets
biannually, is not scheduled to meet this year, so such a law could
not be passed until 1999 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Zybach raises cattle on 1,700 acres in southwestern
Oklahoma and across the Texas line. On his 900-acre ranch in
Oklahoma, he said, he would normally have 700 head of cattle at
this time of year. But last Friday, with no grass in the fields for
the cattle to eat and little hay available in the markets, Zybach
packed up four truckloads and sold them off, leaving him with only
50 or 60 cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no green grass at all,'' Zybach said. ``We're plum out
of green grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Feagley, manager of the Farmers Cooperative Society No. 1
in Wellington, Texas, said conditions were as bad in the Panhandle
as he had ever seen them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Feagley's business comes from the co-op's two cotton
gins. But this year, business has been so bad that the co-op is
trying to sell one gin. The co-op also provides a weighing service
for trucks full of cattle on their way to be sold. ``Normally,
you'd start getting the cattle trucks in September,'' Feagley said.
``But the ranchers are all out of grass out there, so they're
selling early. They have to. I weighed 12 trucks already today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Davis, an economist at the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service, estimates that Texas cattle ranchers have already lost
$451 million; $126 million from being forced to sell off their
herds early and $351 million from buying expensive feed in a vain
effort to keep the herds going. If there are no rains in August,
the year's loss figures could double, said Larry Boleman, a cattle
specialist at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, the story is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dry land cotton is gone,'' Howard said. ``Irrigated cotton is
very stressed. Much of it won't make it. The watermelon crop is
three-fourths off. The pecans, they're pretty well wiped out. Hay
crop is 70 or 80 percent off. The horticulture industry is feeling
it. People aren't buying shrubs and trees. If we don't get rain
very quickly, we are not going to have any wheat pasture this fall.
Corn is 80 or 90 percent gone. Soybeans are something like 70
percent gone. My dairy farmers tell me that because of their heat
the cows are just off their feed, off their milk and production is
down a third or a half. I know how the cows feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett walked through his field near the Salt and watched a
neighbor's tractor kick up reddish dust. ``I've heard of these
droughts, but I've never been through one,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   On his own dry land, Bartlett said, he would normally expect to
get 300 to 400 pounds of cotton per acre. This year, he will get
only 50 to 100. ``The irrigated cotton is close to normal,'' he
said, ``but it's costing me $50 more an acre in watering. That's an
expensive crop I've got in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well from now until the harvest, he expects to lose
about half of what he would have earned on a normal crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be a few less farmers around here next
season,'' Bartlett said. ``Who knows? I may be one of them.'' He
tossed a shriveled cotton boll back into a crusty furrow. ``No, I
don't really think so. I'll make it. But it all depends on how
understanding your banker is. The bankers have their rules and
regulations, too, I suppose. It's just life, I guess.''

PARCELLS ADDS SPICE TO JETS' QUARTERBACK CONTROVERSY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells can be a pleasant sort of
fellow, especially in commercials when he affects an almost jolly
air. And sometimes he is enigmatic, such as he was Tuesday. Or was
he?
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells, perhaps inadvertently, perhaps purposely, perhaps
innocently, added drama to the Jets' exhibition game against the
Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night _ if not to the entire Jets'
season. He said Tuesday there was ``a pretty good chance'' he would
start Vinny Testaverde at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Parcells also said, when asked about his starting
quarterback down the road, ``Nothing has changed in this
situation.'' That would seem to indicate that Glenn Foley is still
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision on who starts Saturday will be made on
Wednesday, after Parcells discusses it with his staff, he said. The
news, even though it was hardly official, seemed to rattle Foley
when reporters repeated it as he was leaving lunch. He is, after
all, the Jets' starting quarterback and was told by Parcells that
in the competition for the job, he gets ``the benefit of the
doubt.'' But suddenly, here were his freckles virtually draining
from his face as he tried to deal with the surprising news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that,'' he said. But then he quickly added,
minimizing the significance of it, ``It's just a rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone pointed out he didn't seem happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need reps with the first unit if he wants me to be the
starting quarterback,'' Foley responded. Foley speaks often about
how little work he has had over the years, first as a No. 3
quarterback, then as a backup, in a career hampered by shoulder and
knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was said to be at the dentist's at lunchtime, and was
not available for comment. Meanwhile, Foley, despite the look of
someone who had just had eight cavities filled, handled most of
snaps at Tuesday's workout, just as has done from the first day of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of camp, the 34-year-old Testaverde has seemed
sharper and looser than Foley, a gritty competitor who is a slow
summertime starter.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Eagles last Thursday in the Jets' exhibition
opener, Foley recovered from a stuttering opening quarter as he
completed five of his last six passes. The Jets scored 10 points in
his three possessions, while Testaverde helped generate 10 points
in the next four drives. Testaverde had an impressive scrambling
opening pass of 39 yards to Alex Van Dyke.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Parcells said of Testaverde, ``I think I've got to give
this guy a chance to play with the better guys, or the ones we
think are the better guys.'' He said he planned to play the first
unit almost the entire first half, which is more than he did last
week.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Parcells made it sound elemental: He wanted to
see Testaverde with the first-string offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you like to see Vinny with Keyshawn Johnson?'' the
coach asked rhetorically. ``With the Giants, I used to bring in
Phil Simms third. It would be Rutledge, Hostetler, Simms. I'm doing
it with a bunch of guys on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it never seems that simple with Parcells, who tries
to think of everything that can go wrong before he considers what
can go right. These could be some other reasons he is starting
Testaverde:
</P>
<P>
   _The Jets face the Ravens in Game 2 of the regular season. By
limiting Foley's appearance on Saturday, they will not get a chance
to become very familiar with him.
</P>
<P>
   _Perhaps he wants to raise Foley's aggression by creating a
virtual official competition.
</P>
<P>
   _He may want to be put Testaverde in a situation to pump him up.
Testaverde was cut by the Ravens, for whom he played the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   _He is preparing a quarterback shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Testaverde's father, Al, admitted he had mixed
emotions about his son starting this weekend. Al Testaverde has not
seen his son play in person since suffering a heart attack at a
game in Tampa Bay 10 years ago. Even when his son went to the Pro
Bowl in Hawaii two years ago, Al Testaverde went back to his hotel
on Waikiki Beach to watch the game on television. He is simply too
nervous at the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for Vinny,'' Al Testaverde said Tuesday. ``But it's
bad for me.''

<P>
   Speeding along at more than 100 mph, the millionaire adventurer
Steve Fossett on Tuesday became the first balloonist to cross the
South Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed the southern tip of Africa on his way eastward from
Argentina, Fossett clocked 5,000 miles _ one-fifth of the distance
he hopes to cover in the next two weeks to become the first
balloonist to circle the world nonstop. By coincidence, he
completed the South Atlantic leg of his flight on the 20th
anniversary of the first balloon crossing of the North Atlantic _ a
record achieved by the Double Eagle II, which was a larger balloon
flown by a crew of three.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett emulates the piloting style of Charles Lindbergh by
always flying alone and by carrying a bare minimum of equipment and
comforts.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday the 54-year-old commodities broker and sportsman,
who lives with his wife, Peggy, in Beaver Creek, Colo., began his
quest for ballooning glory and the $1 million Budweiser prize from
a stadium in Mendoza, Argentina. This is his fourth attempt at
circling the world; he already holds the world's ballooning
distance record of 10,360.61 miles for his flight in January 1997
from St. Louis to Nonkhar, India.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade at least a dozen attempts have been made by
balloonists from four countries to circle the earth _ all of them
in the Northern Hemisphere _ but all have fallen far short of the
goal. Besides the daunting technical and weather problems they
faced, the balloonists had to contend with the withholding of
overflight permission by various countries. China, Libya and Iraq,
among others, have thwarted balloon flights.
</P>
<P>
   By making his latest transglobal attempt in the Southern
Hemisphere, Fossett hopes to avoid political problems. The only
major land masses he expects to cover are South America, South
Africa and Australia. But the disadvantage of the southern route,
he said in an interview before starting his current flight, is that
a forced landing in the vast southern oceans, far from any shipping
route, ``would present serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett's Solo Spirit balloon, built by Cameron Balloons Ltd. in
Britain, has roughly twice the volume of helium lifting gas
(450,000 cubic feet) as did his previous balloons. This allows him
to carry much more propane fuel for burners that heat air and
provide supplementary lift at night, when the balloon loses
buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Fossett lifted off on Friday, a fire broke out
involving two of the craft's four burners, and his face was burned.
But he extinguished the flames and repaired one of the damaged
burners, so that three will be available for the rest of the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett's spokesmen at Washington University in St. Louis report
that although he is flying at 24,000 feet in an unpressurized
capsule, he is reasonably comfortable. The cabin temperature, which
on previous flights was below freezing, is about 60 degrees.
Fossett conditioned himself for the thin air of his trip by
sleeping each night during the past month in a low-pressure chamber
simulating high altitude.

 &HT;    Investors sift for clues amid market's rubble
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An agonizing waiting game is under way on Wall Street as
investors look for clues to how long the latest stock market
correction will last, and how bad it will get before it turns.
</P>
<P>
   In a report circulated by Prudential Securities to its offices
Tuesday, recently bearish technician Ralph Acampora said the bottom
``will be made in the October time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts prefer not to be pinned down to a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if this is a bear market or a normal bull market
correction,'' said Ricky T. Harrington of Interstate/Johnson Lane.
``A serious correction is certainly overdue. Or, the market could
go into another trading range.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market's longer-range future is fundamentally good, as
analysts generally contend, its near-term technical signals are
scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standout negative signal is the biggest divergence
(between big and small stocks) in years,'' said Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   He said stock market averages are being propped up by the
purchase of mostly blue chip stocks by mutual fund managers and
foreigners seeking a safe haven _ and that the indexes are
deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath a seemingly strong market you have a weak market,''
said Harrington, citing recent reports that as many as half of all
Nasdaq stocks and 30 percent of all New York Stock Exchange stocks
are down 30 percent or more from their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   As for fundamentals, he said the market is finally waking up to
the fact that Asia's economic crisis really is putting a dent in
U.S. corporate earnings, and that this will continue.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced the weakest market since 1994, when stocks
fell during a yearlong series of interest rate hikes by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's market looked for a while as though it would be a
repeat of a week ago, when the Dow lost 299.43 points, its third
worst one-day point loss.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Dow was down nearly 258 points, or 3 percent,
before a late rally trimmed the loss to 1.3 percent. Broader and
secondary market averages fell even more: the technology-loaded
Nasdaq composite by 2.5 percent and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller-capitalized stocks by 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame shrinking profit growth for the latest
correction, as double-digit earnings increases drop to low
single-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based First Call, which tracks earnings trends, said 89
percent of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies have released their most
recent quarterly earnings, and the average year-over-year gain is
2.3 percent. That's down from 3.8 percent in the first quarter and
11 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the excessive valuation of most stocks and you have
the seriousness of the latest correction, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify stocks selling at 28 times earnings,''
Georgia Tech's Fred C. Allvine said of the price-to-earnings ratio
of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a market of hot air that could drop 20 to 30
percent,'' said Allvine, director of Georgia Tech's Stock Market
Project. ``People need to protect their gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The best protection, according to some investment advisers, is
to adopt a longer-range strategy and stick to it even in a down
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming a strategy is in place, we think there are
opportunities here,'' said D. Ray Peebles, a portfolio manager at
Atlanta-based CornerCap Investment Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, ``there is a lot of hand-holding in this business,''
said Peebles. ``And we have done some hand-holding recently.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an investment strategy should be tailored to the
individual's goals and objectives, and change when those objectives
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not suggested an increase in cash holdings,'' said
Peebles of the portfolios under his firm's management. ``We stay
fully invested.''

NAIROBI INVESTIGATORS SEEK PIECES OF TRUCK THAT BORE BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (See related: AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-TANZANIA)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ U.S. agents began reconstructing hundreds of
pieces of vehicles blown apart by a powerful bomb at the U.S.
Embassy here on Friday, in a painstaking attempt to identify the
pickup truck that carried the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the grounds of a railroad company headquarters across
the street from the blast site, dozens of agents tagged parts and
arranged them in a circle. Kenyan police technicians in white lab
coats carried more canisters of debris from the blast site, which
the American experts sifted with rakes for metal parts.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents declined to comment on their investigation,
saying they had received orders from their superiors in Washington
not to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an official presence here,'' an FBI supervisor
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear the U.S. agents had in large part taken over
the investigation from the Kenyan police. The local Criminal
Investigations Division headquarters was swarming with U.S.
law-enforcement officials, who carried computers and other
sophisticated equipment into the building.
</P>
<P>
   At the blast site, the toll continued to rise as rescue workers
from Israel, France, the United States and Kenya continued to pull
bodies from the rubble of the seven-story Ufundi Cooperative
building. The building bore the brunt of the blast aimed at the
U.S. mission next door and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, more than 18 mangled bodies had been extracted
from the tons of concrete, bringing the death toll here to 217,
Kenyan authorities said. Many of the bodies were found in groups of
two or three. Some were too disfigured to be easily identified,
they said. Another 10 died in the embassy blast in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   As cranes and backhoes ate away at the mountain of rubble,
rescue workers said no one was believed to be left alive in either
the embassy or the Ufundi structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting down to the area now where we have uncovered
most of empty spaces and we are getting to compact rubble,'' Capt.
James Chinn of the Fairfax County, Va., Fire Department said.
``Chances are getting very slim of finding someone alive at this
point.'' Under a contract with the federal government, a special
county team is deployed in cases of disaster, including the
Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bomb detonated about 10:35 a.m. on Friday in a parking lot
behind the embassy. The lot is sandwiched between the five-story
mission, the seven-story Ufundi Cooperative Building and the
22-story Cooperative House.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of witnesses interviewed by the press and
investigators so far vary wildly in many details, but they agree on
a few key points.
</P>
<P>
   Most witnesses say a pickup with a covered flatbed made its way
past a flimsy crossing gate manned by the Cooperative Bank's
security guards. Then, according to most accounts, the pickup
approached the entrance ramp to the embassy's underground garage,
which was staffed by a Kenyan guard, and at least one man got out
of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is unclear. Some witnesses recall gunfire.
Others say the attacker hurled an explosive device at the embassy,
perhaps a grenade or some other small explosive intended to stun
the guards.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, a devastating explosion gutted the rear of
the embassy, leveled the Ufundi house and damaged buildings in a
200-yard radius, U.S. officials and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness surfaced on Tuesday at Kenyatta Hospital.
Douglas Sidialo, a 27-year-old car salesman who was blinded in the
blast, saw the pickup enter the parking lot through a gate normally
used as an exit.
</P>
<P>
   To Sidialo, was was sitting in his car in traffic, it appeared
the truck was trying to force its way through the gate into the
embassy parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the security officers at the American Embassy
retaliated,'' he said from his bed. ``I didn't exactly see the
retaliation, but I heard the gunshots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidialo said he saw a man in a blue uniform with a hand-held
radio walking calmly away from the pickup just before the
explosion. Then he lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Rhyl Jones, a British army engineer and explosives expert
who was one of the first to arrive on the scene, said the car
carried between 400 and 500 pounds of explosive, judging from the
destruction. The explosive appeared to be a commercial substance _
dynamite or a plastic explosive, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said most of the blast went upward but was bounced back
toward the embassy by the towering wall of the Cooperative House
building, whose structure withstood the shock wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cooperative building hadn't been there, there would
have been a bigger space for the blast to dissipate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the bombers managed to gain entrance to the underground
parking garage, he said, it would have devastated the embassy
building, killing most of the people inside it.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents would not comment on what their preliminary analysis
of forensic evidence has told them about the bomb. Nor would they
say what precisely they were looking for as they combed the site
for parts of cars.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the bomb experts working here were also involved in
the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, in which
168 people died.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, investigators discovered the axle of the rented
van that carried the bomb. The axle bore an identification number
that ended up being the crucial piece of information that led to an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The search for such evidence can take weeks or months, and none
of the law-enforcement officials on site are predicting a quick
solution to the puzzle. ``It is still early,'' one agent said, as
he returned to a hotel to get some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For Kenyans, the scale of the tragedy is beginning to sink in.
Some families have begun burying their dead, but there are scores
of bodies still lying unidentified in the morgue and the
authorities are inundated with requests from frantic people looking
for missing relatives, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a wounded nation,'' Charity Ngilu, an opposition
politician who visited the blast site, said. Hospitals have issued
appeals for blood for the wounded, and have collected thousands of
pints, which they say they are screening for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of hopelessness surrounded the collapsed Ufundi building
Tuesday as firefighters brought down body after body on canvas
stretchers. At 5 p.m., the people working on the top of the rubble
called for silence and used listening devices and a special
television camera on a long pole to check for signs of life inside
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   An expectant hush came over the site. After 20 minutes, the
people operating the listening equipment slumped in disappointment.
Someone shouted, ``Back to work!'' and the heavy machinery ground
into motion again.
</P>
<P>
   But some Kenyans refused to give up hope. Kibera Karima, a
47-year-old banker, waited all day on the edge of the wreckage of
the Ufundi building, where his daughter, Jacqueline, was attending
a secretarial college at the time of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping against hope that by some miracle from God, that
somehow I'm going to see her rise up wherever she is,'' he said.
``I've been here since yesterday afternoon. I spent the night here.
A vigil for my daughter.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and state agencies announced Tuesday that
they are targeting companies that use the glamour of movies and
television to entice people into investing in fake money-making
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which consists of state regulators, said they have
filed 60 lawsuits against allegedly phony entertainment and
media-related investment companies in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, FTC consumer protection director, said false
promotions by the companies being sued have led to losses of about
$100 million for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showbiz schemes have enormous appeal,'' she said at a news
conference. ``They play on the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies targeted in the suits filed in U.S. District
Courts around the country include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Automated Systems &AMP; Concepts International Inc. of Los
Angeles. The FTC accused the company on Aug. 5 of selling $10,000
investments in the production of ``infomercials'' that would offer
packages such as an Elvis Presley coffee-table book, an Elvis CD
and Elvis postage stamps for sale. The scheme raised about $12
million, the agency charged. It said the company falsely claimed
that parts of the package were being considered for official
sanction by Graceland, which controls Presley products, and that
the infomercial would air on the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   _ World Interactive Gaming Corp. of Bohemia, N.Y. The FTC said
that the firm told people their $10,000 investment in an Internet
gambling casino would earn them $150,000 in one year. The FTC said
in a lawsuit filed Monday that the company had raised $2 million
from about 200 investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ My Pet TV of Los Angeles. According to the FTC, promoters
allegedly told investors they could make large profits from a cable
TV network for children. But the network never got off the ground.
According to an FTC suit filed last Friday, the company transferred
funds from the children's network without telling the investors and
used the money to start a cable network devoted to pet programming
that never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the companies could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles Hammond, 43, a shipyard manager
from Greene, Maine, said he invested $20,000 in the children's
network in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material ``was so professionally done and so
well laid out with the list of people that were going to produce
and direct,'' he said. ``It seemed so legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, the company told him he owned part of a new
cable network that was called ``My Pet TV.'' By the end of last
year, Hammond said, he realized he had lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cooke, 58, a retired aerospace engineer from Vienna, Va.,
said he was caught in a movie production scheme two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Desert Gold Partners Company, based in several
California cities, told him he could buy shares in a nonviolent
action movie to be called ``Operation: Desert Gold.'' He said he
checked with Better Business Bureaus in San Diego, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Calif., to ensure that the firm was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done as much homework as I normally do on an
investment,'' he said, adding that he thought the movie was being
made even though production was slow. But a year later, Cooke said,
he was shocked to learn that the firm had shut down and its assets
had been frozen. He said he doesn't expect to get his $20,000
investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, said Desert Gold
raised $8 million from about 600 investors. The agency sued
officials of the firm Tuesday morning just hours before the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he said, there is no movie and all of the money has
been spent.

</P>
<P>
   Officials from the companies could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles Hammond, 43, a shipyard manager
from Greene, Maine, said he invested $20,000 in the children's
network in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material ``was so professionally done and so
well laid out with the list of people that were going to produce
and direct,'' he said. ``It seemed so legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, the company told him he owned part of a new
cable network that was called ``My Pet TV.'' By the end of last
year, Hammond said, he realized he had lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cooke, 58, a retired aerospace engineer from Vienna, Va.,
said he was caught in a movie production scheme two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Desert Gold Partners Company, based in several
California cities, told him he could buy shares in a nonviolent
action movie to be called ``Operation: Desert Gold.'' He said he
checked with Better Business Bureaus in San Diego, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Calif., to ensure that the firm was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done as much homework as I normally do on an
investment,'' he said, adding that he thought the movie was being
made even though production was slow. But a year later, Cooke said,
he was shocked to learn that the firm had shut down and its assets
had been frozen. He said he doesn't expect to get his $20,000
investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, said Desert Gold
raised $8 million from about 600 investors. The agency sued
officials of the firm Tuesday morning just hours before the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he said, there is no movie and all of the money has
been spent.

PRIVACY A CONCERN AS MEDICAL INDUSTRY TURNS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Yarden, a Manhattan musician, recently received a letter
from a doctor asking him to press his health plan to pay an
outstanding bill. By going to the insurer's World Wide Web site,
Yarden could review the payments to his doctors, saving time on the
phone for both himself and the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by the soaring popularity of the Internet, plus the
shifting economics of health care, the medical industry is rapidly
going online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is already a popular place to search for general
information about medicines and treatments, but now a growing
number of insurers and doctors are also using it to provide members
and patients with personal medical information, from lab results to
payment records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential revolution'' is brewing in ``how the consumer
interacts with the health plan and, down the road in a different
way, with the providers of care,'' said Jim Hudak, a managing
partner with Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   And Yarden, who describes himself as a ``big online user,'' said
he hoped that what was available now would be only the beginning.
``They should be offering a lot more information,'' he said, ``like
the doctor's diagnosis and prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has the potential to be a huge benefit for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies, who can become bogged down in
mountains of paperwork and, when seeking information, often face
clogged phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raises serious questions about the privacy of such
highly personal information wafting about the digital world. A
person with AIDS, for instance, might not want his employer to
know, and a politician or an executive up for a promotion might
want to keep a serious illness secret.
</P>
<P>
   The issue thus fits squarely into the broader debate about
privacy and security on the Internet, whether it involves
protecting credit card numbers or keeping children from offensive
information.
</P>
<P>
   For while the variety of Internet offerings has exploded,
privacy has limped far behind. Medical privacy was a factor
recently when the White House backed away from the idea of
assigning every American a medical identification number. The
notion was shelved, the administration said, until Congress passes
legislation to protect patient privacy. The current version of that
bill has faced criticism for not going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yarden said the privacy issue ``doesn't worry me,'' adding, ``I
change my passwords regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Haberman, who works at the National Library of Medicine,
noted, ``If you pay a doctor on your credit card, your privacy is
gone right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Donald Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical
Association, is skeptical. ``If vandals can break into a CIA Web
site,'' he said, ``it doesn't make the AMA feel real secure that
some vandals won't break into a health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies say that they are eager to safeguard
members' privacy and that their security systems can protect the
electronic information, sometimes more effectively than with paper
records.
</P>
<P>
   One Blue Cross plan even invites subscribers to dial in tips
when they suspect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Kaiser Permanente health plan says it will
provide laboratory results next year to patients over the Internet
using a personal identification number. Oxford Health Plans has
similar safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continually walking a very fine line'' between
preserving the confidentiality of patient records and using the
information to improve care, said Aetna Inc. chief executive
Richard Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Its subsidiary, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, says it hopes to have ``a
significant percentage'' of information for consumers on the
Internet soon, including benefits data, the status of claims and a
way to get approval for referrals to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp. said it also planned to test an Internet
project in October, though it gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, for their part, are starting to exchange messages,
typically about nonurgent matters, with patients in remote areas
and computer-savvy patients everywhere who are willing to risk
having some hacker eavesdrop on their cholesterol reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Tang, an internist and researcher at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said he often received e-mail from
patients telling how their blood pressure or allergy medicine was
working or describing symptoms and asking whether they should come
to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of my patients would rather have
communications with me any time of day or night,'' he said,
``rather than worry about the small risk that someone would
intercept any message.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians at Columbia University are testing an electronic
program that will allow patients with chronic diseases like asthma
and diabetes to see and add to their medical records. They type in
an identification number displayed on a card that resembles a
smarter version of an ATM card. A machine receives and
automatically verifies the number, which changes every 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to prove that there are big benefits'' to the
patients by involving them more deeply in their treatment, said
Paul Clayton, chairman of the department dealing with computerized
medical information at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Half the respondents to a survey in Boston said they would be
interested in communicating with their doctors by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This could pose hazards for the doctor. Michael Ackerman, who
directs computer research contracts for the National Library of
Medicine, said he had heard warnings from ``malpractice insurance
persons that a written document by a doctor might show up in a
court and bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the same could be said of a tape of a doctor's
advice by telephone. ``How far are you going to push this
stupidity?'' he said, expressing exasperation at the intrusion of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a big Massachusetts-based health
plan, said it was planning ``a secure Web site'' in response to
members' requests for Internet programs to obtain lab results,
appointments with doctors and prescription drug renewals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Cochran, an associate medical director at Harvard
Pilgrim, agreed that ``computers have both benefits and risks.'' He
added, ``we're not going to jump into'' online services to patients
until other plans get more experience.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim was severely criticized three years ago when it
became known that the records of members with mental health
problems were widely available to general practitioners. ``We
learned a lot about patient confidentiality from that,'' Cochran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most health plans already have Web pages that provide lists of
doctors and hospitals in their networks, and information about
staying well. But some plans began to require a password for a look
at their lists after they learned that rival insurers were snooping
and recruiting their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey even provides street
maps showing the primary-care doctor closest to the member. Members
of all Blue Cross plans can dial up a list of participating
hospitals in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A few plans, like Health Partners in Minnesota and Blue Shield
of California, let employers and insurance agents enroll members
over the Internet. Blue Shield also has contracts with 18
California companies with 9,000 employees who can select their type
of coverage and physicians over an encryption-protected Internet
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between security and
confidentiality,'' said A.G. Breitenstein, director of the Health
Law Institute, a private nonprofit research center in Boston. ``The
salient question is: How many people other than the Kaiser member
have access to that lab result?''
</P>
<P>
   Information about prescription drugs that may indicate a patient
has the virus that causes AIDS or suffers from depression or male
impotence is ``bought, sold, disseminated and researched on, all
without the patient's consent or knowledge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association says patients have a basic
right to the privacy of their medical information and records, a
right that ``should be honored unless waived by the patient,''
Palmisano said.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for individuals worried about privacy to avoid
seeing a doctor who would take notes on their condition. Others pay
out of their own pocket for psychotherapy, for example, rather than
risk having their insurers or employers know of their problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a rigorous requirement for individual consent
could cripple the work of epidemiological researchers, who scan
thousands of patient records seeking patterns to explain diseases
like cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is always an issue,'' said Jay Silverstein, chief
marketing officer of Oxford. ``We're not in the business of
collecting medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said that in a test over several months experts from the
International Computer Security Association had tried
unsuccessfully to breach its privacy safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaiser, strategic development manager Tim Kieschnick said his
employees were using industry standards similar to those used in
online banking to encrypt exchanges between Kaiser and the member.
``We are satisfied with it and still improving it,'' he said,
though adding that there is always more to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fear is that the Internet, which attracts millions
of curious cybersurfers every day, could be a breeding ground for
horror stories similar to those involving computerized medical
records at hospitals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Country singer Tammy Wynette was outraged to find her medical
records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center reported
in two supermarket tabloids. She sued the papers, The National
Enquirer and The Star, for invasion of privacy, and the case was
settled _ no terms were disclosed _ shortly before she died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass., complained before he died
last year that an insurer had used his computerized medical records
without his permission in a training program.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., testified at a Senate hearing
that records of her treatment several years ago at St. Clare's
Hospital in Manhattan, following a suicide attempt, were leaked to
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of bribing hospital employees to get
to the records,'' said Alan Westin, a legal scholar and privacy
expert. Even before electronic communication, he said, such records
had been misused by blackmailers, to discredit rival executives for
promotions and by neighbors in personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have adequate security for access to Internet
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts on privacy issues warned that a determined
hacker could probably get into protected records. But several
privacy specialists said that most interlopers would have little
interest in medical insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is
``a lot less than for banks,'' said Clayton, at Columbia. ``A
hacker in Holland probably wouldn't gain any economic benefit from
knowing that my syphilis test was positive,'' he said.

ISRAEL REMOVES ROADBLOCK TO TREATY ON NUCLEAR MATERIAL

 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Bowing to American pressure, Israel announced
Tuesday that it would not block the next step in a U.N. effort to
draft an international treaty that would halt the production of the
fissile materials used to make nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The move followed similar reversals by India and Pakistan, and
it opened the way to international negotiations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel, thought to be the world's last remaining undeclared
nuclear power, tempered its announcement by making clear that it
still has deep misgivings about signing such a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement said that prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had told the United States that Israel still had
``fundamental problems'' with the very idea of halting production
of plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the fissile materials, as
the United States first proposed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, India and Pakistan had been major obstacles to
the American plan, which is seen by proponents as an important step
toward halting the spread of nuclear weapons. But both countries
shifted course in an effort to win back good favor after their
nuclear weapons tests this spring and the worldwide condemnation
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   That had left Israel as the lone holdout within the 61-member
U.N. Conference on Disarmament. President Clinton, in a letter on
Aug. 9, urged Netanyahu to support at least the formation of a
committee that would begin to formulate a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity for years,
refusing to confirm or deny reports that it has up to 300 nuclear
weapons. It has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and has never permitted international inspectors to visit its
top-secret nuclear reactor in Diomona, which was built with French
assistance in the 1950s and is believed to be an atomic bomb
factory.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the disarmament conference, a permanent committee
of the United Nations that is based in Geneva, require unanimous
approval. And so Israeli opposition could have proved fatal to the
American plan. The qualified OK that Netanyahu issued Tuesday may
well insulate his government from what could have been a torrent of
international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The careful language of the Israeli announcement seemed to
suggest that Netanyahu had made his decision grudgingly and that
the government was in no way eager to embrace any treaty that could
limit Israel's suspected nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The statement quoted Netanyahu as telling his Cabinet at a
meeting Tuesday morning that Israel had ``made it clear that our
support for the establishment of the committee does not indicate
that we are taking a position on the treaty and its contents.'' It
also quoted him as saying that Israel had told the United States
that Israel ``has its own considerations, which are unique to its
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli envoy, Yosef Lamdan, conveyed Israel's decision to
the headquarters of the disarmament conference in Geneva Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, following Israel's action, the conference agreed to
form the special committee, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until now, the United States has for the most part gone along
with Israel's artifice about its nuclear program, choosing not to
confront it over the issue of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But that stance has prompted increasing complaints from Arab
countries, who see it as evidence of an American double standard,
particularly when compared with the hard line that Washington has
drawn against suspected efforts by Iraq and Libya to acquire
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official who described Clinton's Aug. 9 letter to
Netanyahu would not characterize its tone. But the official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was merely the latest
in a series of American messages _ including a telephone call from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Netanyahu last week _
urging Israel not to stand in the way of the next step toward the
proposed treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty halting the production of fissile materials is not
likely to affect nuclear stockpiles already in place, meaning that
Israel might sign such an accord without relinquishing its option
to use nuclear weapons. But such a treaty would also require
countries to open weapons facilities to inspection, something that
Israel is plainly not eager to do.

RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC WOES GROW AS STOCKS AND BONDS REACH RECORD LOWS 
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW _ Russia's markets were swept along in a global economic
downdraft on Tuesday. By the end of the day's trading, stocks and
government bonds were selling at near-historic lows _ that is, even
lower than on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned whether the Russians, already embarked
on an all-out effort to avert bankruptcy, would be able to rebuild
the confidence of world financial markets, which seem to have
written them off.
</P>
<P>
   The main index of Russian stocks fell 9.11 percent, nearly as
great a decline as Monday, to its lowest level since May 1996.
Bonds fared even worse, with the bond issues created when old
Soviet-era debt was repackaged after the fall of communism falling
to their lowest prices ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ruble, continuing its rise, edged close to an
exchange rate of 6.3 a dollar, above the informal trading range the
government has said it wants to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates on the Russian equivalent of U.S. Treasury bills
approached 80 percent for three-month maturities and 140 percent
for nine-month maturities.
</P>
<P>
   Those levels have not been seen since early July, before the
International Monetary Fund assembled a $22.6-billion loan package
that was supposed to calm investors' fears about Russian financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
   The loan package clearly bought the government several months to
improve its fiscal condition, but it has not brought calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collapse in confidence about the Russian government's
ability to fund itself,'' said Charles Blitzer, a former World Bank
official and director of emerging markets research in London for
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. ``Russian debt is priced at
default levels, though I frankly think that the prospect that the
government would default is minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many analysts say that the problems in the Russian
market stem as much from the global economic situation as from any
domestic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The price of oil, one of Russia's principal commodities and a
major source of tax revenue, has been hovering around 10-year lows,
and the government said the value of oil exports in the first half
of 1998 had decreased 46 percent from 1997. Most emerging markets
in Asia and Europe absorbed major blows from the decline of the
Japanese yen, which has raised fears of currency devaluations in
China and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But if that is comforting, it does not make the Russians'
situation any better. As investors lose confidence for whatever
reason, the price of borrowing goes up and foreign investment in
the economy goes down _ developments the nation's financial leaders
can ill afford.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Blitzer said the government appeared to be doing a credible job
of carrying out the terms of the IMF loan package of early July _
terms that included a thorough overhaul of the government's
convoluted tax policies and an increase in tax collections. But he
added that the government has has not been clear and unwavering in
carrying out some of its plans.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, the government has wavered in its plans
for selling new debt issues, changing both the amount and
scheduling of debt packages at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   The government also has not said how it intends to prevent a
devaluation of the ruble. Defending the ruble takes money, and even
sanguine analysts say the government needs all the money it has _
and more _ just to meet domestic expenses and interest payments on
its ever-growing debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government said on Tuesday that it had spent 10.9 percent of
its consolidated revenue in the first three months of 1998 for
interest payments on foreign debt, up from 7.9 percent in the same
period last year. The treasury needs to issue more debt to meet
those payments and other expenses, but the government decided last
week to call off any more debt sales this month. Demand was so low
_ and therefore, interest rates would have been so high _ that
further auctions did not make sense, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials issued a flurry of statements on Tuesday in an
attempt to persuade investors that the nose dives in the markets
did not merit a panic.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said Russia's finances would
be stable this month because ``all commitments are financed from
sources that are absolutely clear.'' Nor would it make any sense to
try new fiscal tacks to rally the markets, he said, ``because most
investors are vacationing and so new tools would not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, experts said on Tuesday night that the United
States had dispatched its senior expert on the Russian fiscal
crisis, Deputy Undersecretary of the Treasury David Lipton, to
Moscow to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings, scheduled before the latest break in investor
confidence, are part of a series of bilateral consultations to
determine the progress of reforms that the Yeltsin government
promised in mid-July in return for the bail-out.

NO HELP FOR LEARNING DISABLED ON WELFARE, SUIT CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hilda Ramos of New Bedford wanted to do well in the GED
program, but she usually got everything wrong and left the class in
tears. Now she frequently plays computer games in class instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ateefeewawa Pereira of Boston also has had difficulty earning a
general equivalency diploma, bouncing through three programs in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The issue facing the two women, both single mothers on welfare,
is not that they are unable to learn, but that they have
substantial learning disabilities that state welfare officials are
failing to accommodate, according to the women's attorney, Ruth
Bourquin of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, 30, is mildly retarded and has dysgraphia, a writing and
spelling &UR;  &LR; disorder, while Pereira, 20, has dyslexia. The
class-action lawsuit they have filed is being closely watched by
welfare officials in other states and in the disability community.
In it, they charge that Transitional Assistance Commissioner Claire
McIntire has effectively deprived welfare recipients with learning
disabilities of equal access to job training and education programs
that could help them get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Powers, Department of Transitional Assistance spokesman,
countered that welfare officials have only $25 million for
employment training and education programs and that priority should
be given to recipients who are subject to work requirements and
time limits.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who also suffers depression, received a disability
exemption from those rules. And if recent studies in other states
are any indication, the number of welfare recipients with
disabilities are considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon-to-be-released results of a three-year pilot study found
that 44 percent of nearly 700 welfare recipients in Washington who
were tested had learning disabilities, said Melinda Giovengo, a
coauthor of the study. In a smaller study in Kansas, 30 percent of
89 welfare recipients tested were found to have learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Young of the National Institute for Literacy said the
findings show that many women went through public school systems
without being diagnosed and have ended up on welfare because the
early misconception had been that boys, who tended to act out and
been more verbal, were more apt to have learning disabilities than
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls tend to be more hypershy and quiet,'' said Young. ``So
girls tend to get socially passed along to the point where they
can't hide it anymore, and they tend to drop out and blame
themselves because they are told they are lazy, stupid, and
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, essentially, is what happened to Ramos. Apparently never
diagnosed as learning disabled while attending New York public
schools, she recalled dropping out of the 10th grade after the high
school principal told her the school couldn't do anything for her.
</P>
<P>
   But states' response to the growing evidence of the link between
learning disabilities and welfare dependency, Giovengo said, should
not be to grant more recipients exemptions from welfare-to-work
rules. Instead, states should find ways to help them learn and
succeed in spite of their disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been exempted all their lives,'' she said. ``We have
tossed them to the bottom of the food chain because they can't do
what we expect them. But these people have abilities. Why waste
human potential?''

RESEARCHERS URGE TWICE-A-YEAR STD SCREENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A Baltimore study showing almost one-third of sexually active
teenaged girls to be infected with chlamydia has prompted the
researchers to call for screening every six months instead of once
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chlamydia has no symptoms in up to 70 percent of cases, but is
the leading preventable cause of female infertility and painful
pelvic inflammatory disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current Journal of the American
Medical Association, found the highest rate of chlamydia infections
_ 33.5 percent _ in 14-year-olds. Overall, of the more than 3,000
teenaged girls aged 12 to 19 in the study 29.1 percent tested
positive at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Many girls were tested more than once over the 33 months ending
September 1996. About 20 percent of all tests were positive.
</P>
<P>
   The study found no correlation between chlamydia infections
among the teens and known risk factors such as multiple sex
partners or prior history of a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to screen everyone under age 20,'' said lead author
Dr. Gale Burstein of the department of molecular microbiology and
immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``We could not
use any of the (risk-factor) variables to decide who to screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Screening every six months would allow for the detection and
treatment of new infections before they inflame and scar the
uterus, causing infertility, said Burstein.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial said the screening suggestion made
sense, but questioned whether parents, doctors, teens and insurers
would accept that.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently
recommends testing all sexually active teens for chlamydia whenever
they undergo a pelvic examination. Current guidelines recommend an
annual chlamydia screening for those at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Study author Dr. Thomas Quinn of the division of infectious
diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said new urine
tests make more frequent screening easy to do in schools and
communities. He cited studies that show it is cost-effective
whenever chlamydia incidence rises above 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts public health officials reported that chlamydia
cases rose 8 percent last year over the year before. In 1997, 7,330
cases were reported, far below the peak level in 1989 of 10,131.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eight percent increase we're seeing is a result of better
tests,'' Dr. Paul Etkind, director of STD prevention for the
Department of Public Health, said. ``There's more intensive
screening going on in family planning and STD clinics and more
education.``
</P>
<P>
   New tests can now detect infections with as few as 10 bacteria
in a vaginal or urine sample instead of the 10,000 that were needed
before, he said. Some areas, he added, are showing rates of 5
percent to 9 percent, double their previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Baltimore study was conducted among inner city
youths, the researchers said the disease is common among all
population groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlamydia is the most common STD,'' Quinn said. ``If you've
got activity, you're going to find chlamydia. It's not going to go
away until you do this screening.''

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CRACK DOWN ON ENTERTAINMENT INVESTMENT SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and state agencies announced Tuesday that
they are targeting companies that use the glamour of movies and
television to entice people into investing in fake money-making
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which consists of state regulators, said they have
filed 60 lawsuits against allegedly phony entertainment and
media-related investment companies in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, FTC consumer protection director, said false
promotions by the companies being sued have led to losses of about
$100 million for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showbiz schemes have enormous appeal,'' she said at a news
conference. ``They play on the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies targeted in the suits filed in U.S. District
Courts around the country include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Automated Systems &AMP; Concepts International Inc. of Los
Angeles. The FTC accused the company on Aug. 5 of selling $10,000
investments in the production of ``infomercials'' that would offer
packages such as an Elvis Presley coffee-table book, an Elvis CD
and Elvis postage stamps for sale. The scheme raised about $12
million, the agency charged. It said the company falsely claimed
that parts of the package were being considered for official
sanction by Graceland, which controls Presley products, and that
the infomercial would air on the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   _ World Interactive Gaming Corp. of Bohemia, N.Y. The FTC said
that the firm told people their $10,000 investment in an Internet
gambling casino would earn them $150,000 in one year. The FTC said
in a lawsuit filed Monday that the company had raised $2 million
from about 200 investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ My Pet TV of Los Angeles. According to the FTC, promoters
allegedly told investors they could make large profits from a cable
TV network for children. But the network never got off the ground.
According to an FTC suit filed last Friday, the company transferred
funds from the children's network without telling the investors and
used the money to start a cable network devoted to pet programming
that never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the companies could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles Hammond, 43, a shipyard manager
from Greene, Maine, said he invested $20,000 in the children's
network in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material ``was so professionally done and so
well laid out with the list of people that were going to produce
and direct,'' he said. ``It seemed so legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, the company told him he owned part of a new
cable network that was called ``My Pet TV.'' By the end of last
year, Hammond said, he realized he had lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cooke, 58, a retired aerospace engineer from Vienna, Va.,
said he was caught in a movie production scheme two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Desert Gold Partners Company, based in several
California cities, told him he could buy shares in a nonviolent
action movie to be called ``Operation: Desert Gold.'' He said he
checked with Better Business Bureaus in San Diego, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Calif., to ensure that the firm was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done as much homework as I normally do on an
investment,'' he said, adding that he thought the movie was being
made even though production was slow. But a year later, Cooke said,
he was shocked to learn that the firm had shut down and its assets
had been frozen. He said he doesn't expect to get his $20,000
investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, said Desert Gold
raised $8 million from about 600 investors. The agency sued
officials of the firm Tuesday morning just hours before the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he said, there is no movie and all of the money has
been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a Desert Gold official in San Francisco were
unsuccessful.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It's not easy to get fiscal respect when your national
currency is nicknamed the bunny, as in ``That will be 500,000
bunnies, madam. Cash or check?'' But in Russia's westerly neighbor
Belarus, where the bunny is king, appellation is the least of the
economic worries.
</P>
<P>
   The Belarussian ruble _ called the zaichik, or little hare,
after the engraving that is its main feature _ has lost half its
worth in five months, and more than 10 percent in the last week
alone. International lending agencies all but wrote off the economy
last spring. Foreign investors have been packing up and leaving for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the government has announced a new and perhaps
unintentionally revealing plan to shore up the ruble's value:
starting next week, the country will no longer accept its own
currency as payment for exports.
</P>
<P>
   That will keep outsiders from pumping more rubles into an
economy already flooded with so many that the currency is
essentially worthless. But outside experts say it will not solve
the real problem: the Belarus government, which controls most of
the country's industry and the prices of most goods, insists on
printing more and more rubles whenever it runs short of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The latest plunge in the ruble's value occurred after the
nation's autocratic and eccentric president, Alexander Lukashenko,
said the government would issue more bunnies to pay for the fall
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Its currency aside, Belarus is not the sort of place these days
that brings to mind fields of cuddly cottontails. Lukashenko is
that rare leader who openly longs for a return to the Soviet
Union's glory days, and he brooks little dissent. Personal and
press freedoms are sharply limited, and the country's human rights
record has come under growing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are not spared. This summer, Lukashenko
evicted many foreign diplomats from their residences, and even one
Belarus public servant who criticized the country's fiscal policy
quickly found herself jobless and in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another blip in what's become a long, slippery
slope,'' said an official of one international lending agency in
the Belarus capital of Minsk. ``They control prices while they push
up the money supply,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified. ``The two actions are incompatible, and the result is
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, inflation is no problem in Belarus. The official
exchange rate is about 41,000 rubles to the dollar. But there are
at least three other less official exchange rates, up to and
including the black-market rate, which now hovers around 85,000
rubles per dollar, and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, prices in Belarus are officially stable, a result of
government decrees capping them. But unofficially, prices are
edging up by 3 or 4 percent a month. Some sellers evade the decrees
by reissuing their price-controlled goods under new names. Others
sell goods on the black market or in open-air markets that are hard
to patrol.
</P>
<P>
   One result is hardship. Inflation gnaws at the average worker's
take-home pay of $50 to $100 a month; pensions are even smaller.
Another is isolation. Foreign companies, especially Western ones,
have slashed their investments in Belarus. Motorola abandoned a
semiconductor-manufacturing venture in May, and a Western maker of
television picture tubes pulled out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Belarus' foreign trade is now conducted with
Russia, and even there, much of the trade takes the form of barter
rather than using hard-to-get cash. Only last week, according to
news reports, Belarus agreed to pay Russia's natural-gas monopoly,
Gazprom, $300 million in refrigerators, tractors and other hard
goods to settle a longstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Belarus government can give away tractors because it
dominates some 90 percent of the nation's industrial base.
Conveniently lodged between western Russia and Poland, Belarus was
something of an industrial powerhouse in the old Soviet era,
shipping television sets, farm implements, cars, textiles and
machinery both westward to Moscow and to the old Warsaw Pact
nations of eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko's policy has been to keep state control of industries
while allowing them to react somewhat to the forces of capitalism _
``market socialism,'' as his government calls it. According to
government statistics, it has worked: The nation's gross domestic
product leaped 11 percent last year, and exports swelled by 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, so did inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To boost production, they have to pay salaries,'' said Mikhail
Seleznev, a Belarus native and an investment analyst for United
Financial Group, in Moscow. ``And to pay salaries, they simply
print money. The local currency is being printed whenever they need
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the exception of the construction of a gas pipeline
traversing the country, foreign investment has dwindled. And
because the government requires companies to convert much of their
foreign-trade receipts into zaichiks _ at the government's
artificially low rate _ exporters have become money-losers as well,
too poor to modernize or innovate.
</P>
<P>
   The government has periodically tried to stabilize the ruble,
withdrawing from currency trading in Moscow and plugging a loophole
that had allowed currency traders to exchange bunnies for Ukrainian
gryvnias. On July 8, it outlawed the private purchase of foreign
currency from nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   The latest demand, that all exports be sold for hard currency,
clamps another control on the wobbly zaichik. And Lukashenko's
government brags, with some justification, that a strong hand has
avoided the wild swings from fiscal crisis to crisis that have
marked Russia's blind leap into capitalism. To which Western
experts reply: At least Russia swings upward once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belarus is just using up whatever capacity they have as a
result of the Soviet breakup,'' said the international lending
officer. ``There's no new equipment; no new production; no new
capacity. As long as they can keep effective controls on the
markets and banks, they'll just slowly run downhill.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and state agencies announced Tuesday that
they are targeting companies that use the glamour of movies and
television to entice people into investing in fake money-making
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which consists of state regulators, said they have
filed 60 lawsuits against allegedly phony entertainment and
media-related investment companies in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, FTC consumer protection director, said false
promotions by the companies being sued have led to losses of about
$100 million for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showbiz schemes have enormous appeal,'' she said at a news
conference. ``They play on the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies targeted in the suits filed in U.S. District
Courts around the country include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Automated Systems &AMP; Concepts International Inc. of Los
Angeles. The FTC accused the company on Aug. 5 of selling $10,000
investments in the production of ``infomercials'' that would offer
packages such as an Elvis Presley coffee-table book, an Elvis CD
and Elvis postage stamps for sale. The scheme raised about $12
million, the agency charged. It said the company falsely claimed
that parts of the package were being considered for official
sanction by Graceland, which controls Presley products, and that
the infomercial would air on the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   _ World Interactive Gaming Corp. of Bohemia, N.Y. The FTC said
that the firm told people their $10,000 investment in an Internet
gambling casino would earn them $150,000 in one year. The FTC said
in a lawsuit filed Monday that the company had raised $2 million
from about 200 investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ My Pet TV of Los Angeles. According to the FTC, promoters
allegedly told investors they could make large profits from a cable
TV network for children. But the network never got off the ground.
According to an FTC suit filed last Friday, the company transferred
funds from the children's network without telling the investors and
used the money to start a cable network devoted to pet programming
that never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the companies could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles Hammond, 43, a shipyard manager
from Greene, Maine, said he invested $20,000 in the children's
network in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material ``was so professionally done and so
well laid out with the list of people that were going to produce
and direct,'' he said. ``It seemed so legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, the company told him he owned part of a new
cable network that was called ``My Pet TV.'' By the end of last
year, Hammond said, he realized he had lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cooke, 58, a retired aerospace engineer from Vienna, Va.,
said he was caught in a movie production scheme two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Desert Gold Partners Company, based in several
California cities, told him he could buy shares in a nonviolent
action movie to be called ``Operation: Desert Gold.'' He said he
checked with Better Business Bureaus in San Diego, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Calif., to ensure that the firm was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done as much homework as I normally do on an
investment,'' he said, adding that he thought the movie was being
made even though production was slow. But a year later, Cooke said,
he was shocked to learn that the firm had shut down and its assets
had been frozen. He said he doesn't expect to get his $20,000
investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, said Desert Gold
raised $8 million from about 600 investors. The agency sued
officials of the firm Tuesday morning just hours before the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he said, there is no movie and all of the money has
been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a Desert Gold official in San Francisco were
unsuccessful.

VALENTIN MAKES SWEET MOVE FOR CANCER CHARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Valentin's Sweet Hits Candy may not sell like Baby
Ruth or Reggie! candy bars, but that hardly matters.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that the Red Sox third baseman is lending his
name and portrait to the New England Confectionery Company for a
new candy that could raise as much as $50,000 for the Jimmy Fund,
the charity that raises money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being a baseball player and being involved with the
Jimmy Fund for a while now, I really didn't think it would affect
me the way it has,'' Valentin said. ``When you meet these kids _
and having two of my own _ it's amazing how much life these kids
have even when they are so sick. It's just been an amazing
experience, and I am happy to do everything that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is marching in the footsteps of players such as Ted
Williams and Carl Yastrzemski who have been the Red Sox' main
spokesmen for the Jimmy Fund. Earlier this year, he reached an
agreement with NECCO, the country's oldest candy maker, to put his
portrait, a picture of him swinging the bat, and a copy of his
autograph on the box of a new product, NECCO Sweet Hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination, somewhere between the NECCO Wafers and our
Sweet Hearts product that sell so well around Valentine's Day,''
said Walter Marshall, NECCO's vice president for logistics and
planning. The candies also bear the printed words of baseball
jargon, including two that are particularly appropriate for
Valentin: ``third base'' and ``double.''
</P>
<P>
   NECCO will make no profit from the sale of the candy, and
Valentin will make no fee. Both will donate their proceeds to the
Jimmy Fund, according to spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said NECCO has purchased 1 million boxes for Sweet Hits
and plans to bring all of them to market. He expects that the
eventual contribution could be about $50,000 in NECCO's first
involvement with the Jimmy Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Hits should begin appearing this weekend at Stop &AMP; Shop,
Star Market, Demoulas, Shaws, Trucci's, Brooks, Bradlees, Osco,
Ro-jacks, Cost Plus, and Candy World &AMP; More _ and many of the
stores will mark the product with special displays.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said he became especially interested in the
fund-raising device after one of the many children he has visited
at the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana-Farber died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas Bartlett was just an amazing kid,'' Valentin said
Tuesday, the emotion welling in his voice. ``You know, he's gone
now, but he's always going to be with me. He was a friend of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox second baseman Mike Andrews, the chairman and
executive director of the Jimmy Fund, praised Valentin for his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that it is sometimes tough when they are playing
and they are so into their sport,'' Andrews said. ``But it's too
bad all ballplayers don't do what John has done.''

   EVER AFTER: A Cinderella Story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Dougray Scott, Jeanne Moreau,
Richard O'Brien &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Andy Tennant &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 119 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fairy godmother, the singing mice and the magic
pumpkin: Cinderella was a (italics)real person,(end italics) and
the grande dame (Ms. Moreau) who opens the story wastes no time in
scolding the Brothers Grimm for getting the tale all wrong. But the
main features of the story are actually intact.
</P>
<P>
   A freethinker long before her time, Danielle (Ms. Barrymore)
subtly and sweetly defies her stepmother (Ms. Huston) and
not-so-sweetly challenges the prince (Scott). Like her traditional
counterpart, she impersonates nobility as she sleeps among the
cinders; but only after she and the prince recognize themselves as
soul mates is the way cleared for the happy-ever-after ending. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None, though Danielle can be a swashbuckler with the
best of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;

<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 The film will be a bit long for restless children, but
the story may well entertain many of them because it's a familiar
one. Some may find a villainous landlord played by O'Brien very
scary, however. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-12 Children this age will take to the notion of
Cinderella as a real person, but the romantic theme may be too
yucky for many boys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP The notion of revisiting a fairy tale may put
them off at first, but many teen-agers will like the idea of
romance in the South of France. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Air Bud'' (1997) it was established that Buddy the golden
retriever can play basketball. Now, it turns out, the animal also
has a feel for the football field. To avoid contact with his
mother's new boyfriend and generally deny the fact that life goes
on after his father's death, young Josh (Kevin Zegers) joins his
junior high school football team as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with a rifle for a throwing arm, Josh needs a receiver
who can go deep and hang on to the ball. That would be his dog,
Buddy, who carries the team to the state finals only to get
snatched by animal trainers with Russian accents. Between the
sensitive situation at home, the big game and the missing dog,
there's a lot to straighten out before the final gun. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The two dog snatchers get some slapstick comeuppance in
the form of nasty spills and blows, but they are such buffoons that
even small children won't take their mishaps seriously. In a
similar vein, the dog's imprisonment with the other animals is more
of a lark than an ordeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 This is such a soft, sweet little movie, so thoroughly
cleansed of any seriously untoward occurrences, that it is hard to
see how anything in it would upset small children. And, of course,
they will love Buddy and the other animals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 This is the ideal age group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP By this age, most children will find the
goings-on silly and overly sanitized.

<P>
   R 105 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a playing field bereft of golden retrievers, Coop (Parker)
and Remer (Stone) invent a mongrel of a game that combines
basketball and baseball. Shoot a hoop and run around the bases. In
Zucker's often riotous spoof of the professional sports scene,
``baseketball'' instantly becomes a hot commodity, complete with
rapaciously greedy owners, idiotic play-by-play, nine-month-long
playoff seasons, squads of cheerleaders in S&AMP;M outfits and teams
like the Los Angeles Riots.
</P>
<P>
   Only Coop, who invented the game, is determined to keep
baseketball clean and pure. But the clock is running out on his
team, the Milwaukee Beers, and their fans, the foamheads. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A lot of body slams and board-in-the-face roughhouse
typical of a rowdy farce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX With boys relentlessly being boys, there are lots of exposed
body parts and continual crude humor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY All the usual and then some. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE Hollywood's obsession with vomiting is again on
display. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12 Obviously this isn't a film for the very young.
Older children, attracted partly by the fact that the film features
Parker and Stone, the creators of television's ``South Park,'' will
be on the floor with laughter, but parents should be aware of the
sexual content and profanity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Again, be aware of the R rating, but many
teen-agers will be up for some good, stupid and ultimately harmless
fun.

CLINTON URGES GOP-LED CONGRESS TO PASS HIS ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton pressed Republicans in
Congress on Tuesday to pass his environmental agenda and announced
new rules requiring water utilities to inform consumers about the
quality of their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The White House stepped up its confrontation with Congress as
senior officials also took aim at a Republican's comments that the
GOP could ``win'' a public relations battle over a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Congress remain at odds over a series of
funding bills pending in the House or Senate. Congress has yet to
enact any of the 13 measures that keep government operating after
Sept. 31, and Clinton has threaten to veto seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   The president, in California to raise $3 million for Democrat
Gray Davis' campaign for governor, trekked to a water filtration
plant to highlight his environmental agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in Congress today a disturbing trend to break up what
historically, at least for the last 30 years, has been a bipartisan
consensus on the environment,'' Clinton told the small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled new regulations that will require the 5,600
water utilities nationwide to provide a ``consumer confidence''
report to their 240 million customers beginning in October next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The reports must inform consumers of the source of their water
and whether it meets federal standards. It must identify potential
sources of contaminants and provide health advisories for people
with medical conditions, such as HIV, that make them vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that five years ago in Milwaukee a microbe
outbreak sickened 400,000 people and killed dozens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is ever an area where we need progress, not
partisanship, it is to ensure the purity and safety of our
environment. But there is a question about that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Congress for refusing to fund his clean water
action plan that would restore 40 percent of the nation's waters
currently too polluted for fishing or swimming. He also complained
that Congress refused to release funding for his plan to add 100
national and historic sites for federal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the month of July was the hottest on record, Clinton
also criticized Congress for cutting his initiatives to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, a primary contributor to global warming.
And, he blasted members for attaching what he called
anti-environmental language to measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawmakers have attached language to unrelated bills to cripple
wildlife protection and cut through an Alaskan wildlife refuge with
a $30 million road. These back-door assaults must also stop,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the administration jumped on comments made by
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., chairman of the Conservative Action
Team, that Republicans could ``win'' a battle over a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff, sent a letter to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich,R-Ga., calling McIntosh's comments
disturbing. ``We continue to believe that shutting down the
government is not any way to sort through our different views of
budget priorities,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor Congress has shown signs of
willingness to compromise as the clock ticks down toward a
shutdown. A series of government shutdowns in 1995 resurrected
Clinton's approval ratings and proved a disaster for Congress,
which was blamed by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles called on Gingrich to repudiate McIntosh's comments.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CRACK DOWN ON ENTERTAINMENT INVESTMENT SCAMS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and state agencies announced Tuesday that
they are targeting companies that use the glamour of movies and
television to entice people into investing in fake money-making
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which consists of state regulators, said they have
filed 60 lawsuits against allegedly phony entertainment and
media-related investment companies in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, FTC consumer protection director, said false
promotions by the companies being sued have led to losses of about
$100 million for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showbiz schemes have enormous appeal,'' she said at a news
conference. ``They play on the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies targeted in the suits filed in U.S. District
Courts around the country include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Automated Systems &AMP; Concepts International Inc. of Los
Angeles. The FTC accused the company on Aug. 5 of selling $10,000
investments in the production of ``infomercials'' that would offer
packages such as an Elvis Presley coffee-table book, an Elvis CD
and Elvis postage stamps for sale. The scheme raised about $12
million, the agency charged. It said the company falsely claimed
that parts of the package were being considered for official
sanction by Graceland, which controls Presley products, and that
the infomercial would air on the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   _ World Interactive Gaming Corp. of Bohemia, N.Y. The FTC said
that the firm told people their $10,000 investment in an Internet
gambling casino would earn them $150,000 in one year. The FTC said
in a lawsuit filed Monday that the company had raised $2 million
from about 200 investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ My Pet TV of Los Angeles. According to the FTC, promoters
allegedly told investors they could make large profits from a cable
TV network for children. But the network never got off the ground.
According to an FTC suit filed last Friday, the company transferred
funds from the children's network without telling the investors and
used the money to start a cable network devoted to pet programming
that never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the companies could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles Hammond, 43, a shipyard manager
from Greene, Maine, said he invested $20,000 in the children's
network in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material ``was so professionally done and so
well laid out with the list of people that were going to produce
and direct,'' he said. ``It seemed so legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, the company told him he owned part of a new
cable network that was called ``My Pet TV.'' By the end of last
year, Hammond said, he realized he had lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cooke, 58, a retired aerospace engineer from Vienna, Va.,
said he was caught in a movie production scheme two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Desert Gold Partners Company, based in several
California cities, told him he could buy shares in a nonviolent
action movie to be called ``Operation: Desert Gold.'' He said he
checked with Better Business Bureaus in San Diego, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, Calif., to ensure that the firm was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done as much homework as I normally do on an
investment,'' he said, adding that he thought the movie was being
made even though production was slow. But a year later, Cooke said,
he was shocked to learn that the firm had shut down and its assets
had been frozen. He said he doesn't expect to get his $20,000
investment back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, said Desert Gold
raised $8 million from about 600 investors. The agency sued
officials of the firm Tuesday morning just hours before the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he said, there is no movie and all of the money has
been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a Desert Gold official in San Francisco were
unsuccessful.

COMMENTARY: ELECTRIC KOOL-AID VIAGRA  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In my 1960s youth, America couldn't stop talking about _ or
taking _ a drug that promised sexual ecstasy and a sensory trip. If
memory serves, it was called marijuana and, though widely
available, was illegal. Three decades later, the new national drug
of choice also promises sexual ecstasy and, as a potential side
effect, what the Food and Drug Administration describes as mild
temporary perceptual ``changes in blue/green colors.'' It is called
Viagra, and not only is it a legal prescription medication, but
anyone with a credit card can score some over the Internet without
even seeing or speaking to a doctor. I know because I did.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra is the emblem of our fin-de-millennium drug culture. On
the market only since April, it has spawned a cottage industry in
humor, not unlike all the stoned comedy of the '60s, and is minting
money for Pfizer, its manufacturer. Pfizer ``has refined the art of
publicizing a `blockbuster drug' ... not unlike the way Hollywood
releases a summertime action flick,'' writes the journalist Greg
Critser in his Salon magazine report on the sprawling Viagra
industry. ``It's kind of off the charts,'' said a Pfizer
spokeswoman last week, sounding very Hollywood as she talked about
Viagra's box-office.
</P>
<P>
   The same spokeswoman assured me that ``we don't have a sense
that there is any kind of widespread abuse of this product.'' She
also said that ``You can't go into a pharmacy and talk your way
into a Viagra tablet without a prescription.'' Nonetheless, it's
not hard to find anecdotal evidence that Viagra is being used,
however improperly, as a recreational aphrodisiac by both men
without erectile dysfunction and by women (for whose use it has not
been cleared by the FDA). An Internet site titled ``How and Where
to Obtain Viagra'' advises, ``If you can't get it from your doctor,
try your local junior high school!! The girls in the junior high
school near to where I live have it and are selling it to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go into the widely used Web search engine Infoseek _ in
which Disney owns a big stake _ and merely type in the word
``Viagra,'' an ad immediately starts flashing ``Free Viagra'' and
leads to an online purveyor. At another site promoting the
Viagra-hyping book ``The Virility Solution'' by Steven Lamm, an
assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine,
a link speeds you to a cyberstore called The Pill Box Pharmacy.
There you click agreement to a waiver of liability, fill out a
simple questionnaire any way you wish, pick your own dosage and _
party on!
</P>
<P>
   Though Pill Box wouldn't fill my order when I clicked ``no'' to
erectile dysfunction, it did accept a deliberately vague
boilerplate description of some ``problem.'' The pills soon arrived
by UPS from San Antonio, Texas. I was charged an additional $85 for
a ``consultation'' with a doctor whose name I learned only from the
pill bottle. He not only didn't talk to me, but he didn't consult
with my primary-care physician to verify my purported medical
history or see if I was telling the truth when I said I was not
taking medications known to interact dangerously with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Michael Risher, of the Lindesmith Center, the
drug-policy research group, why our national drug warriors look the
other way at such flagrant Viagra madness while railing against,
say, the medical use of marijuana. He said that ``perception''
rules: Viagra, after all, has the fatherly imprimatur of the
irreproachable Bob Dole. (We all know which national figure is the
poster boy for marijuana.) Yet even as drug use among the young is
being fought by a Clinton-and-Gingrich-endorsed ad blitz costing
taxpayers nearly $1 billion, what kind of mixed messages are adults
sending kids? The same ad industry that is making the anti-drug
spots speaks out of the other side of its mouth by pushing
grown-up-sanctioned drugs like alcohol and nicotine, not to mention
an exponentially increasing number of prescription pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   A drug culture is a drug culture is a drug culture, whether the
illicitly obtained gateway high of choice for a teen-ager is
marijuana or any legal, heavily promoted medicine that's perceived
as life style enhancing, no matter what its side effects or
long-term consequences. Viagra brings benefits to many legitimate
patients, not to mention stand-up comics, but who's the real butt
of the jokes? Call it an acid flashback to the '60s, but I'm taking
my phone off the hook to avoid all the friends coming after my
stash.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks buckled Tuesday as investors grew increasingly
fearful that sickly Asian economies would drive down corporate
earnings at U.S. companies in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent on the day,
closing at 8462.85. That puts the average 9.3 percent below its
July 17 high of 9337.97 and within shouting distance of a 10
percent correction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last Tuesday's 300-point decline, which came on a day
with little in the way of news, Tuesday's drop came amid a raft of
fresh and frightening world developments. First was an indication
that the Asian typhoon appeared to be gathering speed. Japan's
Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report that the
country's worst slump since World War II was deepening; this sent
the Japanese yen plunging to 147.27 versus the dollar, setting an
eight-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The yen is crucial to world markets because the further it
falls, the greater the fear that China will devalue its currency,
causing another round of devaluations across the Pacific Rim.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 219.43 points, or 1.4 percent
Tuesday, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index lost 3.6 percent.
Malaysia's stock index fell to its lowest level in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Russia worsened as well Tuesday as investors,
concerned that the Russian government would not be able to meet its
debt payments this year, fled the country's stocks and bonds. The
Russian Trading System suspended trading for 45 minutes during the
day after the benchmark RTS index lost more than 7.5 percent of its
value. That market has fallen almost 73 percent since 1998 began.
Latin American stocks reeled as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the time all this news had registered with U.S. investors _
around 10:30 a.m. _ the Dow was down 220 points. At its low point,
the Dow had lost 254 points, or almost 3 percent. By the end of the
day, a buying spree in oil stocks brought the average back a bit to
close down 112 points.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, smaller stocks took bigger hits Tuesday than their
large-capitalization brethren. The Nasdaq composite lost 46.51
points, or 2.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, investors seemed to watch the day's events
warily but without panicking. Several mutual fund companies
reported that the heaviest selling took place in the morning.
According to John Woerth, a spokesman for the Vanguard Group,
buyers began returning to equity funds shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody was willing to buy on this particular market
dip. One stock broker in St. Louis reported a distinct mood change
among his clients. Last Tuesday, when the Dow dipped nearly 300
points, the bargain hunters came out in force, but the sidelines
was the preferred place to be Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the consensus du jour among Wall Street analysts _
that a bear market cannot begin unless interest rates rise or a
recession looms _ lost much of its credibility Tuesday. ``The
earnings side of the stock market is really starting to deteriorate
rapidly,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at
Merrill Lynch in New York. ``We are in a profit recession where we
will have zero or minus 10 percent earnings growth this year.
That's what we think the market is seeing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three elements began to sink into the investor psyche
Tuesday. One was that the continuing deterioration in Asia means
corporate earnings among American companies in the second half will
not bounce back as Wall Street's Pollyanna analysts continue to
claim. Although hard data to support this belief will not be
available for quite some time, anecdotes about declining sales at a
variety of American companies are spreading. The stock market is
picking up this buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's developments in Russia also seemed to show that
investors are increasingly skeptical about governments' ability to
stem currency devaluations. Back in June, when the U.S. Treasury
joined the Japanese government in defending the yen, it was an
attempt to stop the Asian contagion dead in its tracks. So much for
that idea: the yen is 0.7 percent below where it was when the two
governments intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The $22.6 billion bailout of Russia by the International
Monetary Fund in mid-July was another line in the sand drawn by
Robert Rubin, secretary of the Treasury, and the International
Monetary Fund. The bailout was given an initial chance of success
by investors hoping to see fiscal reforms across Russia. But
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Mitchell Securities, said: ``The
markets are starting to wonder why Secretary Rubin and the IMF have
not been successful. The markets fear that they are failing.''

   But the most troubling view that crept onto investors' radar
screens Tuesday is that for all the Federal Reserve's concerns
about inflation, it could be deflation that ultimately undoes the
U.S. stock market. As investors absorb the possibility of another
round of Asian devaluations, so too do they begin to comprehend
what a deflationary spiral could bring.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation is disastrous for an economy, as Japan is discovering,
because as the prices of goods fall, consumer spending grinds to a
halt. People simply wait to buy goods until they feel that the
prices will fall no further. What this kind of behavior does to
corporate earnings is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   E. Han Kim is professor of finance and international business
and director of the Mitsui Financial Research Center at the
University of Michigan Business school. Kim also acted as a
financial adviser during the debt negotiations with the Korean
government earlier this year and is a specialist in Asian finance
and economies. While last year's devaluations actually benefitted
the U.S. economy by keeping prices of foreign goods down and
inflation low, he said, U.S. companies would find another
devaluation less pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have virtually zero inflation,'' he said. ``So
the next thing could be deflation. The chance of a deflationary
spiral is greater now. It was really slim before, but is a real
danger now.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason why even the whiff of deflation scares the daylights
out of the stock market is that it is a virtual unknown. The U.S.
economy has not experienced deflation since the 1930s, so few
investors know what to expect or how to measure it. ``What scares
people the most is the unknown,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists do know that deflation plays out slowly and
insidiously and that the Federal Reserve Board chairman has little
in his arsenal to counteract it. While Greenspan can curb inflation
by slamming on the monetary brakes and raising interest rates, in a
deflationary environment the Fed has few levers to pull. The only
way to get out of a deflationary period is to contract the supply
of goods. This means shutting plants, laying off workers, anything
that will remove excess supply from the economy and restore
companies' ability to raise prices of their goods.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the chances that China will devalue its currency?
Better and better with each fall of the yen, say market watchers.
Richard Babson, chairman and president of Babson United Inc., an
investment advisory firm with $2 billion under management, said:
``We expect the Chinese to devalue and unpeg the Hong Kong dollar
in the first quarter of next year. If it's a choice between
maintaining an international system by not devaluing and having
riots in the streets of Beijing, they'll devalue.''

VALENTIN MAKES SWEET MOVE FOR CANCER CHARITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Valentin's Sweet Hits Candy may not sell like Baby
Ruth or Reggie! candy bars, but that hardly matters.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that the Red Sox third baseman is lending his
name and portrait to the New England Confectionery Company for a
new candy that could raise as much as $50,000 for the Jimmy Fund,
the charity that raises money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being a baseball player and being involved with the
Jimmy Fund for a while now, I really didn't think it would affect
me the way it has,'' Valentin said. ``When you meet these kids _
and having two of my own _ it's amazing how much life these kids
have even when they are so sick. It's just been an amazing
experience, and I am happy to do everything that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is marching in the footsteps of players such as Ted
Williams and Carl Yastrzemski who have been the Red Sox' main
spokesmen for the Jimmy Fund. Earlier this year, he reached an
agreement with NECCO, the country's oldest candy maker, to put his
portrait, a picture of him swinging the bat, and a copy of his
autograph on the box of a new product, NECCO Sweet Hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination, somewhere between the NECCO Wafers and our
Sweet Hearts product that sell so well around Valentine's Day,''
said Walter Marshall, NECCO's vice president for logistics and
planning. The candies also bear the printed words of baseball
jargon, including two that are particularly appropriate for
Valentin: ``third base'' and ``double.''
</P>
<P>
   NECCO will make no profit from the sale of the candy, and
Valentin will make no fee. Both will donate their proceeds to the
Jimmy Fund, according to spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said NECCO has purchased 1 million boxes for Sweet Hits
and plans to bring all of them to market. He expects that the
eventual contribution could be about $50,000 in NECCO's first
involvement with the Jimmy Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Hits should begin appearing this weekend at Stop &AMP; Shop,
Star Market, Demoulas, Shaws, Trucci's, Brooks, Bradlees, Osco,
Ro-jacks, Cost Plus, and Candy World &AMP; More _ and many of the
stores will mark the product with special displays.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said he became especially interested in the
fund-raising device after one of the many children he has visited
at the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana-Farber died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas Bartlett was just an amazing kid,'' Valentin said
Tuesday, the emotion welling in his voice. ``You know, he's gone
now, but he's always going to be with me. He was a friend of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox second baseman Mike Andrews, the chairman and
executive director of the Jimmy Fund, praised Valentin for his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that it is sometimes tough when they are playing
and they are so into their sport,'' Andrews said. ``But it's too
bad all ballplayers don't do what John has done.''

A JAPANESE VISION OF THE ANCIENT WORLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KYOTO, Japan _ In 1991, after collecting objects for the
Japanese tea ceremony for 40 years, Mihoko Koyama switched to
buying ancient and medieval art for the world-class museum she
envisioned building on a mountaintop near here.
</P>
<P>
   Frail and in a wheelchair, Mrs. Koyama, an heiress to a textile
fortune, moved quietly but with tornado force through the ancient
art market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years she collected 300 works produced in
China, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Greece, Rome and Egypt, buying several
times a year at the galleries of prominent dealers in Europe and
the United States. Many were masterpieces, like an Assyrian
limestone relief, depicting a winged deity and a royal attendant,
that she bought from a dealer in 1994 after it was auctioned at
Christie's in London for $11.9 million, a record for ancient art.
</P>
<P>
   The antiquities and the tea ceremony artifacts are exhibited in
the Miho Museum, a stone, steel, glass and concrete structure named
after its creator and designed by I.M. Pei, in the town of
Shigaraki, 20 miles east of Kyoto. (The cost of the land, art and
building was about three-quarters of a billion dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   The site is near the headquarters of Shinji Shumeikai, or Shumei
Family, the religious group that Mrs. Koyama, now 88, founded in
1970. Its 300,000 members believe that contemplating beauty in art
and nature brings spiritual fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Mrs. Koyama's art collecting came after a
conversation with Pei.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I'm partly to blame for Mrs. Koyama's shift in
collecting,'' he said. ``I looked at the pieces she wanted in the
museum and 90 percent were Japanese tea ceremony objects. Since
many museums in Japan have such collections, I wondered why people
would come a long way to see this museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Pei said that Mrs. Koyama had seemed to understand and asked him
for suggestions. ``Why not turn your eyes to the West,'' he said,
``not to the West of Van Gogh, but to the West which was a source
for ancient Japanese art. Look West to Buddhism, to the Silk route,
to ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Koyama enlisted the help of Noriyoshi Horiuchi, a Tokyo
dealer in ancient art who transformed her vision into a reality. He
introduced Mrs. Koyama and her daughter, Hiroko, to dealers like
Giuseppe Eskenazi and Robin Symes in London and James J. Lally and
Edward Merrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi preselected the works for Mrs. Koyama: Chinese bronzes,
Sassanian silver vessels, Egyptian wood carvings, Roman mosaics and
Persian lusterware.
</P>
<P>
   While confident in her choices, Mrs. Koyama, who speaks little
English, relied on experts to confirm her judgment. ``She didn't
say much, a word or two, like `beautiful,' `wonderful,'
`excellent,' '' Horiuchi said. ``She didn't ask the history, the
background or the price of the objects.''
</P>
<P>
   When she admired a piece, said Eskenazi, the dealer, ``she
expressed her great excitement by her wonderful benign smile.'' It
was a smile he was to see many times as Mrs. Koyama returned
frequently to his gallery to buy at least 27 pieces, including
Chinese stone sculpture, inlaid bronzes and a Tang tomb figure of a
pottery court lady with a haunting smile.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the objects was easy for Mrs. Koyama and her team. What
was difficult was authenticating the works. The field of
antiquities is plagued by forgeries and illegally excavated
objects. But Horiuchi was well aware of these problems. ``We bought
only from major dealers,'' he said. ``And we invited museum
curators, scholars, collectors, restorers and dealers to look at
the collection and urged everyone to tell us of any problems they
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had all of the objects analyzed in museum laboratories,
most of them by Pieter Meyers, the head of the Conservation Center
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Of the 300 pieces studied,
8 were not authenticated and were removed from the collection.
</P>
<P>
   In their travels, Mrs. Koyama and her daughter met with
directors, curators and conservators from New York, Los Angeles,
London, Paris, Berlin and St. Petersburg to arrange future loans of
art works from the collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, an exhibition of 80 works, ``Ancient Art from the
Shumei Family Collection,'' opened at the Metropolitan Museum and
later moved to the Los Angeles County Museum. Last November, the
movers and shakers in ancient art gathered for the opening of the
Miho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting art is an ancient tradition in Japan,'' Horiuchi
said. ``As early as the eighth century, the Japanese received gifts
of Persian art from Chinese emperors and continued to collect.
Then, and once again now, the Japanese are eager to import art and
knowledge from China and Europe.''

 &HT;    Humane Society wants microchips implanted in animals
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A microchip identification program at the Cobb County,
Ga. animal shelter has proved so successful that the Humane Society
is asking county commissioners to institute a policy requiring the
chips for all animals that pass through the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Several counties have voluntary microchip programs at animal
shelters. Cobb would be the first county in metro Atlanta to
require people who adopt or retrieve pets to have the
identification chips implanted in the animals, said Joy Evilsizor,
general manager of the Cobb Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching its pilot microchip program in February,
Evilsizor said the shelter staff already had identified 10 to 15
animals a month using a universal scanner that reads the chips.
Instead of being held in shelter cages, the animals were quickly
returned to their owners, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really works,'' Evilsizor said. ``It's a long-term
potential solution.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works: Tiny chips, each coded with a number, are
implanted in the back of an animal's neck. A handheld scanner
deciphers the code, which is fed into a computer. The computer
reveals the animal's owner and contact information. Of the three
companies that manufacture the microchips, the Humane Society is
recommending Cobb use AVID, which has a universal scanner that
identifies all three brands of chips.
</P>
<P>
   The chips would cost pet owners $15, which would be added to pet
adoption fees. Owners retrieving lost or stray pets also would be
charged for the chip. Evilsizor said the program would pay for
itself, and perhaps even generate revenue for the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners agreed to consider the policy. ``It's a good
concept,'' commissioner Joe Thompson said. ``Part of the new
technology.''

SECURITY CAMERA AT EMBASSY IN TANZANIA HAD NO VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-U.S.-EMBASSIES,
AFRICA-BOMBINGS)  
 (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ A security camera that was pointing
directly at the U.S. Embassy gate here where a terrorist bomb
exploded did not contain videotape but was merely used for
monitoring by Marine Corps guards, a State Department security
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, which was attached to the roof of the embassy
building and survived the blast intact, was one of six or seven
cameras on the embassy site, he said. None of them had tape.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the cameras were never intended to have
tape but that a ``lesson learned'' from the explosion here was the
need for videotape to be installed in embassy security cameras
around the world. U.S. officials said soon after the blast last
Friday that the security camera might provide vital evidence for
the investigation now under way by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   After it was discovered that there was no videotaped record of
Friday's blast, all embassies were ordered by the State Department
to start installing cameras with videotape, said the security
official, a senior official with the State Department's Diplomatic
Service Security Office. He is heading a team of 40 security and
counterterrorism experts flown in from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures from the cameras at the embassy here _ as in most
embassies _show up on monitoring screens in the booth inside the
embassy door, where Marine Corps guards are on duty, he said. It
was impossible, the official said, for a Marine to watch all
monitors all the time, but what the guard had seen on his monitors
last Friday would be ``part of the ongoing investigation'' by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzanian police said on Tuesday that they had arrested 14
foreigners in connection with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The officials gave only nationalities and some job descriptions
but no names of those being held for questioning. Six of the men
are Iraqis, six are Sudanese, one is Turkish and one a Somali,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the arrests are their dubious characters and
intelligence information suggesting that they may be involved with
the explosion,'' said police spokesman Aden Mwamunyange at a news
conference. It was not clear Tuesday night whether the FBI
investigators here have interviewed those being held.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department officials cautioned that the
arrests, which were apparently made over the last several days,
appeared to be part of a general roundup that is a common part of
crime investigation in some African countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most striking aspect of the arrests was that all of those
being held were not Tanzanian and that they came from predominantly
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanzanian leaders have repeatedly stressed that they did not
believe that a Tanzanian was involved in the bombing, which killed
10 people and wounded more than 70.
</P>
<P>
   No Americans died in the explosion here. The official death toll
has risen to 10. Tanzanian mortuary officials Tuesday identified
the body of a Tanzanian security guard who was at the embassy gate
inspecting a water tanker when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   At the morgue at the main hospital, the chief pathologist, who
would give his name only as Dr. Makata, said that the bodies of the
two people who were closest to the water tanker at the time of the
explosion were the most severely mangled.
</P>
<P>
   This appeared to lend credence to what U.S. officials have
called the most plausible scenario of what happened here _ that the
bomb was attached to the water tanker that made daily water
deliveries to the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water truck is clearly a key aspect,'' the State
Department security official said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Paul Elisha, 32, the security guard who was
apparently looking at the underside of the truck with a mirror
attached to a long stick, was the most difficult to identify,
Makata said. The other severely damaged body was that of the
driver, Yusuf Shamte Ndange.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extent of death and destruction was significantly
less here than in Kenya, the attack has shaken a nation proud of
its stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanzanian leaders have sought to place responsibility for
the attack outside its own borders. President Benjamin Mkapa said
after touring the damaged embassy building that it was ``very
unlikely'' that the bombing was carried out by a Tanzanian.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Tanzanians acknowledge that if foreign Islamic
militants were responsible for the attack, they would have found it
relatively easy to send in or recruit helpers here. The border
controls of Tanzania are lax and the country is within relatively
easy access of the Sudan, to the north. The Sudan has provided
shelter of Osama bin Laden, who is known to have financed many
terrorist actions.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of the people along the Tanzanian coast are
Muslims, and in the last several years, pockets of a more
fundamentalist Islam have emerged here. In February, there were
violent clashes between the police and more militant Islamic
fundamentalists outside a mosque in the Mwembe Chai area of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   For the FBI and other U.S. law-enforcement personnel here, the
arrests by the Tanzanians of the 14 foreigners show the difficult
balancing act of working on a vastly complicated criminal case in a
country with limited crime-investigation resources.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official said the arrests by the Tanzanians should not
be taken ``too seriously.'' On the other hand, the FBI was anxious
to get the full cooperation of the Tanzanians and not repeat the
rocky relationship with law-enforcement officials in Saudi Arabia,
where the attacks in 1995 and 1996 on U.S. military installations
remain unsolved.

TV PRODUCER TESTIFIES IN STARR INVESTIGATION AS CLINTON ATTORNEY
REVIEWS EVIDENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Hollywood television producer and a White House
lawyer testified Tuesday before a federal grand jury investigating
whether President Clinton tried to cover-up a relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors questioned image-maker Harry Thomason and deputy
White House counsel Cheryl Mills about the president's
damage-control efforts during the early days of the Lewinsky
controversy, Clinton's private lawyer was reviewing evidence at the
heart of the sex-and-perjury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Kendall, who represents the president in the
Whitewater investigation, spent almost five hours at the federal
courthouse viewing the president's videotaped Jan. 17 deposition in
a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In that testimony, Clinton denied engaging in sex with Lewinsky,
a statement the former White House intern contradicted, a legal
source said, when she appeared last week before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall was allowed to view the tape under the supervision of
Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson as preparation for
Clinton's impending grand jury appearance. Permission was granted
by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, a federal judge in
Arkansas who four months ago dismissed the Jones lawsuit but
ordered all evidence to remain under seal.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who left the courthouse Tuesday without comment, is to
meet with the president Wednesday to prepare for his grand jury
appearance. Clinton is to testify via closed-circuit television
Monday from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Thomason spent more than an hour with the grand jury
responding to questions about his five-week stay at the executive
mansion and private conversations he had with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand jurors seemed like great people,'' Thomason told
reporters, adding, ``I've always believed that the president is
telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomason is credited with advising the president during the
early days of the scandal to avoid legalistic responses and to
firmly deny the alleged affair. A few days later, the president
issued a finger-wagging statement saying he ``did not have sexual
relations'' with Lewinsky and never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason has produced several successful television comedies,
including ``Designing Women'' and ``Evening Shade.'' He teamed up
with his wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, to produce a short film
about Clinton for his first presidential campaign in 1992 and
created a 12-minute film about Clinton for the 1996 Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter is not the first investigation of the
Clinton White House involving Thomason. A congressional inquiry
found that he played a key role in what is known as the travel
office firings, the dismissal of seven longtime White House workers
four months after Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying before the grand jury Tuesday was Mills, a
deputy to White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and a key
participant in court debates aimed at fending off independent
counsel Kenneth Starr. Mills left the courthouse without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was subpoenaed after the White House lost a court fight
over the use of attorney-client privilege to keep government
lawyers from having to testify.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, several more Secret Service officers appeared at the
courthouse to testify in Starr's probe. So far, at least 14 Secret
Service employees, including the head of the president's personal
security detail, have been called before the grand jury.

immediate effects from the deal. Prices at gas pumps are mostly
dependent on world oil supplies, which are currently plentiful. And
while the consolidation of gasoline outlets may slightly decrease
retail competition, the exploration prowess of the combined
companies could eventually result in larger supplies of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives at other companies said the deal benefited both
BP and Amoco. The main strength of British Petroleum, they said, is
the business of looking for and finding oil reserves. But the
company is weak in the business of refining the oil into products
and chemicals and distributing it to consumers, at which Amoco
excels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of Amoco is in areas that are lacking at BP such
as the natural gas reserves, which it possesses, and
petrochemicals,'' Andrew Avramides, an oil consultant in London,
said. ``The merger brings these assets into a larger, far more
comprehensive structure, making BP Amoco a true giant with enhanced
structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and dealmakers alike said the announcement could set
off a wave of consolidation in oil companies not unlike that seen
in the financial services and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that might consider moves now are Mobil Corp., Chevron
Corp. and Texaco Inc., all of which saw their stocks rise despite a
downdraft in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said BP chief executive Sir John
Browne approached Amoco chairman Larry Fuller in late spring about
a possible merger. Sir John believed that consolidation was
inevitable and, said an executive close to the deal, ``Both of
these guys said if we don't pick a partner, we are going to be
last.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that the merger will take months to be approved
by regulators, although there are no obvious impediments to the
deal's structure.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesperson said: ``A merger of this
magnitude has to come under review. We will be looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies employ a total of 99,450 workers around the
world. Amoco, with 43,450 total employees, expects to cut 5,000 to
6,000 jobs, but none in its Chicago headquarters, Dan Dietsch, the
company's media relations adviser, said. A spokesman for BP said
the company planned to cut about 1,000 jobs in Cleveland when
refining and marketing operations there are moved to Chicago. Other
cuts are expected at Amoco's research offices in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco and BP said Chicago would remain the headquarters for the
new company's North American business of refining, marketing and
transportation, ``and, in due course, the worldwide chemicals
business.'' Amoco is the fourth-largest company in the Chicago
area.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement coincides with another significant drop
in oil prices on world markets, which are flooded with supplies.
Producers have been hurt by the economic slowdown in Asian
economies, a mild winter and overproduction by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   As the deal was announced in London Tuesday afternoon, the
average oil price around the world hit a 10-year low. Average oil
prices around the world stood at about $10 a barrel, which in
today's dollar is lower than the price of oil 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior oil executives and analysts alike stressed that the move
by British Petroleum must be looked at as a strategic decision
transcending the fluctuations in the prices of what remains one of
the world's most essential commodities and a vital element of
economic growth worldwide. Avramides said that today's low oil
prices are ``not a permanent condition.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mayhew of Cazenove &AMP; Co., a London brokerage firm, said
that no company can ignore current oil prices, but added that
``this move provides considerable economic and financial benefits
on the long run; it makes a great deal of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, who will head the new company as its chief executive,
said the merger was forced by the need for economies of scale and
by increasing competition in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``International competition in the industry is already fierce
and will grow more acute as new players emerge,'' Sir John said
Tuesday in a press conference. ``In such a climate the best
investment opportunities will go increasingly to companies that
have the size and financial strength to take on those large-scale
projects that offer a truly distinctive return.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, he added: ``People always ask me if such
mergers are good for consumers. Competition always is good for
consumers. It is also exciting and challenging. This deal moves us
into the super-league and provides the prospect of real competition
for those already in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John said that the merger would bring some $2 billion in
savings as the two companies eliminate redundancies and consolidate
their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The merger ranks as the world's largest industrial company
corporate combination, surpassing the $36 billion acquisition of
Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler Benz AG announced in May, and
it is the sixth-largest merger of any type. It brings together one
of Britain's top industrial companies, founded in 1909, and a major
U.S. company that came out of the Standard Oil of New Jersey
monopoly when it was split up in the early part of this century.

</P>
<P>
   A senior Kuwaiti oil executive whose country holds about 7
percent of BP shares hailed the deal as a major breakthrough.
``Over the past decade they have gone through a major
rationalization process cutting costs, staffing, increasing their
reserves of oil worldwide and their efficiency,'' the Kuwait
official, who insisted on anonymity, said in an interview in
London.
</P>
<P>
   BP will exchange American depository receipts equivalent to 3.97
of its shares for each Amoco share. BP closed Monday at 7.73
pounds, making the value of the deal worth $48.2 billion based on
964,406 million Amoco shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading Tuesday, BP shares had increased 22
pence in London, to 7.95 pounds, raising the value of the takeover
to $49.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum will also assume $4.86 billion in long-term
Amoco debt.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the new company, which will be based in London,
will contain 13 BP directors and nine from Amoco. Amoco must pay
$950 million if it breaks the agreement. BP will have to pay $1
billion if it backs out. Although both companies strove Tuesday to
represent the deal as a merger, analysts tended to look at it as an
acquisition by BP which will control 60 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have 9.2 billion barrels of crude oil
in reserves. Amoco has been struggling recently to refocus its
growth overseas in an effort to move away from the saturated
American market. The company sold about one-third of its domestic
oil and natural gas properties last year. With Amoco, BP also
acquires 9,300 retail gasoline outlets. The new company will also
become the largest natural gas producer in North America. If
completed, the merger would make BP the largest company in Britain,
supplanting the pharmaceutical manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of the year, Amoco's net income fell to
$673 million from $1.3 billion a year ago. Revenues fell to $15.4
billion from $17.6 billion. U.S. oil company stocks have been
battered this year because of overproduction by world oil producers
and falling demand from Southeast Asian countries. Amoco's stock,
which was split earlier this year, is down 12 percent over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum was advised by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and the law
firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. Amoco Corp. was advised by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and lawyers Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16)  
 (af)  
 By ELIZABETH KAYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looks weathered. He is weathered. ``I got a face like a
catcher's mitt,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But still; there is something about him that inflames the Walter
Mitty fantasies of men and the hidden longings of women. It's a
quality that emerged first in his songwriting, then onscreen, and
owes a lot to an old-time manner that used to be called being
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   If sentimentality is the tendency to show more than one actually
feels, Kris Kristofferson is the opposite of sentimental: the man
who feels so much that he cannot help but show it.
</P>
<P>
   He is what he wrote about, a walking contradiction _ a Rhodes
scholar propelled though life less by reason than by impulse; a
Golden Gloves boxer blessed with a poet's understanding of
irredeemable loss and late-night yearnings. Rugged yet capable of
being wounded, solitary yet reachable, he veers between two styles:
supremely laid back and wound tighter than most.
</P>
<P>
   He is perceived as a sexual icon, though his sexuality derives
from an intense fragility usually associated with women.
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when he was weary, convinced he had done
it all. Yet he found his way to new starts. His laugh is explosive,
contagious, fierce, the flip side of a long struggle with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a boy, music reached him with a force that was
nonnegotiable. ``It felt like something I needed,'' he says. In it,
he discovered what he calls ``honest emotion,'' an ideal that he
sought in ephemeral encounters with numberless women until he found
it with his third wife and the eight children he had fathered in
the course of his marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, he was a restive prowler, spurred by quarts of tequila
and Jack Daniel's, which let him ``keep my brain in the condition
that I liked it,'' as he tells it. Now he is satisfied, though he
never sought to be satisfied, having always believed that it was
hunger that impelled him.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, he had written the line ``Freedom's just
another word for nothing left to lose'' and was being featured in
movies as a pothead, a cowboy, a drifter. In the process, he came
to represent the possibility of life without compromise, of being
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Kristofferson is 62 now. He once had a stubborn streak as
wide and deep as a canyon, but these days he is chastened and
changed, inclined to invoke William Blake's dictum ``If a fool
persists in his folly he would become wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that he's a symbol of freedom produces the wry grin
that means he is laughing at himself. ``But,'' he says, ``I guess
that's what I am _ said the man with eight children.''
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking on a warm day last December in Wilmington, N.C.,
two weeks before the conclusion of principal photography on the
Merchant Ivory film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, which will open Sept. 18, he plays Bill Willis, a
character based on James Jones, the expatriate American writer best
known for the World War II novels ``From Here to Eternity'' and
``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth film Kristofferson has made in the two years
since his life as an actor was recharged by his portrayal of the
vicious sheriff Charlie Wade in John Sayles' ``Lone Star.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appears in two movies that open on Friday: as an
obdurate vampire hunter in ``Blade,'' an action picture also
starring Wesley Snipes, and the lone and remote owner of a dance
studio in ``Dance With Me,'' a role he accepted apprehensively.
(``You know,'' he said in his first meeting with the director Randa
Haynes, ``Robert Duvall would be way better in this part than
me.'')
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, he enters his trailer just before noon,
wearing faded black jeans and worn Tony Lamas cowboy boots. He
emerges moments later, costumed in attire similar to what he just
shed. As always, he's on time for his call; he has never been one
of those stars people have to wait for.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' Kristofferson seems to
be at one with the character he is playing in a way that has not
been the case since he played the doomed rock star in Barbra
Streisand's 1976 remake of ``A Star Is Born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a seamlessness between Kris and Jones,'' says director
James Ivory, who noticed early on that the actor was ad-libbing
lines that sounded markedly like things Jones might have said.
</P>
<P>
   The author's daughter, Kaylie Jones, who wrote the novel upon
which the picture is based, was instantly struck by the resemblance
between them. ``There's a wisdom and kindness in the eyes, eyes
that have seen a lot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the film _ set in Paris and on Long Island
in the 1960s and '70s _ illuminates the warmhearted relationships
between Jones and his daughter and adopted son. Kristofferson told
Ms. Jones that he hoped his children would someday feel for him a
love as profound as the love she holds for her father, who died in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Jones has caused him to summon the best of himself, that
unstinting tenderness that infuses his songs and allows him to love
his own daughters and sons without reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's met a role that really shows who he is,'' says Barbara
Hershey, who plays Marcella Willis, the character based on Jones'
wife, Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofferson was born and reared in a Texas border town,
Brownsville, and spoke Spanish before he spoke English. He was the
only son of an Air Force major general, and it was assumed that he
would follow his father into the military.
</P>
<P>
   But he was subject to a will of his own that first manifested
itself, as he recalls, when he was about 5. His parents were making
fun of Gene Autry's music. He turned to them and said: ``I think he
sings real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was sufficiently his father's son that when he was an
undergraduate at Pomona College in California, his classmates
nicknamed him Straight Arrow. But he soon started drinking,
establishing that moderation was not his style.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Oxford University, where he studied Blake,
implacably drawn to a dominion that combined spirituality and
imagination, although time would pass before he felt entitled to
exist in it.
</P>
<P>
   After school, he joined the Army and became a pilot. He loved to
fly, but his increasingly chaotic spirit was constrained by
military ways. He yearned to write songs, but by then he was
married and had two children to support, so he tried to carry on in
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after leaving a teaching post at West Point, he quit
the military, telling his wife: ``I can't live under the weight of
all those rules.'' He was discovering what life would teach him
repeatedly: that there was a crucial difference between who he was
and who he thought he should be.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving his family in California, he headed for Nashville, where
he got a job as a janitor at a recording studio. ``It was enough to
keep me alive and in touch with the world I was trying to enter,''
he remembers. By day, he mopped floors. At night, he hung out at
the Tally-Ho Tavern, where he drank beer, ate barbecue and swapped
songs. As time passed, he fell ever more deeply in love with the
music and the musician's life, which he construed as his salvation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks a month, he flew helicopters in the Gulf of Mexico to
make money to send back home. But his carousing became extreme; he
fell asleep in a hover and got himself dismissed for being a bad
example. Ashamed and despairing, he holed up at the Evangeline
Motel in Lafayette, La. ``How did it come to this?'' he wondered.
``My wife and kids are off in California and I've got nothing to
show for five years of torment to my whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   But his was to be a distinctly American story, rife with
re-invention and sudden redemption. A few days later, he bought a
six pack of beer, drove to the New Orleans airport and flew back to
Nashville, where he found out that he had landed a gig on ``The
Johnny Cash Show.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the beginning. The next year, his ``Sunday Morning
Comin' Down'' won the Country Music Association award for best song
of 1970, and he also won the songwriter-of-the-year award. He never
quite believed how good his music was, even as he wrote hits like
``Help Me Make It Through the Night,'' ``For the Good Times'' and
``Me and Bobby McGee.''
</P>
<P>
   His songs were somehow spiritual (italics)and(end italics)
carnal, and steeped in an uncanny feel for the way that possibility
turns to cinders. Other songwriters envied and admired them. His
idol, Cash, said: ``They made me want to write better.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kristofferson went on the road, and his existence changed.
``From that time on, I expected to live an accelerated life,'' he
recalls. ``I wanted to experience and taste as much as I could.''
He worried about missing out on things, but the truth was that by
the time he had barreled through his first 40 years, he hadn't
missed much.
</P>
<P>
   He began making movies in 1971, with a role, perversely enough,
in ``The Last Movie.'' In an era when traditional sex roles were
being challenged, he was the right man for the time, one who could
never be accused of being irritatingly macho because he had such
abundant male authority that exerting it was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Martin Scorsese cast him in ``Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore'' as the understanding rancher who encourages a woman's
freedom. With its release, he saw his face on the cover of Rolling
Stone. ``Well,'' he said in his laconic way, ``I guess this means I
made it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had come from worlds that tended to view acting as a
disreputable pursuit for a self-respecting man. At times, he was a
little embarrassed by it himself, though he was far too disciplined
to regard it casually.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming of ``Semi-Tough,'' in 1977, he engaged a
visitor to his trailer in a lengthy conversation that he continued
even though, he noted, he should be working on his lines. ``Listen
to that,'' he exclaimed, `` `I really should be working on my
lines,' he said with all the moral flabbiness he could muster!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he took moviemaking seriously, perhaps more seriously
than he felt a writer should. ``For Christ's sake, Shakespeare was
an actor,'' he said defensively.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the peak of his form in 1979 when Michael Cimino cast
him in that troubled epic of Western America ``Heaven's Gate.'' &UR;  &LR; It
was a heady time. Everything looked so promising, except that
shortly before filming started, Kristofferson's second marriage, to
the singer Rita Coolidge, had fallen apart, leaving him desolate at
the prospect of not bringing up his young daughter. Eventually he
shared custody, but at the time, he felt he had lost everything
that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Cimino induced him to use that feeling, and the camera recorded
the blank, stunned look in his deep-set eyes, the look of someone
newly acquainted with the unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   As the costs on ``Heaven's Gate'' rocketed to $30 million, the
movie became a poster child for the general sense that excess in
Hollywood must be curbed. At the Cannes Film Festival, an MGM
executive made a speech saying that the picture proved that money
should not be placed in the hands of creative people.
</P>
<P>
   For years afterward, recollection of that comment infuriated
Kristofferson. ``Who're they going to give the money to?'' he
growled. ``Uncreative people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven's Gate'' turned out to be a thick brush to be tarred
with, and afterward his career wasn't quite the same. He worked
consistently, but until the role in ``Lone Star'' improved his
fortunes, he did some work that truly interested him, as in Alan
Rudolph's ``Trouble in Mind'' (1985) and a lot that probably didn't
interest him at all, as in ``Big Top Pee-Wee'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Now, gratified to be in a Merchant Ivory film, he feels good as
he ambles across the yard toward a house meant to be the one in
Watermill, N.Y., that Jones and his family moved to from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Kristofferson and Ms. Hershey are filming a scene
in which they play poker with several other people. Between shots,
he tells stories. He has hundreds of stories from years of touring
with friends and colleagues like Willie Nelson: ``Willie came out
onstage to sing with me one time, and I said to him, `I'm losin' my
voice.' He said, `How can you tell?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching across the card table, Kristofferson grabs a cigar,
lights it and takes the smoke deep into his lungs. ``You aren't
supposed to inhale,'' Ms. Hershey tells him. ``If I don't inhale
it,'' he says, ``I feel like Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more comfortable here than he has ever been on a movie
set. But then, it makes sense that Kristofferson is at ease
portraying James Jones. For all that he has been and done, his
occupation, emblazoned in his heart and stated on his passport, has
always been writer.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, he is struck by the degree to which he finds
himself in Jones. ``Willie Morris said that as Jones got older, it
wasn't that he became gentle, but that he was gentled,''
Kristofferson explains. And as the days of filming go by, the
actor's work resounds with a special gentleness, the sort reserved
for men who have known many things, among them what it is to be a
tiger.

MARKET PLACE: U.S. HAS FEW OPTIONS AS YEN DRIFTS LOWER

(JT) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Japanese yen falling to yet new lows and
pulling down financial markets around the world, the United States
finds itself with few options.
</P>
<P>
   It can intervene in the currency markets to support the yen, as
it did in June, or jawbone the Japanese government to stimulate its
economy. But neither maneuver is likely to be very effective in the
absence of drastic measures by the Japanese, a point made
repeatedly by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Back in June, the United States had the element of surprise when
it worked in concert with Japan to prop up the yen, which had
traded as low at 146.78 to the dollar. (As the Japanese currency
weakens, it takes more yen to buy a dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   The move was intended to give the Japanese some breathing room
to implement bold policy changes, changes that have not yet
materialized. Timed just before President Clinton's trip to China,
the intervention was also intended to placate the Chinese, who had
been sending signals that a further decline in the yen would force
them to devalue their currency, the yuan. A Chinese devaluation
would deepen the financial crisis in Asia and reverberate through
world financial markets, perhaps setting off other devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   After the intervention, the yen rallied, rising to 136.75 to the
dollar where it held its ground temporarily. The Chinese reassured
the president that they would not devalue.
</P>
<P>
   The move also helped calm worried financial markets. After the
June 17 intervention, the Dow Jones industrial average took a 7.8
percent runup to its record high of 9,337.97 about a month later.
And foreign stock markets got a lift, albeit a smaller one. Hong
Kong rose and Mexico rallied. Even Canadian stocks got a boost,
although they are now down 19 percent from their 1998 high.
</P>
<P>
   But currency traders view that intervention as a one-time
success. What the United States can only hope is that the yen does
not fall precipitously, but grinds down slowly, said Richard
Medley, the president of Medley Global Advisors, which provides
advice to institutions and hedge funds. To achieve this, he said,
the United States and Japan may be forced to intervene again.
</P>
<P>
   However, a second intervention, he cautions, will be less
effective. For one, traders are expecting it now and have
positioned themselves accordingly. In addition, the new Japanese
government has not convinced investors that it will take the
necessary steps, like tax cuts and banking reform, to revive its
stalled economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling investors to buy the dollar,'' Medley said.
``You may get some smoothing intervention, but don't expect it to
be an effort to reverse the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the falling yen has become a sell signal on the world
equity markets. How much far can it fall? It won't be difficult for
the yen to hit 150 to the dollar, analysts said Tuesday. In New
York trading, it dropped 0.8 percent to 147.35, its lowest close in
eight years. Some year-end forecasts have the yen down to 180 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no fundamentals supporting the yen,'' said Carl
Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This could spell a stormy end of summer for the financial
markets as investors grapple with a still uncertain outlook for
Asia and its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday and Monday, the weakening yen _ and the specter of a
Chinese currency devaluation it has conjured up for investors _ was
blamed for sharp declines in stock markets and currency markets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation by the Chinese would make its exports cheaper,
taking sales away from other Asian nations that are fighting back
from economic collapse. And it would cut into American corporate
earnings in two ways: American sales would drop even further as the
Chinese and other Asian countries lose purchasing power, and goods
brought into this country would be cheaper, putting downward
pressure on products of American competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks slumped Tuesday in the United States after a bigger rout
overnight in Asia. In Latin America, where a Chinese devaluation is
particularly feared as triggering currency declines, the Brazilian
Bovespa stock index dropped 5.6 percent in two days and the Mexican
Bolsa fell 6.8 percent. The Mexican peso dropped to a record low
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the French CAC 40 was off 2.4 percent, while the
British FTSE 100 fell 2.8 percent, and the German DAX index
declined 3.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunged
3.6 percent, while the Nikkei 225 index in Japan dropped 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices also are following the yen's lead. Oil and
copper prices fell Tuesday on concern that Asian consumption will
slow.
</P>
<P>
   What is complicating the situation for American policy makers is
that investors fear a further decline in the yen will trigger a
Chinese devaluation. Not too long ago, a level of 150 yen to the
dollar appeared to be the line in the sand to hold off the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists, however, argue that there is little direct
correlation between the two currencies. The Japanese and the
Chinese do not compete very much in terms of exports. In addition,
the benefit to China of making its exports cheaper is not enough to
offset the political and social costs of a devaluation on the giant
domestic economy, Weinberg argued.
</P>
<P>
   Medley considers the Chinese trade surplus a more important
gauge than the yen. He said that if the surplus fell to zero _ it
was $20 billion for the first half of the year _ the Chinese would
have to devalue to because it would give China a trade deficit that
would threaten its huge foreign currency reserves. ``We recommend
keeping your eyes on this number for the next few months, rather
than newswire headlines,'' he told clients.
</P>
<P>
   But the yen-yuan devaluation link has taken hold, in part
because the June intervention was seen as a response to complaints
from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are portfolio managers we speak to who have set sell
orders on their emerging market portfolios that are linked to the
level of the yen,'' said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange
strategist at BankBoston. While he does not think the link is
appropriate, he said a lot of these orders are bunched at 150 yen
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg of High Frequency Economics concludes, ``The perception
is more important than the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that a weakening yen could become more disruptive to
financial markets, even if China is not compelled to devalue its
currency, because even if there is no yen-yuan link, the markets
see it that way for now. ``China, Japan and the United States are
connected in every trader's mind,'' Fand said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which would
conduct any future intervention, cannot afford to become ``the
policemen of world financial markets,'' he said. Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Fed, he said, ``doesn't even want to be
responsible for the fate of the Dow.''

TURMOIL IN JAPAN UNDERCUTS US MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ US stocks fell abruptly Tuesday after turmoil in
Japan's markets set off a round-the-world rout. The Dow Jones
industrial average tumbled 258 points by early afternoon, but
recovered partially to end the day off 112.
</P>
<P>
   The decline continued a sharp ``correction'' that has sliced
nearly 10 percent of US stock prices since mid-July, though many
individual issues have suffered losses of 20 percent or more. While
many investors remain bullish, there is growing concern on Wall
Street that a bear market could be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed a new report on Japan's economic troubles as the
spark for Tuesday's selloff, but said other factors were at work
too. They include more general fears about Asia, including worries
about a destabilizing devaluation of the Chinese yuan; mounting
evidence that corporate America cannot keep churning out
ever-larger profits; and concerns the US economy may be slipping
from its near-perfect alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid all the talk about Japan and Asia, we may be taking our
eyes off the ball,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for John
Hancock Financial Services in Boston. ``The apparent momentum of
job growth, income growth, and consumer spending in the US may be
more fragile than it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   American investors rushed to dump bank and technology stocks
thought to be especially dependent on Asian business, pushing the
Dow down 1.3 percent to 8462.85 and other market measures down a
similar fraction.
</P>
<P>
   That still means that the 30-stock average is up for the year,
but only 7 percent, a paltry amount compared to the 30 percent-plus
gains investors have come to expect in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and financial fragility were certainly apparent
elsewhere in the world Tuesday as markets from Budapest to Buenos
Aires plunged.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock exchange suspended trading for 45 minutes
after its RTS stock index fell 9.1 percent to a two-year low.
Mexican shares fell 2.8 percent while Brazil's bourse lost 4.1
percent. Bellweather indexes in Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and
Sweden lost 2 percent or more. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index
drop 1.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in areas where we haven't seen serious trouble, we're
seeing it now,'' said Joyce Change, emerging markets director for
Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few bright spots in overseas news Tuesday, British
Petroleum said it would buy Chicago-based Amoco Corp. in a
stock-and-debt deal valued at about $53 billion. It would be the
largest-ever foreign acquisition of a US company, eclipsing
Daimler-Benz A.G.'s $44.3 billion purchase of Chrysler Corp.
announced in May, and create
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the takeover was part of the firms' efforts
to cope with some of the lowest crude oil prices in 12 years, and
predicted that other large energy company combinations are in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Tuesday's news out of Japan seemed minor. The
country's Economic Planning Agency, an organization that's roughly
equivalent to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, simply
changed the term it uses to describe Japan's economic condition
from ``stagnation'' to ``slump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was simply a recognition of what everybody else knows. It
was just a little less rosy than usual,'' said Arthur Alexander,
president of the Japan Economic Institute, a Washington-based think
tank partially funded by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   But the change together with fears that the new government of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi may not win approval of financial
reform legislation was enought to sent virtually every stock market
in the world spiraling downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has turned into a policymakers' nightmare, and that's
making people realize that Asia is a lot worse off than the markets
have thought until now,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist for
Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the Asian crisis, analysts have been sharply
trimming their forecasts of US corporate profits, and many now
predict that profits will grow only about 4 percent this year, a
dramatic change from the double-digit growth during most of the
1990s. As profit growth has slowed, stock prices have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Tuesday's market tumble together with other
recent declines, like last week's nearly 300-point drop in the Dow,
have finally begun to catch up with a handful of big-company stocks
whose recent rise helped prop up major market indexes and mask the
fact that most stocks have been sliding for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chosen few are finally being affected,'' said Robert J.
Barbera, chief economist for Hoenig &AMP; Co., a New York regional
brokerage. ``The amazing thing is not that the market has held up
so well in the face of Asia. The amazing thing is that a short list
of stocks held up so well and gave the appearance of a market that
had not been tarnished by Asia,'' he said.

THE TROCKS, VETERANS NOW, TAKE THEIR FUN SERIOUSLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo began life on
an evening in late fall 1974, in a small meeting room at the West
Side Discussion Group, a gay social center far west on 14th Street
in Manhattan. That first season was short, though eagerly attended.
</P>
<P>
   The way had been paved three years earlier by the pioneering
Original Trocadero Gloxinia Ballet. The stage was essentially a
space cleared for dancing. The scenery trembled. What props there
were tended to be cleverly functional.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday, the all-male Trocks, as the group is
affectionately known, perform at the Joyce Theater for a one-week
season. Fresh from a highly successful engagement in Japan, where
they have a large and loyal audience and even a fan club, the
dancers will take off right after their appearance at the Joyce for
performances in South Africa and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   They have risen up on their loaf-sized points everywhere from
Billings, Mont., to St. Petersburg, Russia, once the world capital
of classical ballet, and have performed in television specials
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Trocks audience is likely to include dance aficionados
and novices of all ages. Children tend to laugh the loudest and
longest at the high jinks of such noted ballerina characters as
Colette Adaie, Ida Nevassayneva and Fifi Barkova, who are partnered
by a male contingent that includes the Legupski brothers Dimitri
and Vladmire, Velour Pilleaux and Kilroy Wazir.
</P>
<P>
   But the ladies can knock off 32 fouettes with the best of them.
And the repertory has widened and deepened, with a return to
lovingly performed classics after a too-close brush with broad
Keystone Kops-style comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Trocks once specialized in romps with names like ``A Ball on
Night Mountain.'' At the Joyce, they will perform the ``Pas
d'Odalisques,'' a choreographic jewel from ``Le Corsaire'' also
seen this summer in a new production by American Ballet Theater at
the Metropolitan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   The Joyce repertory also includes the New York premiere of
``Stars and Stripes Forever,'' choreographed by Robert La Fosse, a
principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, and set, like
George Balanchine's ``Stars and Stripes,'' to march music by John
Philip Sousa.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will also get their first chance to see the Trock
production of a famous excerpt from the 1844 ballet ``La
Vivandiere,'' staged for the company, like the Odalisques trio, by
Elena Kunikova, a former principal dancer with the Russian Maly
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. The genteel notices about ``homophile''
events that were pinned to the bulletin board of the 14th Street
center have been replaced by broadsheet calls to gay action that
plaster lightposts throughout the Joyce's Chelsea neighborhood. Men
taking ballet class in toe shoes are no longer quite the anomaly
they were in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   And dancers, once loath to admit that they were performing with
the Trocks, now receive leaves of absence from their jobs with
mainstream dance companies to appear with the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can't do (italics)that,''(end italics) Brian Norris, who
plays the hulking ballerina Vanya Verikosa and her brother Andrei,
told himself a decade ago when he saw an audition notice for the
Trocks. Norris had come to New York from Grants Pass, Ore., intent
on becoming a Broadway gypsy.
</P>
<P>
   At home he had performed with the State Ballet of Oregon. A
stint in the East followed with the Rochester City Ballet. But jobs
were otherwise few. Dancing with the Trocks, whom he joined in
1994, eventually seemed like a bearable alternative to waiting
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a small town,'' Norris said by telephone from
Tokyo. ``I had a lot of `What will the neighbors think?' in me. But
I grew up. I grew out. My parents have been to the show four times
and loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief ingredient in the ``growing up'' of the Trocks has
been the artistic direction of Tory Dobrin, who joined the company
in 1980. Like all company members, Dobrin plays both a male and a
female dancer. As Adam Baum, he occasionally hoists his Swan Queens
with a grunt modeled after that of tennis player Steffi Graf, an
idol. But Dobrin has come to feel that the Trocks have a serious
role to play in ballet.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Trockadero performances of the Russian classics are now one of
the few places one can still see undiluted ``tutu ballets,'' danced
with old-style Soviet commitment and panache.
</P>
<P>
   For all the jokes, the Trocks' affection and erudition shine
through in the heightened technical skills that are also to be
found in dance in general today, and in details like exquisite
costuming and the hiring of Ms. Kunikova as a guest coach.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin is returning to the Russian ballet of the 1960s that he
came to love on videos broadcast by the television station of the
City University of New York in the 1980s. ``At first it seemed so
mannered,'' Dobrin recalled. ``Then it seemed so complete. We just
take it three steps further.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Trocks who asked La Fosse to create ``Stars and
Stripes Forever,'' danced by Balanchine-style regiments with the
corps playing stripes. They are adding Merce Cunningham's 1964
``Cross Currents'' to their repertory, to be staged by Meg Harper
and danced straightforwardly, with no jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin's approach to performing is a key to the company's
philosophy. In an era in which drag acts are now an accepted part
of the American cultural fabric, it is possible to move beyond the
idea of impersonation and have audiences follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Trockadero, Dobrin says emphatically, is not about drag
queens. There is more Margaret Thatcher than Margot Fonteyn in his
female character, Margaret Lowin-Octeyn, D.B.E.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put on the makeup, you're putting on a personality
you've created in your own mind,'' Dobrin said. ``First you develop
the character you play, then you approach the ballet with that in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris does not think of himself as female when he plays Madame
Verikosa. ``I'm me,'' he said. ``I'm Brian doing Odette. I'm
trying, in `Swan Lake,' to be true to the choreography and
technique and make the emotion and character big. I'm playing it
straight, with a twist.''
</P>
<P>
   He lets the audience know he is ``just a dancer playing a
part,'' he said, however many images that role may have in the hall
of mirrors that is the Trockadero.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the company lasted a good deal longer than many other
dance troupes, with an enviable 40 weeks of work, at a living wage,
most years? Dobrin was able to fine-tune the company repertory and
style when he worked several years ago for the impresario who
produced the Trocks. Not knowing that Dobrin danced with the
company, tour presenters were unguarded in their comments.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial factor in the company's longevity, however, has
likely been the simplicity of its operations, presided over since
1974 by Eugene McDougle, the general director.
</P>
<P>
   Business is conducted from McDougle's Upper West Side apartment.
The Trocks' carefully maintained records are stored in a closet at
the home of the company archivist, Anne Dore Davids. The Trocks
rehearse in rented studios. Costumes and sets were moved out of
McDougle's basement into storage at an insurance company's
insistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never been given any National Endowment for the Arts
or state funding, which meant that we didn't have to build a
superstructure with as many or more administrators as dancers,''
McDougle said. ``We had to live by our wits and what we made, which
allowed us to scale back to zero if necessary. We have lived or
died not by the decisions of some committee someplace but by what
happens on the stage.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: San Diego Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 10:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (15-5, 1.53;
18-10, 2.62 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Andy Ashby (15-6, 2.55;
3-2, 4.63 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: With the run support he has been getting lately, it's a
wonder Maddux is winning at all. After scoring an average of 4.9
runs for him in the first half, the Braves have fallen quiet on the
days Maddux has pitched, averaging 2.7 runs in his six starts since
the All-Star break. Maddux has gone 3-3 in those games, only
because he allowed no earned runs in two starts and allowed a
single earned run in a third. It hasn't hurt that Maddux continues
to lead the majors in ERA (1.53) and shutouts (five). Pitching in
San Diego has provided a challenge for him during the years. His
ERA in 16 starts at Qualcomm is 2.72 (just .01 above his career
ERA), yet he has just an 8-7 record at the park. His next victory
will be his 200th. Ashby, who began the season as the Padres' third
starter, is keeping pace with ace Kevin Brown, losing just once in
his last eight starts and only twice in almost 11 weeks. He has
limited opponents to two runs or fewer in six of his last nine
starts and has made hitters work to get on base. Ashby has
permitted only three walks in his last 50 innings.

 &HT;    Commentary: King of spin a hype heavyweight
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If hype is the true art of the age, then Don King is
the greatest artist of our time, greater than Updike, greater than
Springsteen. The surpassing contradiction is that Don King has
become a multimillionaire by peddling lesser performers when it is
he who is the, ahem, Real Deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he emceed a press conference at the Georgia Dome,
his intent to publicize a prizefight. Three heavyweight champs and
one mayor were on the dais, but it was clear who was the star. In
the span of 90 minutes, the former felon was poet and historian,
missionary and visionary, huckster without peer or shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I've had the opportunity to address Atlanta as
a free man,'' Don King called it, having only recently thrown off
``the shackles and fetters of investigation and indictment.'' He
mentioned Powerball, then said: ``Numbers is my game. Of course,
when I was doing it, they wanted to put you in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He introduced a woman in the audience, prompting a riff about
the role women played in abolition. A question about a possible TV
blackout sent him across the Pond _ ``In England, everything is
televised live and everything is sold out'' _ and then back to the
Revolution: ``Thirteen colonies beat England.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to Vaughn Bean, the nominal challenger who arrived
beneath a red hat almost as tall as King's own famed mane. ``He's
wearing a turban, but he didn't come here to tell your fortune.''
Noting Bean's faith, he said: ``Muslims should pay (to see the
fight). They've got all the oil.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a war as, in essence, Ted Turner's big break.
``CNN is No. 1 worldwide, and it never would have happened if he
didn't have Desert Storm.'' He called a kickboxer to the podium,
referring to him as ``the Frenchman from France.'' Of this same
intrepid individual, Don King also said: ``He's white, but he can
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much money Evander Holyfield was actually ``risking''
by fighting in his hometown, Don King shrugged. ``Numbers would
only depreciate what he's doing.'' No media person seized upon this
world-class deflection and dared to follow up. We were all in the
master's thrall.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Don King lauded Holyfield as ``a heavyweight
champion human being.'' On the night Holyfield's ear was bitten,
Don King was handling Mike Tyson. ``We're moving on,'' he said, no
irony in his tone. ``Now I am preaching Holyfield.'' Should the
champ somehow be toppled six weeks hence, doubtless his handler
will move on yet again, this time to Bean, whom Don King said
Tuesday reminded him of a coffee commercial: ``Juan Valdez, the
Colombian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House has been credited with perfecting spin.
That ignores history. Don King was spinning like a Maytag when Bill
Clinton was off at Oxford not inhaling. On Tuesday, he was at it
still, hyping a pedestrian fight by injecting life into old lines:
``It's the irresistible force against the immovable object!
Something's got to give!'' Here Don King smiled hugely, a singer
reworking his greatest hit. ``And give it will! On Sept. 19! Here
in the Georgia Dome!''
</P>
<P>
   Me, I felt like applauding.

 &HT;    Piney canyons await players at Sahalee
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ We've gone from Winged Foot to a place where
you might spot Big Foot. When the PGA Championship hits the tube
Thursday, don't be surprised if you see some lumberjack shirts in
place of the usual squadron of Ashworths and Izods. Sahalee Country
Club, which hosts this week's PGA Championship, is a course that
might promote drivers to be removed from bags and replaced by chain
saws.
</P>
<P>
   Towering Douglas firs, cedars and hemlocks line every fairway
with such claustrophobic proximity that accuracy off the tee is
even more necessary than usual at a major championship. They say
Sahalee means ``high heavenly ground.'' It ought to be: ``Is there
no ground here off the fairway without a tree on it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best way to prepare for this course would have
been to go to a big city like New York and maybe play down Fifth
Avenue,'' said Lee Janzen, whose game was precise enough to prevail
at the abnormally narrow Olympic Club two months ago. ``I've played
courses this tight maybe somewhere, but I don't think the trees
were this tall. Here, you have no opportunity to work the ball out
over any trees. They're just too tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons of choice for longer hitters are going to be 3-woods
and 2-irons. Tiger Woods said Tuesday he plans to hit no drivers.
Of course, it helps when your 3-wood goes 280 yards and your 2-iron
260. Considering the flailing John Daly has been doing lately, he
might want to stick with 7-irons. The frustration level for missing
the fairway has the potential for a new PGA record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could be a fly on the guys' golf bags,'' Janzen said,
``you might hear some words you've never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Fred Couples, who grew up in the Seattle area and shaped
his game on such piney tunnels, respects the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the golf course can be had if you just keep the ball
in play,'' said Couples, who had not seen Sahalee since 1978.
``Normally, if you're in the rough, there's not too many trees in
the way. Here if you try to do too much and you try to go a little
bit around a tree, it's hard to maneuver the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a week requiring extreme patience, which could
rule out tirade-and-tantrum-prone players such as Woods and Colin
Montgomerie. The player who can force himself to take less club,
hit it straight and rely on his shaping skills on iron approaches
to the greens is more liable to find the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   While the rough was advertised as being in the four-inch range,
it is much longer in some areas. In some cases, that could work to
the players' advantage. Although deeper rough will require a
loftier escape club, it might keep misguided tee shots from running
farther into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a low, straight shot off the tee and a high, soft
shot into the greens,'' Bob Estes said. ``That's a complete game.''

 &HT;    Anyone remember Pebble Beach?
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the stranger bits of scheduling in PGA Tour history,
the rain-shortened AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Invitational will be completed
Monday, seven months after it started and then was interrputed by
El Nino. In case you've forgotten, with 18 holes remaining there
are a pair of co-leaders _ Tom Watson and Tim Herron at 10-under
par. Sea Island's Davis Love III is two shots back. To help ease
the logistical problems of the situation, the PGA Tour arranged a
chartered jet from Seattle Sunday night to get the players to
Carmel, Calif. Herron joked months ago, ``I wonder if anyone has
ever led a tournament for this long.''

   Nobilo really needs an eye patch
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Frank Nobilo took 30 stitches above his left eye
recently at the Lake Nona Golf Club in Florida, where he's a
member, when, while driving in a cart, he was felled by a ball hit
from the range. Doctors told him that being struck just a hair in
either direction could have caused blindness or even death. ...
Callaway Golf will debut a new line of metal woods today, the
Steelhead driver and fairway woods. Priced in the $175 range, they
are Callaway's market combatant to the Adams Tight Lies and Orlimar
TriMetal fairway woods. ... Tiger Woods is still using buddy Mark
O'Meara's backup putter, a Ping Anser2. The transition was not
difficult. He used a similar model as an amateur. With a slightly
longer shaft than his former Scotty Cameron model, the putter
allows Woods to stand over the ball a little taller. ``I'm able to
see the line better,'' Woods said. ``I'm not as hunched over.''
When Woods finished a shot behind O'Meara at the British Open,
O'Meara said,chuckling, ``That's why it's my backup putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples and Lynx a question mark
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples was surprised by a question Tuesday that forced a
comment on the struggling Lynx Golf Co., in which he's both a
representative and has a co-ownership position. Couples was asked
about the Maxfli irons he is using, replacing the Lynx irons that
used to occupy his bag. He remains with the Lynx driver, which he
is still ``killing.'' Said Couples a bit awkwardly, ``A lot of my
other clubs, they're six and seven years old ... but Lynx is
struggling and I really couldn't get a new set. A lot of the
grooves that I had are worn out.'' He grew fond of Maxfli's irons
in Britain while testing some balls at the company's trailer.
``Right now they're really debating what to do at Lynx,'' Couples
said. ``I've tried to stay out of that.''

 &HT;    Angry Floridians at odds over Black College Reunion
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Atlanta has struggled with Freaknik, and
now this beach resort is grappling with widespread unhappiness over
Black College Reunion, an annual event that was marred in April
when four police officers were shot and a black youth killed in a
gunfight.
</P>
<P>
   Angry residents _ most of them white _ want the city to actively
discourage the 10-year-old event, which this year was officially
recognized by Daytona Beach for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But other residents _ most of them black _ say the city isn't
treating black visitors the same as it does others who come to
special events such as Bike Week and Race Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking strict enforcement of the law, let's have it
for all the events, not just Black College Reunion,'' said Richard
Moore, a black resident. ``I'm tired of the traffic gridlock during
(Daytona 500) Race Week.''
</P>
<P>
   At a contentious meeting Tuesday, city commissioners discussed
recommendations by a citizens committee that reviewed the 1998
reunion, which despite city recognition drew widespread complaints
about gridlock, drunkenness, sex in public, loud stereos and
littering.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners were not scheduled to vote on whether to withdraw
their recognition of the event, but instead were to consider only
suggestions for improving next year's reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the issue has threatened to divide the city along
racial lines. Daytona Beach has hosted other, mostly white public
festivals for decades, including Spring Break and Bike Week, the
annual invasion of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, both those events have also drawn public criticism,
and city officials made efforts to tame rowdy crowds by increasing
police presence, tightly controlling traffic flow, strictly
enforcing public drinking prohibitions and offering more organized
events to entertain revelers.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy for the 1998 Black College Reunion.
Previously an unofficial gathering of college students and others
who came to town for a weekend in April, the event this year had a
promoter recognized by the city who planned an array of concerts,
contests and other events that were supposed to help tame the
rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the concerts drew only tiny audiences, as did most of the
other organized activities. The estimated 110,000 visitors seemed
mostly interested in cruising, and their cars jammed streets on the
beach, leading to gridlock that outraged many residents.
</P>
<P>
   Revelers hung from trunks and out of car windows, some tossing
litter freely, while others drank alcohol in public, and many of
the young men chased and accosed women, some of whom were
scantily-clad.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions boiled over when the gunfight occurred in which an
Orlando youth was killed and police officers were taunted by
hostile crowds. The gun battle renewed the debate over the issue,
with many residents saying it was the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   City officials quickly appointed the 15-member biracial
committee to study the affair. But even the panel couldn't agree,
with a majority recommending the city continue recognizing the
event, while four members submitted a separate report calling on
the city to severe its ties to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suggestions of the majority report:
</P>
<P>
   _ Include in advertising and mailings to black colleges and
universities information about the city's code of conduct
discouraging lewd and rowdy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus marketing efforts on the schools, and try to get
endorsements from school presidents and student leaders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the word out through the media and at the schools that
laws will be strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give notice of traffic checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give police authority to close bridges to the beach if
necessary to control traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a better traffic plan and cut down on cruising.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a Human Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work with the African-American community to get its support
for stricter law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage hotels to work with the universities to develop
pre-registration procedures that will include providing
identification to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the suggestions was heated at times, on the
commission and from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Burke, who served on the panel, said he feared the city
could not afford to provide enough police to keep the event safe.
He suggested having the National Guard on standby, saying, ``We
came within a hair's breadth of riots and destruction this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, however, said commissioners were threatening to violate
the rights of the black attendees. ``These kids are going to come
back whether you like it or not,'' he said. ``As citizens of this
country, they have the right to go anywhere they please.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the commission's final actions, debate over the event
seems likely to simmer for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters in my zone have told me they don't want Black
College Reunion_ever,'' said Commissioner Christina Travis, who
lives on the beach. ``It is not a reunion. It's a street party that
has overflowed into the neighborhoods.''

FOR ROLLING STONES' MOSCOW FANS, SATISFACTION AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Mick Jagger said it all, in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, we are here,'' the 55-year-old rock star yelled into
the microphone, his voice booming across a sports stadium filled
with about 50,000 cheering Russians. Many had waited 20, even 30,
years to see the Rolling Stones, live and in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans at Tuesday night's concert _ an extravaganza of smoke,
lights and special effects, dampened only somewhat by a cold rain _
had been teen-agers when the Stones were at the peak of their
popularity. In those days, their records _ or copies of their
records, ingeniously made on X-ray film _ were traded like illicit
treasure in Moscow's subway tunnels and dark courtyards, out of the
sight of the Soviet police.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone. The Communist authorities _ who, like
tyrannical parents, had feared rock `n' roll and tried to keep it
away from young people _ fell from power seven years ago. But still
the Stones had not come to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Pink Floyd came. So did Michael Jackson. But not the Stones, the
group that, with the Beatles, best evoked the sad and funny
travails of being a teen-ager in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I wouldn't live long enough,'' said Andrei, 42, a
Moscow businessman who came to the concert Tuesday night at the
Luzhniki stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Simeon, 40, a television producer who, like Andrei, declined to
give his last name, said, ``For me, it is enough if they just walk
out on stage. Why? Because for us they are a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stones began the concert with `` Satisfaction,'' which the
crowd happily joined in, word for word. By trying to keep their
youths away from Western mass culture, the Soviet authorities
succeeded only in making them commit its lyrics and music to
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on rock music meant that there were no locally produced
records. Western labels were brought in, in small quantities, by
tourists, diplomats and sailors and sold on the black market for as
much as a student's monthly stipend.
</P>
<P>
   Copies were made on reel-to-reel tapes, or on disks cut from
used X-ray film _ known as ``bones'' because of the vaguely visible
X-ray images _ on which the groves of vinyl records could be
etched.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with their idols, fans had to scrounge for their
pictures in foreign magazines, or scout Soviet music products for
the occasional lapse in vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the Soviet record company Melodia included the
Beatles' song ``Girl'' in a multi-record series on music from
around the world. The song was titled ``Folk Music and Lyrics,''
without identifying the group. The record quickly sold out, as did
a record put out in the 1970s with several songs by the Stones, who
were identified only as an ``English vocal and instrumental
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian bands succeeded in playing Paul McCartney tunes on road
trips by identifying their author as Pavel Makarov on the list of
songs submitted to local culture authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, in an interview on Russian television, recalled the
non-negotiable ``nyet'' delivered by the formidable Yekaterina
Furtseva, the Soviet minister of culture, when the idea of a Moscow
concert was broached in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, fans see the effort, and skill, that went into
keeping up with the youth revolution in the West not so much as
absurd, but as almost heroic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the times we lived in,'' said Maxim Katchalin, a
37-year-old public relations director. ``They laid down the rules.
We looked for the exceptions. Now we live in other times, but maybe
we should look back with pride at how we got around those rules.
Maybe if they had allowed us everything, it would not have been as
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasily Kapko, a 44-year-old driver who grew up in Ukraine on the
Soviet Union's western borders, had no trouble following the
Beatles, the Stones and all the other groups that came after them;
he just turned on the radio and picked up European stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it, so I listened,'' he said. ``It was all there.
There were those who had the money to buy the records, and those
who didn't have the money found a friend who did and made tapes. In
the end, everybody listened.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kapko, Tuesday night's concert was mostly a trip down memory
lane. He has not kept up with the Stones and his children prefer
punk and grunge to rock `n' roll. ``It was our youth,'' he said.
``I couldn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, some fans said wistfully, 20 years is just too long
to wait. ``I don't like to say it, but I think of this as an
exhibition at a museum,'' Katchalin said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their 50s and 60s, the Stones look their age, even if
they do not act it, and the audience, by its reactions, revealed
its own generation gap. The 30- and 40-something crowd came alive
for the golden oldies, while the younger generation, in their 20s,
were happier with the newer songs, like ``Love Is Strong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moscow, a city still struggling to achieve normality, the
stopover by the Stones here during their much-touted ``Bridges to
Babylon'' European tour was a sign that it too makes the grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having seen the Rolling Stones live, we become like everyone
else, at least in this field of human endeavor,'' noted a
commentator in the newspaper Moscow News. It was left to papers
close to the now enfeebled Communist Party to note that the Stones
came here only ``in their declining years.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a local radio station, in a zany talk show broadcast
after the concert, that put the Moscow appearance of the Stones in
new historical perspective by staging an imaginary phone linkup
between Lenin, the long-dead founder of the Soviet state
fictitiously resurrected and performing at New York's Carnegie
Hall, and Mick Jagger, talking from Moscow, comparing concert
notes.

BELEAGUERED BOSTON COLUMNIST ALLOWED TO KEEP HIS JOB

GLOBE-BARNICLE-BOS and GLOBE-BARNICLE-REACT-BOS) 
(mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe gave Mike Barnicle a reprieve Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of lobbying by supporters of the popular
columnist and after 30 hours of meetings and telephone conferences
among the newspaper's top executives, Matthew Storin, The Globe's
editor, announced at a crowded staff meeting that he would no
longer demand Barnicle's resignation but had imposed a two-month
suspension instead.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Storin said he had been
``persuaded by the argument that the punishment doesn't fit the
crime.'' Barnicle's offense _ using jokes in an Aug. 2 column that
paralleled the writings of the comedian George Carlin _ originally
brought him a one-month suspension, after he told editors he had
not read Carlin's book.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a local television station, WCVB-TV, broadcast a
videotape of a June 22 program showing Barnicle recommending the
book as summer reading. The editors in Boston called Storin, who
was on vacation in Italy, he said. The decision to ask for
Barnicle's resignation, Storin said, ``was urged on me and I urged
it on the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnicle refused to resign. After he pleaded his case to the
listeners of Don Imus' radio program and to the audience of NBC's
``Today'' show last week, the newspaper was deluged with calls,
e-mail and letters, heavily in Barnicle's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ultimately we tried to be fair to everybody,'' said
the newspaper's publisher, Benjamin Taylor. ``To Matt, to the
editors, to Mike and most importantly to the newspaper and the
staff. He added that a well-publicized letter the chief executive
of Staples sent him on Friday questioning whether it was worth
advertising in a newspaper that didn't carry Barnicle's work ``was
not a factor in our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, in turn, offered more in the way of public apologies
than he has since the furor erupted last Wednesday, changing his
earlier defiant tone to one of contrition. ``I apologized to Matt,
I apologized to the publisher for putting the newspaper in this
terribly awkward position due to my own personal sloppiness,'' he
said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be sloppy in the summer of media
introspection,'' Barnicle added. ``I caused great distress for a
great many good people who work hard every single day to put this
paper out.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision left The Globe's newsroom deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy boy today because I think the management did the
right thing,'' said David Nyhan, like Barnicle an associate editor
at the paper and a longtime member of the paper's staff. ``I am
vastly relieved. I am proud of the publisher and the editor for
reversing a stand that was taken in too much haste.''
</P>
<P>
   But others complained, sometimes bitterly, of a double standard.
Though no one argued that Barnicle's offense was comparable to the
repeated fabrications that led to the forced resignation of the
columnist Patricia Smith earlier this summer, several people argued
passionately that Barnicle got special treatment. Ms. Smith is
black and Barnicle is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not solely a racial issue. It is a credibility
issue,'' said Howard Manly, the sports media critic for The Globe.
``The Boston Globe suffered a significant hit as a result of
management's indecisiveness. The paper will require years to
overcome the perception that it is in fact an institution where the
old-boy network flourishes,'' added Manly, who described himself as
``black first, a journalist second.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Barnicle and the paper's editors, Manly said: ``I totally
feel for them. Here was a guy who fought for his job and was
afforded every reasonable doubt. But would that happen to me or any
of the other 300 or 400 or so reporters in the building? No.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``What Pat Smith did was disgusting. But how this
particular case was handled suggests, to me at least, that there
are some people who are larger than one of the oldest newspapers in
the country.''

 &HT;    Merger might cost Ohioans jobs
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Delphi Automotive Systems will partially merge
two of its seven major automotive parts divisions in a move that
could eliminate some white-collar jobs in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Delphi, the huge automotive parts unit of the
General Motors Corp., said Tuesday the company will combine parts
of its Kettering-based Delphi Chassis Systems with its Delphi
Energy &AMP; Engine Management Systems division in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the move, company officials said Delphi Chassis will
keep its world headquarters and 360 jobs in Kettering, and no
immediate layoffs are planned.
</P>
<P>
   But further consolidation of the divisions could shrink Delphi's
local corporate work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time we expect that some of our support functions would
be consolidated to eliminate redundancies (in the two divisions),''
said Jim Hagedon, Delphi Chassis spokesman. ``We expect any
reductions in manpower would occur through attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial integration of the two divisions is expected to
affect personnel, finance and other supporting departments, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Alan S. Dawes, the highest ranking
Dayton-area executive for the General Motors Corp., has been named
Delphi's chief financial officer. Dawes, 43, has been the general
manager of the Delphi Chassis division since 1994 and will relocate
from Kettering to Delphi's world headquarters in Troy, Mich. He
will also maintain his status as a GM vice president and will
report directly to J.T. Battenberg III, president of Delphi
Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes will be replaced as Delphi Chassis general manager by Guy
C. Hachey, who recently served as director of manufacturing for the
Delphi Interior and Lighting division in Warren, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the new operating structure, Hachey will report
directly to Donald L. Runkle, general manager of Delphi's energy
division.
</P>
<P>
   Runkle will be the top executive in both Delphi Chassis and
Delphi Energy, but company officials said the move doesn't reduce
the power of its locally-based Chassis division.
</P>
<P>
   Battenberg said the partial consolidation of Delphi Chassis and
Delphi Energy is designed to reduce infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The integration) will sharpen both division's focus on sales,
marketing and engineering, while maintaining each division's
individual product lines and customer relationships,'' Battenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   GM said last week it will turn its parts unit into an
independent company by next year.
</P>
<P>
   When the spin-off is completed, only Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base will employ more people locally than Delphi. The world's
largest maker of auto parts employs 15,000 workers in seven area
plants, making the Dayton metropolitan area Delphi's No. 1 U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say communities with a large Delphi presence can expect
more consolidation and cost-cutting as the spin-off approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of cost cutting and consolidation is happening all
over GM and Delphi. It's what Wall Street has been begging the
company to do for years,'' said David Cole, director of the Office
for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of
Michigan. ``There are cost overlaps in Delphi's divisions and I'm
sure they'll continue to eliminate those,'' he said.

 &HT;    Ohio plants to be expanded by GM
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. is planning a third major
investment at it's Moraine facilities in about a year, a $65
million expansion of the Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems, company
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The project would retain 375 jobs, making the next generation of
car air-conditioning compressors in a renovated,
300,000-square-foot building, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said employment could reach 700 at the expanded
site. The company wants to begin production of the compressors by
next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first phase in a number of phases to bring a brand
new family of compressors into reality,'' said Jerry Jackson,
manager of the Thermal Systems plant.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials presented the plan to the Montgomery County
Commission on Tuesday, seeking support for a 75 percent, 10-year
tax abatement for the project, equipment and inventory. The
commission will not vote on the matter until later this month, but
two commissioners _ Don Lucas and Charles Curran _ indicated
support on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moraine City Council is expected to vote on the abatement
Thursday. Because it is a 75 percent abatement, the
Kettering-Moraine City School District does not have to give its
approval. However, a tax incentive review committee, made up of
officials from the school district and the cities of Kettering and
Moraine, approved the abatement last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the school district) do informally support the
abatement,'' said Jerold Steck, treasurer for the school district
and a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   GM is considering putting the new operation in a vacant building
recently used as an Autoworks Warehouse, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   GM employs 3,600 workers at the Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems
operations. Workers not shifted to the new plant will continue to
produce the air conditioning units they do now, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said agreements with the International Union of Electrical
Workers Local 801, which represents the plant's work force, allows
the company to use teams of workers in the new plant and teach team
work concepts. Having a more flexible work force was necessary to
help convince the company to invest in the plant, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the competitive agreement that was recently
negotiated we probably wouldn't be here,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   IUE Local 801 Shop Chairman Donnie G. Owens said the plant,
which is expected to be spun off from GM when Delphi Automotive
Systems becomes a separate company next year, will be able to sell
auto air conditioners to any car maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're spun off we can sell to anybody,'' Owens said.
``We can put them on anything, anyone who wants them.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, GM has initiated two other major
investments at its Moraine works: a $355 million expansion of the
truck assembly plant, and a $320 million joint investment with
Isuzu Motors Ltd. on a 400-employee diesel engine plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company received tax abatements on both projects.
</P>
<P>
   Moraine Mayor Roger Matheny supported using tax abatements to
retain jobs. He said the city has kept its auto-industry employment
high by being willing to offer tax incentives to encourage GM to
stay and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to retain in order to gain,'' Matheny said.

IN WAKE OF BOMBINGS, SEVERAL U.S. EMBASSIES SUSPEND OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related: AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-TANZANIA, AFRICA-BOMBINGS) 
(HLW) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several American embassies have suspended routine
operations in response to threats made after the terrorist attacks
on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, State Department officials
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition that they not be named,
said that the affected embassies included those in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia and Kampala, Uganda. The embassy in Mbabane, the capital
of the southern African nation of Swaziland, was evacuated for
several hours on Tuesday after a bomb threat. In West Africa, the
American Embassy in the Ivory Coast said it had cut back its
business hours while security was reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo office of the Agency for International Development was
also shuttered and its employees moved into the well-fortified
American Embassy in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they could not recall a similar instance in
recent years in which several American diplomatic installations,
which often get threats of violence, had suspended operations
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has announced a worldwide alert for embassies
and other diplomatic installations after the terrorist attacks last
week. The State Department and Congress have faced criticism since
the attacks that they failed to provide sufficient security for
embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the American diplomatic missions were not given the
upgraded security recommended by a independent commission after the
bombing of the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Bierut in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick F. Kennedy, the assistant secretary of state for
administration, said that the United States was ``not shutting down
embassies in a permanent sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that since the bombings last week, the Department and
its overseas posts had received between one dozen and two dozen
threats, including some considered ``copy cat'' threats of
terrorist attacks mimicking those in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not leaving,'' he said. ``We are taking, in effect, a
brief time-out in order to make the security adjustments that are
necessary to be responsive to a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition that he
not be identified, said that, ``where prudent, we're reducing
staff, we're moving from one building to another, we're reducing
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that Americans living or traveling abroad would
be able to obtain emergency services from all American embassies,
regardless of terrorist threats. ``You will always be able to get
an operator at the embassy and be connected to an a duty officer _
24 hours a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department refused to provide a formal list of the shuttered
embassies out of concern that it might be used by terrorist groups
to identify future targets for attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer not to go into identifying specific embassies,''
Kennedy said at a news conference. ``I think that just probably
leads to more copycat calls.'' The closings, he said, had occurred
in ``several regions'' of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embassies had been closed at the request of
ambassadors or, in their absence, the highest-ranking local
American diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said to our chiefs of mission that they are
responsible to protect the lives and safety of personnel
overseas,'' Kennedy said. ``If the chief of mission feels that
there is information available to him or her that says, `I must
take a particular step, including potentially briefly suspending
operations until adjustments to the security posture can be made,'
then we feel that is absolutely the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not describe the threats that had prompted the decision
to close some embassies, but he said all were being taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a call comes in or whatever it is,'' he said, ``each call
is analyzed and measured and then the post, the ambassador, the
regional security officer, the emergency action committee at the
post does what is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   An American official at the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur,
speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that the
embassy closed its iron gates on Tuesday for all but emergency
services for American citizens. The official said it would remain
closed on Wednesday in order for the embassy compound to be
``hardened'' against a possible terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks of Kuala Lumpur as a terrorist target, but we
want to take every precaution to keep our people safe,'' the
official said. ``I think you'll see additional barricades outside
the embassy later this week, some more barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that the American embassy in
Uganda, which borders both Kenya and Tanzania, was closed on
Tuesday but was expected to reopen on Wednesday with tightened
security measures in force.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, the offices of the Agency for International
Development were closed and its employees moved into the sprawling
compound of the U.S. Embassy, which is considered one of the
best-protected and most security-conscious in the Middle East,
State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has hindered the
conduct of American diplomacy not just in Kenya but across much of
East Africa. The embassy there effectively functioned as a regional
headquarters for the State Department and other American government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Sudan was shut down in
February 1996 in response to evidence that the Sudanese government
was harboring anti-American terrorist groups, the embassy staff was
moved to Nairobi, where they worked out of the now-shattered
embassy building. State Department officials said it was unclear
how diplomatic relations with Sudan would be conducted.

TAILOR-MADE WIN FOR RAYMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ They were the kind of shots that Lisa Raymond
prefers, right down the heart of the court, where she can attack
them. Raymond, ranked 17th in the country and seeded No. 3 in the
Boston Cup took advantage of those shots that her opponent, Amy
Frazier, was hitting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball very solid, with Amy hitting the type of ball
that I like,'' said Raymond, who won, 6-4, 6-2, in the first-round
match of this Corel WTA Tour event. ``She hits very flat and hard.
It's a nice ball. She doesn't hit with a lot of topspin. She hits
it in my strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond looked confident and played aggressively in this match,
which years ago might have been played deeper in a tournament. But
Frazier is now ranked 79th after being as high as 16th in the
country in 1994 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond looked strong on her backhand, which she can hit with
topspin as well as belting it with a slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely effective against any of the girls because
most girls have two-handers so I can mix my backhand a lot more,''
Raymond said. ``But you can't be complacent against Amy. You have
to be aggressive. She's very aggressive, so if you don't take it to
her, she's going to take it to you and put you on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond won the first set by serving out in the 10th game,
taking it at 15 when Frazier hit a forehand long up the line. In
the second, Raymond broke Frazier's serve in the fourth game and
again in the eighth, when she took the match at love.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier nevertheless was pleased with her play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to play my game, getting a lot of first serves
in, and I wanted to try to move her first, but I wasn't able to do
that very much,'' said Frazier. ``She doesn't have any weakness.
She can stay back or come to the net, as well as hit slices or go
with the topper. She was forcing the play and I was making too many
unforced errors.''
</P>
<P>
   In another afternoon singles match, Barbara Schett won for the
first time in a while on a hardcourt. Not since the middle of
March, at the Lipton Invitational in Key Biscayne, Fla., had she
played on the surface, so Schett spent the first set getting used
to the surface. Then she went to town, routing Kristina Brandi of
Tampa, 6-4, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing on clay a while and everything out here was
so quick,'' said Schett, ranked 29th. ``In the first set, I didn't
know my opponent, but I was moving really well. And then in the
second set, I was confident, playing much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her groundstrokes were penetrating and she caught me off the
court with her angles,'' said Brandi, who was a qualifier. ``She
hits a lot of angles and that tended to get me off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players had problems with the amount of foot traffic
passing by Court 5. Spectators were constantly roaming past to get
to other courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the qualifier they stopped people from walking
around,'' Brandi said. ``We expected them to have some boards up to
force people from not walking through that area. That made it
difficult to play on that court.''

THE ART OF THE ICE CREAM TRUCK

<P>
   The  &UR; Earl of Snowdon &LR; , who used to be married to  &UR; Princess &LR; 
 &UR; Margaret &LR;  and has a lot of opinions, said in London recently that
an ice cream van parked near the Albert Memorial Hall in London was
an eyesore. Whereupon artist  &UR; Edna Weiss &LR;  put tongue in cheek and
pen in hand, writing to the Tate Gallery to suggest that the van,
if parked outside that institution, could be considered a piece of
conceptual art.
</P>
<P>
   Much to her surprise, reports the Times of London (in a story
clipped and forwarded by  &UR; Gladys &LR;   &UR; Perint Palmer &LR; ), curator  &UR; Simon &LR; 
 &UR; Wilson  &LR; of the Tate took her suggestion seriously. Citing the work
of  &UR; Marcel Duchamp &LR; , who found art in a urinal, and  &UR; J.M.W. &LR; 
 &UR; Turner &LR; , who ``also looked at landscape and saw art in it,'' he
said there was precedent for considering the van an aesthetic
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an artist were to designate the ice- &LR;  cream van a work of
art and exhibit it as such,'' he said, ``and if someone were then
to nominate it for the Turner Prize'' (a prestigious art award),
``it might indeed be considered by the jury for short-listing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's point of view _ ``Anything and everything is art,
because an artist says it is'' _ has given rise to vigorous debate
in the British arts community. ``Mr. Wilson has conceptual second
sight,'' wrote  &UR; Simon Jenkins &LR;  in a Times essay. ``He can spot a
Carracci in a Cornetto'' (a British ice cream confection), ``a
Hockney in a Haagen-Dazs, &LR;  and a Watteau in a Mr. Whippy'' (a soft
ice cream).

BELL ATLANTIC STRIKE ENDS AFTER TENTATIVE PACT

   Bringing a swift conclusion to a two-day-old strike that had
begun to inconvenience telephone customers from Maine to Virginia,
Bell Atlantic employees returned to work Tuesday after reaching a
tentative agreement with management that insures that jobs in the
company's high-technology growth areas will go to union employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed two-year contract agreed to Tuesday, the
company guaranteed that all installation, maintenance and repair
work involving advanced data communications for residential and
corporate customers, including access to the Internet, would be
performed by members of the Communications Workers of America. The
company also agreed to phase out hundreds of mostly customer
service jobs now being outsourced to nonunion workers in Hampton,
Va., and put them back into the union's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory,'' said Larry Mancino, a vice
president of District One of the Communications Workers of America.
``There is no contract in this industry that has those kinds of
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic executives described the accord, which is subject
to ratification by the union membership, in more measured terms.
``This is a balanced agreement,'' said Steven Marcus, a company
spokesman. ``It meets the union's needs and it also meets our
customers' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Sacco, executive vice president for human resources, pointed
out that the company retained some leeway in hiring nonunion
workers. ``The contract gives Bell Atlantic the flexibility to
manage its business in an increasingly competitive market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the agreement as a major victory for labor, Paul
Osterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, said the union had scored in two ways _ by
preventing further erosion of jobs and persuading management that
its members are qualified to do high-technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be able to show that they can do those jobs or can
be trained to do those jobs,'' Osterman said. ``I think it's a big
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the recent General Motors strike, wage increases played a
relatively minor role in the Bell Atlantic dispute. The proposed
contract calls for an increase of 3.8 percent in the first year and
4 percent in the second.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``On the pay front, what the union is achieving is holding their
own,'' Osterman said, ``but they are preventing terrific
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, which began at 12:01 Sunday, did not interrupt
basic telephone service for the company's 27 million customers, but
many people were unable to reach directory assistance, place
operator-assisted calls or get their telephone lines repaired or
installed. About 23,500 managers were assigned to perform work
normally done by 73,000 union employees.
</P>
<P>
   The latest walkout and its speedy settlement was a far cry from
1989, when workers at Nynex, which merged with Bell Atlantic last
year, went on strike for four months. This time, negotiators, eager
to avoid a long walkout, worked nonstop even after the contract
expired Sunday, and came to an agreement at 5 a.m. The company was
under pressure to reach a speedy resolution because of competition
that did not exist nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which reduced regulations in
many communications markets, has unleashed a host of hungry new
companies eager to win business away from established phone giants
including Bell Atlantic. Before the act's passage, Bell Atlantic,
along with the rest of the Baby Bell local phone companies, enjoyed
virtual monopolies in many of their markets.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge posed by the new competitors is especially
daunting for older companies like Bell Atlantic because most of the
upstarts have nonunion work forces. Each day that the strike
continued would have afforded Bell Atlantic's competitors another
opportunity to convince Bell Atlantic's customers that they would
be better off with a different phone company.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stock prices of many competitive local phone providers,
including RCN Corp., dropped Tuesday on news of the settlement, but
Bell Atlantic's shares rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilant over the settlement, union officials said they
prevailed on almost every point. Resolving one especially
contentious issue, Bell Atlantic agreed to extend a lucrative early
retirement program that expired when the contract ended. To
discourage eligible workers from taking advantage of the program
immediately, the company agreed to sweeten their pensions if they
defer their departure.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to extend a provision negotiated under
the last contract that prevents it from laying off workers,
downgrading their jobs, or forcing them to transfer from one
location to another during the life of the contract. In addition,
the agreement makes it easier for the union to organize workers at
all Bell Atlantic subsidiaries except Bell Atlantic Mobile, the
cell phone unit, which employs 7,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic will not have to abandon entirely the use of
contract workers. James Dowdall, vice president for labor
relations, said the company would still be able to hire a limited
amount of nonunion labor under certain emergency or peak demand
situations or when it lacked qualified union personnel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Bell Atlantic employees returned to their jobs Tuesday, a
tentative agreement between Southern New England Telecommunications
Inc. and its workers appeared to have run into some problems.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which serves virtually all 3 million residents of
Connecticut, had announced Friday that it had reached a deal with
the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers, but the proposed
contract met resistance from rank-and-file union members.
</P>
<P>
   A threatened walk-out, scheduled for noon Tuesday, was averted
when SNET agreed to reopen negotiations with the 6,200-member union
and talks began under the direction of a federal mediator.

Doak Walker always a hero
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. _ Dick Davis tried to think of something
to say. He never had wondered about such things before. The words
had always come easily, quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But now his friend and hero, a generation's hero, was in a
hospital bed trying to teach himself how to chew his food, and
Davis knew the words had to be right. What could he say? How should
he act? Would he cry? How could he not? Davis practiced lines,
rejecting each. He imagined his friend pinned by paralysis to that
hospital bed and worried about the news his face would surely tell
the moment he walked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they were 6 years old, Doak Walker and Dick Davis
were already old friends. They had been next-door neighbors in East
Dallas. And by the time their families moved to Highland Park, they
had become the sort of friends you keep for life, and they joined
the other neighborhood kids in a local swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   They were fearless, diving deep into the water, until suddenly
Davis was missing. A peg under the water had grabbed Davis by the
shorts and wouldn't let go. Water began filling his lungs. The more
he struggled, the more securely he became trapped beneath the
water's surface. Panic replaced daring.
</P>
<P>
   But his old friend, the sort of friend you can count on, found
Davis beneath the water, pulled him free and saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doak Walker,'' Davis said six decades later, ``was always a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis was on his way to Denver to see his hero unable to
move. For the first time, Davis didn't know what to say. Walker had
been an ideal, a legend and a friend for life, the best athlete and
teammate Davis had ever known or imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had always loved him. Strangers loved him. He had been the
last American hero before television and cynicism changed the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In January, this most graceful of legends was on the last of the
downhill runs' long, swooping arcs he so loved when he crashed on
an intermediate ski slope named ``Rainbow'' he had cruised a
thousand times before. Walker severely bruised his brain stem. He
was left paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up together. We were inseparable. He is like my
brother,'' Davis said. ``But when I walked into the room to see
Doak, I didn't know what to say. I'm never lost for words, but I
was really worried about it. And then I walked in, and he had a
great, big smile on his face. He immediately put me at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, a therapist asked Walker if he would like to try to
say a few words. Walker was still trying to teach himself how to
talk then, but he had the ``cup'' at the end of the long ventilator
tube that runs down his throat into his chest removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him,'' Davis said, ```Is there anything I could do for
you? Is there anything you need, anything you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Walker thought about the question a moment, smiled again, and
forced out a few raspy words: ``How about a cheeseburger and a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens to everybody,'' Hank Edwards, one of
Walker's enormous ``family'' of friends in Steamboat Springs, said.
``When we went to see him the first time, we were really
apprehensive about it. It's really hard to explain, but when we
left, I felt good. His eyes were brilliant and bright. It was just
typical Doak. You don't leave feeling sorry for him. I left
thinking, `this guy's going to make it.' We went to see him, and he
ends up making us feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   America was never more optimistic, more proud than when Doak
Walker was its hero.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, America was prosperous, hopeful, growing,
victorious. When Doak Walker won the Heisman 50 years ago this
season, America cherished its heroes as perfect magazine-cover
reflections of a nation never more sure of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was the first post-war hero, the last before television
brought its power to show everything, including the warts. Heroes
were not created then to sell shoes. They were selected based on
their ability to fit the nation's ideals, the values that had
inspired real heroism in real battles. America was filled with true
believers. It believed in Doak Walker.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Walker did everything for SMU. He was the Mustangs'
top rusher, passer, defender, kick returner, punter and place
kicker. He was their quiet leader and called all the plays.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-10, 175, he was unimpressive at a glance, but that only
served his legend. He was so swift, so agile, he would seem to use
the entire field in a maze of cuts and moves. Walker seemed to
touch every moment that unbeaten 1948 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was gifted,'' Davis said. ``He could do anything. He
had grace, balance, strength, speed. He could do anything, and he
excelled in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Raleigh Blakely, an SMU teammate, ``They talk today about
guys going both ways. When Doak came out of SMU, he was working
both ways all the time. A lot of people don't realize how great he
was on defense. I guess we could all tell you how great he was, but
the thing that stands out to me was there was something about him
in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatness showed up game time on Saturday. Monday through
Friday, I could throw the ball further. There were guys who could
kick the ball further, run faster in a foot race. On Saturday,
there was no peer. When it was game day, he had a gear none of us
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the previous season, when Walker's legend had just started
to grow after his return from the service, the Dallas News
typically wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulging with manpower and versatile skill, the visitors from
Houston (Southwest Conference favorite Rice) will have every
advantage except for the brains and ability wrapped up in the
person of the 175-pound sophomore tailback who grew up in the
shadow of (SMU's) Ownby Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rice is said to be three- and four-deep in all positions and
has speed, strength, spirit and savvy. SMU has Walker and the idea
that he alone will make the contest even.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 14-0 SMU win, Walker carried 12 times for 87 yards,
completed four of five passes for 33 yards, intercepted two passes
and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   And Dallas football fans were so entranced, the Cotton Bowl,
SMU's part-time home, was expanded by more than 26,000 seats after
that season, and by another 8,000 the next to watch one player for
just two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played (five games as a freshman) in 1945 when a lot of us
weren't back from the service,'' Davis said. ``Then he was drafted,
and went into the service in 1946. In 1946, our team had a lot of
veterans, battle-hardened guys. A lot were great All-Americans.
They started hearing stories about Doak, and after what they'd been
through, a lot of these guys didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they saw him _ he was sort of small _ they really
didn't believe it. But once he put a football uniform on, you knew
it. He had that respect. You could just tell. Everybody knew he was
the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly as many stories of his intelligence during
games. In the 19-19 tie with TCU in 1947, while returning the
kickoff that helped SMU's last-minute comeback, he veered past SMU
coach Matty Bell on a 57-yard return to shout instructions that
Bell put Gilbert Johnson in for the next play. Johnson's ensuing
touchdown pass tied the game with 15 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if he was, as a player, peerless, his legend survives a
half-century later for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Other players could be respected; Walker was beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Before Michael or Dr. J, before Ali or Namath, or even Mantle
and Mays, Walker was a hero from the pages of newspapers and
biographies, smiling from the covers of Life and Look, Sport and
Collier's.
</P>
<P>
   He was the sort of athlete that could inspire dreams _ fast,
graceful, handsome and humble. He had thick hair Vitalis would
later use to move merchandise and blue eyes that virtually every
hospital visitor still speaks of as they leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was so large a figure, one wire service moved an obituary
when his cat died. He was so popular a teammate, when Life magazine
released an issue in 1948 with a cover of Walker in position to
pass, and 40 people lined up outside a drug store near SMU waiting
for the doors to open, 30 were SMU teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He married the homecoming queen, with whom he posed on a famous
Collier's cover. He starred for the university around the corner
from his parents' home. For 50 years, he answered every piece of
fan mail. In 1948, he wrote the Associated Press a thank-you note
for naming him All-American. In 1949, he wrote asking he not be
selected, arguing an injury kept him from playing enough to deserve
the honor for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   America did not know every detail then and didn't need to. It
could look at the 47 magazine covers and fill in the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Doak Walker 3-time All American was published and the
legend picked up speed. Esquire wrote, ``Doak Walker was everything
a football hero should be; handsome, shy, reticent and unassuming
off the field, a cool, swashbuckling, brigand on the field. He was
every father's shining son, every mother's darling boy, every
athlete's sturdy leader, every sorority girl's golden dream. There
was no one in the world who could match him. No mortal could live
up to that much adulation. But Doak Walker did.''
</P>
<P>
   So loyal were those he touched, when Davis and Blakely put
together a reunion last spring, 40 SMU players said they could
attend, and all 40, stretched from Florida to California, showed.
And 50 years after the unbeaten, Heisman season, Blakely believes
they came back to trade stories about the teammate who could not be
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there were other reasons they wanted to get back
together,'' Blakely said. ``It wasn't a tribute to Doak. But Doak
Walker and his injury made it happen. They wanted to be together to
talk about Doak.''
</P>
<P>
   To teammates, Walker was not a face on a magazine cover. Those
were not tales of a god from Greek mythology. It was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy that got his picture on every damned magazine in
the country,'' Blakely said. ``Why did nobody mind that? They
wanted to be the first to have a copy. When I go places now, when
they introduce me they say, `He played with Doak Walker.' That's
awesome. I can grow about four inches hearing that. It's pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all real, they still insist. Even time, even emotions
rekindled by his current circumstances, do not exaggerate the
stories. And even those trained to doubt, to question, don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had so many characteristics that were quite uncommon,''
said Felix McKnight, the former editor of both major Dallas
dailies, and a writer in Fort Worth at the time who could not get
sportswriting out of his system with Walker playing at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 60 consecutive years of newspapering, from staff writing to
correspondent, to the editor-publisher level, I've have had the
opportunity to meet and write about many, many men and women, from
Dizzy Dean to Ike Eisenhower. But I sincerely don't think I ever
met a man who occupied his corner with the style and dignity that
Doak Walker as an athlete gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Werner name is gold in Steamboat Springs, local royalty
except that you always could walk up and say hello, or if you were
sick, Hazie Werner would stop in with fresh bread and tonics.
</P>
<P>
   Skeeter Werner was a legend when she met Doak Walker in 1968.
She had twice been an Olympic skier, once an alternate. Her
brothers Bud and Loris had also been Olympians. They still talk
about the way Bud attacked a slope before he was killed in a St.
Moritz avalanche in 1964. Storm Mountain was renamed Werner
Mountain. Skeeter had stopped competing to model and design ski
clothes, eventually running the ski school and later the ``Storm
Hut'' ski store.
</P>
<P>
   Walker had already ended his six-year NFL career, had dabbled in
business and coaching, when Skeeter was asked to teach a celebrity
to ski for ``Stars and Stripes'' and an instant romance that has
lasted three decades began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me up at six o'clock in the morning and we went to
the very top of Storm Peak, and it was the most gorgeous corn snow
(spring, crusty snow) I ever skied in my life,'' she said. ``It was
so great we climbed all the way back up again because the lift had
broken down. Then we played 18 holes of golf. Then we played
tennis. We went to a cocktail party that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried my skis for me. I never had anyone carry my skis,
so I thought I better pay attention to this guy. We went to the
party and out to dinner and decided to get our sleeping bags and
sleep on the mountain. The next day we got up and skied, came back
down and played golf. I was going to visit friends in Scottsdale
the next week and knew Doak was in a golf tournament in Palm
Springs. Why I called him I don't know because I never did that in
my life, but I asked him to meet me in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out to dinner and the next day played 36 holes of
golf, and then stayed up all night on a diving board talking. The
next day we went out to dinner and I asked him to marry me. The
couple with us said maybe we should wait a little longer, but I
said `No, I want to get married now.' So Doak chartered a plane to
Las Vegas and we got married.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, Walker, the hero and legend, had moved into
the Werner home in which Skeeter was raised and happily called
himself ``Mr. Werner'' around Steamboat Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Friends could drop in at any time in the house just off
Steamboat Springs' main road for coffee in the morning, drinks in
the evening, football every weekend. His Heisman Trophy, once found
on the circular rack of ski jackets in the Storm Hut, sits on the
mantle. His NFL Hall of Fame bust, earned in just six seasons with
the Lions, is off in a corner. There are trophy cases stuffed with
almost 300 shiny reminders of the athletic excellence of Skeeter
and Doak Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker skied roughly 75 days a year. He rode his horse
(``Herschel Walker''; Skeeter's is ``Bo Jackson'') on long pack
trips and played golf in paradise. He hunted for elk and went fly
fishing for rainbow trout. And he cherished his friends nearly as
much as they treasure him.
</P>
<P>
   But now, friends trade stories of Walker instead of beers with
him. They laugh out loud, but stop and look away before their
emotions become too great to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite saying of his is, `I don't know, I'm pretty
busy,''' Chris Gotchy said. ``He'd always say it with that silly
smile on his face. He has the cutest little silly grin. I'd ask if
he wanted to play golf, or if he could come over and help us move
some rocks or something off our property. He'd say, `I don't know,
I'm pretty busy.' It was his way of saying `of course.' He said to
me the other day in the hospital. `I don't know. I'm pretty busy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to ride his horse over to wax my daughter's skis or
just drink iced tea.'' With that, Gotchy could talk no more. She
looked away to fight tears. ``He'll ride again up to my house
again,'' she finally said, softly. ``I know he will.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a collection of letters and faxes Walker
received in the hospital reaches almost three feet from the desk.
Skeeter read every letter to Walker. Some brought jokes, others
memories, but most offered thanks and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get through maximum five without breaking down,'' Jack
Beattie said. ``I can't remember ever going more than five before I
just had to stop. There's some from kids. Some from people 60 years
old he wrote back to 50 years ago. It's a real study, something
very special, the way he touched people. It's what he's about.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tugboat, a Werner Mountain bar, Walker's friends trade
stories and laughs. There could be a thousand groups of friends
doing the same thing, Edwards said. The annual Steamboat Springs
Walker-(Verne) Lundquist golf event raised roughly $215,000 to help
refurbish the 93-year-old Werner-Walker home. And virtual strangers
who knew Walker only through smiles in the supermarket or on the
slopes asked Edwards to provide a fund raiser for Walker that they
could afford. In one evening they raised $2,500 a few dollars as a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of his close friends,'' Jack Doyle, the Tugboat
manager said. ``But he is just a super nice guy to everyone. You
would never know he was a star. He would never talk about it. The
stars go down to Aspen for everybody to notice them. They come here
just to be people. Doak was just people. He just had that big grin
all the time. You'd see him in the grocery store and he'd give you
a big smile and a pat on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tugboat co-owner Larry Lamb, ``Besides being an extremely
important athletic person, he's just a warm, loving, giving,
exceptional, kind, affectionate guy. And if he could, he'd come
right in here and sit down and have a beer beside you and shoot the
fat about what went on that day. He'd say how great it is to see
you. And if somebody tapped him on the shoulder and asked for his
autograph, he'd love to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   So they trade stories. There was the time after a pack trip Lamb
convinced Walker to ride his horse through the bar. ``They came
back and said they were parched,'' Lamb said. ``I don't know how
they could be parched. They brought 15 bottles of whiskey and 14
cases of beer.'' There was the day Werner and Walker were married.
``The guy said, `Do you Ewell take Gladys ,''' Edwards said. ``Doak
looked at Skeeter. Skeeter looked at Doak. `Ewell?' `Gladys?' They
had never heard each other's real first names.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards talked of the time his wife mentioned that Walker's No.
37 had always been her favorite number. Twenty years later, when
Hank and D.J. Edwards were married, Walker sent the red SMU jersey
of his Heisman Trophy season as a gift they cherish. There were
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Songs he would sing. ``And he
has a horrible voice,'' Lamb said. The crowd laughed at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   They even told of visits to the hospital. When D.J. visited, he
told her, ``Skeeter's coming tomorrow. Can you help me? I need
practice kissing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker was managing his first words and Skeeter asked, just
to hear the answer again, ``Do you love me, Doak?'' he waited, and
waited, before he finally smiled and forced out the words, ``Don't
rush me.''
</P>
<P>
   And as they tell the stories, Walker and Werner, in Hawaiian
shirts in a Hula Bowl photo, among the walls of celebrities that
had stopped by for a pint, seem to smile at the retelling.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sense, the magic that could be seen from the Cotton
Bowl's upper decks half a century ago still works. Even motionless,
there's something heroic, something that makes every friend believe
he will walk again, every visitor feel somehow better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask, should I visit him in this condition?'' Gotchy
said. ``Should I kiss him? Should I hug him? But you see his face,
those eyes so expressive. It's Doak. He hasn't lost a beat through
this whole thing. There is a charm about him. You see these big
guys come in to see him, and they don't know how to act. Pretty
soon, they lean over and give him a hug or give him a kiss. He just
has a way that touches people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was real, that feeling that somehow came off those magazine
covers. Perhaps it wasn't the time or the long runs or good looks,
but something was there. It still is.

   ``We're seeing progress, and he will improve,'' Beattie said.
``We all hope for the day he can walk again. It's somewhat
doubtful. But we go beyond that. Nothing is too much for this guy.
You never know what to expect of this guy.'' &QL;

<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ Just before a judge remanded 14-year-old
Mitchell Johnson and 12-year-old Andrew Golden into juvenile
detention for a school shooting spree that killed a teacher and
four little girls, the older boy offered a courtroom filled with
their relatives a childlike excuse.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not mean to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to shoot over their heads,'' said the
quavering, trembling Mitchell, who pleaded guilty in an
abjudication hearing _ the juvenile court equivalent of a trial _
in the Craighead County Courthouse Tuesday. ``We didn't think
anybody was going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden, who was 11 years old on March 24, the day he and
Mitchell used a false fire alarm at Westside Middle School to lure
their schoolmates outside and then fired repeatedly into the
terrified mass of students and teachers with high-powered rifles,
pleaded not guilty. His lawyer said his client was insane at the
time and was not mentally competent to stand trial, although the
judge did not allow him to plead so.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Ralph Wilson, after a two-hour trial in which
prosecutors quickly laid out an open-and-shut case, convicted
Andrew and found him, along with Mitchell, to be ``delinquent,''
the juvenile court equivalent of a guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, his hands tied by strict laws that prevent anyone who
commits a serious crime before their 14th birthday from being
punished as an adult, remanded the boys to the Division of Youth
Services, where they will probably be held in a juvenile detention
center until their 18th birthdays, then released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment will not fit the crime,'' said Wilson, as the
kin of the five victims clutched each other's arms and pressed
tissues to crying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the two boys could be held until they turn 21,
but the state has no facility for adult offenders sentenced under
juvenile court laws, and cannot, by law, put the boys in a state
prison.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Mitchell, barring any crimes committed in
juvenile detention that could extend his sentence, will be out in
four years. Andrew, who sat stone-faced throughout the hearing,
will be out in six.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims _ another nine students and a teacher
were wounded in the attack _ had hoped the hearing would finally
answer why this thing was done, would reveal what was going on in
the minds of the two boys.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew, an award-winning marksman who stole guns from his
grandfather to use in the shooting, refused to say anything, and
Mitchell offered more of an apology than an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Although police and balliistics experts have said the boys
methodically fired into the crowd _ Shannon Wright, an English
teacher, was hit twice by a 30.06 hunting rifle fired by Mitchell _
the boy said he did not mean to shoot anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry,'' said Mitchell, who turned 14 Tuesday. ``I
understand that it may be impossible for some of you to forgive me.
If I could go back and change what happened on March 24, 1998, I
would in a minute. I have caused pain. I have asked God for
forgiveness and that he will heal the lives of the people I have
hurt by my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   For the relatives of the boys' victims, the justice they
received was not nearly enough. They saw only two boys who, even
now, refused to take responsibility for their actions that day.
</P>
<P>
   In a withering testimony in which he spoke directly to the two
boys, Mitchell Wright, the husband of the slain teacher, said there
was no way the killings were unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   The older boy, Mitchell, was firing a rifle with a telescopic
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell me it was random, son, not with the scope on
that gun,'' Wright said, his face red, his eyes beginning to tear.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets that left a sidewalk wet with blood took his best
friend, and the mother from his 3-year-old son, Zane.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been told his mother is in heaven, but he wonders
why, when he wants to be rocked to sleep, she cannot come down and
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zane looks for his mother to come back,'' said Wright. ``You
have robbed a 3-year-old boy of his innocence. He told me, `Don't
worry about those two bad boys. If they break out of jail, I'll
take care of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how his wife, who taught Andrew, gave him extra
time on one project, because he was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Four other relatives took the stand during the sentencing phase,
including Lloyd Brooks, whose 11-year-old niece, Natalie Brooks,
was killed in the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, he pointed out, had turned 14 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrated Natalie's birthday on May 26,'' said Brooks, his
voice shaking. ``We brought flowers to her grave.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile hearings are typically closed to the public and press
here in Arkansas, but the judge allowed a more open hearing because
of the intense interest in the case. About 100 family and friends
came to the courtroom, passing through a medical detector to get to
the heavily guarded courtroom _ state officials had said the boys
had received several death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, there were few spectators who came only for the
spectacle, inside or outside. Most people here say they are sick of
it, sick of the pain of it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew seemed not to even be interested in the proceedings, as
prosecutors built their case against him.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Val Price, said the boy should have been allowed to
claim insanity as a defense _ the judge would not allow such a plea
_ and did not even know what was happening to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client today does not understand the nature of the
proceedings,'' said Price to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But teachers at the school, and people who knew the boy, said he
did not seem to have any mental problems beyond a mild problem with
his attention span.
</P>
<P>
   The case prosecutors built was really more of a synopsis, short,
curt and businesslike. The only real drama came when they showed
the court two of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the guns was cocked, loudly, some people in the
courtroom caught their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence put on by the state was overwhelming evidence,''
said Price.
</P>
<P>
   The boys had apparently planned it for some time. Students at
Westside said it was to get even with a girl who had said she did
not want to be Mitchell's girlfriend anymore _ she was slightly
wounded in the attack _ and in revenge of teasings the boys had
received. But what made the boys respond so violently is still a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, like others here, asked the boys to someday ``tell us
why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jonesboro crime, the deadliest in a series of school
shootings that left people dead in Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Ky.,
and Springfield, Ore., also killed middle school students Paige Ann
Herring, Britthney Varner and Stephanie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, without any objections from either of the public
defenders assigned to represent the two boys, showed in the
courtroom how the boys, both of them dressed in camouflage, stole a
van from Mitchell's house, loaded it with guns from Andrew's
grandfather's house, and drove to a copse of trees that offered a
clear field of fire into the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew rang the bell, drawing the students outside, then went to
join his friend in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired numerous times into the gathering of students and
teachers,'' said Mike Walden, the deputy prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The boys then fled for their van, which they had loaded with
camping gear, ammunition and junk food. But before they could reach
the van police officers intercepted them and ordered them to throw
down their guns and lie down. Mitchell did so at once, and then
Andrew complied. At no time did they point their guns at the
arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Although several people here talked about finding some peace
after the verdict, the case is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's lawyers said they would appeal the judge's ruling, as
did a lawyer for Mitchell's father, Scott Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his son was mistreated while in the Craighead
County juvenile facility.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was not fed well or treated properly by doctors or
counselors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to allow my son to stay in Arkansas,'' he said,
but did not explain how he planned to accomplish that. ``This isn't
the place for a rabid animal, to say nothing of a 14-year-old
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who said his son was sexually abused as a little boy,
said his son never told him why he did what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have an answer for why,'' he said.

FBI IN EAST AFRICA: FAMILIAR METHODS AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related: AFRICA-U.S.-EMBASSIES, AFRICA-TANZANIA,
AFRICA-BOMBINGS) 
(HLW) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With what it describes as the largest team ever
assembled to investigate terrorism against Americans overseas, the
FBI is following a familiar investigative method in East Africa,
aimed at rapidly amassing enormous amounts of data that authorities
hope will yield evidence to unravel the bombing plot against the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have granted the agents nearly unrestricted
access to evidence, witnesses and possible suspects in the case,
and officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation privately
expressed confidence on Tuesday that, in time, they can crack these
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being managed in Nairobi by Sheila Horan, a career
counterintelligence agent, who heads an FBI counterterrorism unit
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horan's agents are working behind the teams of search and
rescue personnel focused on their main task, the tedious but
crucial effort to identify, collect, evaluate and preserve evidence
in an effort to identify the perpetrators and, if the case can be
made, use it against them in an American court.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania, the agents are working in cooperation with local
authorities who have detained more than two dozen people, among
them Sudanese, Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Dar es Salaam's
ambassador to the United States, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said
some of those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack. He
said all were turned over to the FBI for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a prime suspect, the agents are following
three primary trails, officials said on Tuesday. The first involves
interviews with witnesses, suspects and others who may have
relevant information like residents in the vicinity of the
bombings, car rental agents, and airline representatives who might
have observed unusual movements in the hours before or after the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The second track involves tapping into intelligence information
collected by the Central Intelligence Agency and the espionage
services of friendly countries that will be asked to seek out any
relevant information about the bombing to pass on to American
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The third and most visible line of inquiry centers on the
collection of physical evidence. It will be analyzed to determine
the explosive used in the attack. Agents did not arrive at the
scene until 36 hours after the blast, but officials said the
inquiry would have been delayed in any case, because search
operations must be completed before investigators can cordon off
areas to search for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic search focuses on an effort to assemble parts of
vehicles that may have been used in the bombing to determine, if
possible, the manufacturer and ownership. In addition, vehicle
parts often provide clues to the nature of the blast and the
explosive power of the bomb; traces of chemical residues can be
analyzed on portable lab equipment flown to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, FBI officials said that they could not confirm
reports that the bombers in both cities used Semtex, a Czech-made
military high explosive, a sophisticated explosive that would
heighten suspicions of a carefully orchestrated or possibly
state-sponsored terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI's explosives lab has a reputation for being slow to
definitively identify explosives in bomb cases. As a result, other
officials said that the FBI might ultimately conclude that the
bombers in both countries used Semtex.
</P>
<P>
   The early upbeat mood represents a stark contrast to the
bitterness and frustration that followed recent FBI attempts to
extend its reach overseas. In the case of the 1996 bombing at Al
Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 airmen were killed, the
FBI sent more than 60 agents after Saudi officials told the
Americans they would receive full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But Saudi authorities kept FBI agents in the dark from the start
and even after two years of complaints by American authorities, the
Saudis have not allowed agents to interview any of the several
dozen suspects who have been detained. The perpetrators have yet to
be identified and none has been punished.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, the FBI has moved quickly to capitalize on local
cooperation. As a result, the size and composition of the
investigative force bears a close resemblance to the agent force
that conducted domestic investigations of the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City federal building blast in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   And in a small but telling gesture, American agents have even
been permitted to carry their firearms and wear bullet proof vests
_ a meaningful concession within law enforcement circles that
suggests that FBI agents are operating in Africa much as they would
in the United States.

LARGE EMPLOYERS KEEPING OXFORD DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)  (Eds: See also OXFORD-EARNINGS) 
(mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the relentless bad news concerning Oxford Health Plans
Inc. _ and another heavy dose of it Tuesday _ many of the region's
large employers are continuing to do business with Oxford, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   The company's unusually comprehensive list of doctors and
generous benefits appeal to employees, and that outweighs concern
about the insurer's financial instability, hammered stock price and
increased rates, they say. Also, there are few great alternatives
available currently.
</P>
<P>
   Several employers and benefits experts said that Oxford, even in
its embattled state, is preferable to more outwardly stable firms
that offer significantly fewer doctors and benefits and entail
administrative headaches for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``All managed care companies have made changes in recent years,
and not any of them have treated our employees particularly well,''
said John Carroll, a benefits manager at Time Warner Inc., which is
leaning toward keeping Oxford. ``Our primary concern at Time Warner
is keeping employees happy, and so far with Oxford, there haven't
been problems on the service side.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Oxford said it lost $507.6 million in the second
quarter, and that it would raise rates about 9 percent for
employers and cut some reimbursement to doctors, many of whom are
already angry about Oxford's recent cuts and lags in payment. The
stock price, which had plunged 90 percent since last October when
the company's problems became known, rose 68.75 cents Tuesday to
$7.25. State regulators have told Oxford to provide better
financial information and to take larger reserves to meet its
capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But these problems do not directly affect the individuals
insured, so many companies are loath to tell their employees that
the plan is being snatched from them and that they may have to
change one or more of their doctors. Other companies want to avoid
the tremendous administrative work involved in changing carriers,
especially if a new insurer is perceived to be inferior by its
users.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is continuing to negotiate with Oxford, as
is Columbia University. A spokeswoman at Gannett Inc. said the
company planned to offer Oxford again in 1999. American Express,
Bell Atlantic and Citibank all said they were holding on to the
plan for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of inertia in the system because change has its
own costs,'' said Rich Ostuw, a global health-care practice
director for Watson Wyatt, an insurance broker in Stamford, Conn.
``There is going through the process, communicating with employees
and doing the paper work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our clients are not delighted with any service they
are getting from any of their health care providers,'' Ostuw added.
``So they shouldn't say they will jump from one because things are
less-than-perfect only to find they've gone to someone else not
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some employers, especially those with few employees,
have decided not to renew Oxford contracts for 1999. Most brokers
said they have seen pockets of defection, and at least two Oxford
competitors, Aetna US Health Care and Anthem Health &AMP; Life
Insurance of New York, said that they had gotten small chunks of
business from Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of new clients, 25 percent are coming from Oxford plans,''
said Carmine Morano, president of Anthem, adding that they were
mostly small employers. An Aetna spokeswoman said that since
January, the company had picked up 40,000 new members from Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Between the first and second quarters of this year, Oxford's
total membership dropped 4.3 percent, and although company
executives said that most of that was because Oxford dropped
Medicaid patients in Connecticut, they expect to lose some
commercial business in 1999 as a result of rate increases, although
they declined to say how much.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, brokers find many new clients are reluctant
to sign on with Oxford. ``Although Oxford was competitively priced,
new prospects were reluctant to take it,'' said Steven Spiro,
president of Sprio Risk Management, a broker in Valley Stream, N.Y.
``So in that sense I would say their problems are affecting new
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts noted that a reduction in Oxford's highly regarded
services could send client companies elsewhere. ``Better clients
are more mobile and less rate sensitive,'' said Bradley Hamburger,
vice president of Halland Cos. LLC, an insurance broker in Jericho,
N.Y. ``If Oxford's service is not as good, that is going to affect
happiness and morale of employees,'' he added, so then clients
might change carriers, ``especially businessmen of closely held
companies that read about the financial problems.''

SPLIT DECISION ON BARNICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Globe's decision Tuesday to rescind its demand for
Mike Barnicle's resignation stirred emotions like a tough column on
a raw topic: Some hated it. Some cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, peppered at a noontime staff meeting like a defendant
under cross-examination, was alternately contrite and pugnacious as
he apologized for sloppiness and laziness.
</P>
<P>
   And the reaction to the Globe's unusual decision not to follow
its demand for his resignation with his dismissal, also drew
sharply contrasting reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the newspaper, many staffers complained about what they
called the leniency of Barnicle's punishment. Outside, some
journalism experts credited Globe editors for what they called the
courage to absorb criticism in reaching a sanction that more
properly fits the swashbuckling columnist's crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the Globe for reaching an extraordinarily tough
decision but it was the right decision,'' said Marvin Kalb,
director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and
Public Policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnicle did nothing evil, though he did do something quite
foolish and rushed. I think he's learned a lesson. I think he'll be
a better columnist for this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb predicted _ correctly _ that the paper would be criticized
for ``playing favorites'' in keeping Barnicle while asking for, and
getting, the resignation of his former colleague on the Globe's
Metro page, Patricia Smith, who in June admitted she wove
fabrications into her column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very disappointing and embarrassing for the Boston Globe
and the city that the Globe choked and buckled beneath the pressure
to extend their perverse understanding of affirmative action to a
white male reporter who plagiarized and lied by any other name,''
said the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, the co-founder of the Boston
Ten Point Coalition. ``The Globe's decision to give him a two-month
slap on the wrist might as well have put Mike Barnicle in as
publisher and editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Barnicle's credit, he effectively mobilized his white
resistance forces to intimidate very well-meaning white liberals
who choked and caved in. The leadership at the Globe really needs
to engage in some serious soul-searching with regards to what is
clearly a lack of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   While Globe editors urged the staff to put the embarrassing
episode behind it, Barnicle's escape from the brink of dismissal _
in what one reporter labeled the journalistic Houdini act _
dominated newsroom discussion all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a feeling in the newsroom that the punishment
is too light,'' said Judith Gaines, who joined the newspaper staff
in 1988. ``Some reporters still think Barnicle should have been
fired. Others think something in the range of three-to-six months'
suspension would have been more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, a feature writer and a member of the
staff for four years, said the decision means that a newspaper in
the business of telling the truth has learned the fine art of
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will beat around the bush here, but the fact, to me,
are obvious. I think Barnicle was not fired because it would have
been too expensive in terms of advertising. He was not fired
because it would have cost us subscriptions. As much as people
believed Pat Smith was given a job because of the color of her
skin, I believe that Mike Barnicle was allowed to keep his job
because of the color of his skin. A lot of us believe this. Not
many of us are stupid enough to say it in print. I am one of the
few who puts my integrity above my paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes-Rodriguez flatly called the Globe a racist institution
that pays ``lip service to diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cost to all of this that the paper seems to have
not considered,'' she said. ``There are many of us here who take
this very personally. There are many of us here who know that if it
had been us causing lawsuits ... or just generally screwing up in
the paper, we would not have made it. We are generally darker than
Mike, or we have Spanish surnames, or our families come from Haiti
or Vietnam, or we are female. Not only would we not have made it,
we would have been held up as fine examples of why affirmative
action is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the National Association of Black Journalists
criticized the Globe's decision, saying: ``The Globe was correct in
quickly and firmly insisting on Patricia Smith's resignation, but
by making excuses to accommodate Mike Barnicle, their action gives
rise to accusations of a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the right choice _ I'm delighted with the
decision,'' said Paul Szep, editorial page cartoonist at the Globe
for 31 years and a friend of Barnicle's. ``Everyone came out a
winner. It was handled with dignity and aplomb. It would have been
just so bad to lose Barnicle. The paper would have been the worse
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Barnicle for 25 years. He he has put his heart and
soul into the newspaper, part of the fiber of it. An institution.
You just don't throw that over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., said if the newspaper concluded
that Barnicle's offense was a one-time foul-up due to laziness, it
should be credited for rethinking a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it became the classic between a rock and a hard place
scenario,'' said Steele. ``You have a highly popular columnist who
is fighting the penalty. You have an editor who is standing by what
he thinks is a principled decision. I think it is true that the
decision to ask for Barnicle's resignation was made more quickly
than it needed to be. With the value of hindsight, this was a case
that would have benefitted from further conversations between all
parties involved before a decision was made on the nature of the
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Smith at her home were not successsful. Asked
her reaction to the Globe's decision Tuesday, she told WCVB-TV,
Channel 5 in Boston, ``Very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Diego Ribadeneira, a 12-year veteran at the Globe, said the
details of Smith and Barnicle's problems are different. ``But I
also believe Barnicle was treated uniquely,'' he said. ``I'm not
sure the outcome would have been the same if anyone else here
behaved in the same way. I also believe the Globe needs to
vigorously investigate and disseminate any past allegations
involving Barnicle's work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeffrey Brown, chairman of the Boston Ten Point
Coalition, said Barnicle's two-month suspension ``forces people
reconsider the reality of a double standard, and I can't help but
think, what if it was (Globe columnist) Robert Jordan who did this
thing with the jokes? What would have happened to him? How would
this have been spun? You just can't help but wonder.''

METHODISTS ACT AGAINST HOMOSEXUAL UNIONS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., N.C., S.C.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The United Methodist Church's highest court ruled Tuesday that
ministers who conduct same-sex unions violate the denomination's
law and can be tried in its courts.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by the church's Judicial Council, declared that a
sentence added to the Methodists' rule book two years ago that
barred ministers from conducting gay unions was not advisory but
binding on clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Methodist ministers convicted of disobeying church law can face
penalties as severe as suspension from office and expulsion from
the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decision is the second in a week in which a major
religious body has dealt a blow to wider acceptance of homosexuals
in church circles. Last Wednesday the world's Anglican bishops,
meeting in Canterbury, England, passed a resolution declaring
homosexual activity ``incompatible with Scripture'' and advising
Anglicanism's 37 church provinces, which include the Episcopal
Church in the United States, against ordaining homosexuals as
priests.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church, with 8.5 million members, is second
in size only to the Southern Baptist Convention among America's
Protestant denominations. Last week the nine judges of its Judicial
Council _ five lay people and four ministers _ met in Dallas and
heard arguments arising from the trial last March of the Rev. Jimmy
Creech. Creech was narrowly acquitted by a church jury in Nebraska
of charges that he had violated the denomination's rule book, the
Book of Discipline, in performing a ceremony of union for two women
in his Omaha congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict touched off an uproar among conservatives and led
several of the church's regional jurisdictions to ask the Judicial
Council for a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Creech's defense had rested on the argument that a sentence
inserted in the rule book in 1996 by the denomination's General
Conference, its top legislative body, was only advisory. As
evidence, he noted that the sentence had been added not to the part
of the book that deals with the church's structure and specific
regulations but instead to the social principles section, a
collection of the church's reflections on social issues ranging
from racism to the environment to the use of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence says, ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions
shall not be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted
in our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Tuesday, the Judicial Council said the sentence
``has the effect of church law, notwithstanding its placement.''
The ruling added that ``conduct in violation of this prohibition
renders a pastor liable to a charge of disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Bruce Blake of Oklahoma City, one of two bishops who had
argued before the council for interpreting the sentence as binding,
said of the decision, ``Now we have clarity, and we know what the
law of the church is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Blake, who had been among those requesting a ruling, said
he did not think it would end debate within the church over issues
related to homosexuality. But, he said, he expects it to ease
``uncertainty and lack of trust'' among Methodists stemming from
disagreement over what the General Conference intended.
</P>
<P>
   But Creech, reached by telephone on Okracoke Island, N.C., where
he has been working part time since his bishop in Nebraska removed
him from his pulpit, said the decision would throw the social
principles section of the rule book into confusion, by raising the
question whether other social stands can result in charges against
a minister. He said he would join efforts to reverse the ruling at
the next General Conference, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McClellan, an Omaha lawyer who represented Creech during
his trial and at the hearing, said he did not think the ruling
would stop some ministers from blessing same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not that easy to prosecute people'' in the church,
he said.

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 90 minutes Tuesday, Harry Thomason, a
television producer and friend of the Clintons, testified here
before the grand jury about how he helped the president navigate
the first chaotic days of the Monica Lewinsky crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the courthouse, Thomason told reporters that
prosecutors for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had asked him to
describe the advice he had given to the president in January, after
moving into the White House to help with damage control. At that
time, Thomason had urged Clinton to issue a forceful denial that he
had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old
former White House intern. She testified last week that she had had
a sexual relationship with the president, said a lawyer familiar
with her account.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason is back in town this week to help the president prepare
for his grand jury testimony Monday, which is to be transmitted by
closed-circuit television from the White House to the federal
courthouse. Prosecutors might have been trying to send Thomason an
ominous message _ that they might summon him to the courthouse
again, to describe any new advice he dispenses to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Thomason was as ebullient as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed the president was telling the truth,''
Thomason said with a smile. ``I thought the grand jurors were nice,
the prosecutors were courteous. It was actually a good morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article last month in The New Yorker, Thomason was
portrayed as the stage manager of Clinton's defiant denial Jan. 26,
in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' the president said
then. ``I never told anybody to lie _ not a single time, never.
These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement remains Clinton's most complete remarks on the
subject that has consumed Washington for nearly seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason's own words in The New Yorker may have led to the
subpoena that summoned him to appear before Starr's grand jury.
Thomason told The New Yorker that he encouraged Clinton to offer an
emphatic denial, remarking that the president added the phrase,
``that woman,'' because he had momentarily forgotten Ms. Lewinsky's
name.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomason may prove to have limited usefulness to
prosecutors. He told the Associated Press that the president had
told him ``nothing'' about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason also said that the prosecutors asked him to describe
his activities after he had moved into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them in general I was reading articles and watching all
the news shows so we would know what people were talking about,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason has produced and directed several successful television
series, including ``Designing Women'' and ``Evening Shade,'' both
of which were set in the South. Thomason and his wife, Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason, co-produced the short campaign film ``The Man
from Hope,'' which depicted Clinton's life for his first
presidential campaign in 1992. They also produced a 12-minute film
about Clinton's first term which was shown at the 1996 Democratic
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors appear to be searching for a clearer sense of the
advice given to Clinton in the days after Starr's inquiry of the
Lewinsky matter first became public. They are also hunting for what
Clinton may have confided to his closest legal and political
advisers. A federal appeals court last week rejected the
president's bid to block the testimony of White House lawyers on
the grounds of attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills testified for several
hours this afternoon. Asked if she would return for further
testimony, Ms. Mills told reporters, ``Not if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several unidentified Secret Service personnel also testified
Tuesday. At least 14 uniformed officers and agents have testified
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after the appeals court ruling, the grand jury
heard from Lanny Breuer, a White House lawyer who refused to answer
some questions on executive-privilege grounds. Harold Ickes, a
former deputy chief of staff and frequent political adviser to
Clinton this year, also testified late last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Tuesday whether Starr's prosecutors had also
subpoenaed White House counsel Charles Ruff. In the next several
weeks, deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, a close friend of
the president, is also expected to testify. Lindsey is now
recovering from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, spent
nearly five hours at the courthouse Tuesday, presumably to view
Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuit by
Paula Jones. Under oath, Clinton denied that he had had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright gave
Kendall permission to view the videotape, saying that Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson, who presides over the grand jury proceedings,
would control Kendall's viewing of the videotape.

LEWINSKY SCANDAL DRIVES UP MRS. CLINTON'S POPULARITY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton's bus slowly chugged
along the roads in upstate New York recently on a preservation
tour, she glanced out the window at a woman holding aloft a
cardboard sign. It said: ``You Go Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Mrs. Clinton has been trying to do just that,
and in some respects, is succeeding, even as her husband prepares
to face a grand jury Monday about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's approval ratings across the country are higher
than ever. Instead of sequestering herself at the White House, away
from the klieg lights and the inevitable questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton has crowded her schedule with things to do
and people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island,
Mrs. Clinton dropped in on the glitterati, firing up a crowd of
1,000 people who whooped and hollered as she introduced her
husband. And she has helped several Democratic candidates in
fund-raising stops, raising $150,000 in Philadelphia for one
candidate two weeks ago. Soon, she will be traveling to Russia,
Ireland, Chile and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, Mrs. Clinton has chosen to stir things up by
dishing out a few select words about the Lewinsky matter, in which
a grand jury is investigating whether Clinton lied when he denied a
sexual relationship with the former intern and tried to cover it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in an interview published in the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, Mrs. Clinton said ``prejudice'' against the state
of Arkansas is what is driving the attacks on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mrs. Clinton blamed a ``right-wing conspiracy,''
spearheaded by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and his allies,
for trying to ruin her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of this is prejudice against our state,'' Mrs.
Clinton told the newspaper. ``They wouldn't do this if we were from
some other state.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks puzzled and angered some in Arkansas. ``I know she
must be going through a lot of stress, but I don't think anyone in
Arkansas believes this is occurring because of prejudice towards
the state,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``It's
inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., was less charitable. ``It is sad and
unfortunate that Arkansas is depicted by the first lady as a
backward state, worthy of ridicule and prejudice,'' he said. ``It
would be much better if the first lady would make a mature and
responsible assessment of the situation and not blame us Arkansans
for their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   And Republican pollster Ed Goeas couldn't resist quipping,
``First it was the right-wing conspiracy, now it's the chicken-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that Mrs. Clinton has swayed a number of
Americans, especially women, over to her side in the past eight
months. According to a CBS News poll conducted July 19 through July
21, 50 percent of those surveyed said they held a favorable opinion
of Mrs. Clinton and 26 percent say they did not. Historically, only
35 percent or so of Americans have expressed support for the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants say that after six years, people are finally
starting to take a shine to Mrs. Clinton and her reconfigured role
as first lady. Others point directly at Ms. Lewinsky, and say that
the public sympathizes with Mrs. Clinton and that has softened her
in a way that speeches and press releases never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best person they can put out there,'' said Goeas.
``She's kind of standing by her man, and has been determined to do
exactly that. Some people feel sorry for her. Some respect her.
It's probably a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, ``I think that the first
lady has handled this whole set of attacks with grace and
intelligence and wit, and people admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Mrs. Clinton's legal background, and her
own experience as a subpoenaed witness before Starr's Whitewater
grand jury, make her one of the president's most valuable
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   But the private Mrs. Clinton has remained steadfastly elusive.
How does she broach the subject of Ms. Lewinswky with her husband?
Do they talk about the infamous dress? Does she advise him on what
to say?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are all subject to speculation, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at best this is an extremely difficult time and I
think the president and Mrs. Clinton are probably communicating, in
many ways through their lawyer, David Kendall,'' said former White
House aide DeeDee Myers on the news program, ``This Week With Sam
and Cokie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these issues are just too difficult for them to
discuss with each other in many respects.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``These are the kind of issues that I think husbands
and wives don't often sit down and sort of have frank conversations
about.''
</P>
<P>
   During a fund-raiser at the home of Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger in the Hamptons in early August, an ebullient Mrs. Clinton
got the crowd riled up for her husband, then gave him a hug before
he took the microphone and delivered five minutes of subdued
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's staff said she thrives on her public appearances,
especially when she is talking about children's issues, health care
and the encroaching millennium. ``She believes that if you spend
one day pacing around the White House, that's one day you are not
doing something to advance the agenda of the president,'' said Neel
Lattimore, Mrs. Clinton's former press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she approached the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and offered to attend a number of fund-raisers
for House and Senate candidates, many of them challengers facing
uphill climbs. She has attended six fund-raisers since June and is
expected to attend several more over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, the communications director for the committee, said
that after the president, she is the party's biggest draw. Just
before a special election in Albuquerque, N.M. Mrs. Clinton drew
2,000 at a college gym on 48 hours notice, Sallick said. He also
said she has helped spur women who do not typically turn out to
show up and write checks. Recently, Mrs. Clinton has raised
$100,000 in a Cincinnati race and $150,000 at an Indiana
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the president, who tends to do more fundraising for
the national party committee, she is in the most demand of any
other Democratic official,'' Sallick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Spottswood, a candidate for a House race in Wisconsin,
said Mrs. Clinton visited her in Milwaukee, attending a small
reception that netted her $60,000. Ms. Spottswood said Mrs.
Clinton's wifely travails have certainly played a hand in her
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There but for the grace of God,'' Ms. Spottswood said. ``Any
woman could find herself with unwelcomed rumors. She has dealt with
it with so much dignity and grace, it has resonated with people.``

GLOBE BACKTRACKS, SUSPENDS COLUMNIST FOR TWO MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six days after Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin
asked for Mike Barnicle's resignation, he acknowledged acting too
``hastily'' and instead suspended the columnist for two months
without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning turnaround Tuesday, including an apology by
Barnicle at a packed noontime meeting of the Globe staff, capped a
week of controversy over the fate of the popular 25-year Metro
columnist. It followed three meetings between Barnicle and top
Globe officials in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Given the June 18 resignation of black columnist Patricia Smith
after admitting fabricating some characters and quotes in four 1998
columns, the Barnicle suspension may prove divisive inside and
outside the Globe. Storin said Tuesday that ``these two offenses
were much different'' but noted that some staffers &UR;  &LR; are ``still
uncomfortable with whether there are double standards for ... Mike
Barnicle and Patricia Smith.'' Concerned minority Globe staffers
reportedly slated a meeting Tuesday night to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle controversy began when his Aug. 2 column was found
to contain eight jokes similar to those in comedian George Carlin's
1997 book, ``BrainDroppings.'' Initially last Wednesday, Storin _
accepting Barnicle's explanation that he had never read the book
and got the jokes from friends _ suspended him for a month without
pay. But later that day, WCVB-Ch.5 in Boston ran a clip of Barnicle
endorsing the book on the June 22 edition of ``Chronicle.'' At that
point, Storin, on vacation in Italy, asked for Barnicle's
resignation. Barnicle responded that he would not resign.
</P>
<P>
   At the emotional and sometimes contentious staff meeting
attended by Barnicle, Storin explained his change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though there were clear offenses here and violations of
professional standards in my opinion,'' he said, ``I did not feel
that if it came to a question of termination for Mike Barnicle that
the punishment fit the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon press conference Tuesday, Storin noted that
``perhaps too hastily I called for Mike's resignation,'' adding
that Barnicle ``convinced me he didn't remember having done that
tape for Channel 5.''
</P>
<P>
   While admitting errors Tuesday, Barnicle, 54, said, ``I did not
plagiarize anything. Nor did I lie to the publisher or the
editor.'' He added that ``I did not remember doing the TV tape''
about ``BrainDroppings'' since it was filmed several months ago and
was part of a segment on 17 books that lasted less than three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I think the decision that's been reached is the right
decision,'' Globe publisher Benjamin B. Taylor said Tuesday. ``It
was made by the editor of the paper. I fully support it and him.''
The Globe's owner, The New York Times Company, issued a statement
saying it ``has a policy that all of its media properties have
editorial independence and autonomy. In keeping with our policy, we
support the Globe's right to make its own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Globe staff Tuesday, Barnicle confessed to
having created the current furor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here today because of my sloppiness,'' he said. ``We're
here today because I have caused embarrassment to the institution,
to the paper. ... I think what's happened is terrible for a lot of
things, for a lot of people, but none more so than the institution
where we all work _ The Boston Globe. ... I apologize to each and
every one of you collectively. And if I could, I would apologize to
each and every one of you individually for having put the place
where you work ... into such a tough light.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the conditions of the suspension agreement,
Barnicle will face closer supervision of his columns and will
reduce the amount of his outside work because, in Storin's words,
``we need a better bang for the buck.'' Barnicle, who also works
for Channel 5, PBS's ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' and MSNBC,
declined to say Tuesday what outside work he would curtail. He did
say that he would continue at ``Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin also cited Barnicle's distant relationship with many of
his Globe colleagues as a problem that needed to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to me ... how faulty, how unsatisfactory
Mike's relationship was with his editors, including myself,'' he
said. ``And there was no way that I thought we could go forward
unless that could be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems in that relationship were evident at
Tuesday's staff meeting when Barnicle faced a barrage of tough
questions on everything from his estrangement from his colleagues
to the number of times his work has been subject of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's Globe career came under the public microscope after
the Patricia Smith case unraveled in late June. In explaining why
he had given Smith a second chance despite evidence she had
fabricated some 1995 columns, Storin said at the time that he was
concerned that the paper had not ``addressed ... head on''
lingering doubts about Barnicle's work.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Smith resigned, Harvard Law professor Alan
Dershowitz accused the Globe of following a double standard for not
similarly disciplining Barnicle for a 1990 column that Dershowitz
said contained a fabricated quote attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   (Last week, The New York Times reported that the Globe had paid
Dershowitz a $75,000 settlement in that case, an assertion the
Globe and Dershowitz have declined to confirm. Tuesday, in response
to questions about other Barnicle-related litigation, assistant to
the publisher Alfred S. Larkin Jr. confirmed that the paper paid
$40,000 after losing a suit in which a gas station proprietor said
he'd never made a racist statement Barnicle attributed to him in a
1973 column. Larkin also said there was some type of settlement,
perhaps an apology, after a 1990 column in which a tenant made
unrefuted charges against a Lynn, Mass. landlord.)
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Smith's resignation, the Globe reported that
it had reviewed 364 Barnicle columns dating back to January 1996
and gave them a clean bill of health. But that did not put the
issue to rest. In its August issue, Boston magazine resurrected
charges initially made in 1991 against Barnicle about two columns
that the magazine said featured characters who could not be tracked
down. It also brought up two old columns that reportedly elicited
complaints from the late Chicago columnist Mike Royko that Barnicle
had borrowed from his work.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's staff meeting, Barnicle angrily dismissed these
allegations as ``a classic case of where the media takes things and
perception becomes reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On each occasion, whenever any questions arose at the
particular time it arose, I was confronted by an editor at this
paper and gave that specific editor answers to any questions the
editor may have had about the columns in question,'' he said. ``I
do not put lies in the paper, I do not make things up.''
</P>
<P>
   He also characterized his accuser Dershowitz as ``a very smart,
very important, very influential, very obnoxious human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his case to Globe staffers Tuesday, Barnicle explained
that ``this is the only place I have ever really worked as an
adult. This is the only place I have ever wanted to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the tenor of some questions at both the staff meeting
and press conference, it is clear the the specter of a double
standard in the treatment of Smith and Barnicle looms as a
significant issue. Taylor and Storin both tried to address that
concern Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we tried to look ... at the two cases as
separate and distinct cases,'' said Taylor at the press conference.
``The two cases were different.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin also said that ``these two offenses were much
different,'' explaining that Smith was caught fabricating after she
had been warned. ``First of all, I gave Patricia a second chance
... Clearly Mike now has had his second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the fallout from Tuesday's events, the principals
in the Barnicle episode acknowledged just how difficult an ordeal
this has been.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was upbeat about the Globe's credibility with its
readers, Storin told the staff that ``This is a period of great
vulnerability for this paper. You can imagine ... that it was like
a nightmare to have this thing happen at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I find this at one level to be deeply painful,'' added
Barnicle. ``I don't think I'll write about this.''

MAKING THE CASE FOR AN ODD AND ANXIOUS ROMANTIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His time will come,'' Arnold Schoenberg confidently asserted in
a memorial tribute to his mentor, colleague and brother-in-law,
Alexander von Zemlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As that statement implied, by the time of Zemlinsky's death, in
Larchmont, N.Y., in 1942, his music had been almost totally
forgotten, a victim of the derailing of Austro-German musical
culture under the Nazis, of changes in taste that had made his
luscious, lustrous hyper-Romanticism seem old-fashioned, and
probably also of his self-doubts, which kept him from doing much on
his own behalf, even though he held important posts as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   But Schoenberg's prophecy has been borne out during the last
three decades, and not just once but at least three times. The
centenary of Zemlinsky's birth, in 1971, prompted the first flurry
of revivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s his operas were brought back to life, and there
were several important recordings. Now James Conlon is pressing the
case again, with five Zemlinsky albums recorded under his baton for
EMI Classics in Cologne, Germany, and more to come. Two of the
operas are represented in this first batch, ``Eine Florentinische
Tragodie'' and ``Der Zwerg'' (``The Dwarf''), together with
collections of orchestral pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced,'' Conlon writes of Zemlinsky, ``that in
several years a wide and enthusiastic public will know and love his
works.'' That conviction leaps out of these performances, which are
strong, sumptuous and finely detailed. Conlon also allows one to
make a good guess as to why this music still needs zealous
advocacy: though all of it is beautifully made, only rarely did
Zemlinsky push himself above the giants he admired _ Brahms,
Wagner, Mahler, Strauss _ and produce something that while
belonging in the same Romantic sunset as the rest of his output, is
utterly his own.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Zemlinsky is a head above other late Romantics
whose claims have recently been advanced, like Franz Schreker and
Hans Pfitzner. And at its best, his music can stand comparison with
anything Richard Strauss wrote between the wars.
</P>
<P>
   But that best is restricted to just a few works, which certainly
include ``Der Zwerg,'' along with the Second String Quartet and
some of the songs: all works composed during the period from 1914
to a few years after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser pieces have their pleasures, which Conlon's
recordings duly notice. Of the two symphonies (EMI 5 56473 2; CD),
both dating from the 1890s, the Second has a scherzo with an
unforgettable theme, robust and savage. Zemlinsky was in thrall to
Brahms at this time, but he upped the Gypsy side of Brahms, and his
music began to hint at his family origins among the Jews of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In another work of the same decade, the cantata ``Spring's
Burial'' (5 56474 2; CD), echoes of Brahms' Requiem are combined
with Wagnerism. This disk also includes ``Dance Poem,'' drawn from
a ballet score on which Zemlinsky worked in the first four years of
the new century, and a suite of incidental music for Shakespeare's
``Cymbeline.''
</P>
<P>
   It was characteristic of Zemlinsky's luckless career as a
composer that the ballet, ``The Triumph of Time,'' was never
produced and that the ``Cymbeline'' production, scheduled for the
1915-16 season, was canceled because of the war. Not until 1996 was
the ``Cymbeline'' music performed.
</P>
<P>
   Another discouragement came in 1905, when the symphonic poem
``Die Seejungfrau'' (``The Mermaid'') was first performed and
poorly received. Zemlinsky withdrew the score, which was not heard
again until 1984, when Riccardo Chailly performed and recorded it
for Decca/London.
</P>
<P>
   Conlon's version (5 55515 2; CD) is fine, but at almost 45
minutes, the piece is long for its material. Nor is its interest
sufficiently enhanced by its juicy autobiographical subtext,
according to which the mermaid of Hans Christian Andersen's story
represents both Alma Schindler, who had recently abandoned
Zemlinsky for Mahler, and the composer, who in human society felt
like a fish out of water. The piece is coupled with the Sinfonietta
of 1934, which is fluent and even vigorous yet impersonal.
</P>
<P>
   The period of Zemlinsky's greatness had come earlier and was
defined partly by cultural shifts happening around the time of
World War I, partly by his discovering subjects that allowed him to
give voice to his keenest anxieties. Those anxieties had to do with
his body.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Schindler recorded in her diary before the beginning of
their affair that he ``cuts the most comical figure imaginable _ a
caricature, chinless and short, with bulging eyes.'' This
assessment may have been ungenerous, but it was evidently shared by
Zemlinsky, who found opportunities for poignant self-identification
in the story of ``Der Zwerg.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the wider cultural context, there, too, he found himself
an oddity, a dodo among the modernist swallows. He conducted the
first performance of Schoenberg's atonal opera ``Erwartung'' and
admired the work of Berg and Webern. But he could not go that way
himself. If, in the light of what his Viennese friends were doing,
tonality had to be seen as only a part of musical reality, it was a
partial reality he needed. If atonality was now in some sense the
truth, he preferred illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Der Zwerg,'' again, acknowledges this fact; the necessity of
illusion is its subject. The Dwarf believes himself to be handsome
and a fit swain for the Spanish princess to whom he has been given
as a birthday present. When he rips a curtain, looks into a mirror
and discovers the truth about himself, he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eine Florentinische Tragodie,'' too, unfolds largely in an
atmosphere of pretense. A merchant returns home to find his wife in
the arms of her princely lover, and instead of protesting at once,
he plays out a sadistic scene in which he offers his wares to the
intruder, expressing his jealousy only by implication until the
moment finally comes to take his vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Both operas were based on writings by Oscar Wilde _ the tale
``The Birthday of the Infanta'' and the incomplete play ``A
Florentine Tragedy'' _ and they owe something, in points of musical
style and dramatic cruelty, to an earlier Wilde opera, Strauss's
``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   But their unsettling malaise is Zemlinsky's own. In ``Eine
Florentinische Tragodie'' everyone in the theater knows that the
ostensible action is a charade. In ``Der Zwerg'' everyone knows
this except the Dwarf, and his innocent ignorance seems to have
stirred the composer as much as it must stir anyone who listens to
the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The score of ``Der Zwerg,'' completed in 1921, is rich, colorful
and fascinating. It seems to combine Strauss' gift for musical
illustration with Ravel's love of the strange and fantastical, and
it makes all of Zemlinsky's other orchestral works sound like rough
drafts. Its central character, too, is a brilliant and moving
creation.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Dwarf is seen largely from outside, as the
orchestra portrays his awkward movements. But soon the opera
accepts him at his own valuation. The crooked slips and
syncopations give way, and he opens out into a heroic vocal style:
having been introduced as a Nibelung gnome, he becomes a Siegfried.
</P>
<P>
   In the new recording (5 56208 2; two CDs), David Kuebler
achieves this dual personality magnificently. He has a character
tenor's pathos and keen sense of the text, yet he can also move
decisively into a radiant high register.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite him, Soile Isokoski has the porcelain brittleness and
artificiality needed for the Infanta. The two of them work
frighteningly well together in the disturbing scene where the
Infanta plays with the Dwarf's emotions, encouraging his love for
her. There are also excellent contributions from Iride Martinez as
the Infanta's warmhearted maid and from Andrew Collis as the
chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Kuebler is to be heard again as the prince in the recording of
``Eine Florentinische Tragodie'' (5 56472 2; CD), with Deborah
Voigt and Donnie Ray Albert completing the triangle. But as good as
this performance is, ``Der Zwerg'' is something else.
</P>
<P>
   A Hamburg production toured widely in the 1980s and was
recorded, but it somehow failed to give the work the boost it
needed. The new recording, which makes good the cuts and
alterations of the Hamburg version, should do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the opera is being staged in Paris, with Conlon
conducting and Kuebler again in the title role; an American
production cannot be far behind. Then Zemlinsky's time will have
come for good.

LAWSUIT CLAIMS AMGEN FALSIFIED EARNINGS PREDICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- A San Diego law firm has filed a
class-action suit against Amgen Inc., claiming the biotech giant
mislead investors last year about the company's earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Milberg Weiss said in its filing that between
January and August 1997 Amgen officials issued false statements
about future sales potential for the company's two lead drugs and
about the impact a settlement with competitor Johnson &AMP; Johnson
would have on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the suit said top Amgen executives benefited by selling
shares in the company at a time when the stock was trading at
artificially inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen officials declined to comment on the case, and attorney
Jan Adler at Milberg Weiss could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Amgen shares did fall $2.125 Tuesday, or nearly 2.9
percent, to close at $69.6875, analysts attributed the drop to the
stock market's overall decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't pay these things (lawsuits) that much
attention because they're usually a lot of hot air,'' said analyst
Caroline Copithorne at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The suit specifically says unjustifiably positive statements
issued by Amgen boosted the company's share price from $52.50 in
mid-January 1997 to $69.375 in May 1997 and kept it trading at more
than $58 per share through August. During the same period, Milberg
Weiss claims, top Amgen officials sold $32.4 million worth of their
own personal holdings in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also claims that by keeping the stock price above $58 a
share, Amgen avoided paying $158 million on speculative option
contracts on Amgen stock. The options would have been triggered if
the share price stood below $58 when the contracts expired in
August 1997, the suits states.
</P>
<P>
   When eventual sales did not match what the suit claimed Amgen
officials implied, the stock price fell to the $40 range.
</P>
<P>
   Copithorne said that proving Amgen fraudulently promoted the
company will be difficult and speculated that Milberg Weiss will
seek an out-of-court settlement with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything blatantly fraudulent, or the intentional manipulating
of results, those are cases where you can get an enormous
windfall,'' she said. ``This case is all about nuances and
technicalities involved with the stock. While (the price) went
down, for biotech companies the drop wasn't all that extreme. When
you see stock prices drop 75 percent because of failed products,
those are cases where there's more of a splash and more potential
for some huge payoffs.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a voice of the Beat Generation, poet,
publisher and book seller, Lawrence Ferlinghetti has always held a
prominent place in San Francisco's cultural community. Tuesday, he
was elevated to a loftier status.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown, recognizing the need for ``great cities of
the world'' to ``place great stock in their great artists,'' named
Ferlinghetti the city's first poet laureate, a post that requires
him only to give a speech now and then in his yearlong term and
promote poetry around the city.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly much of a challenge for a poet of international
renown. But the role is an unusual one for Ferlinghetti, 79, whose
devout suspicion of government remains a theme in much of his work.
He has always believed strongly that artists should resist
government grants because the money ties them to bodies of power
that cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the new job, which pays him $5,000, was hardly lost
on Ferlinghetti as he thanked Brown, a Democrat he apparently
trusts: Ferlinghetti said he voted for Brown for mayor in 1995 even
though he is registered to vote with California's Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Plato's republic, poets were considered subversive, a
danger to the republic,'' Ferlinghetti said, standing beside the
mayor. ``I kind of relish that role. So I see my present role as a
gadfly, to use as a soapbox to promote my various ideas and
obsessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a poet laureate _ Robert Pinsky _ and so
do most states. But not many cities have them, in part because
poetry is an acquired taste and the more accomplished poets are
grabbed by states. New York City does not have a poet laureate but
two of its boroughs do, Brooklyn (Dennis Nurkse) and Queens
(Stephen Stepanchev).
</P>
<P>
   Brown offered no explanation for why it took San Francisco so
long to anoint one, other than to say it was high time.
</P>
<P>
   For Ferlinghetti, the appointment comes at a time when his most
influential work is probably behind him. A native of Yonkers who
moved to San Francisco after serving in World War II, he joined
other emerging writers, like Kenneth Rexroth, Allen Ginsberg and
Jack Kerouac, to give shape to youthful feelings of distrust and
disenfranchisement.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, they became the voices of the Beat Generation, its
adherents, Beatniks, and in 1953, when Ferlinghetti opened City
Lights, a book store in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood,
they had a place to gather. They do still.
</P>
<P>
   Selling only paperback books at first to satisfy Ferlinghetti's
enduring notion that art should be affordable to all, the store has
expanded over the years to include hardbacks and mainstream books
that are sold in national chain stores. But it retains its original
charm, with an entire room of poetry books, another of hard-to-find
authors and open areas for poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Peters, a onetime librarian at the Library of Congress who
is co-owner of City Lights, said many customers still came just to
buy poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The passing years have done little to blunt Ferlinghetti's
energy. He continues to work in the book store, publish and write
poems. His latest poems are collected in a book issued last year.
He regards the book, ``A Far Rockaway of the Heart,'' as a
companion to an earlier collection, ``A Coney Island of the Mind,''
which was published in 1958 and became one of the most popular
collections of poems of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed not entirely sure how to gauge the overall health
of poetry in modern America. What he hears most, he said, are
voices of the street, rap artists whose words he finds ``much more
violent, much more alienated than the Beats ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beats shared similar feelings of isolation, he said, adding,
``These are most materialistic, militaristic, avaricious times
today. There is more of a need for Beat ideas, non-materialism,
spiritual values, being free as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   As poet laureate, Ferlinghetti does not begin any official
duties until October. But he has a few ideas he would like to sell.
One is having the federal government designate North Beach a
historic district before the tourists and upscale shops obliterate
any reminders of the past.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to establish a poet-in-residence program.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered no details about how those goals might come
about. Nor did Brown. For now, though, Ferlinghetti did not seem
all that concerned about it. ``I was hoping this was just an
honorary position,'' he said, cracking a smile. ``I have so much
else to do.''

BOEING BEGINS SERIES OF COST-CUTTING MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the first of a series of cost-cutting measures, The
Boeing Co. has frozen all hiring in its commercial aircraft
division and ordered managers to get special permission before
granting travel requests or other ``non-essential'' items,
according to an internal company bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The notice sent by Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President
Ron Woodard and obtained by the Post-Intelligencer Tuesday also
instructed managers to curtail spending on the ``low-hanging
fruit'': off-site meetings, non-essential office supplies,
periodical subscriptions, trips to seminars and non-crucial
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our profit margins, we simply cannot afford the `nice to
do' things,'' Woodard said in the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   His cost-cutting program is a direct response to Boeing Chairman
Phil Condit's goal of obtaining a 7 percent net return on sales by
the year 2000 _ meaning Boeing would earn 7 cents on every dollar
of revenue, after taxes and other expenses are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, Boeing expects to earn about $1 billion this year,
less than 2 percent of projected sales.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the overall 7 percent profit margin goal, earnings
from Boeing's commercial aircraft division and its defense and
space operations must be at least 11 percent, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial division is far from that now with earnings
from operations expected to be less than 1 percent this year. Next
year, the commercial division _ which accounts for about 60 percent
of the company's total revenues _ is predicting only a slight
improvement with a 2 to 4 percent profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us should find that an acceptable operating profit
margin and we must dedicate ourselves to doing better _ much
better,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is gaining ground on getting its airplane
production back to normal and now ``where we need to focus renewed
attention is on costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that we've had a very difficult year,'' Woodard
said. ``Our production problems, combined with pricing pressures in
the marketplace, have led to poor financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also plans to reduce costs by cutting employment between
18,000 to 28,000 jobs by the end of next year through attrition and
layoffs. The company employs 238,000 people in 27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have not yet said exactly how many job cuts
will occur or where and Woodard did not address employment in his
recent memo, but the reductions are expected to be spread
throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the overall number are 12,000 previously announced
reductions from Boeing's commercial aircraft division, which has
headquarters in Renton and employs about 110,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, job cuts could come from further consolidation of
Boeing operations throughout the country, which the company expects
to announce tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Boeing plans to announce whether it has decided to
establish a new 737 assembly line at its commercial aircraft
factory in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While executives officially are saying no decision has yet been
made, people familiar with the announcement said the California 737
assembly plan already has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Boeing officials will continue last-minute
negotiations Wednesday with the company's largest union, which
opposes sending assembly work to California.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for going along with Boeing's plan, the Machinists
union is seeking concessions from the company, according to people
familiar with the talks.

several large charges and continued operating losses.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, which was much greater than expected, was seen by
health-industry analysts as an attempt by the managed care company
to write off much of its problem businesses and past practices.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the company's actions as ``a line in the sand
separating Oxford's past and its future,'' Oxford's new chief
executive, Dr. Norman Payson, said that the company was already
raising premiums and cutting costs sharply to achieve its goal of
making money by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Payson outline his strategy for turning around
Oxford, analysts and consultants said that the company seemed to be
clear about what steps it needed to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company knows exactly what it has to do,'' said Kenneth
Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ``There is no
rocket science here.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting there may prove a serious challenge, especially
since Oxford's goal of returning to profitability can only be
achieved if its membership does not fall sharply and reduce
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers may face steeper rate increases, based on their
individual costs, and decide to switch plans to save money.
Doctors, many of whom have stayed in Oxford's network despite their
difficulty in getting paid, could decide to abandon the plan if
their fees are cut too sharply. At the same time the company must
stem its sizable losses and it needs to be careful about making any
dramatic changes that could drive away its doctors or its members,
said Bob Braddick, a consultant with William Mercer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once the darling of consumers and investors alike, Oxford has
fallen badly out of favor. The stock, which sold for as much as $89
last summer, was brutally punished in October, when the company
first said that it had underestimated the cost of delivering care
after it fell months behind in paying its doctors and hospitals.
Oxford had become such a favorite with consumers because it
promised an affordable health plan that allowed them tremendous
freedom in picking a doctor. Shares of Oxford closed Tuesday at
$7.25, up 68.75 cents, but down 53 percent for the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's reported loss was a result of nearly $300
million in unusual or one-time charges. Those charges included the
cost of consolidating some of its operations as well as its
decision to drop much of its Medicaid and Medicare business, the
government programs that it has said caused much of its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would essentially drop all Medicare business
outside of New York and all of its Medicaid business, except where
it could shift some of the risk onto the hospitals providing the
care.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford will also drop much of its commercial business outside of
the New York area, leaving such markets as Illinois and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also include the cost of adding $152 million to its
reserves at the request of the New York State Insurance Department.
The department requested the additions after a lengthy review of
Oxford's finances in which it determined that the company had
underestimated the medical claims it needed to pay over the next
year. ``We believe we are well reserved at this point,'' Payson
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Payson emphasized that the size of the loss did not
reflect the true state of its business, the company is still losing
money. By its own estimate, the company's cash flow losses are
roughly $85 million this quarter, and it said that it expected to
have another $100 million in losses over the next six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even ignoring the special charges, Oxford's medical costs were
very high, eating up 95 cents of every dollar of premium Oxford
took in during the second quarter. ``They are still not a healthy
organization,'' said Braddick, the Mercer consultant. ``They have a
ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's goal is to bring its medical costs down to about 85
cents or so by increasing premiums by about 9 percent, cutting fees
to doctors and hospitals and pushing more people to stay within its
network.
</P>
<P>
   It also hoped to sharply reduce its hefty administrative costs
by some $200 million next year by using fewer consultants, having
fewer employees and undertaking other cost-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping employers remains a serious challenge. While Oxford
says that most employers are deciding to stay with the company,
many are making that critical decision right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have a difficult time retaining a lot of
their business,'' predicted Henry Moyer, a benefits consultant in
New York, who advises companies that frequently offer only one
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Membership is already down slightly from the first three months
of the year, even in the company's flagship Freedom plan product.
Overall, the company said that its membership had dropped from
about 2.1 million members at the end of March to 2 million at the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Oxford has managed to hold on to the vast majority of its
customers, most of whom still believe the company is a better
alternative than the competition. ``We continue to be the health
plan of choice,'' Payson argued.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Oxford can come up with a plan that still pleases
consumers and makes its shareholders money, it does not have the
luxury to try forever. If the company does not reduce its losses
quickly, it could run into the same kind of capital crunch that
caused it to seek a $710 million cash infusion from private
investors earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Payson said that the company had plenty of ``cushion'' and
should not need more capital before becoming profitable sometime
next year. ``We have sufficient firepower and time to complete our
turnaround plans,'' he said.

AS THE YEN FALLS, MARKETS FEAR JAPANESE SAVERS WILL LOOK
ELSEWHERE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As the yen falls to new lows against the dollar,
ordinary investors are fleeing to other currencies, heightening
concern that a fundamental shift in sentiment is under way against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors mentioned by currency traders as immediate
causes of the yen's fall are the faltering stock market, doubts
about the new government's commitment to dealing with problems in
the banking sector and the possibility that China might devalue its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns pushed the yen down to a rate of 147.63 to the
dollar in London trading early Tuesday, an eight-year low, and to
147.35 in New York later. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks
fell for a seventh consecutive trading day, closing down 219.40
points, or 1.4 percent, at 15,406.99. In Hong Kong, the main stock
index fell 3.6 percent, to 6,779.95. Most other Asian markets were
also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry among currency traders is that the yen is
reaching a level where Japanese housewives, who control the family
purse strings and thus a vast pool of savings, are swapping their
yen for dollars, German marks and pounds sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main worry for me,'' said Steven Barrow, a currency
strategist at Bear Stearns International in London. ``The key here
is what's happening to Japanese savings and the fear that ordinary
Japanese are looking to send their cash abroad in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   The yen's slow erosion over the last few months has contributed
to a surge in the government's already large surplus in the current
account, which measures the difference between income from foreign
sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Few have been paying attention, however, to the even larger
outflows from capital and investment accounts since last spring, a
strong indication that Japanese households are beginning to seek
higher returns and less volatility in other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow noted that while the current account surplus has been
running at one trillion to 1.5 trillion yen a month, according to
government figures issued in July, Japan's capital and investment
accounts are running deficits of 2 to 2.5 trillion yen a month,
reflecting a net outflow of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they're earning more foreign currency from trade, it
seems they're only too willing to see even greater sums flowing
back out to take advantage of higher yields elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest factors in the decision last month by Moody's
Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, to put Japan's
triple-A rating on review for a possible downgrading was concern
that the household sector had joined the flight to other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of particular concern is the potential for volatile portfolio
shifts into foreign currency assets by Japanese residents in the
post-Big Bang environment,'' Moody's said in its news release,
referring to sweeping financial reform measures that went into
effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   And traders worry that the government statistics fail to fully
capture the flight from yen to dollars or other currencies. A shift
of individual savings out of yen and into other currencies may not
show up in the government numbers because the money may never leave
the country. Instead, it may sit in a foreign currency account at
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Citibank, Sumitomo Bank and other
banks that offer such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to get a read on how big that shift is, however,
since most banks refuse to disclose breakdowns of foreign-currency
deposit accounts and yen deposit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bank officials contend that April's financial reform
measures did not really enhance the ability of Japanese depositors
to shift their savings into dollars and other currencies, but they
do concede a marked uptick in demand for foreign-currency accounts
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Until this spring, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was almost the
only Japanese bank to promote foreign-currency accounts
aggressively. Katsumi Tsuiji, a Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi spokesman,
said the demand for those accounts had accelerated since April,
although the increase was somewhat modest because the bank already
had a significant part of the foreign-currency deposit market.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuiji declined, however, to disclose the amount in
foreign-currency deposits, as did a spokesman for Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo Bank began offering foreign-currency deposit accounts
in five different currencies last year, in advance of the financial
reforms. A spokesman said that from March until the end of July,
the amount of deposits held in foreign-currency accounts had
increased 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe the government is prepared to step in and try to
stem that tide. In the past, intervention has taken place only in
advance of a significant policy development, and there is no new
policy in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, various senior officials of the ruling party have
expressed dissatisfaction with the yen's direction in recent days,
but to no avail. Tuesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hinted
obliquely that the government might move to prop up the yen, and
Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister of finance for international
affairs, suggested that the Group of Seven industrial nations would
join in support of the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, noting the negative impact that the slide in the yen
is having on other Asian currencies, said, ``I couldn't speak of
specific levels, but it is necessary to intervene if the market is
not moving in an orderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The markets assume that as the yen weakens, Japanese exports
become more competitive with those of other Asian countries, and
concern is mounting that the Chinese will be forced to devalue
their currency, the yuan, in spite of pledges not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A report Tuesday in The Financial Times said the Chinese
government was selling yen, in a major shift in its
foreign-currency portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next key point is 150'' yen to the dollar, said Hiroshi
Sakuma, a foreign-exchange trader at Barclays Bank in Tokyo.
``That's the target point for a lot of investors and speculators
because that's the point that many think the Chinese will have to
devalue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists and strategists suggest that allowing the yen to
weaken is, in fact, the government's newest plan to reinvigorate
the deteriorating Japanese economy, in spite of the stern tone of
disapproval emanating from the ministry of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Economists like Paul Krugman have argued that Japan should
deliberately unleash inflation, which would encourage consumers and
companies to spend rather than save in fear that their purchasing
power would be diluted in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Chudler, chief strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in
Tokyo. said: ``This could be the economic policy they're after. If
they allow the currency to depreciate, it should be inflationary by
making imports more expensive, and many economists believe Japan
desperately needs inflation to get the economy going again.''

RESEARCHERS URGE TWICE-A-YEAR STD SCREENING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (In 3rd paragraph, corrects rate among 14-year-olds to 27.5
percent.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A Baltimore study showing almost one-third of sexually active
teenaged girls to be infected with chlamydia has prompted the
researchers to call for screening every six months instead of once
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chlamydia has no symptoms in up to 70 percent of cases, but is
the leading preventable cause of female infertility and painful
pelvic inflammatory disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current Journal of the American
Medical Association, found the highest rate of chlamydia infections
_ 25.5 percent _ in 14-year-olds. Overall, of the more than 3,000
teenaged girls aged 12 to 19 in the study 29.1 percent tested
positive at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Many girls were tested more than once over the 33 months ending
September 1996. About 20 percent of all tests were positive.
</P>
<P>
   The study found no correlation between chlamydia infections
among the teens and known risk factors such as multiple sex
partners or prior history of a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to screen everyone under age 20,'' said lead author
Dr. Gale Burstein of the department of molecular microbiology and
immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``We could not
use any of the (risk-factor) variables to decide who to screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Screening every six months would allow for the detection and
treatment of new infections before they inflame and scar the
uterus, causing infertility, said Burstein.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial said the screening suggestion made
sense, but questioned whether parents, doctors, teens and insurers
would accept that.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently
recommends testing all sexually active teens for chlamydia whenever
they undergo a pelvic examination. Current guidelines recommend an
annual chlamydia screening for those at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Study author Dr. Thomas Quinn of the division of infectious
diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said new urine
tests make more frequent screening easy to do in schools and
communities. He cited studies that show it is cost-effective
whenever chlamydia incidence rises above 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts public health officials reported that chlamydia
cases rose 8 percent last year over the year before. In 1997, 7,330
cases were reported, far below the peak level in 1989 of 10,131.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eight percent increase we're seeing is a result of better
tests,'' Dr. Paul Etkind, director of STD prevention for the
Department of Public Health, said. ``There's more intensive
screening going on in family planning and STD clinics and more
education.``
</P>
<P>
   New tests can now detect infections with as few as 10 bacteria
in a vaginal or urine sample instead of the 10,000 that were needed
before, he said. Some areas, he added, are showing rates of 5
percent to 9 percent, double their previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Baltimore study was conducted among inner city
youths, the researchers said the disease is common among all
population groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlamydia is the most common STD,'' Quinn said. ``If you've
got activity, you're going to find chlamydia. It's not going to go
away until you do this screening.''

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Audiences flocking to the Martin Beck Theater for the
revival of ``The Sound of Music'' couldn't care less that many
critics find the musical irredeemably saccharine. With its famously
tuneful score, this 1959 show, the last Rodgers and Hammerstein
collaboration, is comfortingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   People watch dazed with happiness, bobbing their heads, along
with the Von Trapp children as they learn their do, re, mi's,
smiling with recognition as Maria lists her favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   There is no glitz, no benumbing spectacle, no blaring rock-ified
orchestra, just good old-fashioned musical value and an uplifting
story. The dance numbers are human-scaled and cute; the child
actors are impish and cute; Rebecca Luker's Maria is sweet-voiced
and cute.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't try to tell contented ``Sound of Music'' audiences
that there is a downside to Broadway's obsession with looking back,
manifested by the prevalence of commercially safe revivals like
this one.
</P>
<P>
   An entirely different kind of audience can be found three times
a season at City Center's Encores series, thoroughly enjoying more
modest trips back to Broadway's past, often its distant past.
Encores resurrects neglected old American musicals in exuberant,
choreographed, costumed, concert performances with winning casts
and restored orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the major commercial revivals on Broadway, which are
geared toward turning big profits over long runs, the Encores
series is a nonprofit operation that presents only six performances
of each show. Where else can you hear a stylish performance of the
original 1927 version of George and Ira Gershwin's zany and
musically dazzling ``Strike Up the Band,'' which Encores presented
last season?
</P>
<P>
   The rich American musical tradition stretches back at least to
the 1920s. That is about 80 years' worth of repertory. So it is
natural, even essential, that some energy and care be put into
maintaining this heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance between old and new has long been tilting to the
old, and the problem is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revivals encourage more revivals,'' Stephen Sondheim said
recently. ``Like kudzu, they are choking out new shows.''
</P>
<P>
   However much the public enjoys a chance to revisit musicals like
``The Sound of Music'' or the Roundabout Theater Company's gritty,
decadent revival of ``Cabaret,'' it stands to reason that the
effort, talent and, especially, money that go into revivals
decreases the potential resources for new material.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true now, with production costs for new works
so prohibitively high. If audiences will turn up for a familiar old
show, why should investors take a risk on something new? The more
successful the revival movement becomes, the more this supposed
celebration of the American musical's past will wind up stifling
its future.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is all the more dismaying because it has happened
before, with grim consequences in classical music during this
century. A growing preoccupation with past repertory, an
ever-increasing marginalization of modern works, the shifting of
financial support to institutions that curate the old rather than
cultivate the new _ it is all eerily familiar to those who have
tried to champion contemporary classical music in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The history of opera presents the closest parallel to the
predicament facing the American musical. In the 19th century, going
to the opera was almost like going to the movies today. The new
Verdi opera was awaited like the new Scorsese film.
</P>
<P>
   The repertory in most houses was primarily new or recent,
meaning works written within, say, the previous 15 years.
Occasionally, something like ``Don Giovanni'' was presented in the
nature of a special revival.
</P>
<P>
   This infusion of new works lessened after the turn of the
century, though there was still a significant public demand for
fresh repertory. It is often forgotten that, in the beginning of
his career, Arturo Toscanini was virtually a new-music specialist,
a champion of operas by his Italian-composer colleagues, though
later in his life he was vilified by living composers as a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Caruso sang many roles written expressly for him,
like Dick Johnson, the bandit-hero of Puccini's ``Girl of the
Golden West,'' and Count Loris in Giordano's ``Fedora.'' Compare
his record with today's opera superstars. Among the Three Tenors,
only one, Placido Domingo, has sung in the premiere of an opera
written for him, Gian-Carlo Menotti's ``Goya.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1920s, radical new approaches to harmony, the
breakdown of tonality and the increasing availability of music
through new mass technologies, like the phonograph and radio,
created a climate in which worried impresarios started placating
rather than challenging the public, until today, when introducing a
new concert piece or opera is considered an act of courageous
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The same trend can be traced in American musicals, though the
time it took was much compressed. Popular arts in the 20th century
have developed at a 20th-century pace. In the years between, say,
Louis Armstrong and Ornette Coleman, jazz progressed as much as
classical music did from Bach to Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, major revivals have increasingly claimed
Broadway theaters and lured audiences away from new scores. In this
case, the challenge came from the growing separation between
theater music and pop styles.
</P>
<P>
   The theater music of Gershwin and Porter was also the popular
music of their time. But the music of, say, Jule Styne was far
removed from the pop and rock of the 1950s and 60s that excited
young people. Shows like ``Hair,'' the Who's ``Tommy'' and, most
recently, Jonathan Larson's ``Rent'' represent attempts to bridge
that gap.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even when young creators today reach out to new audiences,
the climate for doing so is perilous. ``Producers are unwilling to
take a chance on new work, because so much of it doesn't become
successful,'' said Sondheim, whose musical modernism has earned him
impassioned admirers but intimidated Broadway audiences. ``They
would rather put their money into pre-sold products, like musicals
adapted from Disney movies, or revivals of shows familiar to the
public, who know what they are getting when they see something
called `The King and I.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, young creative talent is also being crowded out of
theaters by mega-musical British imports from the 1980s like
``Cats'' and ``Les Miserables'' that have settled in for good, it
seems, the Broadway equivalents of Grant's Tomb and other tourist
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, reflects the situation in opera, where crowd-pleasers
like ``Carmen'' and ``La Boheme'' are fixtures in the repertory of
houses large and small. That these operas were the daring, fresh
new works of their day is hard to convey any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the American musical's focus on the past has
come to resemble the early-music movement in classical music, which
advocates using restored (or newly built) period-specific
instruments and adheres to the carefully researched performance
practices of earlier centuries. The aim is not just to recover
neglected early repertory but to present familiar works in
performances deemed historically ``authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare the talk of early-music movement proponents to some
revealing comments from Rob Fisher, the dynamic, 46-year-old
musical theater conductor who serves as musical director of
Encores.
</P>
<P>
   The task of reconstructing old shows from original, often
incomplete, sources requires the kind of scholarship that
musicologists typically employ in the classical field. For his
yeoman efforts, Fisher has rightly become a hero to devotees of the
American musical. But the attitude of historicism that creeps into
his work is worrisome, when viewed in the context of this overall
backward trend.
</P>
<P>
   In Fisher's interesting program notes for ``Strike Up the
Band,'' he explains that the script to the original version of the
show, which closed in 1927 during a pre-Broadway tryout in New
Jersey, is intact. But not the musical score and orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus began our search for any original artifacts that could
help us restore this piece,'' Fisher writes. By assembling parts
from various sources, he learned ``the instrumentation and sound of
the orchestra'' as Gershwin originally intended it. The style of
the choral writing was ascertained from a later 1930 version of the
show that finally reached Broadway. So the musical, as presented by
Encores, he concludes, contained ``every bit of original material
we could find.''
</P>
<P>
   His archival attitude is strikingly similar to that of the
early-instrument movement leaders in classical music. Here is
William Christie, the musical director of the respected Paris-based
early-music ensemble Les Arts Florissants, writing in the program
notes for his recording of Mozart's ``Magic Flute'':
</P>
<P>
   ``For our part, we use the instruments that Mozart knew, the
voices that he admired and a vocal technique close to the one that
he himself practiced.'' He adds, ``It would be dishonest of me not
to admit that we wanted our own version to be a riposte to other
versions.''
</P>
<P>
   This is fairly presumptuous talk. Still, what's so wrong with
looking back? After all, it's great to get a chance to hear a
neglected Gershwin score. And, although ``The Magic Flute'' is a
repertory staple, it's at least interesting to have Christie's take
on how it might have sounded in Mozart's day.
</P>
<P>
   But the archeological aspect to these exhumations seems a sure
sign that both traditions are stuck, especially in comparison with
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of the Encores productions, particularly the
shows from the decades before World War II, is the way they zap us
back to a vibrant time when American musicals were just sassy
excuses for some snazzy songs and lively dance routines, pinned
like clothing on a mere string of a plot.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kern, Porter and Rodgers and Hart, Gershwin churned out his
shows, often one or two a year. In 1924 alone, he wrote four. He
was like some Broadway descendant of Rossini, who produced 39
operas in 20 working years before he basically quit the opera
business at only 37 and at the height of his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that Gershwin's shows, like Rossini's operas,
aren't filled with craft and elegance. But Gershwin was a pragmatic
man of the theater who wrote for specific performers and
situations, and he was quite willing to change songs, arrangements
or whatever was necessary when the show went on tour, or when
another production came along.
</P>
<P>
   Surely he would have been puzzled by the painstakingly complete
recordings that the musical-theater conductor and historian John
McGlinn has done of shows like ``Of Thee I Sing'' and Kern's ``Show
Boat,'' which scrupulously include every jettisoned scrap of music
from every existing version.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher essentially agrees. ``Back then, these shows were a more
disposable product,'' he said recently, ``like the entertainment of
the week. The creator was not expecting us to come along at the end
of the century and put this mosaic back together.'' But Fisher's
audiences understandably love these trips back to the unjaded days
when everybody was making it up as they went along.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim also has a wistful fondness for the early decades of
the musical, before Rodgers and Hammerstein's innovations made it
requisite that a show have a strong narrative book from which all
the songs convincingly emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time of the Gershwins, the vitality was fabulous,''
Sondheim said. ``Everything didn't depend on money. No art forms
today have that kind of vitality, where people are having fun just
trying things. Maybe the Internet, with its cyberbooks and web
sites. It's a mess, but it's vital.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, there is a specific parallel between the
pre-book days of the musical and 18th-century opera and oratorio.
Performance practices back then were just as fluid and vital as
Broadway in the 1920s. Handel and Mozart were theater pros who
tailored their operas to star performers and specific companies.
</P>
<P>
   This is something many period-instrument proselytizers seem to
forget. A lot of scholarship and polemical arguments have gone into
attempts to perform, say, the ``Messiah'' the way Handel would have
performed it. But there were, by some counts, at least 10
presentations of the work in Handel's lifetime involving different
complements of performers and different versions of the score.
Which one is authentic?
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, when Mozart was asked to supervise the Vienna
premiere of Handel's ``Messiah'' in 1789, nearly 50 years after its
composition, his first step was to update this old piece, which
meant re-orchestrating it for the latest instruments and in the
latest style.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway today, the shows that most benefit from revival are
those that had mixed receptions when new and deserve a second look,
or a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's challenging musicals have particularly benefited from
re-considered revivals, especially those that puzzled people when
new, like ``Pacific Overtures'' and, especially, the remarkable,
much-maligned ``Merrily We Roll Along.''
</P>
<P>
   The best recent example was the acclaimed revival of Sondheim's
``Follies'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. The
production of this 1971 show, directed by Robert Johanson, was a
revelation. The complicated book was pared down and cleared up. The
performances were triumphant, particularly from a roster of
veterans who portrayed the former follies girls of the title.
</P>
<P>
   And Sondheim's score, a veritable compendium of older-show song
styles evoked with affection but not without humor, seemed more
brilliant than ever. It reminded me of a comment by Vladimir
Nabokov, who, when asked what his novel ``Lolita'' was about,
replied, ``My love affair with the English language.'' On one
level, ``Follies'' is about Stephen Sondheim's love affair with the
songs from the early days of the American musical.
</P>
<P>
   So revivals deserve a place on the Great White Way. And Fisher's
Encores celebrations are valuable contributions. But the danger of
old works pushing out new ones remains, and young creators are
languishing. Some are no doubt struggling for attention, as
Jonathan Larson did for most of his brief life. Larson had been
turning out scores for musicals for 15 years before New York
Theater Workshop took a chance on him and booked ``Rent'' for a
limited run.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, it took Larson's sudden death to focus attention on
his work, which now looms as a major and innovative contribution to
the musical tradition and which has also been (timid potential
producers take note) hugely profitable.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Rent'' opened, in 1995-96, two other shows by emerging
composers appeared: ``Floyd Collins,'' in 1996, based on true
events surrounding a cave accident in Kentucky in 1925, featured an
accomplished and intriguing score by Adam Guettel; and, in 1997,
``Violet,'' about a scarred woman in rural North Carolina who
travels to Tulsa in hopes that a television evangelist can cure
her, has a revivalist-tinged score by Jeanine Tesori. (She also has
provided the hauntingly beautiful incidental music for the current
production of Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' at Lincoln Center.)
</P>
<P>
   Each show had aimed for a Broadway run. Neither got further than
a stint at Playwrights Horizons, which had developed them and where
they received somewhat mixed reviews. Still, these are promising
creators who need more opportunities to attempt things, to make
mistakes, to learn by doing, just the way Gershwin did.
</P>
<P>
   How might Gershwin have fared today, when each new project has
to have almost provable appeal before producers will consider it,
and where so much energy is put into milking the past for sure
profits?
</P>
<P>
   hoices must be made between reviving the old and fostering the
new. But the risk of bringing back shows like ``The Sound of
Music'' in expensive Broadway productions is that the Jeanine
Tesoris of our day may never get a crack at Broadway at all, and
another Jonathan Larson may be languishing, undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   A Rodgers and Hammerstein revival can be as enjoyable as an
original-instrument performance of Mozart's ``Jupiter'' Symphony.
But they are hardly necessary, the way new creators and new works
are. At least if the American musical is to have a future as well
as a past.

   CIREZ, Yugoslavia _ Two large cargo trucks eased through the
throngs of refugees on Tuesday in this block-long hamlet in the
mountains of Kosovo. Stopping at a decrepit, empty building, the
drivers unlashed the cargo covers and tossed them to one side.
Instantly dozens of men grabbed the 110-pound sacks of flour from
the trucks and stacked them against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The gaunt men, covered with a floury grime, were told to wait
for their family's portion. But the international relief officials
here said that even if there were enough food in this shipment for
all the people who have fled the fighting in this province to take
refuge in the villages and forests nearby, it would not last long.
They said they did not know when they could come back with more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what they insist were their best efforts, foreign
governments were not able to prevent the Yugoslav government's
recent military offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels, from
which these people fled. Now, international aid agencies say they
are not able to provide for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Since the offensive began in late June, with Serbian artillery
attacks against villages in areas controlled by the rebels,
civilians have emptied large sections of Kosovo. But relief
officials say they still have only a general notion of how many
refugees there are or what their physical condition is or even
which villages have been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sketchy overview of what's going on,'' said Mons
Nyberg, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
``This came on so fast that the international community was
unprepared to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other way to describe it than piecemeal,'' said an
international aid official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``We hear about a group of people _ maybe it's thousands of people
_ we throw some kind of supply convoy together and we take them
what we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure we are not doing nearly enough, but since no one
knows how many people we're not helping, I can't tell you how much
more we should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of this hamlet from where the flour is stored,
at a fly-specked medical clinic with broken windows, dozens of
patients stood in sweltering, stench-filled rooms waiting to see
the doctor. Nearby, foreign water and sanitation experts were
inspecting a well.
</P>
<P>
   They were from Oxfam, a nonprofit relief organization. The well
is being used by refugees crammed into the local school. The well
was adequate for the few families who lived here, local officials
say, but now the water level is dropping quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees hauled up the water bucket and passed it around, each
drinking from it or pouring water into dirty plastic bottles. With
overcrowded and primitive living conditions, even for those who
have shelter indoors, there is an increasing fear of epidemics.
Children and the elderly are suffering from intestinal diseases
already, relief agency doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxfam experts said that with some effort, they think they
can rig up a more reliable and sanitary way to distribute water
here. But that would be for the 360 people now living in the
school. The best estimates are that 80,000 people have been
displaced by the current military offensive, and many of them are
nowhere near a well.
</P>
<P>
   Higher up in the mountains, two refugee children whose families
are living in the open carried plastic bottles to a muddy stream
where other children were bathing along with a herd of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the larger of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of the residents of Kosovo province in Serbia are
ethic Albanians. The government carried out its most recent
offensive to recapture areas taken as the rebels gained support
among Kosovo residents.
</P>
<P>
   As government military forces have advanced, homes and sometimes
whole villages have been set on fire. But it is fear that keeps
most keeps most of the refugees from going home.
</P>
<P>
   International aid officials say they do not have the staff in
Kosovo to respond properly, and most say they do not expect to get
much more help.
</P>
<P>
   Before the current offensive, the United Nations said there were
at least 167,000 refugees within Kosovo. With the estimated 80,000
new refugees, the total is well over 10 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so much work here I'm shattered _ I am dead,'' said
Mick Lorentzen, the only staff employee of the U.N. World Food
Program in Kosovo. Lorentzen said two additional employees have
been assigned but have not been granted visas by the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
   With his family living under plastic sheets covered with tree
branches to provide camouflage and protection from the sun, Abedin
Makolli, 24, said on Tuesday: ``We live like primitive people, but
we cannot go home because it is too dangerous. We have moved three
times since we left home because the army keeps coming, but we
cannot go back.''

BOEING BEGINS SERIES OF COST-CUTTING MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the first of a series of cost-cutting measures, The
Boeing Co. has frozen all hiring in its commercial aircraft
division and ordered managers to get special permission before
granting travel requests or other ``non-essential'' items,
according to an internal company bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The notice sent by Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President
Ron Woodard and obtained by the Post-Intelligencer Tuesday also
instructed managers to curtail spending on the ``low-hanging
fruit'': off-site meetings, non-essential office supplies,
periodical subscriptions, trips to seminars and non-crucial
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our profit margins, we simply cannot afford the `nice to
do' things,'' Woodard said in the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   His cost-cutting program is a direct response to Boeing Chairman
Phil Condit's goal of obtaining a 7 percent net return on sales by
the year 2000 _ meaning Boeing would earn 7 cents on every dollar
of revenue, after taxes and other expenses are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, Boeing expects to earn about $1 billion this year,
less than 2 percent of projected sales.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the overall 7 percent profit margin goal, earnings
from Boeing's commercial aircraft division and its defense and
space operations must be at least 11 percent, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial division is far from that now with earnings
from operations expected to be less than 1 percent this year. Next
year, the commercial division _ which accounts for about 60 percent
of the company's total revenues _ is predicting only a slight
improvement with a 2 to 4 percent profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us should find that an acceptable operating profit
margin and we must dedicate ourselves to doing better _ much
better,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is gaining ground on getting its airplane
production back to normal and now ``where we need to focus renewed
attention is on costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that we've had a very difficult year,'' Woodard
said. ``Our production problems, combined with pricing pressures in
the marketplace, have led to poor financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also plans to reduce costs by cutting employment between
18,000 to 28,000 jobs by the end of next year through attrition and
layoffs. The company employs 238,000 people in 27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have not yet said exactly how many job cuts
will occur or where and Woodard did not address employment in his
recent memo, but the reductions are expected to be spread
throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the overall number are 12,000 previously announced
reductions from Boeing's commercial aircraft division, which has
headquarters in Renton and employs about 110,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, job cuts could come from further consolidation of
Boeing operations throughout the country, which the company expects
to announce tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Boeing plans to announce whether it has decided to
establish a new 737 assembly line at its commercial aircraft
factory in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While executives officially are saying no decision has yet been
made, people familiar with the announcement said the California 737
assembly plan already has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Boeing officials will continue last-minute
negotiations Wednesday with the company's largest union, which
opposes sending assembly work to California.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for going along with Boeing's plan, the Machinists
union is seeking concessions from the company, according to people
familiar with the talks.

NLRB TO MOVE ON PLAYERS' COMPLAINTS  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next step in the labor dispute between the National
Basketball Association and its players will come Thursday. The two
sides will not meet at the bargaining table, and they will not go
before an arbitrator. Thursday it is the National Labor Relations
Board's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the day the New York office of the NLRB plans to
forward to the general counsel in Washington a recommendation on
the players' unfair labor practice charge. ``We're still receiving
information from the NBA,'' Daniel Silverman, director of the New
York office, said Tuesday. ``We don't have a full case investigated
yet. But we hope we'll have a submission to Washington with a
recommendation within a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Silverman does not plan to be in his office Friday, the
first day of a planned vacation, he is expected to make his
recommendation to the board Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, who was instrumental in settling Major League
Baseball's 1994-95 strike, could take one of three steps: dismiss
the union's charge, issue a complaint against the league based on
the union's charge, or recommend that the board seek an injunction
in federal district court that, if granted, would shatter the
league's labor strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The players' preference is an injunction that would declare the
NBA's lockout illegal. In filing the unfair labor practice charge
last month, the union contended that the lockout was illegal
because the owners had not bargained in good faith and had
unilaterally changed working conditions, such as placing a freeze
on signings.
</P>
<P>
   Because seeking an injunction would be the most severe step the
NLRB could take, it would need approval first by the acting general
counsel, Fred Feinstein, and then by a majority of the five-member
board in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If Silverman recommends seeking an injunction, the timing could
be critical. William Gould, the board chairman, ends his term Aug.
27, which means if the matter is not addressed promptly, the board
may be reduced to four members when the recommendation comes up for
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know is the New York regional office will
conclude its involvement on Thursday,'' Gould said Tuesday in a
telephone interview. ``The matter will go to the general counsel on
Thursday. I don't know how quickly, if at all, the general counsel,
will take action. By tradition, we wait for the general counsel to
make a recommendation to us, if in fact there is a
recommendation.''

JUDGE RULES GATES MUST GIVE DEPOSITION IN PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered Tuesday that the government's pretrial
questioning of Bill Gates and other executives of Microsoft Corp.
must be opened up to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling giving the press and the public access to
depositions in a major antitrust case is somewhat unusual, but it
is not unprecedented. One similar instance came during the Justice
Department's 13-year pursuit of IBM, a case that the government
dropped in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A deposition from Gates, chairman and chief executive of
Microsoft, had been scheduled to begin Wednesday, but it was
postponed temporarily as the company's lawyers decided whether to
appeal the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court in Washington applies not only to depositions of Gates but
also to those of 16 other Microsoft employees. The Justice
Department and 20 states have charged Microsoft with illegally
protecting its monopoly in operating systems for personal computers
and trying to extend its monopoly into the new Internet software
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company was ``very concerned
about the possible impact of the ruling on our trial preparation
and on the trial moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 8 in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the company spokesman said, wants to insure that its
trade secrets and confidential business information are protected
during the deposition process. Until a procedure for assuring
confidentiality and the logistics for giving reporters access can
be resolved, ``all depositions are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling came in response to a motion filed by The New
York Times, The Seattle Times and the cable-television and online
news units of Ziff-Davis, a computer trade publisher. Their filing
was joined by two news services, Reuters and Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to open up pretrial depositions was made under a
provision of the nation's antitrust laws. The law states that in
civil antitrust actions brought by the federal government, the
taking of depositions ``shall be open to the public as freely as
are trials in open court, and no order excluding the public from
attendance on any such proceedings shall be valid or enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Publicity in Taking of Evidence Act was passed in 1913 as
public concern about the power of industrial monopolies was at its
peak. The law was enacted, legal scholars say, to insure that the
market practices of the industrial trusts were scrutinized in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusually clear and powerful statute,'' said Adam
Liptak, a lawyer for The New York Times. ``In antitrust cases
brought by the government, the presumption of public access is
almost absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Liptak said, The Times favors open court
proceedings, and the Microsoft case, in particular, is one of
considerable public interest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft case, Jackson had approved a protective order
in May limiting public access to confidential business information
gathered by the government and Microsoft during pretrial discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tuesday's ruling, he said that the 1913 evidence act did
allow the press and the public access to the depositions. And he
instructed Microsoft, the news organizations and the government and
the states to figure out a procedure that would open the taking of
depositions but would also prevent ``unnecessary disclosure of
trade secrets and other confidential information.''

OPENING HIS BAG OF TRICKS, AYCKBORN PLAYS WITH TIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is no secret after 53 plays that Alan Ayckbourn
relishes a challenge. And in play No. 49, ``Communicating Doors,''
the task he has posed for himself is this: how to mold a comic
thriller _ or even a scary farce _ while at the same time shuttling
his characters back and forth in time with an abandon many a
filmmaker might envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of a plot, I think of an idea, and then I wonder, `How
can I get that onto the stage?' '' Ayckbourn was saying one recent
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old playwright was speaking by telephone from his
office at the Stephen Joseph Theater in Scarborough, Yorkshire,
which has been his creative home for most of his prolific
professional life. A member of the theater company since 1957, he
became its artistic director in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Like all but three of Ayckbourn's plays, ``Communicating Doors''
had its premiere in Scarborough, in 1994. It opened 18 months later
on the West End, where it ran almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the American premiere of the play opens Off
Broadway at the Variety Arts Theater, directed by Christopher
Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hodges plays Ruella, Julia McKenzie's star role in the
West End version. Ruella is the second wife of an aging client of a
young, latex-clad dominatrix named Poopay (``It's French for
doll''), portrayed by Mary-Louise Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Ruella is destined to suffer the same fate at the hands of her
murderous husband as his first wife, and it is the conceit of this
play to whiz its characters between 1978, 1998 and 2018 in an
effort to rewrite history _ with a communicating door between hotel
suites as the specific onstage mechanism that allows for the travel
in time.
</P>
<P>
   Not, Ayckbourn said, that the play ought to seem a mere trick.
``Whatever devices you use should always be there to serve the
theme,'' he said. ``If the theme has been overtaken by the device,
then something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, his interest lay in ``the question that
all of us ask: What would have happened if I had taken a different
course, if I had done this or done that?''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Ayckbourn said, ``that we can alter things at the
time if we just think about them a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I once called the play a `Back to the Future' for the stage,''
he continued, ``but it seemed to me very important that in the
middle of that was a human story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Communicating Doors,'' he added, was about ``turning points in
lives, people you meet who can change your life, as Ruella does for
Poopay and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley is known for his work with the American dramatist Paul
Rudnick on plays like ``Jeffrey.'' He called Rudnick and Ayckbourn
both very funny writers, though Ayckbourn has a much slower burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's comedy is explosive and building,'' Ashley said.
``Ayckbourn is sneakier in terms of what is comic about the moment.
I keep thinking about puzzles with him _ if A, then B; if B, then
C.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Ayckbourn plays, too, toy with time. ``Henceforward ...''
(1988) occupies the same vaguely ominous future intermittently
envisioned in ``Communicating Doors,'' while ``Time of My Life''
(1993) begins at a matriarch's 54th birthday and then shifts both
ahead and back to reveal a family in psychic disarray.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Ayckbourn is aware, has a distinctly edited view of
his career, insofar as many of his plays have yet to be seen there
and those that have been _ ``A Small Family Business,'' for
example, had a short Broadway run in 1992 _ did not always succeed.
</P>
<P>
   This play, he said, ``is about self-determination and survival
and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are much more concepts that an American audience will
understand.''

U.S. AGREES TO $1.9 MILLION DEAL IN SHOOTING DEATH OF TEXAS TEEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The U.S. government has agreed to a $1.9 million
wrongful-death settlement with the family of a border youth shot
last year by Marines, but a Presidio County grand jury refused
again Tuesday to indict the man who pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Weinacht, lawyer for the family of Esequiel Hernandez Jr.,
said Tuesday that the Navy and the Department of Justice agreed to
pay the hefty sum rather than face a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Weinacht's announcement came on the same day a grand jury for
the second time in a year declined to charge 23-year-old Marine
Cpl. Clemente Banuelos with murder in the death of Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied I've done what I could,'' said Presidio County
District Attorney Albert Valadez. ``There are no loose ends.
Everything has been tied up and presented to the grand jury in a
nice big package.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of the settlement revived allegations of wrongdoing
in the case of the high school sophomore, who was shot to death
last year by a team of four Marines on an anti-drug patrol along a
remote stretch of the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But with the second grand jury decision made public Tuesday,
hope of laying blame on the government in the Hernandez case rests
largely with U.S. Rep. Lamar Alexander, R-Texas, whose House
Judiciary subcommittee is investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning we've believed there are problems with
the facts of this case,'' said Weinacht, a Pecos attorney who spoke
for the Hernandez family. ``Certainly there's enough evidence to
call into question the conduct of the Marines.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Watney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the
government acknowledged no fault in its agreement with the
Hernandez family. She declined to acknowledge the amount of the
settlement, which Weinacht said came in the form of a $1 million
annuity that over its life is expected to grow to $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of Esequiel Hernandez said the settlement
proves the government is to blame in the youth's death. Weinacht
quoted Margarito Hernandez, one of Esequiel's seven brothers and
sisters, as saying that if the federal government ``accepted the
deal, they accepted it was a wrong thing that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement further suggested to some that the state and
federal inquiries into the matter, all of which have exonerated the
Marines, are suspect. Additional investigations by the Marine
Corps, which falls under the Navy, and Joint Task Force 6, the
anti-drug umbrella group under which the Marines were training at
the time of the shooting, also found no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves to me wrongdoing at the very highest level,'' said
Mel LaFollette, an activist and Hernandez family friend who has
fought the government since the young Hernandez was shot. ``It
proves beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an unlawful
cover-up of this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   While the investigations into the matter have suggested
otherwise, the House Immigration and Claims Subcommittee is
nevertheless delving into the matter. Angered that no one has been
reprimanded in the shooting, Smith has subpoened the Justice and
Defense departments for documents related to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred May 20, 1997, on a bluff east of Redford,
a tiny town west of Big Bend National Park on the banks of the Rio
Grande. Hernandez, who had just turned 18 and had no criminal
record, was herding his goats at dusk when he encountered the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hernandez shot twice with his vintage .22-caliber rifle,
it is unclear whether he knew what he was firing at. The Marines,
camouflaged from head to toe for their undercover operation in the
desert scrub, trailed Hernandez for 20 minutes before Banuelos shot
him once with an M-16 from about 150 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a member of the military had fired on a
U.S. citizen since troops were deployed on border operations in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The incident sparked a vigorous debate about the role of the
armed forces on the border and led to the end of armed military
anti-drug patrols. But neither Presidio County grand jury probes
nor one convened by the Justice Department last winter yielded any
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, including those of the Marine Corps and
Joint Task Force 6, found the Marines were acting within the rules
of engagement, which allows soldiers to fire if fired upon, even in
domestic law-enforcement situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position from the beginning is that Cpl. Banuelos was
completely justified,'' said Jack Zimmermann, a Houston lawyer
representing Banuelos. ``But under the circumstances, the
humanitarian award seems appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second grand jury convened this month and last, meeting four
times and even taking a walking tour of the site where Hernandez
was killed. Though no live witnesses were presented, Valadez made
use of stacks of evidence from the recently concluded federal
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the El Paso-based Border Rights Coalition, said the
sizeable settlement proved the investigations wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the government ever acknowledges fault is through
a quick and easy settlement like this one,'' said Laura Valdez, a
spokeswoman for the group. ``The government has never been in the
business of giving away money.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of modest means living in an adobe home a short walk
from river bank, Esequiel Hernandez Sr. and his wife are to receive
the money in installments. Weinacht said they are happy to have the
matter behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really ready to be left alone,'' he said. ``They just
want to go on with their life, and this will help relieve their
economic strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinacht said the elder Hernandez intends to make few changes in
his life, no longer picking onions and alfalfa as a day laborer in
the nearby fields but still herding his goats and farming hay on
the flood plain of the river that divides the United States from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Hernandezes may want to distance themselves from
the death of their son and the national attention it won,
LaFollette said the incident still haunts Redford.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day it's a raw and open wound on everybody's psyche,
especially the children's,'' he said. ``There's an unpleasant
feeling toward the government.''

ADAM COHEN, SINGER, SONGWRITER AND SON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're an aspiring singer-songwriter itching to pour your
oh-so-sensitive and special feelings into personal anthems of pain
and redemption, it must be intimidating to labor in the shadows of
Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen and all the others who
hijacked confessional poetry in the 1960s and '70s and grafted it
onto folk music.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, how do you begin to match achievements
that radically personalized pop music's voice and opened up its
subject matter to embrace the minutely autobiographical? And in
today's dumbed-down pop culture, in which emotional vulnerability
is viewed with suspicion and everyone pretends to know everything
about life anyway, who's going to want to listen?
</P>
<P>
   Adam Cohen, 26, the son of Leonard Cohen, deserves points for
jumping in over his head and infusing some passion into a moribund
folk-pop tradition. In the best songs from his debut album ``Adam
Cohen'' (Columbia) _ the nasty, tormented ones _ this talented but
still partly unformed songwriter forces you to feel his anger,
jealousy and frustration over various erotic entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   It is when he steps back and begins philosophizing about how
everybody is lost and alone that Cohen's songs deteriorate into
platitudinous reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The singer, who worked with several collaborators on this
surprisingly melodic album, is a highly expressive vocalist whose
voice blends hints of his father's sepulchral drone with the racked
expansiveness of Bono (a sometimes too-obvious influence) and the
eager, crybaby emotiveness of the Canadian pop singer Dan Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But what's best about Cohen's singing is the way he delivers a
lyric as if he were living the song right then and there. At the
same time, the album's most original songs have jagged melodic
lines and shifting atmospheres that perfectly mirror the lyrics'
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive performance can be found on the album's
opening cut, ``Tell Me Everything,'' whose narrator demands to know
_ pleading tremulously at first, then escalating to a tone of
raging desperation _ if his best friend is sleeping with the woman
the narrator loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spare me the lies, and all your tact,'' he says grimly, then
bursts into a howl. ``Tell me everything!'' he screams. ``Leave
nothing out/Tell me all about it/I'm right here listening.'' The
vocal equivalent of Method acting, it's quite chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Me Everything'' is not the only song about a twisted,
deceitful triangle. In ``Sister,'' which Cohen hisses in a tone of
bitter contempt, the narrator sneers at an obsequious friend, who
may be homosexually inclined, for saying he wants to date the
narrator's sister ``because she's so much like you.''
</P>
<P>
   In this creepy blanket put-down, Cohen describes the object of
his scorn as ``the kind of guy who looks you a little too deep in
the eye'' and recalls having once observed him sneaking into his
room and trying on his cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Adding an extra-musical resonance to these songs of embattled
friendship involving a shadowy female figure is their relation to
one of Leonard Cohen's greatest songs, ``Famous Blue Raincoat.'' As
this long, pained epistle offering forgiveness to the man who slept
with the letter-writer's wife unfolds, it becomes ever clearer that
the narrator himself is half in love with the friend who betrayed
him.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer cruelty, ``Sister'' can't touch ``Don't Mean
Anything,'' one of the nastiest songs ever written about falling
out of love. In speech-song verses that have been electronically
filtered to make them sound even more sinister, the singer icily
describes acting out a charade of affection with a lover for whom
he has lost all sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   In the chorus, he croons, with a quiet boastfulness, lines that
are devastating in their bluntness: ``It's hard to feel when you
don't/It's hard to say you will when you won't/And if you do/It
don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Me Everything,'' ``Sister,'' and ``Don't Mean Anything''
are the three clear winners on an album whose other songs are
marred to varying degrees by sentimental cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Pain,'' a strong, insightful ballad about how emotional
masochism can enhance intimacy in a relationship, is bogged down by
a mundane refrain in which poor Vincent Van Gogh, one of pop
music's favorite points of pretentious comparison, is trotted out
as a too-easy reference.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs on the album find Cohen overly enthralled with his
influences. ``Beautiful as You'' is the prettiest of several songs
that strain to make grand statements about love and life in a style
reminiscent of U2. ``How the Mighty Have Fallen,'' a laboriously
elongated slogan, and ``Down She Goes,'' an impersonal observation
of a drug addict's decline, have the flatness of songwriting
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the album's best songs still mark ``Adam Cohen'' as an
unusually impressive debut and one that also bears out that old
expression about the apple not falling far from the tree. If the
late Jeff Buckley (the son of Tim Buckley), Rufus Wainwright (the
son of Loudon Wainwright III) and now Cohen all bring strong echoes
of their fathers into their work, they have also staked out their
own territory in terms of subject matter and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Although we'll never know how Buckley might have developed, at
the time of his death last year he was moving toward a fusion of
hyper-romantic folk-jazz with his own quirky style of alternative
rock. Wainwright brings his father's whimsy to gay subjects and
writes ornate folk-pop music that skews toward the operatic.
Cohen's music is also stylistically more expansive than his
father's in its inclusion of light funk grooves.
</P>
<P>
   Like their famous fathers, they all chose to take the high road
artistically at a time when that road has never seemed lonelier and
more fraught with commercial pitfalls. As their albums show, it is
still a road well worth taking.

AMID DOWNTURN, ANOTHER INTERNET COMPANY'S IPO CATCHES FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never have so many pictures of puppies been worth so much.
</P>
<P>
   Investors clamored to buy the stock of Geocities on Tuesday,
despite a falling market and the fact that the company has yet to
prove it can make money by giving its 2 million members free pages
on the Internet's World Wide Web to show off their kids, their pets
and their bottle-top collections.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Geocities shares closed at $37.3125, more than double
the offering price of $17. That values the company, which had a
loss on revenues of less than $5 million last year, at $1.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities is among a sector of Internet businesses known as
virtual communities, because they offer free real estate in
cyberspace and often organize chat areas of shared interests as
virtual neighborhoods, villages, etc. Virtual communities hope to
sell advertising based on the number of visitors these home-grown
Web pages attract.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary competition for visitors and advertising dollars
is the Internet contrivances known as portals that combine free Web
pages with e-mail, search facilities and other services and
products to attract users.
</P>
<P>
   The portal business won another endorsement Tuesday _ and
Geocities got a formidable new competitor _ when Lycos, a search
and directory service, said that it had agreed to buy WhoWhere for
$133 million in stock. WhoWhere operates the Anglefire service,
which offers home pages, electronic mail service and a telephone
directory that lets Internet users look up phone numbers online.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lycos bought Tripod, another service that offers
home pages, for $57 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals will give Lycos 3.1 million home pages, more than
Geocities' 2.1 million. Measured by numbers of visitors to its
sites each month, Lycos will now be No. 4 on the Internet, behind
America Online, Yahoo and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Media Metrix, a company that measures audience
size on the Internet, found that Anglefire was the fastest-growing
site in the first half of this year. The other fast-growing sites
were also mainly those that offered home pages, chat and other
``community building'' services.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in the stock of Geocities was all the more spectacular
because of the sharp decline in the overall stock market and of
Internet companies in particular. Shares of America Online fell
$5.625, to $107.125, and Yahoo dropped $2.625, to $91.375. Lycos'
shares fell a greater percentage, closing at $63.5625, down $4.375.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors continued to show insatiable appetite for the
initial offerings of Internet companies. Last month, the stock of
Broadcast.com, which offers audio programs on the Internet, jumped
245 percent on its first day of trading, the biggest debut increase
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities offering was oversubscribed by 20 times, said one
person involved in the underwriting. Indeed, that was after the
opening price was increased from an initial target of $12, to a
proposed range of $14 to $16, and was ultimately set at $17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geocities is a meaningful franchise with fantastic growth and
good management,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancAmerica
Robertson Stephens, a brokerage firm that was not involved in the
underwriting. ``It's not obvious how profitable that franchise will
become.''
</P>
<P>
   Geocities, and its competitors, hopes to make money by placing
ads on people's home pages as well as on the other pages that
people see as they navigate around the service. But advertisers
have been skeptical of gambling on home-grown content that at best
is random and extraneous and at worst offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lycos chief executive Robert Davis said that since buying
Tripod the company had been able to add nearly 200 advertisers and
direct marketers to the service. He said that Lycos expected
similar results with sales of ads on WhoWhere's services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the analysts who follow Lycos' stock said they were
impressed with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to Bob Davis,'' said Paul Noglows, an
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``He has a knack for taking traffic
and squeezing revenue out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Lycos would keep its two services separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tripod is geared almost entirely to the Generation X audience,
which is highly desirable to advertisers,'' he said. ``Anglefire
includes a lot of other demographic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   WhoWhere chief executive Dale Fuller said the company had
several other suitors, whom he declined to name, and had many
investment bankers interested in taking the company public.
Ultimately, he said, the company's investors, which included
venture capital funds backed by the Rockefeller and the Bass
families, preferred Lycos shares to any of the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan, said the
price Lycos paid seemed reasonable, relative to other Internet
acquisitions. Microsoft, for example, paid $400 million, or about
$40 a member, for the Hotmail electronic mail service. Ms. Williams
said Lycos was paying $13 for each WhoWhere member.
</P>
<P>
   The market value of Geocities, on the other hand, comes out to
$523 a member. That makes for some pretty pricey puppies, indeed.

NETS' WILLIAMS IS ON FAST TRACK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. _ Jayson Williams is not someone who is
comfortable with idle time. With the National Basketball
Association players locked out, the All-Star center for the Nets is
spending his off season running from one appearance to another
trying to fill the gaps in his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Last week it was a trip to the Cayman Islands to film a
commercial. Presumably footage of a seasick Williams hanging over
the side of a boat will be cut, along with the footage of his
lawyer, Oscar Holt, rushing to the aid of the 6-foot-11-inch player
a bit too quickly and being flipped overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Safely back on shore, Williams delivered a brief lecture Tuesday
at the Jayson Williams All-Star Basketball Camp, then patiently
signed autographs for the children in attendance. When the line
finally wound down, he hopped in his car and headed to one of his
twice-a-day workouts, and then it was on to the next round of
charity appearances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Williams will not do is sit and wait for the league
and the players union to settle their differences. Williams
reiterated his desire to find a game, and if it isn't in the NBA,
he said, he will go wherever he has to go to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls from Billy Hunter telling me to come down,'' he
said, referring to the executive director of the NBA players
association. ``He says that I'm intelligent and can help them with
this stuff. But I don't have the patience for it. I don't have the
patience for somebody getting up and walking out on a situation
like the owners did. I think it was immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has maintained that if the lockout is not settled, he
will play in Italy. He said he received an offer from the Italian
team Kinder Bologna on a per-game basis.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Sal DiFazio, was not available for comment, but
another agent said that it would be possible to structure such a
deal and that an Italian League team might be willing to do it if
it believed that the NBA lockout would be resolved quickly. This
would enable the European league to reap the benefits of the
publicity Williams would bring without the cost being prohibitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is a free agent, has no contract that restricts
him from playing elsewhere. But the NBA honors European deals, so
to return, he would have to have an escape clause in any deal he
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a basketball player,'' Williams said. ``If you think I'm
going to sit back here all year and not go to Italy and play
basketball, you're crazy. That's what I do. I've got to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy is out if there is an NBA. But they told me they'll pay
me by the game. I'm going to go out there and do some camps. I'm
real big in Europe. The day that the NBA gets it back, that's the
day I'll come back.''

Unlike peaches, whose raw glory can barely be improved upon,
tomatoes are all about potential. The difference between consuming
a tomato out of hand and slicing it, then sprinkling it with a

that it takes so little to convert them from one to the other.

ear and full corn flavor, in early development at Caradonna Farms
in Ulster County. This type of corn was grown widely earlier in the

Unlike peaches, whose raw glory can barely be improved upon,
tomatoes are all about potential. The difference between consuming
a tomato out of hand and slicing it, then sprinkling it with a
pinch of salt and a few drops of olive oil, is the difference
between a snack and a dish. And the great thing about tomatoes is
that it takes so little to convert them from one to the other.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline'' opened in June at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, the directors Adrian Noble and Andrei
Serban talked in these pages about staging this rarely seen
adventure-comedy-romance in nearly back-to-back versions.
</P>
<P>
   Noble's, by the Royal Shakespeare Company, was his first attempt
at directing the play. So, too, with Serban, whose ``Cymbeline''
opens Sunday night at the Delacorte Theater, part of the New York
Shakespeare Festival's 43rd season in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, with Noble warning about the play's five-act length
_ ``It's absolutely massive'' _ Serban said that he had not decided
on any concept and that he was ``just starting.'' At a recent
preview he seemed to have made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few nights ago, as a nearly round-faced moon smiled
whimsically overhead, the large cast of Andrei Serban's
``Cymbeline'' ended the first act by appearing to walk into Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the park had grown over the set, which consists of a
large grass-covered oval, a grove of trees and a stream along one
side. At the center of the stage is a white circle of sand on which
much of the action takes place. Elaborate it isn't, but there is
more than a hint of concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, my imagination has to work,'' Serban said. ``Realism
in a situation like this would be killing.''
</P>
<P>
   The director, 55, who from 1990 to 1993 ran the National Theater
in Romania, where he was born, is the head of the graduate acting
program at Columbia University. Perched high up at the Delacorte,
where he could see everything going on, he talked about the play
during intermission.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed pleased and concerned about his leading lady,
Stephanie Roth Haberle, who is 7{ months' pregnant. She portrays
Imogen, daughter of Cymbeline, king of ancient Britain. In a story
full of concealments, her pregnancy is undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Other cast members include Herb Foster, Hazelle Goodman, Randall
Duk Kim, George Morfogen, Liev Schreiber and Robert Stanton. Among
the more than 20 plot complications are scenes involving
cross-dressing, lost brothers, mistaken identities, a wicked
stepmother and war. Eventually, the god Jupiter arrives to sort
things out.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking quickly in his Romanian accent and gesturing
frequently, Serban said about Ms. Haberle: ``Stephanie carries life
inside her. It is very touching. It's not a metaphor; it's real.
From night to night, you don't know. She could give birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he choose the actress, who spends half the play dressed
as a man?
</P>
<P>
   ``In auditions, she touched me the most,'' he said. ``She makes
the language part of her experience. When I see Shakespeare, I am
often bored because the actors don't understand what they are
saying. Stephanie is very much like what I feel Imogen is in the
play _ like Dante's Beatrice, the symbol of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Serban said there is more symbolism in his decision to have
Schreiber play both the evil Iachimo and the god Jupiter. Iachimo
bets Imogen's exiled husband Posthumus (Michael Hall) that he can
seduce her. Though he fails, he boasts of his success, and the
furious Posthumus orders his wife's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, Iachimo is portrayed as a conniver and manipulator,
an Iago, a villain,'' Serban said. ``But I think he is Jupiter, who
takes a human form in order to challenge Posthumus to see himself,
to see his limitations, to see his own vanity, so that he can
suffer and mature. From the very beginning, Imogen is ready for
Posthumus, but he is not ready for her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Iachimo is a very positive devil, a holy devil _ we need
that in life,'' the director said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``I am convinced that nothing that happens to us is
accidental. Everything in our life is a test. We are always
tested.''
</P>
<P>
   By whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think by G-O-D,'' he replied, laughing again and
spelling but not saying the word. ``I'm very old-fashioned that
way. I'm not a post-modernist.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars date ``Cymbeline'' to about 1610, six years before
Shakespeare's death. ``Compared to `Cymbeline,' '' Serban said, ``
`King Lear' is like the `Ninth Symphony.' `Cymbeline,' being a late
work, is more like Beethoven's late quartets. It is much more
subtle, more delicate, more like a man at the end of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary entitled ``Crossroads,'' made earlier this year
about the acting program at Columbia and Serban's work there, shows
the director speaking about reactions over the years to his
productions: ``I got incredibly bad reviews all my life,'' he says
in the movie. ``I have friends who ask me, `How do you get your
next job when you get such bad reviews?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This might be a bit of an exaggeration. For example, Serban's
most recent production in New York _ ``The Caucasian Chalk Circle''
at La Mama in May, with his graduating students as cast members _
won critical praise. He has worked with many leading actors, and
since 1980 has directed operas around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a theory about this,'' he explained the other day,
referring to the reviews. ``What I try to do in the theater is
always to change. I don't have, like Robert Wilson, Richard Foreman
or Peter Sellars, a style of my own. I try to do theater that
escapes definition. When critics come, they say, `What is his
style?' But I don't have a style. And perhaps that is confusing to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Delacorte, as people began returning to their seats,
Serban looked around, interested to see how they were reacting.
</P>
<P>
   Later he said: ``I hope the audience goes home with a vast range
of impressions about human life. An audience that sees this play
might then be able to see life on a cosmic as well as a social
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People fall asleep easily in the theater,'' he said. ``The
seats are comfortable. It's very warm. In Central Park, we are in
the fresh, open air. We can see the moon. We can feel we are part
of something greater. It is an opportunity not to fall asleep.''

   BRITISH PETROLEUM TO BUY AMOCO IN $48.2 BILLION DEAL
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum announced that it would acquire Amoco, the big
oil company, for $48.2 billion in stock. The deal is the largest
oil industry merger ever, as well as the largest foreign takeover
of an American company. If approved by regulators and shareholders
of both companies, BP Amoco, as the company is to be known, will be
the world's third-largest multinational oil company in terms of net

   Russian stocks fell 9.11 percent, nearly as great a decline as
on Monday. Government bonds tumbled to their lowest prices ever, as
rates on the Russian equivalent of United States Treasury bills
approached 80 percent for three-month maturities and 140 percent
for nine-month maturities. ``It's a collapse in confidence about
the Russian Government's ability to fund itself,'' a former World
Bank official said.
</P>

<P>
   SECOND-QUARTER PRODUCTIVITY OFF
</P>
<P>
   Workers' productivity fell at an annual rate of two-tenths of 1

a toll.
</P>
<P>
   LONG BOND'S YIELD NEAR LOW
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.62 percent,
near its all-time low, as investors seeking a haven from stocks and

RELUCTANTLY, LAFONTAINE RETIRES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having suffered a series of debilitating and
increasingly dangerous concussions, the most recent of which
occurred last March 16 when a freakish collision with a Rangers
linemate ended his season, Pat LaFontaine announced his reluctant
but unequivocal retirement from hockey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my choice, you bet I'd be suiting up for the New York
Rangers this season,'' the 33-year-old center said during a news
conference at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine suited up as Mark Messier's replacement last season
despite five previously diagnosed concussions and a history of
post-concussion syndrome. It was a testament to LaFontaine's desire
to close his career on his own terms and to the Rangers'
desperation to back Wayne Gretzky with a proven center.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine finished the season _ albeit prematurely _ second on
the team in scoring with 62 points and tied for first in goals with
23. But the injury from his head-on crash with Mike Keane, which
was not diagnosed as a concussion at first, all but assured that
LaFontaine would not return to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``His was a career almost second to none, certainly in American
hockey history,'' said the Rangers' president, Neil Smith.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine is a five-time All-Star and two-time Olympian whose
148-point season with the Buffalo Sabres in 1992-93 set a record
for American-born players. In January, he became only the third
American player to score 1,000 NHL points.
</P>
<P>
   The solid but far from strapping 5-foot-10-inch sniper
accumulated 468 goals and 545 assists in 1,056 games. His
consistency put him in eighth place on the career goals-per-game
list behind such notables as Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky and Mike
Bossy.
</P>
<P>
   The collision with Keane resulted in LaFontaine's sixth
diagnosed concussion, a Grade II level injury that followed on the
heels of a more severe Grade III blow that knocked him unconscious
and cost him the 1996-97 season at Buffalo. LaFontaine's concussion
as a Ranger was the 56th sustained by an NHL player in 1997-98, a
season in which notables like Eric Lindros, Dennis Vaske and Paul
Kariya were also sidelined by concussions. Lindros, acutely aware
that his younger brother, Brett, was forced into retirement in 1995
after sustaining two concussions within eight days, was out for a
month with his second career concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' Vaske saw his season end on Nov. 14, and Kariya,
the Mighty Ducks' captain, never returned after sustaining his
fourth concussion on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past few years has the NHL dropped its historically
cavalier attitude toward concussions, a little-researched injury
that presents difficulties in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL still has no formal policy for preventing the hits that
provoke concussions, nor has it adopted the recovery timetable (a
minimum of one week off the ice for first-time concussion victims)
suggested by researchers into sports-related brain injuries.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine sustained his fifth concussion on Oct. 17. 1996, from
a vicious blow by Pittsburgh's 6-foot-6-inch Francois Leroux that
sent him crashing to the ice helmetless and left him unconscious
for several minutes. But he was back in uniform within days, and
played seven games before leaving the lineup with post-concussive
symptoms that plagued him the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The collision with Keane, a crash that affected LaFontaine as if
he had ``run into a brick wall,'' caused the last in a series of
concussions that began when James Patrick knocked him senseless
during a Ranger-Islander playoff game in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine, who spent his whole career as a target of brawnier
opponents intent on muscling him into submission before he could
outskate or outsmart them, said he probably has received four or
five ``unofficial'' concussions in addition to the half-dozen that
have been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one ended his career because doctors could no longer
guarantee that his next concussion, whenever it came, would not
carry dire and long-lasting consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Rangers left the decision solely to him, LaFontaine
said it would be irresponsible for him to play next season. He said
the decision to leave hockey was ``made for him'' two weeks ago by
Dr. James Kelly, the Chicago neurologist who gave him the green
light to join the Rangers last season after the Buffalo Sabres,
citing his history of concussions, declined to put him back on
their roster for an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you sustain a head injury, the risks go up further
and further, and I always said that if it ever got to the point
where there was more than minimal risk, I would stop playing
hockey, and it's at that point now,'' said LaFontaine, whose
concussion symptoms have included migraine headaches, depression,
fatigue, nausea and mood swings so crippling that there were days
when he could not convince himself there was a reason to get up in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine, whose career spanned 15 seasons with the Islanders,
Sabres and Rangers, said he had no immediate plans for retirement
besides spending time with his wife, Marybeth, and their three
children, as well as continuing his charitable work, particularly
his affiliation with the American Academy of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very, very fortunate to have played 15 years, but
what I've gone through in the last couple years isn't something
anyone wants to go through,'' he said.  &QL;

<P>
   McIver-Irvin talk lingers around Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
He found a coach who was a polar opposite of the gun-toting,
loud-mouthed leader to whom the Cowboys had gotten accustomed. He
searched for a first-round draft pick whose reputation had never
been tarnished. He even hired help to meet with his players and
conduct a sort of ``sensitivity training.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' efforts, Dallas once
again finds itself in the harsh spotlight because of players who
can't stay away from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Michael Westbrook was seen pummeling Redskins teammate
Stephen Davis on the sidelines during last year's training camp has
an in-house incident captured such attention.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of the Cowboys, as has become the norm, most of
the details are clouded in mystery.
</P>
<P>
   This much is known: Receiver Michael Irvin was in some way
involved in the incident that caused offensive lineman Everett
McIver to suffer a deep gash on his neck. Beyond that, the rest has
just been rumors and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be true that the wound was inflicted with a pair
of scissors during an argument over a haircut, though none of the
principals is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Jones admits to sitting down with both players to ensure no
problems linger. He adamantly denies, however, any knowledge of a
purported payoff between the two designed to stifle public
discussion. It was reported that Irvin, with or without the help of
Jones, paid McIver an amount in the high six figures to buy his
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given anyone any money,'' Irvin said, breaking more
than a weeklong silence on the subject. ``I didn't pay anybody
anything. There has been no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to believe McIver's silence would be worth a
significant sum to both Irvin and Jones. The Wichita Falls
authorities are helpless to make an arrest without McIver's filing
a complaint. Because no witnesses have come forward _ on the
insistence of head coach Chan Gailey _ they have no evidence a
crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, in his original news conference after the incident
occurred, characterized it as ``horseplay'' that somehow resulted
in injury, stressing McIver was not to blame. Unless another
witness comes forward with a different version, both the campus and
city police have to characterize it as an accident.
</P>
<P>
   That is crucial for Irvin, who is already serving a probationary
period after pleading no contest to cocaine-possession charges in
1996. Assault with a deadly weapon would certainly be a probation
violation, which could send him to jail for up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to keep Irvin out of jail is obvious. The
perennial Pro Bowler caught 75 passes for 1,180 yards and nine
touchdowns last year. No other Cowboys receiver had more than 47
catches or four touchdowns. And when Irvin missed the first five
games of the 1996 season after a league suspension connected to the
drug-possession charge, the Cowboys went 2-3. They won eight of
their final 11 games once he returned, and he again led the team in
receptions and receiving yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones denies any role in a payoff or any knowledge of
such.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of any deal,'' he insisted. ``I know of no
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the police are not investigating the incident, the
NFL may be. In July 1997, the league instituted its new
violent-crime policy, which serves up possible fines and/or
suspensions for players involved in such conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The policy states that league employees cannot ``engage in or
aid, abet or conspire to engage in or incite violent criminal
activity.'' The policy goes on to give examples of violent crimes,
including ``any crime involving the use or threat of physical
violence to a person or persons.''
</P>
<P>
   While the policy does not set out specific punishments, it does
require clinical evaluation and counseling for any employee found
to have engaged in such activity. Further punishment is left up to
the commissioner, though the policy clearly states that players can
be suspended from participation in preseason, regular-season and
postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have refused comment as to whether they are
looking into the situation, though Jones has said he expects they
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McIver returned to practice Monday for the
first time since suffering the injury July 29. He has been assured
he will keep his starting job at right guard, though he said he has
some catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you miss time, going through the season, it's a
setback,'' McIver said. ``I've got a lot to make up, but I'm
willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver should see significant playing time when the Cowboys face
the New England Patriots in Mexico City on Monday. He did not play
in the first two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be better off if he had gotten the work in,'' Jones
said. ``But considering that he's a veteran with some skills, it's
not as much of a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger concern is the distraction the incident caused and
the unwanted spotlight the Cowboys once again find shining on them.
McIver and Irvin insist the air has been cleared between them, and
the other players say they've gotten better at dealing with such
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a concern of mine,'' quarterback Troy Aikman
said. ``The media has said a lot about this, and maybe in the past
this would have taken away from what we do on the field. But I
don't think this has at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an initiation, however, for rookie coach Gailey, who
says he never expected everything to go perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you think things are going to go completely smooth
all the time, you're living a little bit in a dream world,'' Gailey
said. ``There are going to be problems. There are going to be ups
and downs. How you deal with it is the key. You deal with it. You
go on to the next one. You work together as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've handled it. I've talked about it. It's done. You can't
get caught up in that, or you don't go forward where you are
supposed to go forward.''

Belarus' ruble, called the zaichik, or little hare, has lost half
of its worth in five months and more than 10 percent in the last
week alone. Now, the government has announced a new and perhaps
unintentionally revealing plan to shore up the ruble's value:
starting next week, the country will no longer accept its own
currency as payment for exports. (New York Times Photo)

CANADA-BORDER-SHOPPING-2, 8-11 -- The empty Park Plaza in
Ogdensburg, a town in the North Country where Canadians shoppers

of liquids in tones of pale straw, amber and burgundy. Grappas?
Liqueurs? Guess again. The bottles are filled with vinegars, served

Unlike peaches, whose raw glory can barely be improved upon,
tomatoes are all about potential. The difference between consuming
a tomato out of hand and slicing it, then sprinkling it with a
pinch of salt and a few drops of olive oil, is the difference
between a snack and a dish. And the great thing about tomatoes is
that it takes so little to convert them from one to the other.

industry types and performers like Flotilla DeBarge and Jeffrey
Breaux. New York has always had a late-night subculture of 24-hour
diners. But now, with a growing number of affluent artists,

ear and full corn flavor, in early development at Caradonna Farms
in Ulster County. This type of corn was grown widely earlier in the
century and must be rushed to market soon after picking, as it
starts to lose its sweetness. In the last 20 years, it has been
supplanted by hardier varieties that stay sweet longer. (Chris

white Incredible sweet corn, a sugar-enhanced variety that is
quicker and easier to grow than varieties grown in years past. For
150 years, breeders have experimented with sweet corns to improve
flavor, texture, tenderness, appearance, growing time and

 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Yarden, a New York City musician, recently received a letter
from a doctor asking him to press his health plan to pay an
outstanding bill. By going to the insurer's World Wide Web site,
Yarden could review the payments to his doctors, saving time on the
phone for both himself and the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by the soaring popularity of the Internet, plus the
shifting economics of health care, the medical industry is rapidly
going online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is already a popular place to search for general
information about medicines and treatments, but now a growing
number of insurers and doctors are also using it to provide members
and patients with personal medical information, from lab results to
payment records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential revolution'' is brewing in ``how the consumer
interacts with the health plan and, down the road in a different
way, with the providers of care,'' said Jim Hudak, a managing
partner with Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   And Yarden, who describes himself as a ``big online user,'' said
he hoped that what was available now would be only the beginning.
``They should be offering a lot more information,'' he said, ``like
the doctor's diagnosis and prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has the potential to be a huge benefit for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies, who can become bogged down in
mountains of paperwork and, when seeking information, often face
clogged phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raises serious questions about the privacy of such
highly personal information wafting about the digital world. A
person with AIDS, for instance, might not want his employer to
know, and a politician or an executive up for a promotion might
want to keep a serious illness secret.
</P>
<P>
   The issue thus fits squarely into the broader debate about
privacy and security on the Internet, whether it involves
protecting credit card numbers or keeping children from offensive
information.
</P>
<P>
   For while the variety of Internet offerings has exploded,
privacy has limped far behind. Medical privacy was a factor
recently when the White House backed away from the idea of
assigning every American a medical identification number. The
notion was shelved, the administration said, until Congress passes
legislation to protect patient privacy. The current version of that
bill has faced criticism for not going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yarden said the privacy issue ``doesn't worry me,'' adding, ``I
change my passwords regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Haberman, who works at the National Library of Medicine,
noted, ``If you pay a doctor on your credit card, your privacy is
gone right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Donald Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical
Association, is skeptical. ``If vandals can break into a CIA Web
site,'' he said, ``it doesn't make the AMA feel real secure that
some vandals won't break into a health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies say that they are eager to safeguard
members' privacy and that their security systems can protect the
electronic information, sometimes more effectively than with paper
records.
</P>
<P>
   One Blue Cross plan even invites subscribers to dial in tips
when they suspect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Kaiser Permanente health plan says it will
provide laboratory results next year to patients over the Internet
using a personal identification number. Oxford Health Plans has
similar safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continually walking a very fine line'' between
preserving the confidentiality of patient records and using the
information to improve care, said Aetna Inc. chief executive
Richard Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Its subsidiary, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, says it hopes to have ``a
significant percentage'' of information for consumers on the
Internet soon, including benefits data, the status of claims and a
way to get approval for referrals to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp. said it also planned to test an Internet
project in October, though it gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, for their part, are starting to exchange messages,
typically about nonurgent matters, with patients in remote areas
and computer-savvy patients everywhere who are willing to risk
having some hacker eavesdrop on their cholesterol reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Tang, an internist and researcher at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said he often received e-mail from
patients telling how their blood pressure or allergy medicine was
working or describing symptoms and asking whether they should come
to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of my patients would rather have
communications with me any time of day or night,'' he said,
``rather than worry about the small risk that someone would
intercept any message.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians at Columbia University are testing an electronic
program that will allow patients with chronic diseases like asthma
and diabetes to see and add to their medical records. They type in
an identification number displayed on a card that resembles a
smarter version of an ATM card. A machine receives and
automatically verifies the number, which changes every 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to prove that there are big benefits'' to the
patients by involving them more deeply in their treatment, said
Paul Clayton, chairman of the department dealing with computerized
medical information at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Half the respondents to a survey in Boston said they would be
interested in communicating with their doctors by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This could pose hazards for the doctor. Michael Ackerman, who
directs computer research contracts for the National Library of
Medicine, said he had heard warnings from ``malpractice insurance
persons that a written document by a doctor might show up in a
court and bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the same could be said of a tape of a doctor's
advice by telephone. ``How far are you going to push this
stupidity?'' he said, expressing exasperation at the intrusion of
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a big Massachusetts-based health
plan, said it was planning ``a secure Web site'' in response to
members' requests for Internet programs to obtain lab results,
appointments with doctors and prescription drug renewals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Cochran, an associate medical director at Harvard
Pilgrim, agreed that ``computers have both benefits and risks.'' He
added, ``we're not going to jump into'' online services to patients
until other plans get more experience.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim was severely criticized three years ago when it
became known that the records of members with mental health
problems were widely available to general practitioners. ``We
learned a lot about patient confidentiality from that,'' Cochran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most health plans already have Web pages that provide lists of
doctors and hospitals in their networks, and information about
staying well. But some plans began to require a password for a look
at their lists after they learned that rival insurers were snooping
and recruiting their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey even provides street
maps showing the primary-care doctor closest to the member. Members
of all Blue Cross plans can dial up a list of participating
hospitals in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A few plans, like Health Partners in Minnesota and Blue Shield
of California, let employers and insurance agents enroll members
over the Internet. Blue Shield also has contracts with 18
California companies with 9,000 employees who can select their type
of coverage and physicians over an encryption-protected Internet
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between security and
confidentiality,'' said A.G. Breitenstein, director of the Health
Law Institute, a private nonprofit research center in Boston. ``The
salient question is: How many people other than the Kaiser member
have access to that lab result?''
</P>
<P>
   Information about prescription drugs that may indicate a patient
has the virus that causes AIDS or suffers from depression or male
impotence is ``bought, sold, disseminated and researched on, all
without the patient's consent or knowledge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association says patients have a basic
right to the privacy of their medical information and records, a
right that ``should be honored unless waived by the patient,''
Palmisano said.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for individuals worried about privacy to avoid
seeing a doctor who would take notes on their condition. Others pay
out of their own pocket for psychotherapy, for example, rather than
risk having their insurers or employers know of their problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a rigorous requirement for individual consent
could cripple the work of epidemiological researchers, who scan
thousands of patient records seeking patterns to explain diseases
like cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is always an issue,'' said Jay Silverstein, chief
marketing officer of Oxford. ``We're not in the business of
collecting medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said that in a test over several months experts from the
International Computer Security Association had tried
unsuccessfully to breach its privacy safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaiser, strategic development manager Tim Kieschnick said his
employees were using industry standards similar to those used in
online banking to encrypt exchanges between Kaiser and the member.
``We are satisfied with it and still improving it,'' he said,
though adding that there is always more to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fear is that the Internet, which attracts millions
of curious cybersurfers every day, could be a breeding ground for
horror stories similar to those involving computerized medical
records at hospitals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Country singer Tammy Wynette was outraged to find her medical
records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center reported
in two supermarket tabloids. She sued the papers, The National
Enquirer and The Star, for invasion of privacy, and the case was
settled _ no terms were disclosed _ shortly before she died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass., complained before he died
last year that an insurer had used his computerized medical records
without his permission in a training program.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., testified at a Senate hearing
that records of her treatment several years ago at St. Clare's
Hospital in New York City, following a suicide attempt, were leaked
to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of bribing hospital employees to get
to the records,'' said Alan Westin, a legal scholar and privacy
expert. Even before electronic communication, he said, such records
had been misused by blackmailers, to discredit rival executives for
promotions and by neighbors in personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have adequate security for access to Internet
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts on privacy issues warned that a determined
hacker could probably get into protected records. But several
privacy specialists said that most interlopers would have little
interest in medical insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is
``a lot less than for banks,'' said Clayton, at Columbia. ``A
hacker in Holland probably wouldn't gain any economic benefit from
knowing that my syphilis test was positive,'' he said.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ As his rendezvous with a grand jury draws near,
the face that President Clinton shows in public could not seem more
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   In a whirlwind coast-to-coast political fund-raising tour this
week, the president has appeared upbeat, energetic and, above all,
engaged in his official duties, keeping an eye on the plunging
stock market and vowing revenge against terrorists who bombed two
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever steps he is taking behind the scenes to prepare for his
grand jury testimony next Monday about Monica Lewinsky, his public
face is calm and confident.
</P>
<P>
   With an actor's skill, his hands in fluid gesture, he conducts
fact-laden tutorials with Democratic Party donors on issues like
Social Security and the environment, muses about his advancing age
and brags on what terrific shape the country is in.
</P>
<P>
   In a move unusual of late, he visited reporters on his airplane
during a late-night flight Monday, casting himself in the role of
movie reviewer. They were watching ``Deep Impact.'' Clinton,
roaming by in his bluejeans like a college student pacing the dorm
during finals, said ``Armageddon'' was better. But really, he said,
``Zorro'' was ``the best movie of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters reached for their notebooks, the president
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax,'' he instructed on his way out of range. ``The workday
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps everyone but Clinton. The combination of
circumstances _ his pending testimony, the rampant speculation in
Washington over whether he will or should make a public statement
about Ms. Lewinsky, whether his presidency has been irreparably
weakened _ gives an added layer of meaning to his often ruminative
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   One theme that has emerged is a sense that he can never let down
his guard _ and that the political is quite personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you done in the times in your life when you thought
everything was hunky-dory?'' he said in a fund-raising speech in
Chicago. ``The natural thing to do is to sort of say: `Man, I have
been working like crazy. This is great. Leave me alone. Give me a
break.'''
</P>
<P>
   But relaxing, he said, would be a mistake. ``Instead,'' he
continued, ``we ought to say: `Hey, we may not get a time this good
again for a while. Let's take this time to think about the big,
long-term challenges this country faced, and let's go on and face
them and deal with them now.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is his message, whether referring to terrorists in Africa
or Republicans in Congress. ``Now is the time to bear down,'' he
said defiantly, ``not back up.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, much of the impression of a president not
preoccupied by matters Lewinsky is by careful design. A pristine
water-treatment plant high in the hills above San Francisco _ as
far as possible from Washington _ provided Tuesday's backdrop for
Clinton to talk about clean water.
</P>
<P>
   While his old Arkansas buddy and image adviser Harry Thomason
was testifying to the grand jury back in Washington, Clinton was
telling a low-key handpicked audience of about 100 officials and
plant employees, ``Today is a happy day.'' He added later, ``Safe
water is something all Americans agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stop was at a hotel ballroom here where 700 people paid
more than $1,000 each and rose to their feet as he entered. ``We
love you!'' one of them shouted. The event was one of three Tuesday
where Clinton helped bring in more than $3 million for the
Democratic nominee for governor of California, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   At each chance, those who introduce the president refer to the
breadth of his knowledge and the high-mindedness of his purpose. At
the water-treatment plant, Rep. Tom Lantos described him as ``the
environmental president'' but quickly added That he could also be
called ``the education president and the public-safety president
and the good-economy president.''
</P>
<P>
   People along the way seem to appreciate Clinton's public
determination to avoid the topic that has consumed Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nonissue,'' Marguerite Young, the California director
of Clean Action, said as she bobbed her infant on her chest and
listened to Clinton talk about protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's concerned about the things he's in charge of,'' she said.
``He's not in charge of having a perfect private life.''

APPLEBY TRIES TO HIDE THE SORROW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It is difficult to imagine the grief Stuart
Appleby will feel as he competes in the PGA Championship this week.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's wife, Renay, was killed on July 23 in an accident
outside a train station in London. As Stuart and Renay were
unloading luggage from a taxi, Renay was crushed between the taxi
and another car when the driver mistakenly thought he was in
reverse instead of drive.
</P>
<P>
   What could be worse than watching your 25-year-old wife die? Why
did this happen? How do you go on?
</P>
<P>
   Almost three weeks later, Appleby is still trying to sort out
those questions, and so many others. He will tee off in a
tournament Thursday for the first time since the accident, not
knowing what to expect, but knowing Renay would want him to
continue playing the game he loves.
</P>
<P>
   However, the greatest love in Appleby's life has been taken
away. And as Appelby courageously answered questions at a news
conference Tuesday afternoon at Sahalee Country Club, he broke down
in tears several times, unable to hide his sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest times are when you do a lot of thinking, when you
just wish things were different,'' said Appleby, a 27-year-old
native of Australia, who met Renay in 1992 and married her in
December of 1996. ``It's tough getting through nights. When you
really love someone, you miss the simple things. Everyone has been
fantastic, but no one can replace that person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of good times. I feel very lucky that I knew her.
The time we spent together was real quality. I feel like she was
first prize of a raffle, so to speak. I was lucky enough to win
her. She was obviously only here for a short time, but she had a
huge impact on a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has saddened the atmosphere of the year's final
major championship, with Appleby's peers determined to help him
through his ordeal. Renay was an outstanding golfer and she made
many friends among the players when she spent several months as
Stuart's caddie during the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Until the accident, Appleby was having the most successful year
of his career, with $678,562 in winnings, four top-10 finishes, and
a victory at the Kemper Open in June. Appleby's friends are glad to
see him back on tour.
</P>
<P>
   `` He said he would rather be busy than sitting at home thinking
about it,'' said Robert Allenby, a fellow Australian golfer, who
has known Appleby since they were teenagers competing in junior
tournaments. ``I'm sure Renee would have told him to get off his
butt and play. That's the type of person she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby recalled Renay's first impression of Stuart, when they
met as members of an Australian golf team that traveled to the
United States to compete against college teams. It was hardly love
at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   `` They had a fight, and she thought he was a stuck-up pig,''
said Allenby .``That was Renay. She said what she thought. But it
was from that trip that they really got together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me that they ended up together. She had
such a personality and a funny sense of humor. She'd joke about
anything and everything. It's so tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   So tragic that many people don't know what to say, or what to
do. But Appelby is trying his best to cope. Tuesday, he played a
practice round with Allenby, Tiger Woods, and Mark O'Meara. Appleby
owns a home in Orlando, Fla., where he is neighbors of both Woods
and O'Meara. Woods still found it hard to believe what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I saw him for the first time, and it was tough to
even talk to him,'' said Woods. ``I almost teared up on the spot. I
get a little choked up talking about it. My heart goes out to him
and his entire family. I knew Renay just a little bit as a friend,
and she was a genuine person, just the greatest. From a player's
standpoint, if he ever needs us at any time, he can find us, pick
up the phone, we're always there We'll drop whatever we're doing,
because to lose a loved one like that so quickly and tragically is
just a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby has not been to his Orlando home since the accident. The
house was one of Renay's joys, and the memories of their times
there are still overwhelming. For now, Appleby is taking each day,
step by step. He plans to play in the Sprint International next
week, as well as the NEC World Series of Golf in two weeks, trying
to establish some kind of normal routine. However, nothing for
Appleby will be quite the same again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an hour that goes by that I don't think of her,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would she want me to do? She would want me to get back.
I've just got to imagine that she's here and she's helping me, and
everything will be okay.''
</P>

CANADIAN BUCK STOPS AT THE BORDER; WEAK CURRENCY HURTING U.S.

 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGDENSBURG, N.Y. _ It is high summer in the North Country, with
the back-to-school shopping season fast approaching. Time for local
business people to reminisce about the days not so long ago when
the Canadians flocked across the border as dependably as the
swallows to Capistrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would show up with empty suitcases and literally no spare
clothes, and they would do all their clothes shopping in one
afternoon,'' said Norman V. Garrelts, the president of Hacketts, a
local department store here, recalling another North Country store
he once managed. ``At the end of the day, the parking lot would be
covered with empty shopping bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Canadians are staying away. The Canadian dollar has
fallen to its lowest level in modern times, and the commercial
fortunes of dozens of towns along the border have fallen with it.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if half the people around here had suddenly moved away.
Along almost all of the U.S.-Canada border, the Canadian side is
much more populous, and shopping by Canadians, who were drawn
across the border by lower sales taxes, longer shopping hours and
often more choices, has formed an important part of local markets
on the American side.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Canadian dollar began to plummet, however, trips by
Canadians to New York state, by far the biggest destination for
Canadians, declined by 9.3 percent, to 2.4 million trips in 1997
from 2.6 million in 1996, according to Statistics Canada, a
government agency. Canadian spending in the United States has
declined for each of the three consecutive quarters ending in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three shopping centers, and one is derelict, one is
struggling and the third is half-full,'' Garrelts said. ``We were
just over-stored, and it was all based on getting the Canadian
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the Canadian dollar's drop have been felt all
along the snaking border. At the Bellisfair Mall in Bellingham,
Wash., business is down 5 percent to 10 percent, said John
Bucksbaum, the executive vice president at General Growth
Properties, which owns the mall. And Blaine, Wash., which sits
right on the border, seems to be hurting even more.
</P>
<P>
   Mickie Blazicevic, a supervisor at Cost Cutters in Blaine, said
that even with the discount outlet's lower prices there were fewer
Canadians going across the border regularly to buy groceries. And
several gas stations in the area have closed.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, towns that had refashioned themselves as French
Canadian tourist destinations, complete with signs in French, are
also feeling the pinch, said Vaughn Stinson, the executive director
of the Maine Publicity Bureau. ``It's really been very, very
soft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the decline in Canadian spending in the
United States may mean little more than a drop in the number of
Canadian quarters, pennies and dimes that show up in their pocket
change. But people in the North Country, as the four New York
counties that border the St. Lawrence River are known, have close
ties to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are oriented toward Canada, absolutely,'' said Ram L. Chugh
(pronounced choodge), a professor of economics and director of the
Rural Services Institute at the State University College at
Potsdam. ``Our commercial relations are not only with Canada, but
our major cultural, sophisticated and important urban areas are
Ottawa and Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, people here follow the value of the Canadian
dollar the way farmers watch the weather. Driven down by the low
worldwide demand for Canadian commodities, which is partly a
function of the Asian economic crisis, the value of the Canadian
dollar has fallen from a high of 89.3 cents in American money in
1990 to 66 cents, a loss of 26 percent of the Canadian dollar's
purchasing power in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on the Ogdensburg Bridge to Canada reflects the widening
disparity between the two dollars. Bridge crossings hit a peak of
866,000 in 1991-92, when the Canadian dollar could still hold its
own, but has declined without interruption each year since, to
517,000 crossings both ways in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, as the Canadian dollar slid, American businesses
tried to keep their Canadian customers by giving them, in effect, a
discount. Signs saying: ``Canadian at par,'' offered equal value
for both currencies at many stores. Informal discounts are still
common _ one local motel gives Canadian customers 75 cents for
their dollar, instead of the market's 66 cents _ but the advantage
has clearly moved across the river: ``$1.00 U.S. (EQ) $1.50
Canadian,'' says an advertisement for Young's clothing store in
Prescott, Ontario, that ran recently in local American papers.
</P>
<P>
   Do not blame Bobbie White, an 18-year old from Wallpole,
Ontario, who was on the American side the other day not to shop,
but to hunt for a job that pays in American dollars. ``To me, the
way the dollar has gone means `Stay on the Canadian side,' '' Ms.
White said. ``Everybody used to come over here to shop all the time
_ there were these long lines at the border going back _ but not
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's first stop in job-hunting was at a sparkling,
500,000-square-foot mall built in Massena, 35 miles east of here,
to capture Canadian business. The St. Lawrence Centre _ even the
spelling is Canadian _ opened in 1990, when the Canadian dollar
stood at nearly 90 cents in American money and as the Canadian
government was about to impose the widely detested 7 percent
national sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all of those factors, the Canadians were basically
flocking to the U.S.,'' said Ron Patnode, director of marketing for
the mall. ``Our license plate count showed that 40 percent to 50
percent of our shoppers were Canadian, but then it began to
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The mall's license plate census hit 10 percent Canadians in
1995, Patnode said, but it has come back some to about 20 percent
to 22 percent. ``They're still coming, but it's not like it was
before,'' he said.

LOW PROFILE HELPS PETER DEVELOP AS A GIANT  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nineteen months after he signed with the Giants
as a free agent in what was a highly controversial episode for the
team, Christian Peter will start his first professional game Friday
against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Peter, a defensive tackle, will
replace the injured Robert Harris.
</P>
<P>
   It is only an exhibition start, but Giants coaches have said
that Peter should also play quite a bit in the regular season in a
rotation with Harris and Keith Hamilton at the two tackle spots.
</P>
<P>
   For Peter, who has a history of sexual and other assaults, this
promotion has been accepted without any conspicuous delight.
</P>
<P>
   Peter, who played sparingly last season, has insisted on
maintaining a low profile with the Giants. It comes with the
acknowledgment that his reputation precedes him. He has decided
that his best course is to be quiet off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All anyone knows is what they've read about me in the
papers,'' Peter said as he stood on the Giants' practice field
after this afternoon's session. ``I understand that. I'm not a
saint and I made poor judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants got me the help I needed, and now all I can do is
act the way I have, and maybe in time, people will change their
opinions of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is evident that Peter's teammates have welcomed him more
warmly this season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he often was alone on the practice fields and in the
catacombs of Giants Stadium. At training camp last year, it was not
uncommon to see Peter eating by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was true or not, everybody had heard the stories,''
said linebacker Corey Widmer, who plays directly behind Peter in
most defensive formations. ``But I've gotten to know him; I think
several guys have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hung out a few times. I've seen him outside football and
I've seen no problems. I haven't seen him wanting to fight anybody.
He's level-headed. Contrary to what people may have read, I think
he's a good person.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys with crystal-clear images who I've gone out to
bars with and when I see them I go: `Holy cow, do they have
everybody fooled.'''
</P>
<P>
   Peter's new position as the third tackle on the depth chart _
this week, or after the return of Harris, who had fluid drained
from his knee _ is one of the surprising stories of a relatively
predictable Giants training camp.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big jump in one year for a player who some thought would
never play a down in a National Football League game.
</P>
<P>
   Peter was drafted in 1996 by the New England Patriots, but
reaction in Boston was so harsh that the Patriots released him
three days after picking him.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the Giants signed Peter. He began training camp
strong, but faded as the weeks wore on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I burnt out,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defensive coordinator, John Fox, said: ``Christian
had sat out a year without any football, and that is going to hurt
anybody. Plus he's a rookie. He's learning new defenses every day
and the game is quicker than he's ever played it. But we saw enough
to know he might make that leap that a lot of second-year players
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1998 training camp opened, Peter was in better shape. He
seemed quicker and immediately impressed the coaches and the
Giants' offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the same traits as a tackle that Erik Howard had,''
Widmer said, referring to the Giants' former All-Pro tackle. ``He's
a fighter inside, and that's what those guys have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter, 25, linked his improvement to his growth on a variety of
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little wiser and more mature,'' he said. ``I feel
quicker, but it's because I've taken the time to learn and get
stronger in a lot of ways. I'm proud of what I've done. Hopefully
it's just a beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel had a similar perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian Peter has gone through a lot to get to this point,''
Fassel said. ``We've watched him pretty closely and he knew that.
He's come through that and right now he's got every chance to be a
very important part of our football team. I don't think he wants to
go back to where he was.''

FORMER HEAD OF TEXAS LOTTERY SETTLES LAWSUIT WITH GTECH CORP.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nora Linares, former director of the Texas
Lottery, has reached a settlement in her lawsuit against the
company that runs the state games, her lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Linares had accused Gtech Corp. in a lawsuit filed in April 1997
of making a ``systematic effort'' to get her fired to take
attention away from the company's own wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney Buck Wood said Linares and Gtech agreed to a
settlement Tuesday, but he declined to discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you my client is very pleased with the
settlement,'' Wood said. ``There was a financial aspect to the
settlement. It was not done for a feel-good statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gtech spokesman Marc Palazzo confirmed that a settlement had
been reached on ``mutually agreeable terms'' that he, too, declined
to discuss. Linares could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Linares sued Gtech after the Lottery Commission fired her in
January amid revelations that the company had briefly hired her
boyfriend for $30,000 in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Linares, who said she did not know about the secret consulting
contract, accused Gtech of hiring her boyfriend ``in an effort to
have some potential future leverage'' over her.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech officials at the time called Linares' allegations ``false
and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Gtech was facing its own troubles at the time the story about
Linares' boyfriend came out. State officials had begun questioning
the fact that the company was paying its chief Texas lobbyist $3
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Linares became a liability to Gtech and her continuing to
serve as lottery executive director served only to draw further
attention to Gtech's illegal corporate practices and questionable
relationships,'' her lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Linares' suit claimed Gtech launched a public relations campaign
against her that led to her firing.
</P>
<P>
   She originally sued the lottery commissioners who fired her, but
then dropped that effort in favor of suing Gtech.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the controversy, state lottery commissioners
decided to rebid Gtech's $160-million-a-year state contract. Gtech
refused to take part in the bidding process, and ultimately the
commission decided the least expensive way to run the lottery was
to stay with Gtech.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery director hired to replace Linares, Lawrence Littwin,
was fired after just four months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Littwin claimed his firing was politically motivated, saying the
lottery commissioners did not want to take on Gtech when Gov.
George W. Bush was facing re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech, in its lawsuit to stop the rebidding process, claimed
Littwin had been prejudiced against the company and had made
derogatory comments about the company at a lottery convention.

LOST IN THE GLOW OF THE MAN AT HER SIDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of 20th-century art has had more than its share of
female artists whose achievements have been overshadowed by the art
of their better-known male companions.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Sonia Delaunay, Lee Krasner, Frida Kahlo,
Helen Torr, Marguerite Zorach and Anni Albers. Georgia O'Keeffe is
one of the few exempted from this category, largely because her
husband, the photographer Alfred Steiglitz, worked tirelessly on
her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the importance of the male halves in the
relationships varies a lot, as demonstrated simply by reciting, in
parallel order, the names of the men attached to the women listed
above: Robert Delaunay, Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera, Arthur Dove,
William Zorach and Josef Albers. But in comparison, the work of
their female companions has received proportionately far less
attention.
</P>
<P>
   One almost suspects some unwritten (or should we say
unconscious?) agreement that a closer look at the women's art would
be too threatening to the significance of their significant others.
</P>
<P>
   But what is threatened is not so much an individual artist's
stature as our understanding of artistic invention, and our
tendency to view it as the province of a single artist rather than
something shared and by definition collaborative. Lee Krasner, for
example, is not equal in stature or importance to Jackson Pollock,
and no amount of historical research will make her so.
</P>
<P>
   But her work deserves examination, and its quality, especially
early on, strongly suggests that she had a role in Pollock's
development _ that it would not have been the same without her.
</P>
<P>
   It may be fine for Picasso to have identified Braque as ``ma
femme'' during the early years of Cubism; it is less so for
artists, or the art historians who tend their flames, to identify
the women who really were their wives as artistic partners. But no
artist is an island _ be he, or she, a movie director, composer or
painter.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Gabriele Munter: The Expressionist Years,
1903-1920,'' an exhibition of 70 paintings, drawings and prints at
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Sept. 20. Even
for students and knowledgeable admirers of 20th-century art, Munter
(1877-1962) is little more than an elusive presence in the annals
of German Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   For decades she has been mentioned in these histories, when
mentioned at all, as pupil and companion of the Russian painter
Wassily Kandinsky. Such citings can't be avoided: with Kandinsky,
Munter was one of the founding members of the Blaue Reiter group in
1911. But she did much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   This show was organized by Reinhold Heller, a professor of art
history at the University of Chicago, for the Milwaukee Art Museum,
which has the largest group of works by Munter, 11 in all, outside
Germany. Showing roughly a third of Munter's output during the
period under scrutiny and none of her later paintings, the
exhibition cannot be considered definitive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it presents enough work _ much of it being seen in this
country for the first time _ to verify that Munter and her art
deserve far more attention than they have received. Backing this
conclusion is Heller's catalogue text, which draws on Munter's
letters and journals as well as on interviews from the late 1940s
and '50s. It gives the first detailed account in English of her
life, artistic development and relationship with Kandinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship seems to have been fairly tumultuous,
punctuated by passionate times together, by separations
crisscrossed with letters that often involved lengthy discussions
of art, and finally by recriminations and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Munter and Kandinsky, 11 years her senior and married, met and
fell in love in 1902, when Munter, determined to be an artist and
dissatisfied with her training, enrolled in Kandinsky's drawing
class at the experimental, short-lived Phalanx School in Munich. It
was just about the only place in Germany where women could study
art alongside men, the alternative being a dilettantish ``ladies'
art academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 11 years they often worked side by side and openly
lived together. Kandinsky taught her, already a skilled draftsman,
to draw in a quick, loose shorthand style _ as the prints and
drawings in this exhibition strikingly attest _ and to translate
this approach into painting.
</P>
<P>
   He praised her natural talent and innate vision and encouraged
her to try this or that method or medium. But he was not above
pettiness, reacting jealously if she wrote of interest in another
artist's work (Picasso's, for example); complaining that their
stressful situation, which made Munter something of a social
outcast, was just as hard on him; and condescendingly patting her
on the head, as when he suggested in a letter from 1903 that
woodcuts might be ``much too much for the small, poor (lazy)
Ella.''
</P>
<P>
   They spent 14 crucial months (May 1907 to June 1908) together in
and around Paris, working on prints and absorbing the ideas of the
Parisian avant-garde, especially the work of van Gogh, Gauguin, the
Fauves and Matisse. But when World War I forced Kandinsky back to
Russia and he finally obtained a divorce, he married another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Munter spent most of the war waiting for him in Scandinavia. She
did not learn of the marriage until after 1921, when Kandinsky sent
a lawyer to collect paintings of his in her possession. Of such a
saga, one can only say: screenwriters, start your laptops.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to report that the show in Richmond will knock
your socks off. It won't, but it will peel them off gradually and
surreptitiously. Munter was, quietly and forcefully, a terrific
artist _ a superb draftsman, inventive colorist and daring
manipulator of paint and pictorial space, thanks to an innately
casual, confident touch.
</P>
<P>
   Her tendency to simplify reality into economical, nearly
abstract components is in step with her artistically momentous
times, and sometimes a little ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Especially riveting here are a series of small, radiant
landscapes made in Murnau during the summer of 1908, in which she
builds upon the tenets of Fauvism by concocting more unusual,
discordant colors and broadening the often stippled brushwork that
the Fauves carried over from Impressionism. The resulting bold
shapes, which are really little autonomous slabs of paint, grant
her extraordinary colors full voice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Murnau Moors'' of 1908, for example, the landscape
progresses through fields of light yellow-green, turquoise and
peach to mountains of electric blue and then violet, finishing with
a sky of more, but softer, light green and yellow. These hues are
dramatized by small, framing intervals of darker, more traditional
colors, greens and browns in quick, fat strokes that indicate trees
and low-lying hills.
</P>
<P>
   In her paintings of the village of Murnau, Munter's colors
become even more electric, in part because the actual facades were
painted different colors, but also because their contiguous planes,
windows and shutters gave her more options for contrasts within a
more restricted space.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, beyond her sex, that Munter is only now beginning to
receive her due may be that she doesn't entirely fit the German
Expressionist profile. The people in her portraits rarely seem
troubled or anxious; only occasionally does a landscape seem at all
threatening, as in the uncharacteristically drab, barren terrain
that isolates the single dwelling in ``The Green House, Murnau'' of
1911.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Munter's natural artistic inclinations _ her emphasis
on color, direct paint handling and distortions of reality _ may
have contributed to the style's development. Without reproducing
any visual evidence, Heller argues as much, asserting that in
August 1908, Kandinsky and Munter, along with the Russian painter
Alexei Jawlensky, worked together closely in Murnau developing a
new way of painting.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that no one artist was dominant and that their works
were sometimes indistinguishable. In other words, a three-person
version of Picasso and Braque.
</P>
<P>
   But Munter's work fits in at several other locations on the map
of early 20th-century modernism. She remained far more within the
orbit of the French styles, especially Fauvism, that influenced all
the German Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   For her, Fauvism was not simply a jumping-off point for a more
rhetorical mode, be it Kirchner's bitter social satire or
Kandinsky's dynamic rumblings. Instead she built directly upon it,
extending it as other French artists, most notably Matisse, were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Matisse, Munter painted for the sake of painting, for the
pleasure of recording her perceptions of the visible world in such
a way that the colors and forms on the canvas took precedence, but
without obliterating that world. And like Matisse, she envisioned
art as an extremely intelligent armchair that soothed but also
stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Munter's ``Still Life, Yellow'' and ``Still Life,
Red'' of 1909, with their blunt compositions, bright dominant
colors and black outlines, are startlingly close to Matisse's work
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She seems not so much to be borrowing from Matisse as to be
paralleling his exploration while using other inspirations,
especially the children's art that she began to collect around
1908.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the French affinities, Munter's ability to imbue her
images with a singular personality, through color and paint
handling, also relates to certain American painters of the same
period, especially Marsden Hartley, who visited her in Munich in
1913, Arthur Dove and to some extent O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Heller cites a journey to Texas to visit
American relatives in 1898-99 as a formative influence on Munter,
who photographed the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Munter was one of several European and American painters who
continued to narrow the gap between method and meaning that the
Impressionists had begun to close. Her paintings told the story of
their own making with directness and honesty in a way that
Kandinsky's large early abstractions, for all their influential
all-overness, never mustered. Subsequent painting has made
extensive use of both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition and its catalogue may raise more questions than
they answer, but the questions are fascinating and raise equally
fascinating larger ones about the nature of originality and the
collaborative nature of all creativity.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, show and text also open a very specific field
of inquiry for other art historians and curators concerning
Gabriele Munter's art, her role in the development of Kandinsky's
art and her contribution to the modernist enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Munter could be the last artist's helpmate of the 20th century
to be recognized in her own right; and she may be one of the most
significant.

ADVERTISING: BILLBOARDS STILL MAKE SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As a young man, L. Lowry Mays bet his future on
oil, becoming a petroleum engineer. A few years later, thinking the
stock market, which was then booming, would be more fun, he went to
Harvard University, earned an MBA and became an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Mays turned to another career 10 years later _ this time as a
radio entrepreneur. Teaming up with a flamboyant San Antonio car
salesman, Red McCombs, now the owner of the Minnesota Vikings, he
paid $130,000 for a local FM station.
</P>
<P>
   That venture grew into Clear Channel Communications Inc., a
company that owns 230 radio stations in the United States and has
full or partial ownership in an additional 163 stations outside the
country. It also owns or operates 18 television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mays, while continuing to amass radio stations,
expanded into yet another field: billboards. Today Clear Channel,
where Mays is chief executive, is the largest outdoor advertising
concern in the world.
</P>
<P>
   All this might sound a bit as though Mays, now 63, is an
acquisitive gambler. Acquisitive? Definitely. A gambler? If so, a
very deliberate one. His company relies less on debt than is common
in the industry, often buying with stock or cash. And Mays has a
reputation for shrewdly assessing the profit potential of each
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in billboards, he said, simply made sense; indeed,
Mays expects billboards to dominate company revenues by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor advertising grew 8.8 percent last year, the largest jump
in the last 13 years, according to the Outdoor Advertising
Association of America, a trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Fletcher, the association's president and chief executive,
predicts that billboards will continue to flourish because of media
fragmentation, technological improvements and an increase in the
time Americans spend driving. ``All three factors are growing,''
she said. ``I've been in this business 22 years and I have to pinch
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays, in a recent interview at his compact company headquarters
near the San Antonio airport, said, ``The reason that people want
to reach people out of home is because the mobility of our society
escalates every year,'' whether it involves two adults driving to
work each morning or so-called stay-at-home spouses hurtling
between soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Transportation, Americans drove
2.4 trillion miles in 1995, more than double the number of miles
driven in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Also, improvements in billboards have attracted more
advertisers. Rather than painters slowly rendering an ad on
sections of wood or metal, now computers print sharp images on
vinyl, which can be hung quickly and moved as needed.
</P>
<P>
   That new technology, said Gordon Hodge, an analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, has made billboards and bus
shelters more attractive to fashion advertisers like Calvin Klein
and consumer products companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble, which has
used billboards to advertise Pantene shampoo. ``It was very
important for the sheen of the hair to come through,'' Hodge said.
``I think before the vinyl it was not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason national advertisers have been attracted to what
had been largely a local-plus-tobacco medium, is that the outdoor
advertising business has consolidated rapidly in the two years
since Outdoor Systems Inc. of Phoenix bought Gannett Co.'s outdoor
division. Larger companies can offer more billboards in more
markets, Hodge said, making the buying easier for these
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel entered the outdoor market in February 1997 with
an agreement to buy Eller Media Corp. and its 50,000 billboards for
$1.15 billion in cash and stock. Eight months later, the company
announced it would add 34,000 billboards through the $1.7 billion
purchase of Universal Outdoor Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Clear Channel reached across the Atlantic to buy the
London-based More Group PLC for $760 million, giving it an
additional 90,000 billboards and bus shelter display surfaces in 22
countries and pushing Clear Channel to No. 1 in the international
outdoor advertising market.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hodge, Outdoor Systems Inc. still has a small edge
in the United States, where Clear Channel has 90,000 displays.
</P>
<P>
   Mays said he would continue to hunt for billboard companies that
are likely to provide a healthy return on investment _ 20 percent
after taxes and interest on the money invested is the company's
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards mesh well with the company's other media holdings,
Mays said, allowing Clear Channel to offer advertisers a third
outlet and allowing the company's radio and TV programs to
advertise on their own billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel received almost half its $697.1 million in 1997
revenues from radio, but Randall Mays, Mays' 33-year-old son and
the company's chief financial officer, predicts that 50 percent of
1998 revenues will come from outdoor advertising, with 40 percent
from radio and perhaps 10 percent from TV.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is publicly traded, is not worried about what
the recent spate of tobacco industry settlements and proposed
settlements will mean for billboards. Clear Channel is already
moving away from tobacco, the elder Mays said. Cigarette companies
buy a lot of billboards, and they want lower rates, he said. ``We
can replace those at higher prices,'' he continued, and at the same
time avoid being vulnerable to a settlement that could pull all
tobacco ads at once.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco has already fallen to No. 3 in billboard spending, after
entertainment and business and consumer services, according to
Competitive Media Reporting, a data research company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Defense wins championships _ that is an overused axiom in pro
football. But it happens to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Once a team kicks its running game into gear, dispenses a
passing attack that averages plenty in yards per pass attempt while
avoiding sacks, and offers high-rolling special teams, then its
defense can complement everything by continually feeding its
offense the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A stout defense, which can be the foundation for a team, has
several ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing turnovers is a gigantic plus.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Giants' defense led the National Football
Conference with 44 turnovers forced, and Kansas City and Pittsburgh
led the American Football Conference with 34 apiece. Each of those
teams won 10 or more games. Each was a divisional champion.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing first downs, of course, is also critical.
</P>
<P>
   A defense that forces several three-plays-and-a-punt series
sparkles. It provides more chances for its own offense and more
chances to tire the opposing defense.
</P>
<P>
   Two key areas, however, help to separate monster defenses from
kitten ones in today's National Football League _ yardage gained
via sacks and via interceptions. These elements create havoc for
offenses. Both create excellent field position for your team and
terrible field position for the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Peek at the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they won the NFC East with an offense that
struggled mightily; in total offensive yards gained, it ranked 27th
of the 30 NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' defense kept giving the offense field position
and chances. It had 27 interceptions (most in the league) and
gained 503 return yards on those thefts. No other NFL team topped
500 yards, and only one other team topped 400 (Kansas City with
432). The Giants also added another 341 yards worth of field
position in their 54 sacks. Add the interception yardage gained
with sack yardage gained and the Giants' total was 844 yards. No
other NFL team cracked 800 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Giants' defense of '97 soared in creating
opportunity and being the club's spine.
</P>
<P>
   The top seven NFL defensive teams in yardage gained via sacks
and interceptions each won nine or more games. Four won 12 or more.
Each made the playoffs with the exception of the Jets, who finished
fifth in this category with 621 yards. The Jets' success in this
area was a huge factor in their fighting for a playoff spot until
the last day of the regular season and in turning a 1-15 team in
1996 into a 9-7 squad last year.
</P>
<P>
   So, want a top-caliber NFL defense? Sack 'em for big losses.
Intercept and run rampant on the return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the teams that were in the Super Bowl last
year, they had the two best quarterbacks,'' Ted Cottrell, the
Buffalo Bills' new defensive coordinator, said of Denver's John
Elway and Green Bay's Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, the quarterback can be the show, and if
you can sack him or intercept him, your defense wins. We tell our
defensive backs to break on the ball. Knocking down a pass is fine;
we'd rather have the ball. Then, once we get it on the
interception, our guys are taught that they are no longer on
defense. They are on offense. And if the other offense is lazy, we
are going to get a big return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys on the opposing offense are not used to tackling or
used to getting blocked. We look at these two things on a per-game
basis. We don't want five interceptions in one game and then not
another for two weeks. Per game, each game, how are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams in training camp now ask themselves, how are we doing
here? The answers for a few follow, with each team's defensive
sacks and interceptions in parentheses:
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (59/16) Good news: the Saints led the league in
sacks. Bad news: Saints quarterbacks were sacked 50 times. The
Saints gained 408 yards in sacks; they lost 317 yards when their
quarterback was sacked. They were intercepted 17 times more than
they intercepted others and lost 148 more yards on interceptions
than they gained. They spun their wheels. Their camp points
strictly to offensive discipline.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA (36/11) The Panthers gained only 72 return yards on
their defensive interceptions. Compare that with San Francisco's
366 yards in toppling the Panthers for the NFC West title and it is
easy to see why Carolina seeks improvement.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO (46/15) No Bill gained more than two interceptions last
season; 23 NFL teams featured a player with at least four thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (38/25) In yards gained via defensive sacks and
interceptions, the Rams ranked 10th in the league, but they won
only five games. Their offense did too little and did not protect
the ball (44 sacks for 326 yards lost and 30 turnovers).
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND (45/19) Pittsburgh earned one more interception than
the Patriots' 19 but gained 133 fewer yards than the Patriots did
on interception-return yardage. That means that the Patriots played
teams whose offenses could not tackle after the interception or
that the Patriots' interceptors were more swift and fancy on
returns.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (43/14) The Eagles' offense, once intercepted,
allowed 425 return yards and 4 touchdowns on those thefts. It was
the only team to allow 400-plus yards in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (31/10) This team ranked 28th in yards gained via
defensive sacks and interceptions but compensated with quarterback
Dan Marino and special teams _ and made the playoffs. The Dolphins
need improvement in defensive aggressiveness to push further.

70 COMPANIES ACCUSED OF USING TINSELTOWN GLAMOUR TO FLEECE
INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Demonstrating that Tinseltown's glitter isn't
always gold, federal officials on Tuesday announced a nationwide
crackdown against 70 businesses and individuals accused of
operating bogus entertainment scams that bilked thousands of
investors out of at least $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con artists promise Titanic profits, but too often investors
end up going down with the ship,'' said Denise Voigt Crawford,
president of the North American Securities Administrators
Association Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Risky Business, a sweeping action by a three-agency
task force, focused on schemes covering a wide range of
entertainment projects, including television programming, movies,
an infomercial for Elvis Presley memorabilia and a proposed
Internet casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``These investment opportunities are peddled as bright, new
initiatives. But they're actually the same old story,'' said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Consumer Protection. ``They are touted with fabulous earnings
claims, promoted with deceptions and virtually all the investors
end up losing their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that in some cases the ventures being pushed by
telemarketers didn't exist or if they did, had little chance of
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, telemarketers would encourage investors to pour
money from individual retirement accounts into the schemes by
saying that the deals had been approved by the Internal Revenue
Service, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all false,'' Heather Hippsley, an assistant director in
the consumer protection bureau. ``Most of the money (invested) goes
to overhead and sales commissions. There is very little money for
the actual investment.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, 60 complaints were brought by the FTC, the Securities
and Exchange Commission and state securities regulators against
operators of the businesses that tried to cash in on the public's
fascination with Hollywood's glamour.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies targeted, Los Angeles-based My Pet TV, was
accused of victimizing 1,200 investors who poured $16 million into
what was billed as the ``Children's Cable Network,'' which would
broadcast nonviolent, educational children's programs. Most of the
money was used to pay the company's principals and telemarketers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is accused of then illegally diverting $650,000 that
remained from the initial investment into a cable television
network devoted to programming geared toward pet owners.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were also filed against two affiliated companies,
Cable Marketing and Management Inc. and The Pet Channel, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals named in the complaints were Michael Marcovsky,
president, chairman and chief executive officer of My Pet TV, and
Sheldon Altfeld, president and chief executive of Cable Marketing
and Management and vice president of network operations for My Pet
TV.
</P>
<P>
   FTC officials said the two company executives have not responded
to the federal complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Automated Systems &AMP; Concepts International Inc. of Los Angeles
was accused of selling $10,000 investments in the production of
infomercials for such products as an Elvis Presley coffee-table
book, stamps and a collection of previously unreleased songs.
Federal officials estimate investors sunk $12 million into the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the complaint were John R. Munoz, the company's
president; Timothy Munoz, president of Premier Entertainment, a
related business; and Frank Gale, vice president of Automated
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials could not provide any other information about
the three businessmen and their attorney could not be reached for
comment.

COMMENTARY: TRUTH OR DARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics)  
 (HLW)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It makes perfect sense that Geraldo could be the
``NBC Nightly News'' anchor for the millennium. It makes perfect
sense that ``60 Minutes'' could hire Murphy Brown as a
correspondent. It makes perfect sense that Bill Clinton could go
onto the board of Dreamworks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a harmonic convergence. We may be awash in nostalgia about
``Private Ryan'' and a time when America had values more important
than celebrity. But we're stuck with a quarrelsome, raunchy, blurry
period where we constantly scramble to figure out what the rules
are.
</P>
<P>
   The artifact of our age will be a Gap dress that may bear what
one tabloid called ``the presidential seal of approval.'' We are
way through the looking glass here.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr plays Captains Ahab and Queeg, spending $40
million to report the obvious: Our president skirts the truth and
likes skirts. As Wilde might dub this federal fox hunt, the
unspeakable in full pursuit of the unedifying.
</P>
<P>
   With Harry Thomason here to explain his ``Wag the Dog'' role to
the grand jury and to help produce the president's rebuttal to
designing women, it's a good time to debunk the biggest myth about
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He is not, as Bob Kerrey told Esquire, ``an unusually good
liar.''  &UR; (I didn't inhale. It was a fluke that I didn't get
drafted. I did not have sexual relations with that woman. &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   He is like a little boy standing in the middle of a room with a
paper bag on his head, thinking he is invisible. Americans know he
lies, but they like him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He stammers. He loses his temper. His eyes get clouded. He looks
down. He answers slowly. He has trouble with his prodigious memory.
He leaves semantic and syntactical clues. Watch his tenses, his
adverbs, his articles.  &UR; (That allegation is false.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When he looked scared and tried to duck behind the present tense
when Jim Lehrer asked him last January, ``You had no sexual
relationship with this young woman?'' _ ``There is not a sexual
relationship,'' Clinton replied _ wasn't it obvious that something
inappropriate had occurred between the president and the intern?
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is such a skilled manipulator, such a consummate
charmer with words, then why did he need a coach to rebut the
Monica story? His denials in that first round of interviews were so
lame that Thomason rushed here to script a more forceful denial.
</P>
<P>
   When Clarence Thomas fought off Anita Hill's charges, he did so
``unequivocally,'' with such force that the senators leaned back
from the blast of the words.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never mastered the categorical denial, the big
intimidating blast that forces the listener to either accept or
reject your version. He prefers fibs that wink, or hem and haw,
buying him some time.
</P>
<P>
   Where Thomas denied ``each and every single allegation,''
Clinton is always sticking in wiggle words like ``solely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Clinton will turn a denial into an admission. Or he
will excuse himself inside the admission, asking for exoneration
even as he claims he did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the famous 1992 ``60 Minutes'` interview with Steve Kroft,
Clinton denied Gennifer Flowers' story but admitted causing pain in
his marriage. Most viewers came away understanding that he had been
involved with Ms. Flowers, but that he was denying some details of
her version. Rashomon rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can't even admit to a prevarication without tacking on
another. Is there anyone who believes his latest account, that he
did dally with Ms. Flowers, but only one time?
</P>
<P>
   His preposterous six-month refusal to explain his relationship
with the young White House intern says it all. If Clinton could say
Monica Lewinsky made everything up, or that it was inconceivable
that he was anywhere near that infamous navy blue dress, wouldn't
he scream it at the top of his lungs? Instead, the president stays
silent, as his fretful aides call reporters to ask if they've heard
anything about the lab results.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in a pickle. If he lied, he now has to figure out
some way to avoid committing perjury in the grand jury without
admitting perjury in the civil case. How can something be true and
not true at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   It is the moment when this luckiest of presidents might finally
learn that you cannot have everything you want without any
consequences.

 &HT;    `There's a long road to go' for Appleby
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Stuart Appleby had to stop several times, his
voice so choked words could no longer come out. Clearly, he isn't
done weeping for his wife, Renay, who died July 23 in a freak car
accident in London. Maybe he never will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like she was the first prize in a raffle of sorts, in
life and picking partners, and I was lucky enough to win her,'' the
27-year-old Australian said Tuesday, weeping between words. ``She's
changed a lot of people's lives. She obviously was only here for a
short time, and she had a very big impact on a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Renay Appleby and golf were Stuart's life. She caddied for him
in 1996 when they were trying to save money. More recently, with
her husband becoming a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, she walked
in the gallery, supporting his every move. At night after a round _
she always traveled with him _ they shared ideas and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that's left is Appleby's golf. By deciding to play this
week in the PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club, he's sinking
himself into his work, trying to cope with the void caused by her
horrific death. Renay was crushed between two cars when a cab
driver mistakenly thought he was in reverse and instead lunged
backwards into her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there with another gentleman,'' Stuart said. ``We were
doing CPR, heart massage, trying to find a pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   They never did.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby looks extremely tired. His eyes are sunken, his eyes
reddened. He is growing a beard, but not hiding behind it. He
requested a press conference in the PGA media center, choosing that
over a weeklong, daily barrage. He didn't realize how every thought
and mention of Renay would bring the nightmare into reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a part of the process of trying to move on,'' he
said. ``Not in a rushing sense, but to take one step at a time. I
had a loss of a person very close to me. Maybe other people don't
know what to say. Maybe I've got to reassure everyone that I'm OK.
We're all in this big group of people together in the world.
There's no preferences dealt out when someone disappears from us
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, it's just one day at a time and just trying to get a
rhythm,'' he said. ``I suppose the worst of it's over in an impact
sense, but there's a long road to go. ... At my best, I feel good,
very normal. At my worst I feel terrible. It's a feeling I would
never want to wish on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby is taking ``little baby steps'' in the recovery. The
funeral in Australia is behind him. He has returned to the PGA
Tour, planning three straight events. Returning to their house in
Orlando will take some time. Too many memories still live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough getting through nights,'' he said. ``When you
really love someone, you miss the simple things. It's a whole
package of experiences that you've shared with someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow players such as close friend and fellow Australian Robert
Allenby, are his safety net. They all want to help. Stuart wants to
chat with Davis Love III, whose father died in a 1988 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   For Couples, who has lost both parents over the last two years,
there's something of an identification to Appleby's pain. But Renay
was 25. The couple was just entering the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive into the trees and make a triple bogey and go to the
next hole,'' Couples said. ``And if you're worried about it for a
while, you just relate to things that happen to other people. ... I
give him a lot of credit for being able to get on a plane, leave
the house and come and play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples said he was ``in shock'' not only to see the story on TV
but because ``I was just in London and witnessed a little old lady
actually dive back to the curb to get out of the way of a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really strong guy,'' said U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen, a neighbor at Isleworth Country Club in Orlando. ``I know
it's not going to be easy for him for a long time. He knows he
needed to get back on tour. The biggest thing we can do is let him
know that's he's got a lot of friends who care about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said close friend Jesper Parnevik, already sensing Appleby's
resilience, ``He still has a positive outlook on life. It's not
like it's over. He just has to live it differently.''

AMMO JAILS AMERICANS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a matter of great confusion in the Mexican legal system,
said Roberto Rodriguez, Mexico's consul in Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, Scottsdale, Ariz., businessman James Brunen was
arrested entering Nogales, Sonora, with 149 rounds of ammunition he
said he mistakenly left in his vehicle. Brunen has been in jail
since.
</P>
<P>
   A week after, former Nogales, Ariz., police officer Jaime
Morales was arrested with two boxes of bullets at the same crossing
site. Three days later, Morales was released.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen and Morales had different federal judges assigned to
their cases, one with a strict interpretation of Mexico's ban on
all firearms and ammunition, the other who showed some compassion
for an unwitting violator.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats like Rodriguez say they wish there was some
consistency because ``there's just a lot of confusion now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rodriguez said, the same judge handling Brunen's
case had ordered the prompt release of another U.S. citizen
bringing ammo into Nogales, Sonora, last year when it was
determined that it was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But a higher court in Sonora's capitol, Hermosillo, chastised
the judge's decision, and ``that same judge is trying to act in
accordance with the ruling of the superior tribunal,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing remains clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have firearms or ammo on you when you cross that line,
you are in violation of Mexican law,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen can attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with reporters Tuesday about his rat- and
cockroach-infested prison cell and about life in a jail designed
for 350 people but home to about 1,500 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen said he already has spent $15,000 in legal fees and
expects to spend double that before he gets the case resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come here. Don't bring your money here. They hate us
here,'' Brunen said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen reiterated that he had taken a weapon from the vehicle
before leaving Scottsdale on a trip to Nogales to buy decorative
pots for friends. He said he simply forgot about the ammunition
until he had crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
   When stopped by Mexican customs officials, Brunen said he told
them in broken Spanish that he was declaring the ammunition, using
the words ``declare-o, declare-o.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a report of the incident filed by Mexican customs officer
Gilberto Chontal Maldonado, Brunen told authorities that he
couldn't remember whether he brought any ammunition with him.
Chontal said Brunen denied bringing weapons with him.
</P>
<P>
   Chontal said customs officers found a holster behind the
driver's seat of Brunen's Jeep Cherokee and started asking
questions. They then searched the vehicle and found 100 9mm rounds,
20 .38-caliber rounds and 29 .380-caliber rounds in the area of the
spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said it was clear, at least to his mind, that Brunen
had made no effort to conceal the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hidden in a bag or anything like that. It was out in
the open,'' Rodriguez said. ``Maybe some judges consider it hidden
simply because it was in the trunk area.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said that Brunen can expect to come to trial within 40
days of his arrest. &QL;

 &HT;    Marichal sends a message
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ People are still sending Dennis Martinez stuff, like
the bottle of 1988 Dom Perignon he found in his locker with a note
from San Diego reliever Randy Myers when he hit the clubhouse
Tuesday. But perhaps the most important item he received was a
two-sentence fax from the Dominican Republic, signed by Juan
Marichal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't his voice, which would have been something different
than a fax but he signed it,'' said Martinez, who surpassed
Marichal's record for victories by a Latin American pitcher with
his 244th Saturday. ``It was saying congratulations for overcoming
the record, that he was really pleased by it. It was quick. It was
a two-line thing. But that was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The record now his, Martinez has no idea if this will be his
last season. He has been periodically effective this year and,
perhaps more important, has had no recurrence of the elbow trouble
that drove him to retirement last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what will happen after the year,'' he said.
``I'm only thinking about this year. It's not as easy as it used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt's quad, episode 826
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss arrived at Qualcomm Stadium with an improved left
quadriceps after three days off. After huddling with trainers,
manager Bobby Cox determined his shortstop was not as improved as
he thought he was, shelving Weiss for Ozzie Guillen for the third
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pretty sore (Friday), but it's the same old thing,''
Weiss said. ``I thought before the San Francisco series I was done
with the thing. I felt great. I didn't expect it to pop up again.''
</P>
<P>
   But after seven straight starts, Weiss felt the muscle twinge in
his first at-bat last Friday against the Giants' Kirk Rueter, when
he ran out a hopper over the mound. Two days later, it was no
better.

   ``Seeing that it's getting closer to the end of the season,
we're going to be a lot more cautionary than we might have been if
this was May,'' he said. ``That's the bottom line right now, trying

   The great Andruw Jones hair saga has reached a conclusion. For
now. He has no hair at the moment, having shaved his head and his
platinum tint job on Monday. His smooth pate required plenty of
explaining to the steady stream of teammates who came to his locker
for hair updates. For those scoring at home, in the last week he
went from bronze to blond to none.

INVESTMENT-FRAUD CRACKDOWN SET

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fraudulent investment schemes centered on companies
that say they are raising money for entertainment ventures have
cost American investors $100 million in recent years, federal
regulators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing a joint crackdown on entertainment-industry
investment fraud, officials from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and a group of state securities
regulators said that a growing number of consumers had complained
recently about losing money in entertainment investments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, H. Dean Cooke, a 58-year-old retired aerospace
engineer from Vienna, Va., said at a news conference Tuesday that
he had invested $20,000 last year in Desert Gold Partners, which
said it was producing a film about the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the SEC charged four California-based companies and
three individuals with securities fraud in the sale of $8 million
of Desert Gold partnership units to 600 investors nationwide. The
commission said that the defendants transferred most of the money
raised to themselves and their affiliates, but no movie was
produced.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also announced the filing of three other enforcement
actions in entertainment-related ventures and filed three cases in
federal court in Los Angeles and one in federal court in Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC announced the filing of four regulatory actions,
including one charging a California company with deceptive
practices in raising $16.5 million from investors to operate a
cable television channel with nonviolent programming for children.

ADOBE WARNS OF POSSIBLE LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adobe Systems Inc. warned Tuesday that its
third-quarter revenue would fall below analysts' expectations,
resulting in a potential loss. Adobe also announced the departure
of three senior executives and a reduction of 240 to 300 jobs, or
13 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Adobe fell $1.375, to $30.8125, on Nasdaq before
trading was halted for the company's announcement late in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., is a leading maker of software
programs used in publishing, including Photoshop, Illustrator,
Pagemaker and the Postscript language used in printers. Although
Adobe has modified many of its programs to take advantage of the
Internet, and many are used to create Web sites, analysts said the
company had run into difficulty exploiting the transition to
electronic publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adobe is a tremendously successful company in the print world,
but they haven't really figured out the right products and strategy
for making money and being successful on the Web,'' said
Christopher Galvin, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also said in its announcement Tuesday that business
continued to be hurt by Japan's recession. The company said that
cost-cutting efforts, including the reduction of jobs, would lower
expenses by as much as $60 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said revenue for the quarter that will end Aug. 28
was likely to be $220 million to $225 million, compared with $230
million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-time reorganization charge and other nonrecurring
expenses, Adobe said, net income may break even or be a loss,
compared with net income of $53.4 million in the quarter a year
earlier. Analysts had expected Adobe to earn 52 cents a diluted
share, according to First Call, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also said Tuesday that three top executives, P. Jackson
Bell, executive vice president and chief administrative officer;
Robert Roblin, executive vice president for marketing, and Ross
Bott, executive vice president for product divisions, had resigned.

TUCSON FEDERAL JUDGE RICHARD S. BILBY DIES SUDDENLY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER AND MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Richard S. Bilby, a Tucson federal judge known for
incisive intelligence, blunt-spoken manner and high-profile clashes
with Arizona officials, died suddenly Tuesday near his summer home
in Flagstaff. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby collapsed while taking a walk with his dog, friends said,
and paramedics were unable to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby, who presided over the 1992 civil trial of financier
Charles H Keating Jr. was the son of a pioneering Arizona family
and an outspoken critic of those he thought had abused their
professional or political power.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the death of the Tucson native, who played golf
frequently and carefully watched his diet, stunned his colleagues
on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would live forever,'' said Judge Robert
Broomfield, who presides over the U.S. District Court in Phoenix.
``He was the model of health.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Irving, a retired U.S. District Judge in San Diego,
said, ``It was a real shock to me. His father lived until he was
about 95, and I used to joke with him that he was in such
tremendous shape that he'd be around forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving called Bilby ``a very talented judge with an uncanny
ability to cut right to the heart of a case'' and move it
efficiently toward resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very decisive,'' Irving said. ``A totally honest and
ethical person who called things as he saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hawkins, who argued cases in Bilby's court before
himself becoming a judge in the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
hailed Bilby's pragmatism and willingness to bring computer
technology into the courtroom and involve jurors in the questioning
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, when he became a senior judge, I described
him in a speech as `the trial lawyer's trial judge,' '' Hawkins
said. ``He was probably one of the most innovative trial judges
this state or any state has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 interview, Bilby said he had ``the best job in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I most like about being a judge is that I get to solve
problems,'' he said. ``Being a judge is much better than being a
trial lawyer. Here, I give the ulcers rather than get them. Plus, I
just enjoy watching attorneys work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilby was a man of vivid contrasts. He once served as Pima
County Republican Party chairman, but his views often sounded like
those of a populist Democrat from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He was a respected figure in a profession dominated by somber
men of grave self-importance, but he sported a Mickey Mouse watch
and preferred not to wear a judicial robe in his courtroom, unless
a jury was present.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat, made Bilby his
first judicial nomination, a move that wasn't popular with some of
DeConcini's Democratic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But DeConcini, who grew up with Bilby in Tucson, said he picked
his friend for the job because ``he was an excellent lawyer who
just had a sterling reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a senior judge, Bilby's death does not create a
vacancy on the federal bench that can be filled by presidential
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby made plenty of headlines in his career. He tangled with
former Gov. Fife Symington over juvenile corrections and criticized
state prison officials for failing to protect inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bilby openly attacked suggestions by Gov. Symington and
others regarding the automatic transfer of repeat and violent
youthful offenders to adult court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take the position that every child who commits an
assaultive crime should be considered an adult, that puts us back
in the Dark Ages,'' he said. ``My God, I thought we were smarter
than that!''
</P>
<P>
   Bilby subsequently ordered the state juvenile corrections agency
to limit its bed space - and then determined that the Arizona
Department of Juvenile Corrections was not in compliance with his
order.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bilby struck down as unconstitutionally vague Arizona's
ban on ``partial birth abortions;'' he permanently blocked the law
from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   He said the law, passed by the Legislature, unconstitutionally
burdens a woman's right to terminate a non-viable fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby also presided over a massive 1992 civil trial in which
investors successfully sued Keating as well as accountants,
business associates and lawyers who were accused of having helped
the Phoenix financier sell junk bonds in his ill-fated American
Continental Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking bluntly from the bench, Bilby said that if one of
Keating's law firms saw a pattern of fraud, it should have walked
away. ``You can take your big fees and leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby later said he had no tolerance for professionals who
``abuse their status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a lawyer or a CPA (certified public accountant) or a
doctor, you have special privileges that allow you to make a lot of
money'' and hold a preferred position in society, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to me that when you have those perks, you have
special obligations that go along with them. I expect lawyers and
all professional people to be honest and hard-working and candid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bilby said his background explained his scorn
for self-importance and his demand for candor. ``It's just the way
I was brought up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby's parents were Mormon pioneer stock who met at the Gila
Academy in Thatcher, eloped and, in 1912, struck out for Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their first home was a wooden-floored tent on the banks of the
Rillito River,'' said Bilby, whose mother taught school while his
father attended the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby credited his mother with doing most of the work of raising
four children, while his father built a law practice and became a
leader in state Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an exceptional woman who, I think, gave me my ideas
about fairness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I grew up, the three luckiest things that could
happen to you were to be born in the United States, to be White and
to be healthy. My mother made me realize that you don't have a lick
to do with any of those things, so when you look at other people,
you've got to realize that not everybody has the same breaks in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilby earned a bacelor's degree from the University of Arizona
in 1955, and, after service in the Army, earned a law degree from
the University of Michigan Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Hawkins said Bilby's relatively privileged background and
Republican Party activism made some Tucson observers of his early
career on the bench misjudge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that he might not be sympathetic to claims of the
poor and minority groups and those who thought the government had
run roughshod over them,'' Hawkins said. ``But he was very much an
advocate, in the appropriate circumstances, for the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, ``The Republic'' reported Bilby's sharp
criticisms of state prison officials over the death of inmate Steve
Benitez, who was murdered by gang members in his Tucson prison cell
after officials had allowed him to rejoin the general inmate
population, even though they knew his life had been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you that Benitez really bothers me, because I
think it evidences an attitude,'' Bilby told Department of
Corrections Director Terry Stewart in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the attitude that scares me more than anything else, that
`What we (DOC) are doing is right.' But if what you are doing is
right,'' Bilby said, ``Benitez should be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt remembered Bilby on Tuesday
as a ``man of very strong convictions and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said that with the abbreviated caseload of a senior
judge, Bilby had ``wanted to focus on playing golf and enjoying
life . . . ``It just seemed like everything was just the way he
wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilby is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two grown
daughters. Funeral arrangements are pending. &QL;

TROJANS' LINE FINDS RIGHT COMBINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The offensive line might be USC's biggest
question mark, but it appears that at least the right side has been
settled. Junior Travis Claridge and sophomore Brent McCaffrey would
start at right guard and right tackle, if the season began today.
</P>
<P>
   The other three positions might be up for grabs, but getting the
right side decided has to be viewed as progress for a largely
inexperienced group. It doesn't help matters that the offensive
line has been the most maligned position for the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been beaten down a bit,'' offensive line coach
Steve Greatwood said. ``It seems like the offensive line is where
the buck stops. Whether it was warranted or not, and it probably
was, that's where it has stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood has been working at restoring morale as well as
teaching techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to prop them up,'' he said. ``There's not
a lot of household names in the group, which has not been the norm
at USC. We're young. We're just a bunch of no-names right now, but
I think I'll have an excellent group.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other positions, Ken Bowen and Rome Douglas are battling
for the left tackle spot, while junior-college transfer Donta
Kendrick and Jason Grain are splitting time at left guard. Matt
McShane, Eric Denmon and Grain are all practicing at center,
although McShane was considered the leader following spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the team will have to practice in pads before any
other decisions are made on the line.
</P>
<P>
   __ Haslip making strides: Defensive back Ken Haslip has emerged
during the first two days, impressing Hackett with his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Haslip is in better shape than he's ever been,'' Hackett
said. ``I'm very happy with our secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Antuan Simmons, who is battling Haslip for a starting
spot, was cleared to practice Tuesday and also drew Hackett's
attention. ``He's around the ball a lot,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas nurses ankle: The role of highly touted quarterback
Jason Thomas has been slowed the first two days by a sore ankle.
It's the same ankle that Thomas fractured last season at Dominguez
High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aggravated it through the dropbacks we did Saturday,''
Thomas said. ``It's a lot different than in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is being limited to one practice per day, and doctors
have told him scar tissue around the ankle is causing the
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jersey switch: Offensive lineman Trevor Roberts is wearing
No.76 in training camp because there are no available jerseys with
his No. 77. What happened to the No. 77's? They were shipped to
Ohio for the NFL Hall of Fame ceremony induction involving former
Trojans lineman Anthony Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not in camp: Wide receiver Kevin McLaughlin of Hart, who
underwent reconstructive surgery last spring, is not in camp but
will return once school begins. McLaughlin is redshirting this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking it slow: Hackett is having several players, including
wide receiver Larry Parker and linebacker Mike Pollard, sit out
every third or fourth practice session so they can simply observe
and absorb what's happening on the field. Hackett referred to it as
a ``mental practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be pulling guys not necessarily with an injury,''
Hackett said.

   Cowboys pay visit &QL; 
to Spin City again
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MOST of us can think back to our high school days and probably
remember engaging in antics that can only be described as
``horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   As I remember it, horseplay usually involved either delivering
or receiving a series of ``frog'' punches to the biceps. Sometimes,
it might have been hiding a teammate's uniform, or when the locker
room really was hopping, perhaps rubbing some Ben Gay inside an
unsuspecting teammate's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   It was horseplay. It was boys being boys. It was what we did
when we were sowing oats, sprouting wings and doing all those
things we did when we thought we were men but in truth were not.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, wherever there was horseplay, there also was a
burly coach who appeared from his office, either blowing a whistle
or wielding an inch-thick paddle. And that was that. Horseplay
over. Situation under control.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of learning to grow up and being accountable _
how we left horseplay behind and replaced it with real-world games
like mortgages, carting kids to T-ball and building love-hate
relationships with Stairmaster machines.
</P>
<P>
   But then, there are the 'Boys. The Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Talk proves cheap ...
</P>
<P>
   They told us they would be men this year. They told us the
antics and charades were done. They brought in familiar faces and
personalities we could love _ the professorial Calvin Hill, the
respected head coach Chan Gailey. Quarterback Troy Aikman and
Emmitt Smith _ respected players and people _ talked of renewed
enthusiasm and no longer having to worry about distractions. A
trimmer offensive line came to camp and, more important, brought
healthy knee cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Boys told us they finally would grow up and worry as much
about image and integrity as their 10-13 record over the past 23
games.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently they were, are and forever will be just 'Boys in
men's bodies, so long as receiver Michael Irvin has a friend in
Jerry Jones and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a coach in desperate need of a scary-looking
paddle in his top desk drawer, or at least a whistle he doesn't
have to swallow whenever Jones shows up, it is Gailey, a good coach
in an undeniably, inevitably bad place.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent episode among these 'Boys was the July 29
training-camp fight involving Irvin, offensive lineman Everett
McIver and a pair of sharp scissors Irvin apparently thrust into
McIver's neck.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the fight, Jones not only ignored the promised
integrity and accountability but also put a gag order on all those
involved and started spin-doctoring. He switched on his made-for-TV
smile and called it all ``horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, horseplay certainly isn't what it used to be. I
don't remember locker-room stabbings, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Irvin went to the innovative ``blame the media''
card, telling reporters, ``You guys are working harder to put me in
jail than the police.''
</P>
<P>
   But in actuality, the police didn't have to work very hard to
find Irvin in felony possession of cocaine in 1996. Judge Manny
Alvarez also didn't have to work hard deciding that even if that
was a nice mink coat Irvin wore to court, he still would give Irvin
four years' probation and a warning that one violation of parole
could result in up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ... but silence can cost
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we are in the midst of a 'Boyish cover-up that obviously
involves deceit, or at least the kind of truth-bending Dallas has
not seen since J.R. told Sue Ellen he would be faithful.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: We know the two-inch gash in McIver's neck came
dangerously close to his carotid artery. What we do not know is how
McIver's serious wound was surgically repaired.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 stitches sewn into McIver's neck. But there is no
record of his being admitted to any Dallas-area hospitals, which
are required to report to police all violent incidents (stabbings,
etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Could Jones be so conniving and deceptive that he turned to a
team trainer or perhaps his tailor and said, ``Come on! We gotta
make this scissors thing look like a big ol' misunderstanding! Sew
that kid up!'' After all, Jones knows Irvin's pass-catching skills
might deteriorate slightly by 2018.
</P>
<P>
   One recent report said Jones himself negotiated a
high-six-figure settlement between Irvin and McIver in exchange for
McIver's not filing charges _ charges that surely would have
interested all those officers, attorneys and Judge Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is investigating. Campus police and district attorneys
are waiting for substantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the particulars of the stabbing remain hazy, from
the bits of information that have squeezed through the cracks of
the locker-room walls, I'm picturing an uncensored Jerry Springer
episode about home makeovers gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Globs of hair in players' hands. Chairs flying through the air.
Profanities. Punches flying. Sharp objects. Situation out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   'Boys will be boys.

 &HT;    Pesek-Bonner takes 3-meter synchronized
 &HT;    By Tracey Thomson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Tuesday night, the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center
opened the 1998 U.S. National Diving Championships, showcasing the
talent of 65 athletes competing for spots on the U.S. National and
World Cup teams. The divers, ranging in age from 13 to 39,
completed the preliminary round in the men's and women's 3-meter
and 10-meter platform synchronized competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized diving, a relatively new event in the sport, was
developed by Tom Gompf in 1995. Gompf, a U.S. Diving and FINA
official, introduced the event as a way to increase the number of
specators at diving meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spectators like synchro because more things can happen,'' said
Tracy Bonner, the first-place finisher with partner Kathy Pesek in
the 3-meter competition. ``There is more difficulty, and that makes
it more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized diving involves a pair of athletes executing a
number of moves simultaneously. Divers are scored by a panel of
five judges based on individual and team performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is definitely difficult in synchro. But the hardest
part is concentrating on your own dive, and trusting your
partner,'' Pesek said.
</P>
<P>
   For Pesek and Bonner, timing and trust have developed over time.
While the two have only been competing as a pair for a year and a
half, both have trained with Tennessee Diving and competed for the
University of Tennessee under the instruction of coach Dave
Parrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definately have an advantage over other divers because we
have trained with the same coach and have developed the same
technique,'' said Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   With the sport still in its infancy, many divers have not had
the luxury of training together for any amount of time. Jessica
Johnstone and Olivia York of Marietta formed their synchro team
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we are both from here and we train here, we just decided
to try and see how we would do,'' said Johnstone whose team placed
16th in the 3-meter competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 10-meter platform, 1996 individual platform
Olympians David Pilcher and Patrick Jeffrey placed first, advancing
to Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to come back and have some fun,'' said Jeffrey,
who finished ninth in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 3-meter synchro competition, Kevin McMahon and
Justin Dumais finished first, earning the pair a spot in Saturday's
finals. The women's 10-meter platform competition concluded the
synchro portion of the National Diving Championships. Placing first
were Laura Wilkinson and Patty Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Championships give divers an opportunity to earn points
toward January's World Cup in New Zealand. Many divers who competed
in the synchro portion will continue in individual competition
through Sunday's conclusion of the Championships.

 &HT;    Younger freestyler overtakes Bennett in Nationals
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLOVIS, Calif. _ Olympic champion Brooke Bennett got a little
taste Tuesday of how Janet Evans felt losing to a younger swimmer _
namely Bennett _ at a major meet. Now can Diana Munz hold onto her
newfound supremacy?
</P>
<P>
   Munz, 16, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, defeated Bennett in the
800-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming National Championships as
the temperature surpassed 100 degrees and their rivalry reached
into the hot zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can remember back when Janet was swimming and I wanted to
beat her,'' said Bennett, 18, of Plant City, Fla., who held off
Munz in January for the world title at Perth, Australia. ''It's
just the determination inside of you to make you get to that wall
first. But I think I still have a lot left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett took the early lead, but didn't get out far enough and
Munz was able to draft off her. Munz passed Bennett with 590 meters
to go and kicked, touching the wall with pale blue fingernails. Her
time of 8 minutes, 31.74 seconds was more than two seconds off her
best. Bennett's time, 8:35.81, was about eight seconds slower than
her top mark.
</P>
<P>
   Munz had already defeated Bennett in three races earlier this
year at spring nationals _ the 400, 800, and 1,500 _ but recognized
that Bennett hadn't shaved and tapered to prepare for that meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time that we've both been ready to go and I was
able to bring it in as a win,'' Munz said.
</P>
<P>
   At this same pool in 1987, Evans set world records in the 800
and 1,500. ''Wow, I didn't know that,'' Munz said. ''You know,
Janet Evans is seriously my idol _ even if she's not swimming.
Brooke now is the No. 1 swimmer, and it's just amazing that now
it's coming to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Munz will meet again here in the 200, 400 and
1,500-meter freestyles. Bennett believes that theirs will be a
rivalry for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that she's right there, and I think for the rest of our
careers we're going to be neck and neck with each other,'' Bennett
said, ''which is good for me because I went through a couple of
times where I had really no competition.''
</P>
<P>
   While she acknowledged, ''It always hurts (to lose),'' Bennett
said it was ''good for me to come here, and find my weaknesses and
work on those for the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both qualify for the 1999 Pan Pacific meet in the Olympic pool
in Sydney. Bennett has a reminder of Australia at home in the form
of her pet wallaby, Tilly-May. A wallaby is like a baby kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett is known for her animal menagerie, Munz was almost
embarrassed to admit that she has no peculiar hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have two dogs, labrador retrievers,'' she offered. ''Their
names are Splash and Backstroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson won the men's 800, which is not an Olympic event,
while Tom Dolan suffered another of his asthma attacks and was
14th. He should be fine by Thursday, when he swims his gold-medal
event, the 400 individual medley.

JOEL BARR, 82, DEFECTOR WHO BECAME PIONEER IN SOVIET MICROCHIP
INDUSTRY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joel Barr, an American Communist and friend of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who barely eluded the FBI before he
could be charged with espionage in 1950, died on Aug. 1 in a
hospital in Moscow. He was 82 and had lived in St. Petersburg for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend, Morton Sobell, who served 18 years in prison on a
charge of conspiracy to commit espionage, said Tuesday from his
home in San Francisco that Barr had died of a heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Rosenbergs, who were tried with Sobell, were executed
in 1953 for their role in providing nuclear secrets to the Soviets,
Barr went on to become a founder of the Soviet Union's microchip
industry. He never played a major espionage role and no arrest
warrant or indictment was ever issued against him. He applied for,
and received, Social Security benefits and held both American and
Russian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a cog in the wheel,'' said Edward Wierzbowski, a
documentary filmmaker who helped Barr in his old age. ``He was just
one of hundreds of Americans supplying information to the Soviet
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Wierzbowski said on Tuesday that a KGB official had told him
that Barr had provided Soviet agents with radar and electronics
information. ``This was important to the Russians, who were not
getting any technological assistance from the Americans and the
British,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barr defected to the Soviet Union with Alfred Sarant, an
engineer from Ithaca, N.Y., and established the Soviet equivalent
of Silicon Valley at a time when the Russians were far behind the
West in microchip technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KGB had people everywhere and knew that he was going to be
arrested'' in the United States, Wierzbowski said. Barr then went
to Paris for a supposed holiday and slipped behind the Iron
Curtain, first to Czechoslovakia and then to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Sarant was interrogated for three days by the FBI and fled,
ultimately to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was born in Brooklyn of parents who had emigrated from
Russia and, although he was regarded as an excellent pianist, he
studied engineering at the City College of New York. Among his
classmates were Rosenberg and Sobell.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1992, Barr said
that Rosenberg signed him up as a party member and they became
friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barr said: ``I am ready to confess, or
whatever the word is, to say that really I made a tremendous
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that his actions were never meant to ``put the
United States in peril,'' but rather to help communism to thrive in
the Soviet Union so it might spread to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he helped the Soviets build their first radar-guided
anti-aircraft guns but contended: ``Nothing I did in America was
used directly in my work in the Soviet Union, but, indirectly, my
general education, which I got in America, has helped me a lot in
my work here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Barr applied for and received an American passport,
which he used to travel to the United States and to apply for a
Social Security pension, which he got.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, Barr gave up on communism. ``I
believe that now history will show that the Russian Revolution was
a tremendous mistake,'' he told The Los Angeles Times. ``It was a
step backward. The real revolution for mankind that will go down
for many, many years was the American Revolution.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton's bus slowly chugged
along the roads in upstate New York recently on a preservation
tour, she glanced out the window at a woman holding aloft a
cardboard sign. It said, ``You Go Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Mrs. Clinton has been trying to do just that,
and in some respects, is succeeding, even as her husband prepares
to face a federal grand jury on Monday about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's approval ratings across the country are higher
than ever. Instead of sequestering herself at the White House, away
from the klieg lights and the inevitable questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton has crowded her schedule with things to do
and people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island,
Mrs. Clinton dropped in on the glitterati, firing up a crowd of
1,000 people who whooped and hollered as she introduced her
husband. And she has helped several Democratic candidates, raising
$150,000 in Philadelphia for one candidate two weeks ago. Soon, she
will be traveling to Russia, Ireland, Chile and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, Mrs. Clinton has stirred things up by dishing
out a few select words about the Lewinsky matter, in which a grand
jury is investigating whether President Clinton lied when asked
under oath if he had had a sexual relationship with the former
intern and whether he tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Mrs. Clinton placed the blame on a ``right-wing
conspiracy'' spearheaded by the Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
and his allies, for trying to ruin her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in an interview published in The Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, Mrs. Clinton said prejudice against Arkansas was
driving the attacks on her husband.``I think a lot of this is
prejudice against our state,'' Mrs. Clinton told the newspaper.
``They wouldn't do this if we were from some other state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Arkansas seized on Mrs. Clinton's remark.
``I know she must be going through a lot of stress, but I don't
think anyone in Arkansas believes this is occurring because of
prejudice towards the state,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.
``It's inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., was harsher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad and unfortunate that Arkansas is depicted by the
first lady as a backward state, worthy of ridicule and prejudice,''
Dickey said. ``It would be much better if the first lady would make
a mature and responsible assessment of the situation and not blame
us Arkansans for their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas could not resist joking, saying,
``First, it was the right-wing conspiracy. Now it's the
chicken-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that Mrs. Clinton has swayed a number of
Americans, especially women, over to her side in the past eight
months. According to a CBS News poll conducted July 19 through July
21, 50 percent of those surveyed said they held a favorable opinion
of Mrs. Clinton and 26 percent say they did not. In previous years,
only 35 percent or so of Americans had expressed support for Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some political consultants say that after six years, people are
starting to like Mrs. Clinton and her reconfigured role as first
lady. Others point directly at Ms. Lewinsky, and say that the
public sympathizes with Mrs. Clinton and that has softened her
image in a way that speeches and press releases never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best person they can put out there,'' said Goeas.
``She's kind of standing by her man, and has been determined to do
exactly that. Some people feel sorry for her. Some respect her.
It's probably a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said, ``I think that the first
lady has handled this whole set of attacks with grace and
intelligence and wit, and people admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Mrs. Clinton's legal background, and her
own experience as a subpoenaed witness before Starr's Whitewater
grand jury, makes her one of the president's most valuable
strategists. And, in fact, she is said to be directly involved in
meetings with lawyers and others on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the private Mrs. Clinton has remained steadfastly elusive.
How does she broach the subject of Ms. Lewinswky with her husband?
Do they talk about the infamous dress? Does she advise him on what
to say?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are all subject to speculation, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at best this is an extremely difficult time and I
think the President and Mrs. Clinton are probably communicating, in
many ways through their lawyer, David Kendall,'' DeeDee Myers,
President Clinton's former press secretary, said on the ABC news
program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Myers said, ``These are the kind of issues that I think
husbands and wives don't often sit down and sort of have frank
conversations about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former White House aide said people still discounted one
thing when they looked at Mrs. Clinton's relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That woman is wild for him,'' the former aide said. ``She is
so deeply in love with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser at the home of the actors Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger in the Hamptons at the beginning of this month, an
ebullient Mrs. Clinton got the crowd fired up for her husband, then
gave him a hug before he took the microphone and delivered five
minutes of subdued remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's staff said she thrives on her public appearances,
especially when she is talking about children's issues, health care
and the encroaching millennium. ``She believes that if you spend
one day pacing around the White House, that's one day you are not
doing something to advance the agenda of the President,'' said Neel
Lattimore, Mrs. Clinton's former press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she approached the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and offered to attend a number of fund-raisers
for House and Senate candidates, many of them challengers facing
uphill battles. She has attended six fund-raisers since June and is
expected to attend several more over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, the communications director for the campaign
committee, said that she was the party's biggest draw, after the
president. Just before a special election in Albuquerque, N.M.,
Mrs. Clinton drew 2,000 at a college gym on 48 hours notice,
Sallick said, adding that she had helped involve women who did not
typically turn out to show up and write checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the president, who tends to do more fund-raising for
the national party committee, she is in the most demand of any
other Democratic official,'' Sallick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Spottswood, a Wisconsin candidate for the House, said Mrs.
Clinton attended a small reception in Milwaukee that drew $60,000.
Ms. Spottswood said Mrs. Clinton's wifely travails had certainly
played a hand in her popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There but for the grace of God,'' Ms. Spottswood said. ``Any
woman could find herself with unwelcomed rumors. She has dealt with
it with so much dignity and grace, it has resonated with people.''

COLLEGES AGREE TO SHARE CHORES, BUT WITHOUT UTTERING THE M-WORD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, LeBron Fairbanks, the president of a small,
distinctively Christian liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, Ohio,
had an inspiration. Budget cuts were threatening his institution,
but, he figured, he could save ``bushels of money'' by combining
resources with neighboring colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was daring for an institution like Mount Vernon
Nazarene College, which is committed to its religious traditions
and wary of blurring its identity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fairbanks came up with a proposal in which Mount
Vernon and five other Ohio colleges would seek ways to combine
administrative tasks. He found a receptive ear for his experiment
at the Teagle Foundation, a midsize private philanthropy that was
just then shopping for a way to make a significant contribution to
higher education. Teagle so liked the idea (and trusted Fairbanks,
as an earlier grant recipient) that it set up the Collaborative
Ventures Program and has issued more than $4 million in grants to
help colleges set up money-saving collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   While only a handful of such consortiums existed in 1995, today
there are at least 21 representing more than 125 colleges and
universities. They range from the elite Five Colleges Inc.
(Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith and the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst) to the Montana Consortium of American
Indian tribal colleges (Rocky Mountain, Salish Kootenai, Little Big
Horn and Fort Peck Community College).
</P>
<P>
   The appeal for Five Colleges was not just to save money but also
to enrich academic programs. Specialized courses like Arabic, early
music and astronomy rotate among the Five Colleges campuses, which
individually might not be able to afford such unusual offerings.
Students are encouraged to register for the shared courses at
member institutions for no additional fees, and free intercollege
bus service is provided.
</P>
<P>
   Five Colleges is now trying to consolidate programs in American
ethnic studies. A $135,000 Teagle grant will help pay for a new
ethnic studies teacher who will shuttle from campus to campus this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the colleges in the Montana Consortium are too far
apart for shuttle buses, so they are creating an online university
using distance-learning techniques, with a shared curriculum and
faculty exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great many of these small institutions are being caught in a
squeeze,'' said Richard W. Kimball, president of Teagle. ``On the
one hand, their costs are going up because education is
labor-intensive, and on the other they can no longer continue to
raise tuition faster than the rate of inflation because the public
won't stand for it. They've got no alternative but to reduce
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was approached by Fairbanks, Kimball said he was aware
that some collaborative efforts in the past had failed. But he
recalled thinking, ``If a very conservative school like Mount
Vernon Nazarene College is interested in this, maybe the time is
right nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of consortiums is not entirely new. The Associated
Colleges of the Twin Cities, an organization of five colleges in
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, has shared academic programs for
about two decades. It is expanding its collaborations and is now
working on a plan to share security services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future will require higher-education leadership to reach
out to others where there are administrative overlaps and academic
programs which can be combined,'' said Larry Osnes, president of
Hamline University in St. Paul, a Twin Cities institution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the most striking efforts involve institutions that have
strong religious ties. A consortium of seminaries around Columbus,
Ohio, is linking libraries and requiring students of each
institution to take at least one course at another consortium
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fairly avant-garde in this,'' said Norman E. Dewire,
president of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, part of the
consortium. ``But we realize we can't live in a world apart.''
</P>
<P>
   College administrators are not unmindful of the risks. ``Of
course we have to be careful,'' said Fairbanks of Mount Vernon
Nazarene College, which is now in league with five diverse
institutions, including Ohio Dominican College, a Roman Catholic
institution, and Wilmington College, which is affiliated with the
Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers. Teagle awarded $560,000
to the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a fierce loyalty to these institutions,''
Fairbanks said. ``If you talk to the alumni about mergers, changing
the name or losing your identity you're looking for another job.''

WILLIAMS'S STYLE HAS BEEN TO GET RESULTS, NOT ACCLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The man has his quirks. No one questions that. His Red
Sox cap looks as if it is three sizes too big, pulled low enough to
hide his eyes and highlight his ears. Sometimes he thumps his desk
in the manager's office when he speaks. You close your eyes and
swear it is comedian Dana Carvey imitating George Bush on those old
``Saturday Night Live'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams returned to Fenway Park Tuesday, the first time he
and his team have been at home since July 26 (although his office
calendar was still flipped to June). That's why, by 3:30 p.m.,
there was already a crowd of Sox fans outside the players' parking
lot. They came with cameras and caps, hoping for glimpses and
autographs. Most of them weren't looking for the manager. They
should have been.
</P>
<P>
   We all talk about the Eccentricities of Jimy. Not many have
discussed his dugout brilliance. If Jim Leyland _ the first choice
for the Boston managerial job after Kevin Kennedy was fired in 1996
_ were sitting in his seat, maybe there would be loud Manager of
the Year debates about him. But many dismiss Williams as a guy who
could just as easily be wearing overalls and holding a pitchfork, a
great candidate for a 1990s portrait of American Gothic. He is as
homey as anyone you've met. But you've got to give him his props:
He knows baseball. Question is, would you make him Manager of the
Year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. Manager of the Year,'' Mo Vaughn said before last night's
Sox-Royals game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is pinstriped opposition to that statement.
Only 200 miles from here, a man named Joe Torre has led the Yankees
to nearly three wins in every four games. Everyone has known since
late May that the Yankees will easily win the American League East.
Now they're talking about winning 117 games, which would break the
record of the 1906 Cubs. There are many who argue that you have to
give the Most Valuable Player Award to the slugger who breaks Roger
Maris's home run record. In most cases, I would think that you'd
have to do the same thing with a manager who leads his team to the
most wins in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Torre could be Manager of the Year, too,'' Vaughn said.
``But with the low expectations people had for this ball club, Jimy
deserves it more. Everyone knew the Yankees were going to be good.
But they didn't know about us. And Jimy has kept us rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   If I lived in another city, Torre would have my vote, based on
the Yankees winning 75 percent of their games during a year in
which 16-game winner David Cone didn't even make the All-Star team.
But those who have a front-row view of what Williams has had to go
through here understand that the race for the award should be
close. He lost his leadoff man and second baseman in spring
training. He began the season with outfielders who many predicted
would not have a 20-homer man among them. He has had to shuffle the
lineup a few times this season because of the absence of Vaughn or
Nomar Garciaparra. He stood aside when his general manager snubbed
his first baseman and as his first baseman ripped his general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   He's a genuinely nice man. But you know there have been times
when he has looked at the now-dormant civil war between Vaughn and
Dan Duquette and said to himself, ``Why can't these guys chill out
until the end of the season?'' He's probably thought it; he's never
said it. People have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is as good a man as he is a manager,'' pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan said. ``That's just as important as anything else in
the big leagues because of the amount of time you spend around
these guys. His top assets are his integrity and his honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan paused and smiled before he added, ``With all the
distractions we've had with injuries and all the other stuff that
normally happens over the course of a summer in Boston, he's been a
rock. He's our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   That should have been obvious in Texas Saturday night. Williams
decided to give Darren Lewis the night off and put Darren Bragg in
the leadoff spot. Bragg finished the night with four hits,
including a home run, off former teammate Aaron Sele. The next
night, Bragg was batting seventh. Williams was asked Tuesday if he
would consider putting Bragg back in the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's our leadoff hitter?'' he asked, thumping on the wooden
desk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren Lewis,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. Before that, he had been asked about the
surging Baltimore Orioles. You know what he said, right? He talked
about the Royals, how they were last night's opponent, the Sox had
to focus on them and basically made other unremarkable statements
not many people want to hear. But these are Jimy's gospels. On the
left side of his desk is a picture of his family. It is framed in a
case inscribed, ``Father.'' On the right side of that desk? A thick
booklet that reads, ``Advanced Scouting Report: Kansas City
Royals.''
</P>
<P>
   Your team will beat his because your team is better. Your team
will not beat his because his team did not master the basics.
Before games, he drills Kerrigan about the state of the bullpen. He
insists that his players be on time and play hard. He loves hustle
plays such as Bragg's artful slide home in the seventh inning last
night. He likes one-on-one talks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vaughn, ``When I threw that ball away in Texas (the
decisive run in a 4-3 loss), he came to me the next day and said,
`Listen, this is how you have to think about it. Think about it;
just hear me out.' He keeps things in house. He'll pull you in his
office and sit you down rather than rip you in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will never rip his guys. He'll thump on his desk and
sometimes speak in evasive terms that some would call presidential.
They'd be wrong. Jimy Williams's style is, well, managerial.

LEWINSKY CASE MAKES PHONE RING FOR SIMPSON DNA EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(budgeted as NY-SCHECK-PROFILE)  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are three things that Barry Scheck, the DNA
expert on O.J. Simpson's defense team, would like you to know about
Monica Lewinsky's dress.
</P>
<P>
   First, that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, surely has
the results already. ``It should be clear to everybody,'' Scheck
said. ``They can analyze the dress very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, if there is evidence on the dress of a physical
encounter with President Clinton, then Starr has an ethical _ but
not legal _ obligation to disclose it now, before the president
testifies to the grand jury. ``Otherwise he's setting up a perjury
trap,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   And third, if there isn't evidence, then Starr should disclose
that, too. ``If there's no sperm on the dress,'' Scheck said,
``then the incendiary publicity that has resulted from this dress
is very unfair. This is not a game of `Gotcha!'''
</P>
<P>
   Scheck, 48, is one of the nation's most visible defense lawyers,
and still laboring to get out from under the bloody gloves of O.J.
Simpson. ``The problem with the Simpson case is that you become
like a 'toon,'' he said. In fact Scheck has been at plenty of
soap-opera trials with notorious clients. His cases could fill up a
season of ``The Practice,'' the ABC series about lawyers in Boston
that he watches all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck not only represented Simpson in his acquittal on murder
charges, but also helped defend Hedda Nussbaum from criminal
prosecution when her lover, Joel Steinberg, killed the 6-year-old
girl they reared together. His biggest failure, or Pyrrhic defeat,
was his defense of Louise Woodward, the British au pair who was
convicted of murdering her 8-month-old charge, but then freed after
a judge reduced her sentence to involuntary manslaughter. Now
Scheck is part of the team representing Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant who prosecutors say was tortured in a Brooklyn police
station.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when news of Ms. Lewinsky's dress was back on the
front pages, Scheck's phone began ringing again. So far the White
House hasn't called _ ``That would be a big story,'' Scheck said _
but the press, needing comment on DNA, is hungry.
</P>
<P>
   How many calls in all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten zillion,'' said Scheck, over breakfast on Monday of a
double espresso (he has two or three a day) at a 12th Street cafe
around the corner from Fifth Avenue and the Benjamin N. Cardozo
School of Law at Yeshiva University, where Scheck is a professor.
Absolutely no one would call Scheck press shy, but he did restrain
himself to the ``Today'' program, an appearance on CNN and comments
to two newspapers. ``See, I'm afraid of the yuck factor,'' he said.
``It upsets me to be discussing semen on a dress in the
continuation of a presidency that held great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheck is a rumpled, distracted and tenacious old lefty _ he was
gassed at the 1968 Democratic convention and still remembers the
order of the acts at Woodstock _ who looks as if he has just hacked
off his long hair and found a suit in the back of his closet.
</P>
<P>
   He said he became a lawyer because he wanted to change society,
but seems to have had doubts along the way. He is proudest of his
work on the Innocence Project, a shoestring program he runs at
Cardozo with another New York lawyer, Peter Neufeld, that uses DNA
evidence to reopen old cases. So far, the project has helped
exonerate 32 people wrongly convicted. Twelve were on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any justification for being a lawyer, this is
it,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Over his coffee, Scheck looked as if he needed to wake up, but
then talked steadily for two and a half hours. He lives in Brooklyn
Heights, is married to a psychiatric social worker, has two
children and often stays up until 1:30 a.m. reading and watching
television. ``I'm a glutton for mass culture,'' he said. He plays
golf at the Dyker Beach public course in Brooklyn. ``The 14th hole
used to have an abandoned car on it,'' he said. Friends describe
him as a regular guy but a pit bull in court.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck still defends his work on the Simpson team: ``I never
called anybody names,'' he said. He says he was not challenging the
legitimacy of DNA evidence in that case, but attacking the Los
Angeles Police Department's methods.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck's father managed Connie Francis and moved his family from
Forest Hills to the Upper East Side. Scheck first became interested
in the law while watching ``The Defenders,'' the 1960s television
series, and later interviewed the lawyer F. Lee Bailey for his
student newspaper at Horace Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the interview with Lee because Lee was dating Connie
Francis,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck was a war protester at Yale, where he was chosen to meet
with W. Averell Harriman, the chief envoy to the Paris peace talks.
``He took one look at me and turned off his hearing aid,'' Scheck
said. Scheck went to law school at the University of California at
Berkeley, then spent two years as a public defender in the South
Bronx. He has been at Cardozo since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Scheck wrote a movie script with two colleagues
about a public defender, a woman, in the South Bronx, which is
still kicking around Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I should have gotten out of the law
entirely,'' he said seriously, ``and dedicated myself to writing
screenplays.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WILL PATIENCE HELP HUNDLEY FIND GROOVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Todd Hundley deserves praise for merely being in
left field for the Mets on Tuesday night, as he has been for most
of the last four weeks. Hundley is still not himself, but he
returned with a surgically-repaired right elbow because the Mets
have a chance for the post-season and he is supposed to make them
more imposing. It was an unselfish move.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hundley hammered his first homer of the season in
Monday's 4-2 victory over the Cardinals and is gradually showing
more continuity from the left side of the plate, he conceded that
the search continues for the right rhythm, the right stroke and the
right results. Unfortunately for the Mets, Hundley's search is
colliding with their tense pursuit of a wild-card berth. That is
not the smoothest of marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley went 10 months without swinging a bat against a major
league pitcher after undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery, which
is why his body feels like it is March. Still, Hundley has not made
excuses for his scant production and has worked diligently to make
the awkward shift from catcher to left while Mike Piazza leases
shin guards in New York for a few months. But Hundley stares at the
mirror often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's tough not to be who I know I can be,'' Hundley
said. ``That's why you have to be patient. I just got to learn to
be patient with this change and this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also what the Mets feel they must do. Be patient and
wait for their best power hitter and most popular player to go
deep. Be patient and let the old Hundley emerge, as he did with one
ferocious swing Monday. But how long should their patience last?
</P>
<P>
   Despite his massive homer off Matt Morris' juicy fastball, there
have been and will continue to be frustrating times for the player
who has struck out 12 times in his last 17 plate appearances and 35
times in 83 at-bats after whiffing three times and slapping a
run-scoring single Tuesday night. Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, insists that Hundley is barely missing pitches and will
not judge him on a sliver of the season. There are many reasons for
the Mets to be patient, such as Hundley's record-setting 41 homers
in 1996, his 30 bombs last year, his $21 million contract, the
potential protection he could provide Piazza in the batting order
and the absence of a superior alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll eventually come and I'll get into a groove and I'll take
off from there,'' Hundley vowed Monday night. ``Go look at every
year, and I start off slow. I've come back so it's not much of a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not a concern today. What about in two weeks? How about a
month? The Mets do not want to be faced with the delicate questions
about a valuable player who has made a sacrifice, but they could
emerge. Hundley's memory is cloudy since he actually has more
career homers and a higher batting average in April than in any
other month. If he continues to labor, when does a .205 hitter
without consistent power behind Piazza become detrimental to a
post-season push?
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what he's going through, and I'm with him every
step of the way,'' said Valentine, which is exactly what a manager
is supposed to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to winning,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets'
general manager. ``We think Todd is part of that equation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine will have to review Hundley's status sometime.
With the leadoff man Tony Phillips as a new and important catalyst,
Jermaine Allensworth added for his speed and Butch Huskey (strained
left hamstring) eligible to be activated next Tuesday, Valentine
will have a crowded outfield that also includes Hundley, Brian
McRae and Lenny Harris. McRae and Phillips will likely play every
day. Hundley could merit similar status if he did more than whiff
11 times in 12 at-bats as a right-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think this was working out, I'd tell them,'' said
Hundley, who admitted he has struggled to adapt to what he called
the ``boring world'' of the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   When Valentine was asked whether Hundley would be part of an
outfield rotation once Huskey returned, he said: ``Probably. Let's
hope he keeps playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Hundley can make sure the Mets never have to address
these delicate questions. If Hundley bashes a few homers and drives
in a batch of runs in the next week and then remains consistent,
the Mets could avoid answers they do not want to ponder. So could
Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doubts can happen,'' Hundley said. ``That's what I'm
trying not to let happen. I'm not going to let it happen.'' &QL;

IN WAKE OF BOMBINGS, SEVERAL U.S. EMBASSIES SUSPEND OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. embassies have temporarily closed down
routine operations in response to threats made after the terrorist
attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, State Department
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition that they not be named,
said that the affected embassies included those in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia and Kampala, Uganda. The embassy in Mbabane, the capital
of the southern African nation of Swaziland, was evacuated for
several hours on Tuesday after a bomb threat. In West Africa, the
American Embassy in the Ivory Coast said it had cut back its
business hours while security was reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo office of the Agency for International Development was
also shuttered and its employees moved into the well-fortified
American Embassy in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they could not recall a similar instance in
recent years in which several American diplomatic installations,
which often get threats of violence, had suspended operations
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has announced a worldwide alert for embassies
and other diplomatic installations after the terrorist attacks last
week. The State Department and Congress have faced criticism since
the attacks that they failed to provide sufficient security for
embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the American diplomatic missions were not given the
upgraded security recommended by a independent commission after the
bombing of the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Bierut in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick F. Kennedy, the assistant secretary of state for
administration, said that the United States was ``not shutting down
embassies in a permanent sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that since the bombings last week, the Department and
its overseas posts had received between one dozen and two dozen
threats, including some considered ``copy cat'' threats of
terrorist attacks mimicking those in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not leaving,'' he said. ``We are taking, in effect, a
brief time-out in order to make the security adjustments that are
necessary to be responsive to a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition that he
not be identified, said that, ``where prudent, we're reducing
staff, we're moving from one building to another, we're reducing
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that Americans living or traveling abroad would
be able to obtain emergency services from all American embassies,
regardless of terrorist threats. ``You will always be able to get
an operator at the embassy and be connected to an a duty officer _
24 hours a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department refused to provide a formal list of the shuttered
embassies out of concern that it might be used by terrorist groups
to identify future targets for attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer not to go into identifying specific embassies,''
Kennedy said at a news conference. ``I think that just probably
leads to more copycat calls.'' The closings, he said, had occurred
in ``several regions'' of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embassies had been closed at the request of
ambassadors or, in their absence, the highest-ranking local
American diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said to our chiefs of mission that they are
responsible to protect the lives and safety of personnel
overseas,'' Kennedy said. ``If the chief of mission feels that
there is information available to him or her that says, `I must
take a particular step, including potentially briefly suspending
operations until adjustments to the security posture can be made,'
then we feel that is absolutely the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not describe the threats that had prompted the decision
to close some embassies, but he said all were being taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a call comes in or whatever it is,'' he said, ``each call
is analyzed and measured and then the post, the ambassador, the
regional security officer, the emergency action committee at the
post does what is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   An American official at the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur,
speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that the
embassy closed its iron gates on Tuesday for all but emergency
services for American citizens. The official said it would remain
closed on Wednesday in order for the embassy compound to be
``hardened'' against a possible terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks of Kuala Lumpur as a terrorist target, but we
want to take every precaution to keep our people safe,'' the
official said. ``I think you'll see additional barricades outside
the embassy later this week, some more barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that the American embassy in
Uganda, which borders both Kenya and Tanzania, was closed on
Tuesday but was expected to reopen on Wednesday with tightened
security measures in force.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, the offices of the Agency for International
Development were closed and its employees moved into the sprawling
compound of the U.S. Embassy, which is considered one of the
best-protected and most security-conscious in the Middle East,
State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has hindered the
conduct of American diplomacy not just in Kenya but across much of
East Africa. The embassy there effectively functioned as a regional
headquarters for the State Department and other American government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Sudan was shut down in
February 1996 in response to evidence that the Sudanese government
was harboring anti-American terrorist groups, the embassy staff was
moved to Nairobi, where they worked out of the now-shattered
embassy building. State Department officials said it was unclear
how diplomatic relations with Sudan would be conducted.

COMMENTARY: BROTHERS LAND ON THEIR SIDE OF THE DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shrieks and squeals filled the yellow school bus as
it bounced and bumped over the potholes along the factory-lined
streets of the East Williamsburg Industrial Park. They subsided,
only to be replaced by the bouncy beats of a hip-hop song on the
radio. Bear Mountain was still an hour away, but the children from
St. Barbara's Day Camp were getting psyched for the summer's final
outing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have bus music,'' one child shouted. ``She'll be
coming 'round the mountain when she comes. Yee-haw! She'll be
coming 'round the mountain when she comes. Yee-haw!''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Rick Dixon, the camp's director, savored the exuberant
scene, speaking up only a few times to quiet the group when the
yee-haws reached rodeo riot levels. He did so reluctantly, at that,
since he knew this was a big day for youngsters who feel cooped up
in their Bushwick neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a group like this, the more ordered and controlled it is,
the easier it is for us,'' Dixon said. ``At the same time, it's not
good for human relations. I'm continually struggling with that
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus trip was a breeze compared with the demands of his own
spiritual journey as a member of the Little Brothers of the Gospel,
a tiny Roman Catholic order that practices prayer and contemplation
in neighborhoods that are poor, violent and sometimes raucous.
Odder yet to some of their neighbors, their mission is not to build
schools or hospitals, but to offer simple acts of constant
companionship. With the income gap between the rich and poor
widening, Dixon said the hardest part of his mission was to
convince others that money may help, but it doesn't heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our consumer-oriented culture, there is so much pressure,''
he said. ``The only things kids see is this drive for money,
exploitative love and sex. It's almost like we've forgotten that
profound friendship is love, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and his confreres didn't need any studies to tell them how
rich and poor were diverging more and more. Good economic times
forced them to move to Bushwick two years ago from their longtime
home on the Lower East Side. Four of them had lived in an apartment
just steps off the Bowery on East Fourth Street until skid row gave
way to sidewalk cafes, pricey apartments and clubs of the moment.
Most of the poor families they had known over the years had
gradually been scattered to other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lower East Side is a better community because it attracts
tourists,'' Brother Giorgio Gonella said. ``But in recent years we
felt like guests and the neighborhood belonged to the people who
went to restaurants and theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   What had once been a struggling community, he said, began to
feel more and more like a no man's land of urban individualism.
What Bushwick lacked in material wealth, they discovered soon after
their arrival two years ago this month, was offset by what it had
in human bonds. And while their neighbors first thought they were
undercover policemen, little by little they became friends with the
people they saw each day sitting outside on stoops, chatting in
bodegas or worshiping at church.
</P>
<P>
   A previous generation once measured success by the mile,
equating it with how far they could move from the neighborhood.
Jackie Gracie, a day camp counselor, credits people like Dixon for
reminding others how they can work to improve the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to listen,'' Gracie said. ``He may be a brother,
but he's really like a brother from a different mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Little Brothers call the neighborhood a little village, even
if the curses that filter into the small chapel in their apartment
would make it appear that this was hardly a place for
contemplation. Quite the opposite, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When survival is a daily challenge, somehow there is something
beautifully naked,'' Gonella said. ``The dialogue always comes down
to the basic questions. Why life? Why death? Why poverty? The more
middle-class you are, the more expert you are in the art of hiding
from the real questions. Living in a poor neighborhood, your
contemplative life is enriched by the tragedies which oblige you to
be truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a richness of life that Gonella didn't see
being replaced any time soon by cafe society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't come here unless you belong here,'' he said. ``So
far, we don't have any yuppies moving here. They're all going to
Williamsburg.''

NEW JERSEY HAMLET JOLTED BY CHARGES THAT WOMAN RAN BROTHEL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ On Old Glen Road in this lush and
lolling hamlet, things have never been quite the same since Judith
Kelly Dempsey moved into the 20-room Georgian Colonial estate known
as Sunnymede in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were complaints about her decision to sell off some
of the property for new houses. Now, neighbors have a more
startling concern: police say Mrs. Dempsey had turned her mansion
into an all-hours bordello called An Afternoon Delight.
</P>
<P>
   At first, residents said they did not know what to think of the
car traffic and other activities at Sunnymede. Some thought Mrs.
Dempsey might have held frequent dinner parties. Others thought the
cars constantly entering and exiting her driveway were construction
workers doing renovations to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Weinlein, 71, who lives on Beechwood Drive, around the
corner from Sunnymede, said there had been rumors in the
neighborhood for months that Mrs. Dempsey was operating a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   She voiced her suspicious to a neighbor across the street.
``When I told her I thought it was a house of ill-repute,'' Ms.
Weinlein recalled, ``she said: `I think they are renting rooms. I
think its a boardinghouse.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-month investigation that was initiated because of
neighbors' complaints _ including reports that men demanding
massages were knocking on their doors _ a law enforcement team led
by the Morris County prosecutor's office raided the stately home
last Wednesday. They arrested and charged four women with
prostitution and three men with soliciting prostitution. Detectives
then set up a sting operation in the mansion, and arrested and
charged another 12 men with soliciting prostitution, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dempsey, a 46-year-old former Playboy bunny who had worked
as a real estate agent, owns the home in Morris Township with her
estranged husband, Robert. Neighbors said that Mrs. Dempsey did not
have children. And they said that although Mrs. Dempsey had
organized house tours in the township for charity, she was not
particularly friendly with other residents on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dempsey was on vacation in Las Vegas at the time of the
raid. When she returned to New Jersey on Monday, she turned herself
in to the Morris Township Police, and was arrested and charged with
promoting prostitution. She was released on her own recognizance,
as were the other 19 people arrested. She faces 3 to 5 years in
prison and a fine of up to $7,500 if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dempsey's lawyer, Michael R. Ascher, said on Tuesday that
his client was innocent. ``We are going to be entering a plea of
not guilty at the appropriate time,'' Ascher said. ``And I am sure
my client is going to be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Morris County prosecutor John B. Dangle said
Mrs. Dempsey had been charging customers $225 an hour, and that the
escort service advertised in the Daily Record, Morris County's main
newspaper, and had a phone number listed in the local Yellow Pages.
Prosecutors estimated that the brothel had been operating since
last November and that it had weekly revenues of about $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Tuesday, stunned residents of the area walked
or drove by to gawk at the mansion, which is located in a
neighborhood called Convent Station. Television camera crews and
reporters also spent much of the day on Old Glen Road. There was no
sign of Mrs. Dempsey's silver Jaguar, and a woman who responded to
knocks on the door referred all inquiries to Ascher.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Morristown area seemed abuzz Tuesday with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an atrocity,'' said one neighbor, who declined to give
her name. ``Everybody else is working hard and trying to raise
their children and to teach them good standards, and there is this
sleazy operation going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was not the first time that Mrs. Dempsey had angered
neighbors. They said Mrs. Dempsey had submitted a bid for the house
before it even went on the market, promising that she and her
husband would live there and would not parcel off pieces of the
property to developers. But they said that in recent years, several
acres of the property had been sub-divided into four lots, where
new houses were built.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-bedroom mansion is surrounded by sprawling lawns and
shrubbery. There is a wide second-floor balcony and a covered
veranda on the first floor overlooking an English garden. A
driveway leads to a three-bedroom carriage house that neighbors
said had been occupied by renters.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Suzanne Hamlin, said that Mrs. Dempsey would often
walk to a branch of First Morris Bank, just a block away from her
house, to make large deposits in cash. Officials at the bank
declined to comment on that report.

ANTHONY GENOVESI, LEGISLATOR, DIES AT 61 IN A ONE-CAR CRASH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony J. Genovesi, a state assemblyman and powerful
political force in Brooklyn Democratic politics for two decades,
was killed Monday night in a one-car accident about 50 miles north
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Genovesi, 61, and his 26-year-old daughter, Lara, were returning
from a family home in the Berkshires when the car, driven by his
daughter, lost control on a rainy highway in Dutchess County,
according to state police. Ms. Genovesi was slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Genovesi, a liberal politician whose political views were often
considered somewhat out of sync with his moderate-to-conservative
district in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, was known as a master
campaign technician.
</P>
<P>
   He was a bulky, gruff-talking figure who knew the ins and outs
of neighborhood and state politics better than, arguably, any of
his rivals of the day. Perhaps because he rarely agreed to talk to
reporters, he developed a reputation over the years for being an
enigmatic and influential political player. He was, in many ways, a
political strategist in the tradition of the Brooklyn politics of
old _ an insider who, unlike most politicians today, hated to see
his name in print.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early and staunch supporter of Ed Koch and helped to
turn out the vote in Brooklyn for each of his mayoral campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like an oak,'' Koch said Tuesday. ``You could count on
him. He treated his turf as though it was a small town. And he
would work with government, not for himself, but for those people,
like a Little League ball team that needed funding. I loved him
like a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Genovesi had become a strong political opponent
of Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic
chairman. Their most notable clash came two years ago, when the two
leaders backed competing candidates for Brooklyn surrogate. The
victory by Norman's candidate signaled to some the waning of
Genovesi's political prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Genovesi's death upends Brooklyn politics in that it
removes the most significant rival to Norman's leadership. It is
unclear who, if anybody, will emerge as the successor to lead that
opposition group to Norman's leadership.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State police said the accident in which Genovesi was killed
occurred about 11:40 p.m. Monday on State Route 22 in Pawling.
</P>
<P>
   Genovesi was a passenger in the 1988 Toyota driven by his
daughter. Ms. Genovesi told state troopers that water from a
passing vehicle had splashed onto the windshield of her car, which
then slid across the highway and struck a concrete retaining wall.
Sgt. Robert L. Hogan Jr. said the assemblyman was pronounced dead
at the scene. Ms. Genovesi was treated for a bruised hip and was
not hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Lara, he is survived by his wife of
38 years, Joyce; three sons, Joseph, of Rye, N.Y., and Anthony and
Mark, both of Brooklyn, and another daughter, Elena Sirota of
Brooklyn.

FAWCETT TESTIFIES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 FARRAH-FAWCETT-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ALEX ROTH 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Weeping on the witness stand, actress Farrah
Fawcett testified that an argument with her producer-boyfriend
about another woman led to angry words, threats, shattered windows
and a bloody cut to her head.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old former ``Charlie's Angels'' star was the first
witness against James Orr, 45, in the Santa Monica Superior Court
trial Tuesday. He faces misdemeanor battery charges in the January
scuffle outside his Bel-Air home Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me and we struggled, and I ended up on the ground,''
the actress said, adding that she begged Orr to stop, telling him,
``I think I'm really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in opening statements that Orr, a
writer-producer whose movie credits include ``Mr. Destiny'' and
``Three Men and a Baby,'' is guilty of domestic abuse for banging
the actress's head against the ground. Orr's attorney said the
fight was a case of mutual combat instigated by Fawcett -- and that
prosecutors charged Orr simply because he was the man.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett's testimony came after the City Attorney's Office gave
her immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The actress acknowledged Tuesday that she was the first to get
physical. As they drove home from a restaurant, she kicked him and
grabbed his face. Shortly before the scuffle, she kicked in a
window in the door of his house. A day after the scuffle, she
returned to the house with a baseball bat and broke some more
windows, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Orr's attorney, Donald R. Wager, accused prosecutors of taking a
``men bad, women good'' approach to domestic-violence prosecution.
He accused Fawcett of acting ``like a petulant child.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Del San Juan said prosecutors charged Orr
because he committed battery, while Fawcett's acts were simply
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision was to prosecute the more serious offenses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Orr faces a second battery charge against Fawcett for a scuffle
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett testified Tuesday that the January incident started with
an argument after she discovered a letter from another woman in a
garbage can outside Orr's house.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at dinner at the Belgian restaurant Mon Grenier in
suburban Encino, they argued when Orr said she took too long to
sign an autograph, Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Orr's house, Fawcett refused to get out of the car.
Later, carrying a baseball bat she'd found in the back seat, she
went into the house to pack some belongings. She said she took the
bat ``as a statement to say, Leave me alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguing continued inside the house, with Fawcett picking up
a fire poker and later threatening Orr with a drum-set stand, she
testified. Orr responded by jabbing her with a bar stool, bruising
her arm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she left his house, he called her a vulgar name and walked
back inside. She responded by kicking in a window pane in the door
and running away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Orr stormed out of the house and wrestled her to the ground,
banging her head against the pavement at least twice, she
testified, opening a wound on her head.
</P>
<P>
   She said she refused to go to the hospital for fear he'd be
arrested. But a day later, she and her personal assistant returned
to his house, she said. She also brought a bat. The two argued
again, and she began smashing his den windows. Orr's attorney said
she caused $5,000 worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The two continued dating after the fight and Fawcett threw Orr a
birthday party in March, but the couple broke up recently, Wager
said. Fawcett referred to him as ``Mr. Orr'' during her testimony
Tuesday.

HOLYFIELD TAKING A CUT EVEN BEFORE THE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of months ago at a charity golf tournament in New
Jersey, Evander Holyfield joked that he would probably have to pay
out of his own pocket to make a bout against Vaughn Bean, the
International Boxing Federation's No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Holyfield is taking a cut in his normal purse ($8
million to $10 million) and is tying his purse to a percentage of
the gate at the Georgia Dome for his title defense against Bean on
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, would not estimate the
champion's purse, but said it would be less than $3 million, even
if ticket sales were strong.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield isn't the only one to get an early start on the season
of giving. Showtime will broadcast the bout during a free preview
weekend, which means that more than 60 million homes in America
that have cable will have access to the fight at no cost. Could
this largess have been prompted by the unwillingness of casinos in
Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., as well as pay-per-view outlets,
to pay big fees for an unappealing fight?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could sell this fight to Atlantic City or Vegas today and
make more money, because the ticket prices would be higher,'' said
Jay Larkin, head of programming at Showtime, speaking by telephone
from a news conference in Atlanta on Tuesday to officially announce
the Holyfield-Bean bout. ``But Evander wanted this fight in Atlanta
and everyone, Showtime, Don King and Evander, stepped up to make it
happen. Evander agreed to tie his purse to the performance of the
gate. He's taking a huge financial risk, which flies in the face of
all the critics who say he's only out to make as much money as he
can for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time that Holyfield fought in Atlanta was in 1991. Not
many people turned out at the Omni to see him defeat Bert Cooper.
But since then Holyfield has cemented his claim on the heavyweight
championship by beating Mike Tyson twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome, which seats 76,000 for football, will
accommodate 40,000 seats for the fight. Many of the seats will be
priced between $35 and $25. The top price is $500.
</P>
<P>
   The parties involved will have to hustle to sell the bout in
Atlanta, which isn't noted as a boxing town.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Thomas said that King has come up with several
novel promotional ideas to push the fight in his hometown.
Holyfield will train for two weeks in Houston and spend the final
four weeks leading up to the fight training at two different gyms
in Atlanta. ``It's a much different task getting 40,000 people to
come out in Atlanta than it is to get 12,000 gamblers to come to a
fight in Las Vegas,'' Thomas said. &QL;

WORLD SERIES' FIRST DOUBLE: BOX SEAT PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deciding that World Series tickets were vastly undervalued,
Major League Baseball has doubled the price of box seats for its
premier event, from $75 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   The executive council took that step at a meeting last June,
commissioner Bud Selig said Tuesday, but the development was never
announced and came to light only this week when teams sent letters
to season-ticket holders telling them of post-season prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the sensitivity of it and I share those
concerns,'' Selig said by telephone from Milwaukee. ``But I think
this is the right thing to do. Frankly, our own people have been
critical that we were undervaluing the tickets for our premier
event. The discussion was spirited though in the end unanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   The top price of $150 for a World Series game is still
considerably less than the top prices for other championship
events.
</P>
<P>
   The top ticket price for last January's Super Bowl was $350,
with the rest at $275. The price has not been set for the next
Super Bowl. For the Stanley Cup finals, the Washington Capitals
charged $250 for their best seats; the Detroit Red Wings, $200. The
Chicago Bulls had 100 courtside seats available for $475 each for
the National Basketball Association finals, but the top price for
other seats was $90. The Utah Jazz had a top regular price of $113
and had five rows of seats at courtside available at $180 to $300
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of discussion comparing our price with the prices
of the best seats at other championship events,'' Selig said. ``My
father always used to say nothing is good or bad except by
comparison. So when you look at $150 for a World Series box seat,
it's still a lot less than the top ticket for the other events.''
</P>
<P>
   Clubs can charge even more than $150 for premium World Series
seats. The Yankees, for example, will have club box seats with
waitress service for $300 each. Those seats will cost $150 for the
league championship series and $100 for the division series.
</P>
<P>
   In parks where clubs have two levels of box seats, lower and
upper, they may charge $120 instead of $150 for the upper boxes.
The price of reserved seats was raised from $50 to $100, although
upper reserved can be $85. General admission tickets will cost $40,
up from $30 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Price increases are more moderate for the series leading to the
World Series. For the league championship series, box seats are
going from $50 to $60, reserved seats from $35 to $45 and general
admission from $25 to $30. For the division series, clubs can set
prices within a range of $17.50 to $30, up from a range of $17.50
to $25 last year.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig said: ``I would
always agonize over ticket increases, even $1. But in the end, you
can make a very compelling case for the World Series, considering
the undervaluing and comparison with other events.''

LOS ANGELES COUNCIL FEELS HEAT FOR OPPOSING BILINGUAL EDUCATION
MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICK MCGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Stung by a backlash of criticism that the Los
Angeles City Council is fighting the will of the voters, Councilman
Richard Alatorre said that he plans to pay the city's expense for
joining a lawsuit against Proposition 227, the voter-approved
measure virtually ending bilingual education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 11-3 last week to file a ``friend of the
court'' brief to support a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups
seeking to overturn the state ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   School districts have started implementing the law, which was
approved by more than 60 percent of voters statewide, as well as a
majority of Los Angeles voters, in the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   Alatorre said Tuesday some of his colleagues have taken heat
from constituents for challenging the measure, so he will use his
political officeholder account to reimburse the City Attorney's
Office for the $1,000 expense of drafting and filing the court
brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it so people won't be able to say it's costing the
city taxpayers money,'' he said. ``That's all they've been raising
_ the money it's going to take to fight this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatorre also said he was planning a news conference for
Wednesday with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund and others who filed the lawsuit to better make the case for
legal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Council members Mike Feuer, Laura Chick, Joel Wachs, John
Ferraro and Ruth Galanter have received dozens of calls and letters
of criticism for their votes to support the legal challenge to
Proposition 227. The five council members supported the challenge
even though the majority of voters in their districts favored the
ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer received nearly 100 phone calls from constituents, about
80 percent of whom opposed his position, said Jane Blumenfeld, his
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the callers thought the council should not have
second-guessed the voters,'' Blumenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer stood by his vote Tuesday, saying Proposition 227 ``calls
into question fundamental constitutional principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The councilman said he was convinced by the City Attorney
Office's position that the measure violates the equal-protection
clause of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten some (critical letters), but ultimately the
question turns on the significance of the constitutional issues at
stake,'' said Feuer, an attorney. ``There are certainly times when
it's appropriate for the city to participate in litigation
regarding a voter-approved initiative _ if, for example, the voters
had approved a prohibition on certain forms of religious
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatorre also is unmoved by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters I have seen in the newspaper _ it's unfortunate
that they don't understand that there is more to the issue,'' he
said. ``There are constitutional issues that transcend whether you
like something or not. It's about guaranteeing the rights of all
children.''
</P>
<P>
   However, residents upset with the council's action said they are
not appeased by Alatorre's offer to pay the city's legal expenses
with political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I vote for something which I feel is very important to
me, and the majority votes, and you people vote against it, it's
like (you think) we don't know what we're doing,'' Johnny Rotella
told the City Council at its meeting Tuesday. ``It's an insult to
me and all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotella said educational policies are not the council's concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your job to get involved with the educational
system,'' he said. ``You have other things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nassany one of many residents who wrote letters to the
editor of the Daily News criticizing the council action, said
Alatorre's offer to foot the bill for the legal challenge does not
lessen her anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy this,'' Nassany said. ``I'm furious with him.
Here's a man who is saying he's better informed than the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatorre said Los Angeles, as a major city, has a responsibility
to play a role in clarifying the constitutional issues involved in
Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional issue, and I understand that,'' he said.
``The reasons for us doing it are there are constitutional issues
that have to be protected,'' he said.

 &HT;    Democrats pick Taylor; Day leads GOP bid for lieutenant
 &HT;    By Charmagne Helton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State Sen. Mary Margaret Oliver wanted to be Georgia's
first female lieutenant governor. But that dream seems not to be
coming true this year.
</P>
<P>
   With 74 percent of precincts reporting statewide Tuesday, Oliver
trailed fellow state Sen. Mark Taylor of Albany by about 50,000
votes for the Democratic nomination. His lead appeared too great to
overcome even with DeKalb and Fulton county precincts _ both
considered Oliver strongholds _ still out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press called the race for Taylor around 9:15
p.m., but Oliver's supporters were still hoping for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not ready to concede,'' campaign consultant Angelo
Fuster said around 9:30 p.m. ``We're waiting on the metro
counties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race for lieutenant governor, Clint Day was
leading Mitch Skandalakis, 54 percent to 46 percent, with
three-fourths of precincts reporting statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press also gave early victories in two other
statewide races. Michael Thurmond beat Steve Henson in the race for
the Democratic nomination for labor commissioner, and David Ralston
defeated Kip Klein for the Republican nomination for attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   In a runoff election in the middle of August with few
high-profile contested races, only the most loyal voters were
expected to return to the polls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, that often means Christian conservatives. For
the Democrats, that normally means traditional liberals. Knowing
this, the candidates for lieutenant governor tried to appeal to
those voter bases.
</P>
<P>
   Day and Skandalakis each called himself the ``true
conservative'' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race has been entirely about trust and truth,'' said Day.
``We have a conservative record.''
</P>
<P>
   Day, a 39-year-old former state senator, sought to tarnish any
appeal to conservatives Skandalakis might have by running TV
commercials that reminded voters the Fulton County Commission
chairman created a gay and lesbian task force.
</P>
<P>
   Day also accused Skandalakis of waffling on abortion, trying to
bring casino gambling to Georgia and paying for phone calls to
strippers during a 1994 trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis, 40, appeared to be the GOP front-runner before
Tuesday's runoff. He accused Day, a millionaire, of failing to pay
his taxes and of desecrating Native American burial grounds. Citing
an endorsement by a gay-oriented newspaper, Skandalakis said Day,
not he, was the gay community's favored candidate. In the
Democratic runoff, Taylor called Oliver soft on crime, but he
admitted early on in the campaign to past cocaine use. He
apologized, calling it a ``youthful indiscretion,'' and insisted he
hadn't used the illegal drug since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver ran TV commercials and distributed mailings to remind
voters of her opponent's drug use.

WIMBLEDON FINAL REJUVENATES TAUZIAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Nathalie Tauziat doesn't mind when an
entire country's hopes fall on her. ``Every time I play, I play for
France and for myself,'' she said. ``It does not put extra pressure
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   So this year, when Tauziat became the first Frenchwoman since
Suzanne Lenglen in 1925 to play in the Wimbledon final, it did not
faze her. She lost to Jana Novotna, but she remains a fan favorite
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Her showing at Wimbledon brought her the most attention of her
career, even though she has been on the women's tour for 15 years
and was ranked as high as 11th in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, ranked 13th, continues to work off her June success at
Wimbledon. She beat Chanda Rubin 6-4, 7-5 on Tuesday to advance in
the Acura Classic, where she will meet doubles partner and fellow
countrywoman Alexandra Fusai today in the second round. Though
Tauziat might be more recognizable since Wimbledon, the resident of
Bayonne, France, said she is ``still the same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, 30, is the oldest player here who did not play
qualifying matches. As No. 5, she is the highest-seeded player to
have played thus far at Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back-to-back parties?: Iva Majoli turned 21 on Tuesday and
she celebrated with friends in Santa Monica at night. It helped
that she posted a 1-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Rita Grande earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now 20th-ranked Majoli will meet top-seeded Martina Hingis today
in the second round, hoping for an upset. Said Majoli, ``If I win,
I'm sure I'm going to have another party.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Venus withdraws, again: Venus Williams, who has tendinitis in
her left knee, has withdrawn from the tournament. She had planned
to play doubles with her sister, Serena, but is dropping out of a
second straight event. Last week at the Toshiba Classic in La
Costa, Williams withdrew during a quarterfinal match against Mary
Pierce while trailing 4-0 in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stars in action: The match between top-seeded Hingis and
Majoli should be the highlight of today's action. Third-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario plays Ai Sugiyama, and fourth-seeded Monica
Seles meets Barbara Paulus.

DECISION LETS AIR OUT OF LOS ANGELES' BAN ON GAS-POWERED LEAF
BLOWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rendering Los Angeles' leaf-blower ban
essentially useless, the City Attorney's Office said that it won't
prosecute gardeners who say they fuel their machines with methanol,
rather than gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and police said they will rely upon sworn
declarations from gardeners that they are using methanol and will
not check the fuel or machines.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said Tuesday she will ask her
colleagues as soon as next week to close the methanol loophole,
which was used successfully to beat defeat tickets in three court
cases recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts' rulings are pretty solid, so we need to look at
the law _ and change the law,'' said Miscikowski, who pushed for
the ban that won final approval on a 9-6 vote in January.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the council amends the law, a bill now
pending in the California Legislature could remove Los Angeles'
ability to impose such a ban unless approved by a citywide vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 14, authored by Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles,
also would regulate blowers in terms of noise, not fuel type.
Polanco's chief aide, Bill Mabie, predicts that the bill will win
Assembly approval within three weeks and then will garner the
Senate's backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans support it because they look at these ordinances
as government intrusion on essentially small-business people,''
Mabie said. ``The Democrats tend to support it because of the issue
of workers' (rights) to use their tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners hailed Tuesday's concession by the City Attorney's
Office as a key victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic and excited that we triumphed in the
courts,'' said Alvaro Huerta, secretary general of the Association
of Latin American Gardeners of Los Angeles, which has a membership
of more than 1,000 people citywide.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the City Attorney's Office said it would dismiss a
ticket against a gardener after three defeats in court in which
tickets were overturned on the basis of the fuel used.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said a gardener who is cited from now on for using a
leaf blower can avoid prosecution by providing a sworn declaration
as to the type of fuel used and a declaration from the person who
modified the machine to run on methanol.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Thomas, chief of the City Attorney's Criminal Division,
said that the courts have made it impossible for his office to
prosecute the leaf-blower ban when gardeners claim to use methanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us in a pretty tough position given the courts'
rulings on the ordinance,'' Thomas said. ``We can't just ignore
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, Municipal Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White threw
out $270 tickets against two gardeners because they had used
methanol, which is not covered by the city law.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and police said they have no intention of
verifying whether the gardeners' leaf blower actually was using
methanol. But to guard against fraud, Thomas said his office plans
to review each contested ticket when the methanol exemption is
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But most claims will be accepted on face value as a show of good
faith to the Los Angeles law firm, Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro, that
has been representing the gardeners for free in leaf-blower cases,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury attorney Kimberly Buffington said her office had four
remaining leaf-blower tickets that will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge victory,'' Buffington said.
</P>
<P>
   The council could begin debating Miscikowski's amendment as soon
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until the law changes, Miscikowski said the ban on
gasoline-powered leaf blowers will be difficult for police and
inspectors to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to discern by smell or look between gas and
methanol so a person on the street wouldn't know it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez, who opposed the ban, said he has not
decided whether to support the amendment because he believes the
law specifically was written to outlaw gasoline-powered blowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep referring to this as a loophole when the reality
is we were outlawing gasoline leaf blowers,'' Hernandez said. ``We
never discussed the type of fuel, only the pollutants.''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of the ban, West Los Angeles attorney Jack Allen of
the Coalition to Ban Leafblowers, said the City Attorney's Office
should not have conceded the methanol exemption so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should fight it in court,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners association President Adrian Alvarez said his group
will work to find other loopholes. ``We're not going back to brooms
and rakes, so we're going to continue to protest and find legal
challenges to the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city should simply ban blowers that use internal-combustion
engines, lest the gardeners find another way around the law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The association believes Polanco's bill may be the best
compromise and members went to Sacramento last week to lobby
lawmakers for support.

melted under the relentless wheedling of a material child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nagging works,'' said Cheryl Idell of Los Angeles-based
Western International Media, which commissioned the study.
</P>
<P>
   As many as four of every 10 sales of popular consumer products,
such as jeans and hamburgers, are the result of effective nagging,
said Idell, who believes the survey is the first to examine the
effectiveness of this irritating habit of young children and
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, 41 percent of trips to
entertainment-based destinations are the result of _ you guessed it
_ nagging.
</P>
<P>
   So are one of three trips to fast-food restaurants and sales at
apparel shops. Three of 10 home video sales are nag-induced, as is
one in five trips to amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Kern, a mother of two, says she isn't nearly the pushover
the survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every 20 things they ask for that they don't need, they
get one,'' Kern said, standing in the cookie aisle at a Ralphs
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Isn't that a box of cookies in Kern's
shopping cart?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And they got there because of some nagging by her daughter,
Caitlyn, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Kern's son, Justin, 15, has a bit more refined taste. His
nagging resulted in the purchase of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and
basil, Kern said, smiling adoringly at her son.
</P>
<P>
   Quinta, 29, and Gerald Nixon, 30, said they, too, tend to give
in to nagging _ even if not directly.
</P>
<P>
   Quan Nixon, 8, nagged Tuesday for a ``Dennis the Menace'' video
at Blockbuster, but he didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   But later, his mother predicted, she and her husband probably
would take the boy to Ralphs and let him pick out something
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we feel guilty,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: DRIFTING TO A NEW IRAQ POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   These first days of August have brought a disquieting retreat by
the Clinton administration on Iraq. Without saying as much, the
White House seems on the verge of altering seven years of U.S.
policy by letting Saddam Hussein slip free of the international
effort to prevent him from developing a new arsenal of biological
and chemical weapons. That would be a grave mistake.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change of tone and direction have been striking in the week
since Saddam ended Iraqi cooperation with United Nations weapons
inspectors, breaking the agreement he reached earlier this year
with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Instead of warning Saddam
that his resistance was no more acceptable now than it was before,
and would be met with military force if necessary, the
administration has deliberately downplayed the defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, for his part, has urged the Security Council to review
the inspection system and accompanying economic sanctions that have
been in place since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of equivocating performance Saddam has
been hoping to provoke. A relaxation of sanctions and reliance on
less intrusive inspections might be in order if Iraq had complied
with the Security Council requirement that it dismantle all weapons
of mass destruction and make no effort to rebuild them. But Iraq
has resisted inspection at every turn, leaving inspectors convinced
it retains the ambition and means to develop biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to attack his
neighbors, even his countrymen. Allowing him to replenish his
stockpile of biological and chemical weapons would threaten the
Persian Gulf region and its oilfields, as well as Israel. Few
developments would so directly endanger U.S. security interests.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no illusions in Washington about the difficulty
of keeping Saddam in check. The Security Council is wobbly, with
Russia and France eager to ease inspections and sanctions. Annan's
resolve seems in doubt. Many Americans question the need to
maintain pressure on Baghdad and would oppose the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat is too great to give ground to Saddam. The cost
to the world and to the United States of dealing with a belligerent
Iraq armed with biological weapons would be far greater than the
cost of preventing Baghdad from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   Without a clear and consistent message from Washington that it
is prepared to enforce the inspection system, Iraq's weapons
programs cannot be reliably contained. Unless Annan insists that
Baghdad fully honor its agreement with him, increasingly bold Iraqi
challenges to U.N. authority are certain to come.

EDITORIAL: A BUDGET BALANCE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   With Congress in recess, Washington is filled with threats of
another government shutdown over the budget in October. Underneath
the surface, however, a fragile majority of moderate Democrats and
Republicans is emerging in both the Senate and House that could set
a less confrontational tone when lawmakers return in September. On
budget issues, moderate Republicans are warning sensibly against
big new tax cuts and spending reductions in essential areas. It
would be healthy for Republican leaders to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the Shays-Meehan campaign finance legislation owed
much to independent-minded Republicans in the House this year. In
that vote, more than 60 Republicans ignored Speaker Newt Gingrich
and voted with the Democrats. An equally large bloc of Republican
moderates voted with House Democrats recently to save the National
Endowment for the Arts and defeat a gay-bashing amendment pushed by
social and religious conservatives. Moderates in the Senate,
especially veterans of past budget battles like Pete Domenici and
William Roth, refuse to go along with the big tax cuts advocated by
the budget-cutters in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Fights between Republican moderates and conservatives have so
tied up the budget this year that none of the 13 appropriations
bills financing the government after the end of September have been
passed by both houses of Congress and sent to President Clinton.
Congressional Republicans could not even agree on an overall budget
resolution. Meanwhile, moderates in the Senate support full funding
for the International Monetary Fund to help it deal with the Asian
economic collapse. House conservatives seem more in the thrall of
the isolationism of Dick Armey, who recently commented: ``I've been
to Europe once. I don't have to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House may be in crisis but can count on the country
rallying against another budget siege by Republicans, shutting down
the government as they did in 1995. Last week, when some House
Republicans were saying that this time they could reap political
gains from a shutdown, it was Gingrich's turn to cringe. The title
of his recent book, after all, is ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way.''
The paradox of this moment is that while the conservatives brought
Gingrich to power, the moderates are the ones who learned the
lessons. &QL;

ON TECHNOLOGY/DAVID EINSTEIN  
 APPLE'S IMAC _ THE NEW VW BEETLE OF COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ON TECHNOLOGY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Most tech stocks took a tumble yesterday, but not Apple Computer.
The Cupertino company blithely ignored the market's sell-off,
gaining $1.06 to close at a 52-week high of $39.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clearly, Steve Jobs, Apple's interim CEO for life, is onto
something with the $1,299 iMac, which ships this Saturday. He's hit
a chord just as he did in 1984, when the first Macintosh captured
the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing is that he's doing it without a technological
breakthrough like the graphical interface that the original Mac
introduced to the world. In fact, the iMac is basically just a Mac
honed by improvements you'd expect after 18 years, with a built-in
monitor and a seductive translucent case that would look right at
home in Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac appeals to the average person, who is basically
befuddled by technology and just wants a computer that's easy to
use. Forget the megahertzes and the gigabytes, just get me on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the market right now is ripe for a machine like the
iMac. With entry-level PC prices well below $1,000, computers have
entered the realm of commodity appliances such as televisions and
stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody care how many watts a stereo amplifier has? Or how
many lines of resolution there are on a TV? No. You just plug the
things in and enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is lucky in a way. It can't compete on price/performance
with the Compaqs and Dells of the world. But it doesn't have to.
Nobody needs a 400 MHz Pentium II or an 8 gig hard drive. The
technology inside the iMac is more than adequate for almost
anything a normal person would do with a computer, including word
processing, desktop publishing or, most importantly, getting
online.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet seems to have become the driving motivation
for purchases of new computers. And if what you really want is to
surf the Web and do e-mail, the iMac is a match for any PC, no
matter how powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The new Apple is a little ahead of its time, equipped as it is
only with USB ports for connecting printers, scanners and such. It
probably won't be until late this year that USB-compatible devices
start hitting the market en masse. Meanwhile, a few scanners, mice,
keyboards and modems are available with USB connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, all PC-makers will convert to USB, phasing
out serial and parallel ports that have confused consumers for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' decision not to put a floppy disk drive in the iMac also
shows his predisposition toward future-tech. As recordable CD-ROM
drives and DVDs catch on, floppies probably will go the way of the
dinosaur. Still, it would have cost Apple just a few bucks to put a
floppy drive in the iMac and give users a convenient way to back up
and exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   From the advance rumblings, it seems certain that iMacs will be
gobbled up by Apple users who can't afford the faster, more
expensive G3 Macs. The big question is, will the new computer also
appeal to first-time PC buyers who might otherwise go for a cheap
Compaq or HP machine?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it might. One gets the feeling that other PC-makers
consider entry-level systems as step-children that cower in the
shadow of the high-end, $2,500 screamers. Apple, on other hand, has
imbued the iMac with a hip personality all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it hurt that the iMac comes along at a time when
Americans are happily embracing post-modernistic designs. If
Volkswagen can sell a truckload of the revivified Beetle, Apple
should find a wide market for the iMac.

 BEHIND THE HIGH-LEVEL DEPARTURES AT HAMBRECHT &AMP; QUIST 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Time to batten down the hatches at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist?
<TEXT>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully trying to sell the niche investment bank to
a larger suitor _ in contrast to its Bay Area brethren Robertson
Stephens and Montgomery Securities _ H&AMP;Q is suffering from some
defections and dismissals among its research ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The highest profile departure is that of Bruce Lupatkin,
director of the bank's research department. Sources close to the
company say that Lupatkin was shown the door after a number of
highly regarded analysts jumped ship. The reason: He failed to
provide adequate leadership and direction to the department, and
the quality of the research sometimes suffered, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q chief executive Dan Case confirmed that Lupatkin had left
the company, but he would not expound on the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an exceptional professional and we wish him well,''
Case says.
</P>
<P>
   At least three researchers have bailed from H&AMP;Q, including
Shelly Hale Young and Jean-Michele Valet _ who were both
well-respected consumer product analysts, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the revolving door suggests that H&AMP;Q might be
back in play. Because if it were bought by a larger brokerage or
major financial institution, the research department would likely
be the first to go.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the company say buyout talks haven't
rekindled. If anything, the opposite is true. The window for a
takeover of H&AMP;Q may have shut, and management is trying to preserve
its franchise as a nimble underwriter of technology companies,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q's stock is trading below $30, down substantially from the
low $40s when takeover talk ran rampant late last year. Case would
not comment on speculation regarding future ownership of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But sources say Case is telling the troops that the boutique
investment bank is prepared to stand alone now that Robby Stephens
and Montgomery Securities have been swallowed by BankBoston and
NationsBanc respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in his position, I would say the same thing,'' says
one hedge fund manager, who watches the company closely.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Net Madness
</P>
<P>
   The latest installment of Internet madness opened with a bang,
but it wasn't without its moments of high drama.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was not the ideal day for GeoCities of Santa Monica to
go public as the stock market took on water like an ocean liner
pierced by an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet portal company kept a stiff upper lip during
its first day of trading, despite the Dow Jones industrial average
sinking more than 250 points at one point. (The Dow made a
late-inning rally to close only 112 points down at the bell).
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, GeoCities more than doubled its initial offering
price of $17 to end the day at $37.31. The company, which generates
Net traffic by letting users set up free Web sites, sold 4.75
million shares, or a 15 percent stake. Its market cap is now a
whopping $1.1 billion. The initial filing with the Securities and
Exchange commission pegged the initial price range at $12 to $14.
Goldman Sachs was the lead underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was going to hell in a hand basket, and that's a
very difficult market (in which) to float a new offering,'' says
Ryan Jacob, portfolio manager for the Internet Fund, a $3.5 million
no-load fund based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, doubling the price in your first day isn't too
shabby.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabby or not, it wasn't the kind of off-the-charts performance
that many portal-stock fans expected. Jacob surmises that if the
IPO had been priced on a less-tumultuous day, its opening price
(which was around $20) would have been significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with that thinking based on the unearthly
performances of other Internet offerings launched earlier this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that GeoCities saw support for its shares
build throughout the day was testimony to how strongly (rightly or
wrongly) Internet stock zealots felt about the company _ despite
the weird and wacky vacillations of the current market, says Jacob,
also research director for the IPO Value Monitor, an institutional
service owned by Horizon Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Despite GeoCities's noble showing in the face of
market-adversity, there were some unhappy campers out there.
</P>
<P>
   One way to play the GeoCities IPO was to buy shares in one of
its largest shareholders, CMG Information Services (CMGI) of
Andover, Md.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI owns 9.8 million shares of GeoCities, or a 31 percent
stake. Its shares soared last week in anticipation of yesterday's
GeoCities IPO, but those same shares plunged $5 to $74.25 in the
wake of yesterday's offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit of a letdown for CMGI shareholders,'' says
Jacob.

LYCOS ADDS WHOWHERE WEB DIRECTORY  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - LYCOS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Upping the ante in an increasingly crowded Internet portal market,
Lycos Inc. yesterday said it will snap up Mountain View-based
online directory WhoWhere Inc. for $133 million in stock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not to be outmaneuvered, rival Infoseek laid out $17 million in
company shares for Quando Inc., a maker of ``virtual databases''
allowing Net surfers to comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   The buyouts are the latest machinations among online and
mainstream media companies vying to create so-called portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   They believe the all-in-one sites _ which are crammed with
e-mail, chat rooms, e-commerce features, breaking news and search
engines _ are the most efficient way to hook Web users and generate
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any serious Web site needs to offer services that make
people's lives easier for basic activities like communications and
shopping,'' Infoseek CEO Harry Motro said. ``If you don't, you
won't be around long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a land grab,'' said Jan Horsfall, Lycos vice president of
marketing. ``You have to add as much distinct content as you
possibly can to differentiate your (portal).''
</P>
<P>
   Internet insiders said the more significant deal is Lycos'
acquisition of WhoWhere, a provider of e-mail and home-age
technology, yellow-page and white-page listings, classified ads and
other information on the Web. The company's MailCity e-mail service
has 9.3 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Observers consider the acquisition significant to the fortunes
of 3-year-old Lycos in the portal wars because it is trailing
Infoseek, Yahoo, Excite, AOL and Netscape in both viewership and ad
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are comparing the portal market to the television
industry, where only five or seven major networks will survive,''
said Abhishek Gami of William Blair &AMP; Co. LLC in Chicago, who
recommends Lycos stock. ``In the process, every independent company
will be bought out by one of the big boys. This is an extremely
rough space to compete in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gami noted that of the 15 most popular Internet sites listed by
online pollster Media Metrix, Lycos is among the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, like Amazon.com and other Internet companies, has been
using its stock to buy companies since its shares more than tripled
in the past year. Lycos closed at $63.56 yesterday, down $4.38.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Earlier this year, the Waltham, Mass., company purchased
Tripod Inc., a free home-page service, and WiseWire Corp., whose
software allows Internet users to make customized searches.
</P>
<P>
   WhoWhere, which is backed by the Rockefeller family's venture
capital arm VenRock, will operate as the West Coast division of
Lycos.

ADOBE CLEANS HOUSE, PLANS SHUFFLE, LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ADOBE   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Warning of an expected earnings drop, Adobe Systems yesterday
announced a management shakeup and plans to lay off up to 10
percent of its worldwide workforce.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's second-largest maker of PC software, known for
graphics and desktop publishing programs such as Adobe Photoshop,
Illustrator and PageMaker, said it will save $50 million to $60
million per year in part by laying off 240 to 300 full-time
employees and contractors. Adobe also plans to streamline
operations and eliminate three senior vice president positions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the San Jose-based company said net income for the
third quarter, which ends August 28, ``may approach break-even or a
loss'' after a one-time restructuring charge, compared with net
income of $53.4 million in the third quarter of 1997. Previously,
analysts surveyed by First Call had forecast a third-quarter profit
of 52 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe said third-quarter revenues are expected to be between
$220 million and $225 million, down from $230 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe's earnings projections ``are disappointing,'' company
President Charles Geschke said in an interview. ``It was altogether
clear we had to do some restructuring on the spending side to get
our current numbers under control and so we had headroom to invest
in new product opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   All but 25 of the layoffs will be full-time employees and will
include an undetermined number of vice president and other
management positions.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has about 3,000 employees and contractors worldwide, with
about 1,500 in the Bay Area, said spokeswoman Wink Grelis. The
layoffs are expected to be completed by the end of the third
quarter, but Adobe has not disclosed which jobs will be cut, Grelis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were encouraged that the restructuring puts
Geschke and CEO John Warnock, two former Xerox PARC researchers who
founded Adobe, in more-direct control of the firm's future product
development and marketing plans. However, Adobe still has to prove
that it can deliver new products and generate more revenue,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great franchise, but unfortunately, they haven't
been able to show revenue growth,'' said Christopher Galvin, an
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, which has rated Adobe stock a hold
for the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of execution,'' Galvin said. ``Adobe has this
great opportunity to turn their leadership position in the print
marketplace into the Web world, but they're still working on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Rossi of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens said Adobe
still seems to be moving too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about fast-moving markets like the Internet
and enterprise applications for document management,'' Rossi said.
``The idea is to get the products out there and start marketing. I
want to hear more urgency in the voices of the people in this
company. It's almost a do-or-die period for Adobe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the restructuring, three senior executives
resigned: P. Jackson Bell, chief administrative officer and
executive vice president; Robert Roblin, executive vice president
for marketing; and Ross Bott, executive vice president in charge of
the products division. Their positions were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In their places, Bruce Chizen, head of Adobe's Graphics Products
division and a former Claris Corp. executive, was promoted to
executive vice president for worldwide products and marketing.
Chizen will report directly to Warnock.
</P>
<P>

BAY AREA FIRMS GRAB BIGGEST SHARE OF VENTURE CAPITAL IN
2ND  QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - VENTURE   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Despite a volatile stock market, institutional investors continued
to pour money into high-tech and other startups during the past
quarter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Venture capital firms invested $1.1 billion in 168 Bay Area
companies in the three months ending June 30. That was up from $773
million invested in 119 local companies in the first quarter,
according to VentureOne, a San Francisco research firm. The total
also was higher than the $1 billion poured into 161 companies
during the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Three quarters of the companies that received venture capital
commitments in the past quarter were information technology firms.
But the one that received the most is in health care. Vascular
Systems, founded four years ago in Mountain View to develop
intravenous drugs to prevent and treat life-threatening blood
clots, raised $21.55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that won financing in the past quarter include:
</P>
<P>
   _Whisper Communications. The Sunnyvale maker of automated
meter-reading systems quietly raised $20 million to expand
production of its pager-sized radio device that fits in an
electric, gas or water meter.
</P>
<P>
   The device can transmit meter readings every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The technology not only spares utilities the cost of sending out
workers to read meters, but it can take readings every 15 minutes.
This would allow utilities to price energy for peak and nonpeak
periods just as telephone and cellular phone companies now price
their services.
</P>
<P>
   Whisper CEO Mick Mullagh says his company's system allows
two-way communication, unlike competing products from public
companies CellNet and Itron.
</P>
<P>
   If radio transmission doesn't go through the first time,
Whisper's technology could tell the meter to store the information
and resend it later. Whisper has several contracts, including one
to supply meter-reading components for 1.1 million customers served
by Illinois Power.
</P>
<P>
   As part of pricing strategies to reduce peak demand and
utilities' investments in new power plants, Mullagh says electric
utilities could adjust home thermostats (with the owner's
permission) to cut energy use and consumer bills during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   _Quokka Sports. The San Francisco company, which covers
international sporting events online, raised more than $14 million.
Started two years ago and named for an Australian marsupial, the
company covered the nine-month, round-the-world Whitbread yacht
race, providing a stream of digital photos, instrument readings,
e-mails and other information.
</P>
<P>
   The company specializes in what CEO Alan Ramadan calls ``total
sports immersion coverage.'' By wiring racers, climbers and other
athletes in the same way NASA tracks astronauts, Quokka intends to
``transform spectators into participants.''
</P>
<P>
   _allapartments.com. This year-old San Francisco company provides
more than 5 million online listings of rental units in over 4,000
U.S. cities. It provides photos and floor plans as well as other
information about schools, insurance, crime rates and career
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started by Marcus &AMP; Millichap Real Estate
Investment Brokerage and raised $10 million in second-round
financing from three venture capital firms and Netscape CEO Jim
Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more companies are integrating electronic commerce
strategies in their business plans,'' said VentureOne research
director Jean Yaremchuk.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, venture firms invested $3.2 billion in 467 companies
during the past quarter. As usual, Bay Area companies were the main
magnet, attracting 34 percent of all the dollars. Venture capital
firms are flush with cash from pension funds and other
institutional investors. In the first half of this year, VC funds
raised $7 billion, or 34 percent more than the $5.2 billion raised
in the same period last year, according to Venture Economics.
Meanwhile, the average fund size nearly doubled to $112.2 million
from $65.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A record number of companies are receiving venture capital. But
worries about Asia's economies and the outlook for U.S. stocks has
kept quite a few private companies from selling stakes to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the year, only 48 companies backed by
venture capital had initial public offerings, compared with 60 in
the first half of 1997. The leading venture investors were Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers of Menlo Park, which backed 6 IPOs, and
BancAmerica Robertson Stephens of San Francisco, which backed five.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that technology continues to create
unparalleled opportunities,'' said Jay Hoag, general partner of
Technology Crossover Ventures in Palo Alto. His firm invested in
allapartments as well as Autoweb, a Santa Clara startup that helps
consumers research, buy and sell new and used cars online.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for venture capitalists is that so much money is
chasing the hottest deals that venture firms are having to pay more
for their early investment stakes. As a result, Hoag suspects, ``we
won't enjoy the 40 percent to 60 percent annual returns of the past
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology Crossover Partners is unusual in that it invests in
both private and public companies. Because many fast-growing
high-tech companies have lost 25 to 50 percent of their value in
recent weeks, Hoag figures that some are better bargains than
startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what's happening in the public markets today,'' Hoag
said, ``it makes sense to selectively invest in companies that are
growing 40 to 50 percent a year and selling at 25 times estimated
earnings.''

APPLEBY DISCUSSES WIFE'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
 PGA FEATURE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Stuart Appleby's professional golfing life
turned around when he won the Honda Classic in Coral Springs, Fla.,
last year, but his entire life was devastated last month. After
competing in the British Open, he watched in disbelief on a London
street as his wife, Renay, was pinned between two cars while the
couple were exiting a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Her death sent a shock wave through the world of golf, but
Appleby has managed to interrupt his mourning to prepare for the
80th PGA Championship that begins Thursday at Sahalee Country Club.
Appleby broke down twice Tuesday as he answered questions about
what life has been like, about returning to his native Australia
for the funeral, and about returning to golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baby steps,'' he said on a few occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here on normal terms. It's quite obvious what
happened. If you've got questions, fire away. I'm quite comfortable
being here talking about whatever you need to ask me about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when I came back, I had to do this. It's probably
one of the easiest things. It's nothing. It's something I could not
avoid. Maybe that's part of the process, trying to move on, take
one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a loss of a person very close to me. It's just a very
unusual circumstance, so I've got to reassure everyone that I'm OK.
There's no preferences dealt out when someone disappears from life
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby is a native of the farming village of Cohuma in the
southeast state of Victoria, and Renay caddied for him when he came
to the United States to play on the Nike Tour in 1995. He was moved
to tears when her name came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to feel, what to say,'' said Appleby. I wish
I could correct myself a little easier, have a plan of where I want
to go. It's just one day at a time, and I'm just trying to find
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good at best. I feel terrible at worst. It's a feeling
I would never want to wish upon anyone _ the feeling you have so
many qusetions but can't find answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a little bit of time. I'll be OK. I'd say the toughest
time is when you do a lot of thinking, when you just wish things
were different. I've had a lot of support, which makes a lot of
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been fantastic, but no one can replace that person
and how she made me feel. I've just got to get used to the
memories, and as time goes on, the memories will make me happier
and happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of good times, and I feel very lucky that I knew
her. The time we spent together was really good quality, and I
don't have any regrets. I feel she was the first prize of a raffle,
and I was lucky enough to win her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's changed me and my life. She's changed a lot of people's
lives. She obviously was only here for a short time, but she had a
very big impact on a lot of people. It was sort of tough to decide
whether I was going to come back and how quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, who hasn't returned to his home in Isleworth, Fla.,
since Renay's death July 23, remembers the details vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two parked cars,'' he said. ``And we were sort of
double-parked next to each other. We were in a taxi. We were
getting luggage out. We already had some luggage out. I was just
finishing the last items and paying the cab when the driver
opposite us reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Renay was near me when the car backed up and hit her. I
turned to see the car still reversing. The car stopped when it hit
the other car. Then obviously, the car went forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called for an ambulance. I was there with another
gentleman, and we were doing CPR and heart massage and were trying
to find a pulse. It wasn't that scary at the time. I didn't feel
very upset. I was very surprised at how calm I felt. I knew it was
a serious situation, but I felt like I had it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, a neighbor of Appleby in Ilseworth, also talked
about the tragedy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad time,'' Woods said. ``I saw him for the first
time yesterday, and it was tough to even talk to him. I almost
teared up on the spot. I get a little choked up talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, everyone here has been open arms,
open heart. We welcome him back and we just want to say if he ever
needs us, he can find us.''

NED GILLETTE, 53, SPORTSMAN KILLED IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Mass., Alaska, Vt.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ned Gillette of Sun Valley, Idaho, a 53-year-old adventurer,
mountain climber, sailor, skier, photographer, journalist and
author, was shot to death the night of Aug. 5 while sleeping in a
tent in the disputed northern Kashmir region between India and
Pakistan. His wife, Suzy Patterson, who was also shot, was said to
be recovering in a Pakistani hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials said two suspects had been taken into
custody and charged with murder and assault. The authorities said
the apparent motive was robbery. According to Bloomberg News, the
local police, helped by villagers in the mountainous region,
uncovered a shotgun they believed was used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Patterson, 42, was the U.S. women's champion in slalom
skiing in 1974 and the U.S. downhill champion in 1976. She finished
14th in the 1976 Olympic downhill.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gillette's mother, Janet Gillette of Falmouth,
Mass., her son and daughter-in-law left in early July to climb
mountains and journey through Pakistan. They had expected to return
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and mother, Gillette is survived by a
sister, Debbie Law of Tiburon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, a native of Barre, Vt., was captain of the Dartmouth
College ski team and a noncompeting substitute on the 1968 U.S.
Olympic team in cross-country skiing. He later headed the ski
touring program at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vt., and wrote
instructional books on skiing.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest love was doing things no one else had done and
perhaps not even imagined. In 1978, he led an expedition that
climbed the base of Mount McKinley in Alaska not vertically, but
horizontally. In 1981 and 1982, he made a similar trip around Mount
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he and three others became the first to row from the
tip of South America to Antarctica through the 600-mile Drake
Passage, considered by mariners to be the most treacherous body of
water in the world. Their specially built 28-foot aluminum boat,
Sea Tomato, overturned several times during the 14-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother wishes I never thought of it,'' Gillette said later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he and his wife rode camels 6,000 miles on the old Silk
Road from China to the Mediterranean Sea. Before that trip, he
said: ``I think poignant experiences like this either enhance or
destroy a marriage, and I see no reason why this is going to do
anything but enhance. People often say, `How can you top this?' And
there's always a new idea that comes along. Life doesn't stop with
one experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rice, a meteorologist in Bedford, Mass., provided weather
forecasts for Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people,'' Rice said of such adventurers, ``get
more out of life than anybody. They don't really think they can be
hurt, and it's kind of a surprise to them when they are. Most
people use only about 10 percent of themselves. These people call
on much, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said the biggest challenge was finding a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a time where you can no longer climb the highest
peak, or no longer explore blank spots on a map,'' he said.
``Adventure is looking at old subjects in a new way. There's still
plenty left to do if you use your imagination. You have to create a
double adventure rather than answer to one already waiting for
you.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton's bus slowly chugged
along the roads in upstate New York recently on a tour for historic
preservation, she glanced out the window at a woman holding aloft a
cardboard sign. It said, ``You Go Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Mrs. Clinton has been trying to do just that,
and in some respects, is succeeding, even as her husband prepares
to face a federal grand jury on Monday about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's approval ratings across the country are higher
than ever. Instead of sequestering herself at the White House, away
from the klieg lights and the inevitable questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton has crowded her schedule with things to do
and people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island,
Mrs. Clinton dropped in on the glitterati, firing up a crowd of
1,000 people who whooped and hollered as she introduced her
husband. And she has helped several Democratic candidates, raising
$150,000 in Philadelphia for one candidate two weeks ago. Soon, she
will be traveling to Russia, Ireland, Chile and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, Mrs. Clinton has stirred things up by dishing
out a few select words about the Lewinsky matter, in which a grand
jury is investigating whether President Clinton lied when asked
under oath if he had had a sexual relationship with the former
intern and whether he tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Mrs. Clinton placed the blame on a ``right-wing
conspiracy'' spearheaded by the Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
and his allies, for trying to ruin her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in an interview published in The Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, Mrs. Clinton said prejudice against Arkansas was
driving the attacks on her husband.``I think a lot of this is
prejudice against our state,'' Mrs. Clinton told the newspaper.
``They wouldn't do this if we were from some other state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Arkansas seized on Mrs. Clinton's remark.
``I know she must be going through a lot of stress, but I don't
think anyone in Arkansas believes this is occurring because of
prejudice towards the state,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.
``It's inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., was harsher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad and unfortunate that Arkansas is depicted by the
first lady as a backward state, worthy of ridicule and prejudice,''
Dickey said. ``It would be much better if the first lady would make
a mature and responsible assessment of the situation and not blame
us Arkansans for their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas could not resist joking, saying,
``First, it was the right-wing conspiracy. Now it's the
chicken-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that Mrs. Clinton has swayed a number of
Americans, especially women, over to her side in the past eight
months. According to a CBS News poll conducted July 19 through July
21, 50 percent of those surveyed said they held a favorable opinion
of Mrs. Clinton and 26 percent say they did not. In previous years,
only 35 percent or so of Americans had expressed support for Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some political consultants say that after six years, people are
starting to like Mrs. Clinton and her reconfigured role as first
lady. Others point directly at Ms. Lewinsky, and say that the
public sympathizes with Mrs. Clinton and that has softened her
image in a way that speeches and press releases never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best person they can put out there,'' said Goeas.
``She's kind of standing by her man, and has been determined to do
exactly that. Some people feel sorry for her. Some respect her.
It's probably a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said, ``I think that the first
lady has handled this whole set of attacks with grace and
intelligence and wit, and people admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Mrs. Clinton's legal background, and her
own experience as a subpoenaed witness before Starr's Whitewater
grand jury, makes her one of the president's most valuable
strategists. And, in fact, she is said to be directly involved in
meetings with lawyers and others on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the private Mrs. Clinton has remained steadfastly elusive.
How does she broach the subject of Ms. Lewinswky with her husband?
Do they talk about the infamous dress? Does she advise him on what
to say?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are all subject to speculation, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at best this is an extremely difficult time and I
think the President and Mrs. Clinton are probably communicating, in
many ways through their lawyer, David Kendall,'' DeeDee Myers,
President Clinton's former press secretary, said on the ABC news
program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Myers said, ``These are the kind of issues that I think
husbands and wives don't often sit down and sort of have frank
conversations about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former White House aide said people still discounted one
thing when they looked at Mrs. Clinton's relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That woman is wild for him,'' the former aide said. ``She is
so deeply in love with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser at the home of the actors Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger in the Hamptons at the beginning of this month, an
ebullient Mrs. Clinton got the crowd fired up for her husband, then
gave him a hug before he took the microphone and delivered five
minutes of subdued remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's staff said she thrives on her public appearances,
especially when she is talking about children's issues, health care
and the encroaching millennium. ``She believes that if you spend
one day pacing around the White House, that's one day you are not
doing something to advance the agenda of the President,'' said Neel
Lattimore, Mrs. Clinton's former press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she approached the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and offered to attend a number of fund-raisers
for House and Senate candidates, many of them challengers facing
uphill battles. She has attended six fund-raisers since June and is
expected to attend several more over the next few weeks.

   Dan Sallick, the communications director for the campaign
committee, said that she was the party's biggest draw, after the
president. Just before a special election in Albuquerque, N.M.,
Mrs. Clinton drew 2,000 at a college gym on 48 hours notice,
Sallick said, adding that she had helped involve women who did not
typically turn out to show up and write checks.

   ``Besides the president, who tends to do more fund-raising for
the national party committee, she is in the most demand of any
other Democratic official,'' Sallick said.

   Lydia Spottswood, a Wisconsin candidate for the House, said Mrs.
Clinton attended a small reception in Milwaukee that drew $60,000.
Ms. Spottswood said Mrs. Clinton's wifely travails had certainly
played a hand in her popularity.

   ``There but for the grace of God,'' Ms. Spottswood said. ``Any
woman could find herself with unwelcomed rumors. She has dealt with
it with so much dignity and grace, it has resonated with people.''
