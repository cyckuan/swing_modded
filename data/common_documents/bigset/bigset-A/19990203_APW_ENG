<HEADLINE> Florida Won't Play Powerball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush has decided Florida  
doesn't need to gamble with Powerball, the successful multi-state 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush announced Tuesday that Florida is backing out of the  
Powerball contract that former Lottery Secretary Marcia Mann signed 
Nov. 6, less than a week after Bush was elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although state economists projected a short-term financial boost  
with Powerball, Bush said it was of ``debatable effectiveness'' and 
he isn't convinced the game is a long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lottery department needs to move away from a vendor-driven  
department to a department that looks at the broad interests of the 
state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mann said the reversal goes against every study she  
conducted as secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big mistake,'' Ms. Mann said. ``I never believed  
that Powerball was the answer forever, but I certainly think it 
would be the answer for the next couple of years when revenues are 
flat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several state lawmakers were outraged that Ms. Mann didn't  
contact them or the governor when she signed the state up for 
Powerball, which is played in 20 states. Ms. Mann was replaced last 
month.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Said Helps Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public reaction to the Congress' handling of  
President Clinton's impeachment has the cash register ringing at 
the Democratic National Committee, party officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grossman, serving as the party's co-chairman for the last  
time at a $1 million fund-raiser Tuesday night in New York City, 
said the DNC had hoped to raise $1 million from small donors -- 
people who on average give $26 to the party -- in January. ``We 
raised well over $2 million,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are hundreds of thousands of citizens all over the  
country who are angry, who are outraged,'' Grossman said. ``They 
are voting with their wallets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grossman spoke before the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, attended a gathering of deep-pocketed supporters at a 
$10,000-a-plate dinner of sea bass at the exclusive Le Cirque 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's first fund-raising swing of the year began earlier  
Tuesday in Boston, where he attended a $700,000 lunch and a 
reception for smaller donors. It took place while House impeachment 
managers in Washington were quizzing presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan about his efforts to assist Monica Lewinsky's job hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	After the dinner at Le Cirque, Clinton sought to portray the  
impact of what he said were the achievements of his administration 
-- dropping crime rates, low unemployment, smaller welfare rolls and 
a robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What matters to me is the lives it changed,'' he said, adding  
that investing more in education and using the budget surplus to 
shore up Social Security ``will change the future of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a public elementary school in Boston, Clinton backed his call  
to fix or close failing schools with a $200 million proposal to 
support intervention in troubled classrooms and challenged 
Republicans to a debate over increasing accountability in the 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, concerned that Clinton's education proposals would  
encroach upon state and local school autonomy, questioned whether 
his new budget does enough to directly support teaching and whether 
it allows local school officials enough flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and  
Workforce Committee, said Clinton was seeking to micromanage local 
schools from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the president's proposals, Washington bureaucrats will  
call the shots on most of the major issues confronting states and 
local school districts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said teachers and parents want greater  
accountability from their school systems, which receive $15 billion 
in federal funds annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine any company spending $15 billion and saying,  
'Here's the money, we don't care what the results are?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton returned to Washington late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Darling Grows Up To Be Boxer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jackaline Jimenez didn't know her son would become a boxer when  
she named him. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, now an 18-year-old man, has turned into a featherweight  
boxer with a promising future and the non-pugilistic name of 
Darling. 
</P>
<P>
	What's in a name? Darling has no meaning in Spanish, so Darling  
Jimenez, a native of the Dominican Republic, is not embarrassed by 
the English meaning of the word. The 5-foot-6 Jimenez said that 
when he plays basketball, he's teased as being ``Little Darling,'' 
but that has been the limit of any taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	What's in a name? When the name is Sugar Ray Robinson, however,  
it's a different matter to Darling Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	When he won the 125-pound open title in the New York Daily News  
Golden Gloves last year, Jimenez was voted the Sugar Ray Robinson 
Award as the outstanding boxer in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 24, Jimenez will begin a quest for a third Golden Gloves  
125-pound title (he was a novice winner in 1997). He is given a 
good chance of again winning the award named after Robinson, who 
came out of the tournament in 1940 to launch a career that made 
him, in the minds of many boxing people and fans the greatest 
pound-for-pound fighter in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw some tapes of him,'' Jimenez said of Robinson. ``He was  
good. He threw SOME combinations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for himself, Jimenez said, ``I can box and I can punch.  
People keep asking me when I'm turning pro, and I tell them after 
the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez is being sponsored by the New York State Federation of  
Taxi Drivers, an organization of some 3,000 livery drivers in New 
York City. The group is predominantly Latino, with a majority of 
its members Dominican. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship is limited to moral and vocal support.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a cheer-leading crowd,'' said Fernando Mateo, the  
federation's drivers. ``We're very proud he's been able to focus on 
his goals and we want him to know he has the backing of the 
Dominican community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez moved to Yonkers, N.Y., with his family in 1991, and it  
was about that time that he got involved in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My cousin used to box, so my father took me to the gym,'' he  
recalled. ``I liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likes it? He lives it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is about boxing,'' said Jimenez, who dropped out of  
school in 1997, but is now seeking a General Equivalency Diploma. 
```I just go to the gym, run and train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jimenez doesn't start competing until Feb. 24, the  
competition in the 72nd Daily News Golden Gloves, oldest amateur 
tournament in the United States, opened on Jan. 21. Finals in the 
novice and open divisions will be held April 8-9 in the Theater at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 500 men and women boxers registered for the  
competition, which, as usual, has an international flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, registered were Aloysius Kelly, a light  
heavyweight fighting out of the Irish Ropes Boxing Club; Yacoubou 
Moutakilou, a super heavyweight, who hails from the West African 
nation of Togo; and Zamfir Truto, a 30-year-old heavyweight who was 
1988-89 Rumanian national champion.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Firm Appeals License Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A company on Wednesday asked an appeals  
court to overturn an injunction preventing it from buying driver's 
license photos from Florida that were to be used as part of an 
anti-fraud system. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data Corp. challenged a temporary injunction granted  
Monday by Seminole County Circuit Judge Nancy Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Losey, an Orlando attorney representing Image Data, said  
the injunction was too broadly written, the company wasn't allowed 
to present its case to the judge and the plaintiffs should have 
filed a complaint before they filed for an injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Alley's injunction order, Gov. Jeb Bush terminated  
the state's contract with the Nashua, N.H.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	The state already has turned over 35,000 photos to the private  
firm under the 3-month-old contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the injunction is overturned, it won't change Bush's  
position that the contract is over. Language in the agreement ends 
it if there's a court order or change in the law, said Bush 
spokesman Cory Tilley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their appeal is pretty much meaningless,'' Tilley said.  
``Anything they do at this point, we pretty much look at as 
irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data plans to use the information from licenses, including  
photos, to provide retailers with a data system to assist in 
identifying customers, thus cutting down on fraudulent check 
cashing and credit-card charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has faced similar problems trying to launch its  
anti-fraud tool in South Carolina and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, South Carolina sued to have the photos and other  
information returned. An injunction hearing is scheduled for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado officials on Tuesday took similar action to halt the  
sale of license information to Image Data. Gov. Bill Owens says 
Colorado lawmakers will introduce a bill to void his state's 
contract with the company.

<HEADLINE> Brit Telecom To Cut Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Facing pressure from price cuts in the  
German telecom market, British Telecom said Wednesday it will cut 
costs to stay competitive, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, this means that we will have to pay even more  
attention to low costs,'' the Handelsblatt daily quoted British 
Telecom's executive director for Europe, Pat Gallagher, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Gallagher said British Telecom, which owns 45 percent  
of Munich-based telecom firm Viag Interkom, aims to integrate its 
fixed and mobile networks in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cuts operating costs 8 to 12 percent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom last week announced dramatic price cuts for  
long-distance evening calls, a move quickly followed by price 
reductions at other German telecom companies.

<HEADLINE> Judge Troubled by Microsoft Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a second day of courtroom drama, the  
government pointed out new problems Wednesday with a video 
demonstration prepared by Microsoft Corp. in an attempt to support 
a central argument in its landmark antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson shook  
his head to admonish a senior Microsoft executive: ``I can't rely 
on it (the video). It's very troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over a four-minute segment, a government lawyer pointed to  
software icons that appeared -- then disappeared and reappeared -- on 
the screen of the computer purported to have been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly has not turned out as a good video  
demonstration,'' Microsoft senior vice president James Allchin 
conceded on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Justice Department lawyer David Boies,  
Allchin acknowledged that Microsoft had tested several computers, 
but edited together video segments so it appeared a single computer 
was being tested during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Boies said he didn't know whether the video flaw was  
intentional. ``The videotape is simply not reliable as evidence,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said outside court that it planned to recreate the  
demonstration overnight with government experts watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make very good software,'' said the company's lead in-house  
lawyer, William Neukom. ``We didn't make a very good tape. ... It's 
frankly our fault. We've got to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin had testified previously that his ``total trust in my  
team'' assured him that Microsoft's tests were performed using 
clean computers containing only Windows software with the 
government's modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	But the video showed telltale remnants of other programs, such  
as parts of Microsoft's Office business software. 
</P>
<P>
	In some frames, an icon for an Office program is visible on the  
computer screen; in others, it's missing. Later, it reappears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the impression given is, this is the same machine,''  
Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Allchin said. But he later acknowledged:  
``Yes, there were multiple machines involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, now you know there were multiple machines?'' Boies asked  
incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had believed that the demonstration would be an  
effective rebuttal of the government's claims that its Internet 
browser software could be easily removed from Windows 98. The video 
shows its browser running dramatically slower after the government 
tried to disable most Internet functions in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is central because the government alleges that  
Microsoft's design forces consumers who use Windows also to use its 
browser, discouraging use of rival software. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Boies stopped the video in midframe to first point  
out a discrepancy: the border showing the browser's name was 
different in one part of the video than in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies charged -- and Allchin agreed -- that the subtle change in  
the border, called the title bar, indicated that Microsoft's test 
actually used a version of Windows unaffected by the government's 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	But later Allchin testified that the demonstration appeared  
tainted simply because unrelated software from an online service 
was removed from the company's test computer, causing a subtle 
change in how the title looked. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's three computer experts -- two young men in their  
early 20s and their former college professor -- found the latest 
problems with Microsoft's video during the Wednesday lunch break, 
Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same team noticed the earlier discrepancy for the government  
the same weekend Microsoft made a copy available for them to 
preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Microsoft's explanation, the debacle caused the  
company serious problems in how its legal fight is perceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Gray, a California antitrust lawyer analyzing the case  
daily for the San Jose Mercury News, wrote: ``The last time the 
United States government inflicted this much punishment on a foe, 
the evening news was filled with aerial photography of bombed-out 
vehicles and burning Iraqi tanks on the highway leading out of 
Kuwait City.''

<HEADLINE> Serbia Bearing Pressure for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's hard-line government is  
bearing the full weight of international pressure for Kosovo peace 
talks, now that rebels have agreed to negotiations to end the 
nearly yearlong war. 
</P>
<P>
	Although calling the proposed peace plan flawed, the main  
spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that rebel 
leaders accepted the U.S. and European summons to peace talks in 
Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels demanded a lead role on the Albanian negotiating  
team. The KLA has become Kosovo Albanians' leading force in their 
strengthening push for independence from Serbia, the dominant of 
Yugoslavia's two republics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some objections to the proposed document but we are  
certainly ready to go to Rambouillet,'' rebel spokesman Jakup 
Krasniqi said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes if Serbia and the rebels aren't  
talking by Saturday and closing a peace deal by Feb. 19 under talks 
organized by the United States and five European powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic deferred Serbia's decision  
to Thursday's meeting of parliament. The parliament is dominated by 
hard-liners and ultranationlists and under Milosevic's de facto 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
welcomed the KLA acceptance, saying the United States was ``pleased 
that the Kosovar Albanian side appears to be coalescing in favor of 
coming to the negotiations outside of Paris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the United States was waiting for the Serbs to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Serb police on Tuesday seized nearly $600,000 worth  
of weapons, ammunition and uniforms destined for ethnic Albanian 
rebels in what officials called the biggest weapons find ever 
inside Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies were found under a false floor in a 25-ton  
tractor-trailer near Kosovska Mitrovica, about 20 miles northwest 
of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Police said they found the vehicle 
abandoned on the side of a road after an anonymous telephone tip. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, officials escorted reporters to the local police  
headquarters, where they displayed rocket-propelled grenades, hand 
grenades, machine guns, anti-personnel land mines, fuses, fatigue 
uniforms and the red and black shoulder patches of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of rounds of semiautomatic weapons ammunition and  
cartridges were strewn along the trailer's false bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, police and the Yugoslav army have seized larger  
quantities of weapons but along the border area with Albania, which 
the KLA uses for sanctuaries and training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA was to announce its delegates to the peace talks today.  
Krasniqi said the rebels wanted four spots on the Albanian team, 
expected to number about 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-proposed peace plan would give Kosovo greater autonomy  
for three years. Serbs and Albanians would decide what happens 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA will demand that Kosovo be made an international  
protectorate during the autonomy period, Krasniqi said. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Kosovo's people should decide its future in a  
referendum, the rebels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians are by far the majority among Kosovo's 2  
million people, and most of them want outright independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government has said any vote on Kosovo's future  
should be by all the people of Serbia. It has resisted any moves 
that might erode its control over the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin emphasized the U.S. position against independence for  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between Kosovo Albanian separatists and Serbian and  
Yugoslav forces has killed at least 2,000 people, many of them 
civilians, and made refugees out of hundreds of thousands. Hundreds 
of people have been killed even since an October cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Fuentes Brothers Riding High in NM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AP Photo    	
</P>
<P>
	SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (AP) -- Blood runs thick between Miguel,  
Alfonso and Adan Fuentes. That lasts only until post time. 
</P>
<P>
	The three brothers are jockeys. In November 1995, they left  
their parents' ranch outside of Mexico City to come to the United 
States. Since then, they've been winning consistently at New Mexico 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 24, Adan and Miguel won seven of the 10 races at Sunland  
Park. Adan won aboard five of the six horses he rode that day and 
Miguel won twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've taken over. If it's not one Fuentes, it's another,''  
says Eric Alwan, a veteran handicapper and publicity director at 
Sunland Park, where the Fuentes' are riding this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	At 34, the 5-foot Miguel is the oldest of the trio and currently  
is the leading thoroughbred rider at Sunland. Through last week, he 
had 20 victories, and 36 of the 72 horses he rode finished in the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I use Miguel as much as I can,'' trainer Roy Marcom said. ``I  
think he's as good a thoroughbred rider as there is in the 
Southwest. He can go anywhere and ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a wonderful sense of pace and wins the close races  
like you wouldn't believe,'' Alwan said. ``Because of that, he's 
getting all the best connections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adan also rides for Marcom.  
</P>
<P>
	``What time I've been around them, they seem like excellent  
people,'' Marcom said. ``You ask them to come help you with 
something and they always show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adan, 24, is the youngest and at 5-foot-5, is the tallest of the  
three. He rides both thoroughbreds and quarter horses, and at the 
Downs at Albuquerque meet this fall finished as the second-leading 
rider overall with 32 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last weekend at Sunland, he had 21 wins, 14 of them on  
quarter horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adan has a lot more wins on quarter horses, but he's equally  
dangerous on both,'' Alwan said. ``Horses seem to liven up for 
Adan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso, 27, is 5-foot-1. He spent most of 1998 riding at tracks  
in Oklahoma, but also won 13 races on thoroughbreds and quarter 
horses at the Downs at Albuquerque's fall meet. At Sunland, he won 
the 1997 Riley Allison Futurity, the top thoroughbred race in New 
Mexico for 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alfonso may be the most stylish of all of them,'' Alwan said.  
``When they first arrived here, he was the one winning the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what happens when the brothers end up in the same race?  
Competition, they say, supersedes family. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the jock's room, we're brothers. But once we get on a  
horse, we become rivals,'' said Alfonso, who like his brothers 
speaks little English. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel feels the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll look at the program and if Adan and Alfonso have the best  
horses in the race and they get in trouble, I won't give them a 
break just because they're my brothers,'' he said. ``In a race, I'm 
looking out for the interest of my owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are professionals and we ride for ourselves,'' Adan said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, say the Fuentes, they haven't convinced other jockeys of  
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been envy, anger, resentment,'' Adan said. ``When  
we're all in the same race, I think some jockeys feel like they're 
competing against all three of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three grew up in a family of seven children -- four boys and  
three girls -- in the Mexican village of San Bartolome. They rode in 
match races and eventually ended up at the Hipodrome de Las 
Americas track in Mexico City. When that track closed, the three 
brothers headed North. 
</P>
<P>
	How much longer the brothers will stay together in New Mexico  
isn't certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel and Alfonso want to move on to bigger tracks and bigger  
races, in California, Kentucky or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worm that is always within a jockey,'' Miguel said.  
``I'm 34 years old and if it doesn't happen for me soon, it won't 
ever happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adan, whose reputation as a quarter horse rider is growing,  
wants to stay in New Mexico, where some of the nation's biggest and 
richest quarter races are run each summer at Ruidoso Downs. His 
goal is to ride in the $2 million All American Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are going well for me and I think I have a future with  
quarter horses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alwan, who has been handicapping horse races since he was in  
elementary school, is convinced the Fuentes will continue to be a 
hot item. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about them. They meld with a horse real well  
and you feel comfortable when you have a bet on them. They're good. 
The proof is in the pudding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it's in the irons.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Times Switching to Mornings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Times, long a flourishing afternoon  
newspaper, will become a morning paper and compete head-to-head 
against rival Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, announced Tuesday, will occur within two years as  
part of a restructured joint operating agreement between the 
Seattle Times Co. and the Hearst Corp., which owns the 
Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see some of the fiercest newspaper  
competition that you'll see in any city anywhere,'' said Mason 
Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The P-I's editor and publisher, J.D. Alexander, said he believes  
the Seattle market can support two morning newspapers. ``There's no 
reason that we can't do it successfully,'' he said. ``Good 
journalism draws readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring gives the Post-Intelligencer a larger share of  
profits and allows for expansion of its Web site, which the P-I 
updated with the day's top news stories Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both papers have had trouble making significant  
circulation gains in recent years, the Times has been a rare bird 
in an era of increasingly popular morning papers, dominating with a 
daily circulation of about 230,000 and a Sunday circulation of 
about 504,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The P-I has a daily circulation of about 200,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been successful in bucking the trends with an evening  
newspaper because of the quality of our product, but we now are at 
a point where we must respond to the community's clear preference 
for a morning paper,'' said Sizemore. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions to change the newspapers' 15-year-old joint  
operating agreement and to allow the Times to publish in the 
morning began in 1990 and intensified as the Post-Intelligencer 
sought a way to post news to its Web site, a move the Times 
believed was barred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to talk about it and see if we could solve it  
rather than sue each other,'' said Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised agreement extends until Dec. 31, 2083, and gives  
Hearst Corp. right-of-first-purchase should Times owners decide to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blethen family, which owns 50.5 percent of the Times, has no  
plans to sell, Sizemore said. Knight Ridder owns the remaining 49.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint operating agreements, in which newspapers of different  
ownership compete editorially but share advertising, circulation 
and production resources, exist in 16 cities.

<HEADLINE> New York Disc Jockey Suing FCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four disc jockeys operating an unlicensed,  
low-watt radio station do not have to reveal their identities in 
their suit against the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The four disc jockeys broadcast on ``Steal This Radio,'' a  
20-watt FM station operating out of Manhattan's Lower East Side. 
The station, which debuted in 1995, broadcasts daily from 6 p.m. to 
6 a.m. and includes a feminist show, storytelling, poetry and 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC unplugged it last April and threatened to seize its  
equipment because it was unlicensed. But the station sued the FCC 
and went back on the air, claiming it has a First Amendment right 
to speak via the airwaves without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	While their case is heard, the judge is keeping the disc  
jockeys' real names in a sealed envelope so they can't be 
prosecuted for operating the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, the  
plaintiffs will only be known by their on-air names -- DJ Thomas 
Paine, DJ Sharin, DJ Carlos Rising and DJ E.S.E. -- in their case 
against the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``To deny them permission to proceed by pseudonym would either  
expose plaintiffs to further penalties and prosecution or... 
discourage them from pursuing their constitutional challenge,'' 
Mukasey wrote in his ruling this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney, Robert Perry, said such motions have been  
granted before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of motion is frequently made when you have  
plaintiffs who are challenging conduct which they believe is 
protected, but which is illegal under the laws they are 
challenging,'' Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. It had argued  
that the real names of the plaintiffs should be used because they 
are seeking to vindicate their own interests, and that since the 
group is suing the FCC, it should be forced to stand behind the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a new radio station license in Manhattan is nearly  
impossible because the commission has given away most available 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1978, the FCC has refused to grant licenses to stations  
that broadcast under 100 watts. Operating at that level would cost 
at least $50,000, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the FCC offered proposals to create thousands of new,  
licensed low-tech FM radio stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts for 
as low as $2,500. Pirates who refuse to follow FCC orders and shut 
down their illegal stations could have a tough time getting the 
license if and when the proposals are adopted.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Chooses Central Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- When the government dismissed the  
Central Bank president Francisco Lopes and replaced him with a 
former George Soros associate, it seemed to be giving currency 
speculators a taste of their own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Arminio Fraga worked for the billionaire  
investor, advising him on emerging markets such as Brazil's. His 
appointment Tuesday is the government's latest move to halt the 
financial crisis that has gripped Brazil and threatens to buffet 
other Latin American economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``By bringing to the Central Bank his experience on the other  
side of the table, he will certainly be an asset for Brazil,'' 
Finance Minister Pedro Malan told Globo News Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment was generally well received. Brazil's  
currency, the real, strengthened on the news and while the stock 
market declined, losses were less than might be expected with such 
a shift. 
</P>
<P>
	During Lopes' short-lived presidency, the real had lost more  
than 40 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first impression this unexpected change may give to the  
international community is one of total chaos,'' said Jose Luciano 
Dias, a Brasilia-based political analyst. ``But in a few days it 
will become clear that the change was necessary for Brazil to 
regain its credibility and the confidence of the international 
financial community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga, who arrived in Brasilia Tuesday afternoon, headed  
straight for the Finance Ministry where he met with Malan and 
International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Stanley 
Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan, Fischer and a team of International Monetary Fund  
economists spent much of Tuesday reviewing the terms of a $41.5 
billion IMF-led aid package finalized last November in light of 
Brazil's currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the switch, the government took pains to say that  
the foreign exchange policy initiated by Lopes just three weeks ago 
would remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes threw his support  
behind the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He, more than anyone else, understands the actions of  
speculators and will be able to stop their criminal actions,'' 
Magalhaes told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the support, Fraga has no easy task ahead of him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fraga's nomination doesn't mean that all of Brazil's problems  
are solved,'' said Marcelo Guterman, fund manager with Lloyd's 
Asset Management. ``We need new direction, the IMF accord is being 
reviewed and if the policies are bad, no one man will hold it 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And opposition politicians criticized Fraga's proximity to  
Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has just handed over the Central Bank to one of the  
biggest speculators in the world,'' leftist-Workers' Party 
president Jose Dirceu told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has taken pains to stress that Fraga is no longer  
associated with Soros. Fraga was a managing director at Soros Fund 
Management, a private New York-based investment management firm, 
where his main responsibility was investing strategies for emerging 
markets. Earlier he worked for New York-based Salomon Brothers and 
Rio De Janeiro's Banco Garantia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taught at Columbia University's School of International  
and Public Affairs and other universities in the United States and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Fraga served as the Central Bank's director  
of international affairs and was involved in earlier negotiations 
with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he is confirmed, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho Neto of  
the Central Bank will serve as interim president. Pending 
confirmation, Fraga will serve as a special advisor to Malan.

<HEADLINE> O'Brien Sets Sights on 9,000 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, Dan O'Brien has been talking about  
breaking the 9,000-point barrier in the decathlon. This might 
finally be the year. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien is relatively healthy and competing regularly on the  
indoor circuit, sharpening his skills for the outdoor season. He 
already has competed in the hurdles and long jump, and will do both 
events again this weekend. He will run the 60-meter hurdles at the 
Millrose Games Friday night and long jump Sunday at the New Balance 
Invitational at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, O'Brien has been training hard to improve three of his  
weaker events, the 400 and 1,500 meters, and the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have set specific goals -- to run better than 45.68 (seconds)  
and break Bill Toomey's decathlon 400-meter record, and to pole 
vault 5.40 meters (17 feet, 8 3/4 inches),'' O'Brien said. ``And I 
will run a great 1,500 meters before my career is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember Bruce Jenner had the Olympic gold won (in 1976),  
but he ran for the world record (in the 1,500). That was 
impressive. People always remember the last thing you did, and that 
is the 1,500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, another reason he feels he has a shot at breaking the  
9,000-point barrier, he said, ``There are a lot of nines in this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joking aside, O'Brien is very serious about his goal. The 1996  
Olympic gold medalist, three-time world champion and world 
record-holder (8,891 points, set in 1992) even has picked the meet 
where he plans to make his record assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to break the world record at the national  
championships in Eugene (Ore.) and break 4:30 (in the 1,500) with a 
`Go, Pre Go' '' shirt on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shirt will be in memory of the Oregon distance runner, Steve  
Prefontaine, who died in a car crash in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries prevented O'Brien from competing in the decathlon in  
1997 and limited him to one meet last year, a stirring comeback 
victory at the Goodwill Games. This year, he plans to compete in at 
least two decathlons -- the USA Championships at Eugene in June and 
the World Outdoor Championships at Seville, Spain, in August. 
</P>
<P>
	His schedule also calls for him to do ``selected events'' at  
five other meets, including the second day's five decathlon events 
at Tucson, Ariz., March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm way ahead of last year's schedule,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nine-thousand ... that keeps me in top shape, keeps me going  
... wanting to break that. It definitely pushes me. And I want to 
go to another Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the 32-year-old O'Brien goes to the Sydney Games in 2000, and  
gets the gold medal, he would be only the third decathlete to win 
two consecutive Olympics, joining Bob Mathias (1948-52) and 
Britain's Daley Thompson (1980-84). 
</P>
<P>
	And that probably won't be the end of his career.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you lead the world in an event and make a good living,  
it's hard to step away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I score 9,000 points, I will think I could have done  
better, and that will make me go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why step out of the sport when I can still put up big  
numbers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, O'Brien envisions winning his fifth consecutive  
world title in 2001 at Edmonton, Alberta, and defending his 
Goodwill title in 2001 at Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder in the pole vault,  
has won more world titles -- six. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement is a dirty word,'' O'Brien said. ``I don't like the  
sound of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to leave a lasting impression on the decathlon  
and on track and field. Nine-thousand points would do that ... two 
Olympic gold medals would do that. I would like people to think I'm 
as good an athlete as Michael Jordan and John Elway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, he will have two difficult assignments. In the  
Millrose Games, he will face Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked 
hurdler, and Reggie Torian, No. 4 and the 1998 U.S. outdoor 
champion. At Boston, his long jump opponents will include Roland 
McGhee, last year's national outdoor champion and former NCAA 
champion Robert Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning won't matter to O'Brien. Performing well will count, but  
more importantly, the competition will aid his preparations toward 
the decathlon record.

<HEADLINE> Radio Cassette Players Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Thomson Consumer Electronics announced  
Wednesday it is voluntarily recalling about 424,000 radio cassette 
players because of a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson has received three reports of outlets on its GE  
Spacemaker units overheating and catching fire. No injuries have 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our testing revealed that the product failure may occur with  
prolonged and repeated usage of the appliance outlet over a period 
of years,'' Thomson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit, sold under the General Electric Spacemaker brand name,  
is designed for under-the-cabinet use and includes an AM/FM stereo 
cassette player, a light and appliance outlet that is used to plug 
in additional items. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall covers units with model number 7-4285 that  
were sold from 1992-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson, which has its North American corporate headquarters in  
suburban Indianapolis, said consumers should unplug the units 
immediately. They can call 800-464-7022 to receive a free 
replacement unit.

<HEADLINE> Stressed-Out Employees Can Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For city workers feeling blue, help may be a phone  
call away. They just shouldn't expect a human on the other end of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has installed a ``mood meter,'' an automated phone  
system that screens for depression. Callers listen to recorded 
descriptions of how they feel and are asked how often they feel 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Descriptions range from ``I get tired for no reason'' to ``I  
feel others would be better off if I were dead.'' When callers 
punch the corresponding digits, they hear a recorded diagnosis that 
urges severe cases to get counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the hotline is especially valuable for the city's  
18,000 workers, often blamed for the Boston's maladies. Healthy 
employees are less likely to be absent and more likely to be 
productive, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not meant to replace an appointment with a mental health  
professional but it's a push in the right direction,'' said Joe 
Cullinan, clinical director of the city's Employee Assistance 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotline, installed in October, has received 155 calls.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 122.81 on Fed Rate News / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock pushed higher after the Federal Reserve  
made it official that it did not change interest rates in its 
two-day policy meeting that wound down this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up up 122.81 at 9,396.93. After recovering from a wobbly morning, 
the Dow was up 98 points when the announcement came at 2:15 EST 
that Fed governors had left short-term interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow dipped a bit immediately following the announcement, as  
some investors ``sold on the news,'' but soon resumed climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors were on Fed watch all morning. Although they  
didn't really expect it, there was a chance that the Fed would 
respond to recently robust economic data by raising rates, which 
would be bad for stocks because it would raise corporate borrowing 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our view is that they really have nothing to worry  
about,'' Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of 
St. Louis, said in late morning. ``This is one of the easiest 
decisions the Fed has had to make. Even if they change the bias 
toward tightening, we just remind people that that happened last 
year before they lowered interest rates twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology issues were again leaders to the upside, pushing  
broad-market indexes, where technology names are heavily 
represented, higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13.03 
at 1,275.02, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 19.03 at 
2,482.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by 10 to 9 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 701.63 million shares, up slightly 
from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco Systems shares were down 1 1/16 at 110 13/16. The company  
reported earnings late Tuesday that were one penny above analysts' 
expectations, but Chief Executive John Chambers warned this morning 
that there is some concern about how the Year 2000 computer issue 
will affect high-tech spending later in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But many computer-related stocks were higher, with America  
Online up 5 3/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber were  
up 1 5/8 at 52. The company announced an alliance with Japan's 
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and fourth-quarter earnings that 
matched analysts' expectations. The company also separately 
announced a worldwide cost-cutting effort that will eliminate up to 
2,800 jobs.

	TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Arrest warrants have been issued  
for three former southern Chiapas state officials who allegedly 
tried to cover up the massacre of 45 people by a pro-government 
vigilante group. 
</P>
<P>
	The three top law enforcement officials, who arrived on the  
scene shortly after the Dec. 22, 1997 killings in Acteal, are 
accused of presiding over a desperate attempt to hide a crime that 
captured international attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants were made public by Chiapas state prosecutors on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say that Jorge Enrique Hernandez, then-state public  
safety council director, directed police to toss the bodies onto a 
flatbed truck, tampering with key evidence at the crime scene. He 
is charged with abuse and usurpation of authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state police coordinator Jorge Gamboa Solis and former  
assistant state interior secretary Uriel Jarquin Galvez were 
charged with obstructing law enforcement in the alleged cover-up 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	All three have received provisional injunctions that temporarily  
protect them from arrest.

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- A Paraguayan human rights activist  
called on the Brazilian government Wednesday to end the amnesty it 
extends to Paraguay's former dictator, Alfredo Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter addressed to Brazil's president, Martin Almada  
called Stroessner a ``common criminal'' who should not elude 
justice in Paraguay or Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Almada said, recently discovered files on military  
operations led by Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Stroessner during 
the 1970s revealed some victims were Brazilian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil cannot continue being the paradise of those who  
committed crimes against humanity and robbed the state,'' Almada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almada released the letter as hundreds of Paraguayans gathered  
peacefully in downtown Asuncion to mark the 10-year anniversary of 
the fall of Stroessner's regime. Stroessner was given sanctuary in 
Brazil after a 1989 coup ended his 34-year-dictatorship.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A fugitive Mexican banker fighting  
extradition from Australia has won an injunction preventing him 
from being jailed on 13 charges related to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Cabal Peniche is suspected of misusing $700 million while  
he was the principal owner of two Mexican banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled Tuesday that the 13 charges of white-collar crime  
are not classified as serious under Mexican law, meaning Cabal 
Peniche need not be jailed on them if he is returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court rejected the banker's request for an injunction to  
block efforts to extradite him and Cabal Peniche still faces other 
charges under which he could be jailed if he is brought home, the 
federal attorney general's office said in a news release. 
</P>

<P>
	Energy Secretary Luis Tellez told reporters that the reform  
would attract investment to guarantee electricity supplies in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of power to consumers' homes and factories would be  
privatized, with regional distribution concessions offered to bids 
on a 30-year contract basis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government would keep control of the sector through  
planning, regulations, ownership and operation of the network used 
to move electricity between plants and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico has a growing need for electricity, and it will need more  
to meet demand over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed changes would have to be approved by the  
opposition-dominated Congress, where passage is far from assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is historically sensitive about any suggestion that the  
state-owned power sector -- including the state oil monopoly 
Petroleos Mexicanos -- could be privatized.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Teams Get New Stadiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles and Phillies can  
finally say good-bye to Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe two brand new stadiums with all the trimmings will change  
the lousy luck of these two forlorn franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pennsylvania General Assembly's passage Wednesday of a  
funding plan for new stadiums for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the 
Eagles and Phillies began planning for a 2002 opening of their new 
facilities. That means the longtime cohabitants of drab, outdated 
Veterans Stadium only have three more seasons in one of the worst 
facilities in pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major step,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said. ``It  
is just the first step, but a major step nonetheless. We are very 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams still have to work out funding arrangements with the  
city, and many important details such as the builders, location and 
cost are still to be decided. But at an evening news conference at 
the Vet, the Eagles already were displaying two paintings of what 
their 66,000 to 68,000-seat, grass, football-only facility might 
look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans will have two brand new stadiums that will be dynamic and  
state-of-the-art,'' Eagles executive vice president Joe Banner 
said. ``This is exciting. We're the first major market in the 
country to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell added his support to the  
Legislature's decision to fund the stadiums. ``No state anywhere 
has produced a bill as good as this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner had been critical of the state funding plan, which  
proposes that teams pay if tax revenue generated by the new 
ballparks doesn't match the state's contribution. Some $320 million 
in state money has been earmarked for the stadiums in each city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as fair a deal as we could have gotten,'' said Banner,  
who predicted that a new facility would be built in time for the 
2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies chairman Bill Giles said a new stadium was the only way  
his team could be competitive under baseball's current economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can ... get this thing built, then I believe that the  
opportunity for our general manager and president is there to get 
the job done,'' Giles said. ``The chances of having players on the 
field that people can get excited about increases dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers also will be moving from  
Three Rivers Stadium into two new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative vote came one week before interim funding to  
build the Pirates' PNC Park would have expired, a development that 
could have led owner Kevin McClatchy to sell or move the cash-thin 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've fought for three years for the right to play here for  
another 30 years,'' said McClatchy, who bought the team in February 
1996. ``I've said since the day I stepped foot in Pittsburgh that 
this ballpark was essential to the Pirates' survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stadiums will be built on opposite sides of Three Rivers  
Stadium and will be funded by a regional sales tax, the state and 
the two teams. A regional tax board agreed in July to contribute 
$13.4 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' 38,000-seat PNC Park is expected to open in April  
2001, and the Steelers' still-unnamed 65,000-seat stadium will open 
later that fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies want a stadium with a grass field with about 45,000  
seats and a design that resembles that of Coors Field in Denver, 
Camden Yards in Baltimore and Jacobs Field in Cleveland, team 
president Dave Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery predicted an April 2002 opening for the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither team knows whether its ballpark will have a corporate  
name, like most new facilities including the Pirates' PNC Park. The 
Eagles are not ruling out the sale of personal seat licenses, which 
raise money for stadium construction by charging fans a fee for 
buying tickets. The Phillies will not sell PSLs, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles laid out some expected features of their stadium:  
100-120 luxury suites, 8,000 to 9,000 club seats and an open-air 
design with a view of the city skyline. The Eagles prefer a south 
Philadelphia location near Veterans Stadium and the First Union 
Center, which is used by the NBA's 76ers and NHL's Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies are considering three possible locations. Two are  
closer to the downtown area, including a spot near the 30th Street 
rail station, a major East Coast train hub. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner estimated that the Eagles will end up footing about  
one-third of the total cost of the stadium, which he estimated at 
$300 million.

<HEADLINE> Senator: Some Sudanese Enslaved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of non-Muslim Sudanese live  
as slaves and are ``branded, beaten, starved and raped at their 
masters' whim,'' Sen. Sam Brownback said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Brownback, R-Kan., at a news conference was Rep. Frank  
Wolf, R-Va., who said the Clinton administration ``has done zip ... 
nothing'' to ease the plight of repressed Sudanese. Two million 
Sudanese, mainly non-Muslims from southern Sudan, have died from a 
16-year civil war and repeated famines that the fighting created. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cannot be allowed to continue into the next millennium,''  
said Wolf, who has visited Sudan a number of times. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1997, the administration tightened sanctions against  
Sudan, Africa's largest country, citing the Muslim extremist 
government's alleged involvement in international terror and its 
``abysmal record'' on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton blocked Sudanese government assets in the  
United States and barred most U.S.-Sudanese trade. Also prohibited 
were U.S. investments in Sudan and most financial transactions 
between the two countries. In August, Clinton ordered the bombing 
of a factory in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, that the Americans 
suspected was being used to make ingredients for chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback spoke before a photographic display portraying the  
sorrowful faces of people he said were Sudanese slaves. The victims 
are Christians and animists in the southern part of Sudan, where a 
rebel movement has waged civil war seeking autonomy for the South 
from the Muslim north. 
</P>
<P>
	Women and children captured in the war often are given to  
government soldiers, who convert their ``war booty'' into slaves, 
Brownback said. For a $50 fee, a slave can be freed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback said he will introduce legislation to challenge what  
he called the ``famine-inducing practices'' of the Sudanese 
government, but he did not give specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Brownback's information on the situation was based on a  
visit to Sudan this December by staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	Baroness Caroline Cox, a human rights activist and member of the  
British House of Lords, told the news conference that the ruling 
National Islamic Front in Sudan ``is committed to an explicit 
policy of jihad (holy war) in its most aggressive and brutal form. 
</P>
<P>
	``That includes military offensives against innocent civilians.  
It includes ... slavery as part of its policies of enforced 
Arabization of the Africans of the south and Islamization of those 
who are Christians,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Parents Slow To Embrace V-Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The v-chip, praised as salvation for  
parents fed up with trash TV, is languishing on store shelves 
during its first year of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite generous media attention and heart-tugging  
advertisements beseeching ``They're only kids once; protect them 
for all it's worth,'' few parents are buying the gadget that 
shields children from sex, violence and profanity on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interest was high, but it just never seemed to translate  
into sales,'' said Todd Grunberg, vice president of marketing for 
Tri-Vision International of Toronto, which produced 60,000 v-chip 
decoder boxes under the trade name ``V-gis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Post of the Nashville suburb of Mount Juliet apparently  
reflects the view of many parents. He said TV programming in 
general ``stinks,'' but he doesn't plan to buy a v-chip box to 
attach to his TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know where the on-off switch is,'' said Post, a father of  
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say it takes time for consumers to embrace new  
technology like the v-chip, and early sales figures are not 
indicative of public sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very early in the learning curve,'' said Lois  
Salisbury of the Washington-based advocacy group Children Now. ``I 
certainly don't see this as a measure of parents' concern about TV 
content or their desire for a ratings system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	V-chip technology became available following a decade of debates  
in Washington over whether violence on TV translated to crime on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	With the support of the Clinton administration -- particularly  
Vice President Al Gore -- Congress passed the 1996 
Telecommunications Act that forced broadcasters to develop a TV 
ratings system. The ratings are electronically coded on shows by 
programmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents can use a remote control tied to the v-chip to zap  
unwanted programs based on sexual content, violence or 
objectionable language. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also required TV manufacturers to equip U.S.-sold TV  
sets with v-chips beginning this year. Half the new models must 
have v-chips by July 1, and the remaining by July 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who want the v-chip without buying a new television must  
buy a decoder box with the chip inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The box is about the size of a videotape and costs roughly $60  
to $100. Parents must figure out how to hook up the decoder between 
the cable TV box or videocassette recorder and the television. 
Those without a VCR or cable must buy an additional device called a 
converter for about $80. 
</P>
<P>
	Tri-Vision began selling its decoder boxes in June over the  
Internet and in August at Toys R Us, Sam's Club and H.H. Gregg 
stores for between $60 and $80. Sam's and H.H. Gregg have since 
dropped the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``We carried it for six months and the manufacturer did a lot of  
advertising. But out of our 18 stores, we only sold two units,'' 
said Ken Beckley, a vice president of Indianapolis-based H.H. 
Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunberg would not reveal sales figures but acknowledged  
consumers bought less than the 6,000 per month needed to expand to 
other national retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another firm, Parental Guide Co. of Omaha, began selling its  
``PG-Plus'' and ``PG-1'' decoders in July in Omaha and New York 
City for between $69 and $99. Sales have been modest, said John 
Olivo, one of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any expectations of units flying off the shelf at lightning  
speed were not ours,'' Olivo said. ``We always thought this would 
take time -- a lot of time -- to develop consumer awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the legislation say the real test will be use of  
v-chips distributed through the 23 million TV sets sold each year 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really want this kind of tool,'' said Kathryn  
Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education in 
Washington. ``They're very concerned about the problem of sex and 
violence on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted last May found 65  
percent of parents said they would block objectionable TV shows if 
they had a v-chip in their home. At the same time, 69 percent said 
they were not likely to buy a v-chip box or TV with a v-chip in the 
next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunberg insists most consumers still don't know what a v-chip  
is or how it works. Looking for new marketing strategies, 
Tri-Vision parted ways in November with its Nashville advertising 
firm and is negotiating with producers for an infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Shapiro with the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers  
Association doesn't believe a new marketing strategy will make much 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the perfect example of government mandates intruding  
on the marketplace. It may make people in Washington feel good, but 
it has no impact on society at all,'' Shapiro said.

<HEADLINE> Cutting Edge TV Not Quite Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- Cutting edge televisions and computer monitors  
that are as thin as sliced bread and as vivid as a blooming garden 
are going to take years longer than originally expected to end up 
in most American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at Display Works '99-- a conference on electronic screen  
technology-- acknowledged Wednesday they've been overzealous in 
their predictions and that prices aren't near low enough for the 
average consumer. Instead, they said, the bulky glass ``cathode 
ray'' tubes invented 100 years ago will continue to dominate the 
market at least through the year 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's price, price, price, price, price and price,'' said  
Thomas Striegler, a flat panel display consultant from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were plenty of people in our industry who were  
overbullish about flat panel displays, but they're not even close 
to taking over the market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-inch flat panel display television sells for about $12,000.  
A comparable cathode ray tube television will cost about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would someone pay so much more for something that doesn't  
do anything better except that it's slimmer?'' said Striegler. 
``Bragging rights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathode ray tubes, used in desktop computer monitors and  
television sets, emit a beam of electrons that illuminate phosphors 
on the inside of the screen as the beam sweeps back and forth. With 
$200 million invested in factories to make them in Japan, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and China, companies aren't moving quickly to give them 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Flat panel displays are now used in laptop computers, digital  
watch faces and other small electronic devices and use a variety of 
different technologies. Each can also be used to create skinny 
television sets that hang on a wall like a picture and sleek 
computer monitors that leave space on desks for other work. 
</P>
<P>
	They create gorgeous images, but they're tremendously expensive  
to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. is waiting for manufacturers to figure out cheaper  
ways to build flat panel displays before even trying to get in to 
the market, said Sony technical service manager Dan King. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a normal, everyday customer, you and I are not going to pay  
for a flat panel today,'' said King. ``We feel it's going to be a 
few years before these are really ready for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Werner, editor of Information Display Magazine, said his  
industry always gets very excited by the new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that old cathode ray tube refuses to go away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Werner said analysts were predicting cathode  
ray tubes would be near obsolete by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That year keeps going further and further into the future,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Be Sentenced in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shelley Finkel makes the case to keep Mike  
Tyson out of jail sound quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a minor accident,'' said Finkel, Tyson's boxing  
advisor. ``The two defendants settled with him and said they wanted 
him to get help, and that's what happened. What more could you 
ask?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor paints a darker picture. Montgomery County  
State's Attorney Douglas Gansler has called Tyson a bully who 
committed ``road rage'' and is ``nothing less than a time bomb 
buried in our back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion that counts will be that of Judge Stephen Johnson,  
who on Friday will determine whether Tyson's latest comeback is 
over after just one fight. Johnson will sentence the fighter on two 
counts of second-degree assault -- and in turn will trigger a 
decision in Indiana on whether Tyson violated his probation for a 
1991 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to jail here, it's much, much more likely he'll go  
to jail there,'' said Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after  
a minor three-car accident in the Washington suburb of 
Gaithersburg, Md. On Dec. 1, Tyson pleaded no-contest -- meaning he 
neither protests the assault charges nor admits guilt -- and could 
receive up to 20 years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, were paid  
an undisclosed amount to avoid a civil suit shortly before Tyson's 
plea. Both will be present Friday, ready to tell the judge that 
they feel Tyson shouldn't go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any inference that we've been purchased or bribed is off the  
wall,'' said Saucedo's lawyer, Glenn Culpepper. ``From the very 
beginning, my client said he didn't want him to convicted, he 
wanted him to be helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel, who will ask for probation, plans to call character  
witnesses, including one from a Washington homeless shelter where 
Tyson has been doing volunteer work. He will also point out Tyson's 
goodwill acts while training in Arizona -- he visited teen-age 
inmates and paid for the funeral of a 2-year-old girl shot to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who lives in Bethesda, Md., is undergoing therapy at  
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that his actions speak for themselves. You're seeing a  
different Mike,'' Finkel said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Gansler will delve deep into Tyson's background,  
where he found plenty to work with. His report to the judge details 
Tyson's rape conviction in Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a 
juvenile, as well as the infamous fight in which Tyson bit off part 
of Evander Holyfield's ear in June 1997. Tyson subsequently had his 
boxing license revoked for a year before returning to knock out 
Francois Botha in a comeback bout last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also quoted a November Playboy interview in which Tyson  
called himself a ``hateful individual'' and said, ``I know I'm 
going to blow one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The state need go no further than the defendant's own  
statements to arrive at the conclusion that (he) is not only 
volatile, but dangerous,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	What Gansler cannot do is ask the judge to put Tyson in jail.  
The no-contest plea agreement negotiated by Gansler's predecessor 
forbids that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler doesn't like that agreement. So he's been publicly  
saying Tyson should go to jail while telling the judge that Tyson 
should be sentenced to a ``period of executed incarceration,'' 
which technically could mean home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a legal mumbo-jumble,'' Gansler said.

<HEADLINE> Astros Sign Reliever Wagner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Billy Wagner received one of the largest raises  
in baseball history Wednesday when he avoided arbitration with the 
Houston Astros by agreeing to a $10.3 million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The reliever, who has just 2 years, 139 days of major league  
service, made $280,000 last year and $185,000 in 1997 after signing 
for the minimum $109,000 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His new contract calls for salaries of $2.1 million this year,  
$3.2 million in 2000 and $5 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't something we had to do,'' Astros general manager  
Gerry Hunsicker said. ``This is a very unusual signing for this 
franchise. It is unprecedented given the fact Billy has only 
completed two full seasons of service in the major leagues. But 
we're dealing with a very unusual young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, 27, was seventh in the NL with 30 saves last season, the  
third-highest single-season total in Astros history. He achieved 
the total despite missing nearly a month after he was struck in the 
head July 15 by a liner off the bat of Phoenix's Kelly Stinnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure makes it a lot easier to go out there and take a line  
drive,'' Wagner said. ``One minute you're looking at near death and 
the next minute you're looking a three-year deal. I don't know how 
to explain it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, whose fastball regularly reaches 100 mph, was tops among  
NL relievers last year in strikeouts per nine innings (14.6). He is 
averaging 13.6 per nine innings during his career and has 62 saves, 
fourth on Houston career list. 
</P>
<P>
	He converted 30 of 35 save chances last year, including 19  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's emerged as one of the top closers in all of baseball,''  
Hunsicker said. ``Certainly I think in our industry the two things 
that generate the most excitement are home runs and strikeouts. And 
nobody strikes out people better than Billy Wagner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner fanned 97 in 60 innings last season, walking 25. He went  
4-3 with a 2.70 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win championships without a reliable closer, and so  
having someone with a special talent like Billy Wagner and knowing 
he's part of this franchise for the years to come is certainly 
comforting,'' Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner has been working during the offseason on perfecting a  
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable with it,'' he said. ``I've spent hours,  
days working on it and trying to figure what I can do with it. I 
expect to throw a higher number of sliders and changeups. But I'm 
not going to leave my bread and butter. I didn't make it to the big 
leagues on a changeup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had asked for $3.3 million in arbitration and had been  
offered $2 million. He became as eligible as a ``Super 2,'' one of 
the players with 2-to-3 years of major league service whose 
arbitration rights were restored as part of the 1990 lockout 
settlement. As part of the deal, the top 17 percent by service of 
those with 2-to-3 years in the majors can go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of percentage of total dollars in a new deal compared  
to an old one, the largest raise ever came last March. Boston 
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who made $150,000 in 1997 when he won 
the AL Rookie of the Year award, agreed to a $23.25 million, 
five-year contract with two team options that could make the deal 
worth $44.25 million over seven years.

<HEADLINE> Alien Species Clinton Is Targeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Among alien species causing economic and environmental problems  
in the United States: 
</P>
<P>
	--Zebra mussel, which has clogged pipes and caused nearly $5  
billion in damage since arriving in the Great Lakes aboard 
freighters from central Asia. It has since spread across 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brown tree snake, from Indonesia, which has overrun much of  
Guam and destroyed most of its native birds and now is threatening 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	--Asian long-horned beetle, burrowed in wooden shipping crates  
from China, which devoured thousands of maple trees that lined the 
streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Chicago, forcing many to be cut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	--Green crab, a native of the European North Atlantic, it is  
threatening native marine life in San Francisco Bay and as far 
north as Washington state and waters off New England. Its voracious 
appetite threatens native shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tamarisk, small water sucking tree from Eurasia, which is  
threatening the water balance across much of the arid Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miconia plant from Latin America, which has become, say some  
biologists, ``the greatest single threat to Hawaii's tropical 
forest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Chinese mitten crab, believed to have migrated across the  
Pacific in freighters' ballast water, which has multiplied in the 
San Francisco Bay and its delta area, eating smaller marine life 
and burrowing into flood-control levies.

	``By Your Side'' (Columbia) -- The Black Crowes  

</P>
<P>
	The Black Crowes are back.  
</P>
<P>
	Back from personal and business problems that plunged the band  
into an ill-advised two-album excursion into psychedelic-tinged 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Back into the groove that highlighted their first two albums and  
made the Atlanta-based band the next step from the early Rod 
Stewart/Jeff Beck collaborations and early Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	``By Your Side,'' the Crowes' fifth album, strips away the  
artifice and shows the band doing what it does best -- clicking into 
irresistible boogie grooves given an edge by lead singer Chris 
Robinson's raspy drawl and brother and lead guitarist Rich's 
straight-ahead slide style. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ``Go Faster'' blows the album out of the gate. Rich  
Robinson follows up with one of his best slide performances to date 
on the rocker ``Kicking My Heart Around.'' And the addition of an 
electric organ on ``Then She Said My Name'' balances all the heavy 
stuff with just the right amount of funk. 
</P>
<P>
	There aren't any ballads on this effort, surprising since one of  
the band's biggest hits was ``She Talks to Angels.'' And the sense 
of fun that was apparent on their debut ``Shake Your Money Maker'' 
is missing here, as is the grittiness and emotional rawness that 
followed on ``The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion.'' But 
``By Your Side'' is a step back in the right direction.

	``Translucent Soul'' (Philo/Rounder Records) -- Ellis Paul  

</P>
<P>
	How can you not like Ellis Paul's latest CD, ``Translucent  
Soul?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does it have the scintillating vocals, intriguing chord  
structures and honest lyrics of Paul's three earlier efforts, but 
it also carries a freshness that sets the up-and-coming folk singer 
well apart from his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tale of faith, ``Angel in Manhattan,'' alone is worth the  
cost of the CD. But songs like the title track, which explores 
love, friendship and human relations, and ``She Loves a Girl,'' a 
look at same-sex relationships, soar where few singers dare fly in 
these days of musical clones. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul takes an introspective look at his recently dissolved  
marriage, loneliness, and other issues on tracks like ``Did I Ever 
Know You?'' ``Take Me Down'' and ``I Won't Cry Over You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he offers his listeners hope with ``The World Ain't Slowing  
Down,'' and ``Live in the Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Translucent Soul'' is Paul's best work to date. The next can't  
come soon enough from one of the folk world's most articulate 
messengers.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt will not  
seek the presidency in 2000, avoiding a bitter primary fight 
against Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Several advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity Tuesday,  
said he planned to inform Gore in a private meeting this morning 
before making his decision public at an evening meeting of House 
Democrats, most of whom urged the Missouri lawmaker to remain in 
Congress and help eliminate the Republicans' paper-thin hold on the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take back the House, but it's going to take all of our  
attention and all of our money,'' said Democratic strategist Dane 
Strother. ``Now we don't have to worry about any of that being 
diverted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now Gore doesn't have to worry about Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	Flying to New Hampshire today, Gore told reporters he had a  
``very productive and warm and cordial breakfast'' with Gephardt 
but declined to say what Gephardt had told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are close friends and allies and in support of the same  
goals for the country, and whatever decision he makes, he will 
offer great service to the people of the United States. I have 
nothing but admiration for his talent and skills,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his own fund-raising operation and network of allies,  
Gephardt stood as the greatest threat to the vice president's White 
House ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has got to be very good news for the Democratic Party and  
it's good news for us,'' said Gore strategist Bob Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's decision was not a surprise. He was less inclined to  
run for the White House after Democrats fared surprisingly well in 
the November elections and pulled to within six seats of regaining 
control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies of Gephardt, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
determined that winning back the House was as important to 
Democratic initiatives as retaining the White House. And he worried 
that a divisive primary would hurt the party's chances in both. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also realized he had a better shot at becoming speaker  
than president, several Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to be daunting for Gephardt to see Gore sitting in his  
way,'' Strother said. ``We've never not nominated a sitting vice 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has most of the advantages of an incumbent: He flies Air  
Force Two from coast to coast, meets with a network of activists 
and donors beholden to the White House and taps President Clinton's 
political operation at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore will not be unopposed. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, a Hall of Fame professional basketball player, is 
challenging Gore for the nomination. Sen. John Kerry of 
Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson are 
considering races. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats suggested Bradley could benefit by Gephardt's  
withdrawal if no other Democrat enters the race to split any 
anti-Gore votes. The vice president's advisers say the sentiment 
against Gore isn't strong enough to buoy Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, praised Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could do practically any job in American he chose. If he  
chooses to stay in the House and seek to be speaker, I'll do 
everything I can to help him be speaker,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's spokesman said the senator will base his decision about  
a presidential run on a number of political and personal factors, 
including, in a small way, Gephardt's decision.

<HEADLINE> GAO Blasts Major Airline Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The alliance between Northwest Airlines and  
Continental Airlines could cut competition and boost airfares in 63 
cities visited by 2 million passengers annually, according to the 
General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	A new GAO report released this week says passengers at  
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport have less at stake than 
those in some other cities, mainly because Continental has only 
limited service at the Northwest fortress hub. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report suggests that Northwest and Continental have  
overstated the benefits and understated the risks for consumers of 
their partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Steenland, the airline's executive vice president,  
disagreed Tuesday, saying the alliance will create 17,000 online 
flight opportunities in 10,000 markets, benefiting 79 million 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aggregate benefits this generates in terms of improved  
service to consumers is worth $600 million a year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Northwest's estimate of the value of more flight  
opportunities, better connections and travel times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwest-Continental alliance is being reviewed by the U.S.  
Department of Transportation and the U.S. Justice Department. 
Justice officials are suing to challenge Eagan-based Northwest's 
acquisition of a majority stake in Houston-based Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Northwest acquired 8.7 million shares of  
Continental stock for $465 million, but assured government 
officials the deal was structured to give Northwest less than a 
controlling interest in Continental. The two airlines have 
proceeded to merge their frequent flier programs and arrange to 
pass passengers and baggage back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO acknowledged that the Northwest-Continental alliance and  
two other alliances -- between Delta Air Lines and United and 
between American Airlines and US Airways -- might offer consumers 
ready access to more routes, new markets and the benefits of 
combined frequent flier plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency's analysis found that the Northwest-Continental  
alliance would serve considerably fewer new routes than the 
airlines projected -- 74 city pairs by the GAO's estimate against 
more than 2,000 by the airlines' estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also said Northwest and Continental underplayed the  
revenue opportunities if the two airlines were to choose to 
decrease competition in markets they both served before their 
partnership -- a strategy both airlines deny they intend to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland disagreed. ``Northwest and Continental are competitive  
airlines as much after the alliance as before the alliance. We're 
not allowed to coordinate on price. We're not allowed to coordinate 
on schedules.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Says Plant Is Beyond Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Engineers today explored the  
blast-damaged power plant at the Ford Motor Co. River Rouge complex 
as a company official announced the building was beyond repair and 
would be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the sprawling complex's 10,000 employees had been  
ordered to stay home a day after the blast killed one man, 
critically injured 15 others and knocked out electrical service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally destroyed,'' River Rouge manager Art Janes said  
at a news conference this afternoon. He said the mangled plant 
would be razed after the investigation into the blast was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Edison will provide power for the complex, and the  
automaker hoped to have full electricity back by the end of the 
week, he said. Meanwhile, a new separate power plant for the Rouge 
complex already was under construction and is scheduled to be in 
operation in 1 1/2 to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some limited work resumed at the complex today, with generators  
supplying the power, but the loss of most of its production had 
already slowed work at Ford assembly plants elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to the power plant included ``substantial reinforced  
concrete blown loose by the blast,'' as well as movement in at 
least one of its towering smokestacks, Dearborn police Chief Ron 
Deziel said. Other damage included a caved-in roof and mounds of 
debris, Fire Chief Jack McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unstable sections will have to be demolished and the damaged  
smokestack will have to be reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
	A safety assessment team checked the power house this morning to  
determine if investigators could safely enter to look for the cause 
of the explosion. Investigators won't be able to get in until 
Thursday, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety is paramount for us, we want to make sure it's  
structurally sound,'' Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey said earlier 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials have refused to speculate about what caused the  
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre River Rouge complex was once the world's largest  
auto plant and was the home of the Model T. The power house 
produced enough electricity to serve a city the size of Boston, 
Ford has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The power station served six Ford factories in the complex: a  
Mustang assembly plant and parts factories that make such things as 
engines, doors, hoods and glass. Its stamping plant supplies 16 of 
the No. 2 automaker's 20 North America assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford brought in generators Tuesday, and Sharkey said partial  
production resumed today in three factories: the fuel tank area of 
the engine plant, part of the stamping plant and part of the frame 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're slowly starting to ramp back up,'' Sharkey said. He  
couldn't say how many employees were on the job today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the blast, production was slowed Tuesday at a number  
of Ford plants across the country. Work hours were trimmed at 
assembly plants in Wayne, where Escorts are built; Wixom, where 
Lincoln's Town Car and Continental are built; Lorain, Ohio, where 
Ford Econoline vans are made; and St. Thomas, Ontario. All but the 
Wixom plant were to resume full production today. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime shifts were halted Tuesday at four other plants -- in  
Kansas City, Mo., Norfolk, Va., Oakville, Ontario, and St. Paul, 
Minn. -- that make Ford pickup trucks. Only the St. Paul plant was 
to resume overtime shifts today.

<HEADLINE> Glenn Autobiography Due Out in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- John Glenn has signed with Bantam  
Books to write his autobiography, due out this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York publisher announced the deal today. Bantam  
spokeswoman Barb Burg would not disclose how much Glenn would be 
paid for the as-yet-untitled book. ``We never do,'' she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, 77, the first American to orbit the Earth back in 1962,  
returned to space last October aboard the shuttle Discovery. The 
book will chronicle both flights, as well as the astronaut's 
55-year marriage to Annie Glenn and his 24 years as a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been working on it and kept diaries along the way,'' Burg  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months leading up to his flight as the oldest person ever  
in space, Glenn received numerous offers to write his memoir, so 
many that he hired a literary agent to field the calls.

<HEADLINE> New Air Travel Fees Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation is expected to have a $6.8 billion  
surplus in its aviation trust fund as of Sept. 30, but that's not 
stopping the Clinton administration from proposing extra aviation 
taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill  
being proposed today, the Transportation Department wants to let 
cities and states raise an airport construction tax on tickets from 
$3 to $5 per stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's new budget also proposes imposing $1.5 billion  
in user fees for air traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the transportation secretary has declared that  
he will fight attempts to siphon the balance out of the burgeoning 
aviation trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	That money, generated by different ticket taxes, is supposed to  
be used for airport construction and other aviation improvements. 
President Clinton wants to keep the multibillion-dollar surplus to 
balance shortfalls in the federal budget -- the kind of financial 
maneuver he said was ``as wrong as it can be'' while he was 
governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's regrettable that with so substantial a balance in the  
aviation trust fund, the administration finds it necessary to 
impose new taxes on the traveling and shipping public,'' Edward 
Merlis, head of legislative affairs at the Air Transport 
Association, an airline trade group, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not spend the money you're collecting first, then  
determine if you need more, rather than imposing the taxes first 
and then figuring out where to spend it?'' Merlis said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bulk of the air traffic control fees probably would be  
levied against airlines, Merlis said some of the cost could trickle 
down to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing his department's $45.5 billion fiscal 2000 budget  
on Monday, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said repeatedly 
that the administration supports ``record-level'' investment in 
aviation, but new taxes and fees are needed to make the system more 
user-based. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton would strongly oppose spending all of the money  
in the aviation trust fund, which some in Congress favor, because 
it would not be fiscally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to take much of this to the Congress and work out  
how we provide long-term, sustained funding for the aviation 
system,'' Slater said. ``But I think we can do that and I think we 
can provide record-level funds for that effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, much of the aviation system is already paid for by  
its users. 
</P>
<P>
	When passengers buy a ticket, they pay an 8 percent federal tax  
on the fare. In addition, they pay a $2 federal fee for each leg of 
the trip, which can add up on a round trip with several 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	All that revenue is deposited, along with freight and fuel  
taxes, in the federal Airport and Airway Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Transportation Department lets city and state  
governments assess a $3 airport construction tax. Known as the 
passenger facility charge, it can be used only for improvements at 
a local airport. Under current law, passengers cannot pay more than 
$12 in passenger facility charges per trip -- equal to four $3 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is proposing to raise the passenger facility  
charge cap to $5 per stop and $20 per ticket. The transportation 
budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 also proposes imposing 
$1.496 billion in aviation user fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget does not spell out how the program would work, but  
Slater was expected add details today during a speech in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the passenger facility charges would be retained by local  
governments, the new user fees would roll into the Airport and 
Airway Trust Fund -- an already burgeoning account. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sept. 30, the fund had a surplus of $4.3 billion. In the  
new budget, the administration projects the surplus will rise to 
$6.8 billion by Sept. 30, and to $8.2 billion by Sept. 30, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arkansas governor, Clinton complained about the federal  
government withholding gasoline tax receipts to ``make the federal 
budget deficit look smaller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress took that money from us under a solemn contract  
to turn right around and give it back to be spent only on roads -- 
federal highways,'' Clinton said. ``It is just as wrong as it can 
be, and we ought to stop it.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Are Now Toni Kukoc's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- For Toni Kukoc, the days of being the  
much-chastised third option are over. 
</P>
<P>
	No more screaming from coach Phil Jackson, no more coming off  
the bench as the Chicago Bulls' sixth man, no more deferring to 
Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	On this remodeled team, Kukoc is the man, the go-to guy in what  
will surely be a season filled with losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc wears a look of relief these days, glad he was part of  
three championship teams but eager to move on in this new role. It 
means more leadership, more scoring and more shots for the 
Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need a reminder of the past, I can just look up here,''  
Kukoc says of the championship banners hanging on the walls at the 
Bulls' practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc scored 32 points in the Bulls' exhibition loss to Indiana  
earlier this week, a mixture of jump shots -- a part of his game 
that can be erratic -- and long-armed, left-handed drives to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows the Bulls' triangle offense as well as anyone and  
how to make it work, and is being counted on by rookie coach Tim 
Floyd to convey his knowledge to a host of new teammates who are 
still trying to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been interesting to watch,'' Floyd said Thursday. ``From  
a guy who was silent the first week who now seems more pronounced 
and vocal on the floor, not only with the older guys but with our 
newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc was known as ``The Waiter'' during his playing days in  
Europe for his ability to serve other players with clever, no-look 
passes. He still lists Magic Johnson, perhaps the greatest passer 
in NBA history, as the one player he'd like to face one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toni is one of the most skilled players in the league. And now  
he has to step up and be a leader,'' said new teammate Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been there and been through it, and he's going to be a  
source of strength for a young team learning and growing. He has to 
step into that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, voted the NBA's best sixth man in 1995-96 when the Bulls  
won an NBA-record 72 regular-season games, never fashioned himself 
as anything but a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he joined the Bulls, Jordan retired for the first time and  
Kukoc was crushed because it appeared his dream of playing with the 
world's best was over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan returned and the Bulls went on to three  
championships. Kukoc took his verbal beatings from Jordan and 
Jackson. With Floyd, the Bulls may not win as many games, but 
Kukoc's ears won't be ringing as much, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Jackson) wanted us to be better, but I can get it out of  
myself without being yelled at,'' Kukoc said during the Bulls' 
abbreviated training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had plenty of respect for Phil, but I didn't need the  
yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who averaged 13.3 points last season when he started 52  
games, is ready for the added burden, starting with Friday's opener 
in Utah, where the Bulls clinched the title last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be nights when the offense won't click and  
somebody will have to step up,'' he said. ``And most of all, the 
guys will be counting on me. ... I'm ready to take the 
responsibility. I didn't do it much the last five years.''

<HEADLINE> Barnett Wants Huskies Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel's successor at Colorado was  
one of four coaches Wednesday to ask the NCAA to hand a severe 
penalty to the new Washington coach for recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Barnett, who succeeded Neuheisel last month, said he joined  
Colorado State's Sonny Lubick, Washington State's Mike Price and 
Oregon's Mike Bellotti in signing a letter ``protesting what the 
punishment might be for Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett said the group ``petitioned the NCAA to make this  
punishment fit the crime, because it won't. They'll get their hands 
slapped and they'll be reinstated. That's just the way it's done. I 
just think that's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel admitted that Washington assistant coaches were in the  
homes of four prospects on Sunday, in violation of an NCAA ban on 
in-home recruiting visits on Sunday. The school turned itself in to 
the Pac-10 because of the infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``All four of us lost kids that day to Washington,'' Barnett  
said. ``And that rule is a pretty well-known rule. It's not a new 
rule. We lost a player that Washington contacted on Sunday -- 
(defensive back) Chris Massey (of Moreno Valley, Calif.).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule has been in effect since 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Massey, who earlier gave Colorado a verbal commitment, signed  
instead with the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sonny called me and asked me what I thought about this,''  
Barnett said. ``He asked if I would join him in writing a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the last thing I want to do is make a big deal out of  
this. I do not want to start a brushfire between me and Rick 
Neuheisel. It's an issue, we're addressing it, and life will go 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A potentially more serious charge, however, could result from  
Barnett's suggestion that Neuheisel tampered with the Buffaloes' 
roster by phoning some of his former players. Neuheisel labeled 
that charge as false, saying he merely said goodbye to some of his 
former athletes.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Question Blumenthal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preparing a final push for live testimony at  
the impeachment trial, House prosecutors today wrapped up private 
questioning of witnesses with a short deposition of White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal. Republicans and Democrats battled over a 
proposal to formally accuse President Clinton of wrongdoing before 
ending the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal's deposition, which lasted less than four hours with  
breaks, marked the last of three videotaped sessions conducted by 
Republican prosecutors hoping to bolster their case that witnesses 
should be called to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the public will be well served and history will be  
well served if we can have what occurred today (at the deposition) 
before the public. ... Then everyone can vote their conscience and 
that would be a good thing for America,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C., said after emerging from the Blumenthal deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned some new things,'' added Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.,  
who led the questioning. They were barred by Senate rules from 
describing the testimony further. 
</P>
<P>
	While House prosecutors made clear their intention ask the  
Senate to call witnesses, senators who viewed Monica Lewinsky's 
videotape testimony, which the prosecutors completed on Monday, 
showed little enthusiasm for hearing her in person. 
</P>
<P>
	And Senate Democrats emerged from a closed-door caucus today  
promising opposition to both live witnesses and any Republican plan 
for a formal declaration of wrongdoing by the president as a 
prelude to a final vote on articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and other Democrats said  
any so-called ``finding of fact'' would be unconstitutional. 
Daschle also said that if the Senate chooses to air the videotaped 
depositions of Ms. Lewinsky and others, they should be aired in 
their entirety. ``We should take it all or we shouldn't take any of 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to allay Democratic concerns that Clinton would claim  
victory if the trial ended in acquittal, White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart suggested today that Clinton would 
``continue to take responsibility for the inappropriate nature of 
his behavior. That will last forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a certain sense of relief here at the White  
House if this process were to end quickly and go away. But I don't 
think that there's anybody here who thinks anything out of this 
process constitutes a victory,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart also appealed for the videotaped depositions to remain  
secret. ``We've seen what has happened in the past when depositions 
and videotapes have been released -- it's created sort of a frenzy. 
We don't think that needs to be repeated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Majority Leader Trent Lott and several other  
Republican senators were circulating draft language for a letter 
that would invite the president to appear before the Senate before 
the trial ends, according to Lott spokesman John Czwartacki. The 
House sought permission for such a letter last week, but the White 
House has said repeatedly Clinton would not accept such an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors who questioned presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan at the Capitol on Tuesday elicited some testimony they felt 
could help their case for live testimony, sources familiar with his 
deposition said. Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney who found 
Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York, altered his account of a breakfast 
meeting with the former White House intern that prosecutors have 
focused on, according to the sources, who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Blumenthal, his value in the Senate trial rests in his  
testimony about a conversation at the start of the Lewinsky scandal 
last year. The aide quoted Clinton as saying he had rebuffed Ms. 
Lewinsky after she ``came at me and made a sexual demand on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that  
she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it 
and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she 
wouldn't be the stalker anymore,'' Blumenthal told the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``stalker'' moniker swiftly became a news story staple,  
always attributed to unidentified sources. In grand jury testimony, 
Blumenthal denied having passed along the information to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers are trying to show that Clinton's motive was to  
feed a false account to his aides that would find its way into the 
investigation of prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Republicans looking to the end of the  
impeachment trial are weighing a formal declaration that Clinton 
``willfully provided false and misleading testimony'' to Starr's 
grand jury last summer, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are laboring over a draft ``fact-finding''  
document that says Clinton engaged in a course of conduct designed 
to ``alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of 
evidence and testimony'' in the sexual harassment lawsuit that 
Paula Jones filed against him, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the two forms of the proposal makes a finding that  
Clinton committed perjury or obstructed justice, as alleged in the 
articles of impeachment passed by the House. Republicans hope to 
attract the support of at least a few Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Olympia Snowe said  
today the final disposition of the case should include a Senate 
recognition that Clinton committed wrongdoing -- even though there 
are not enough votes to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Hatch said the  
best way would be for the Senate to adjourn the trial with a 
finding ``that says he did lie under oath and he did commit 
obstruction of justice. You don't accuse him of any criminal 
activity ... (but) recognize the House vote as the highest form of 
condemnation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont spoke dismissively  
of such Republican efforts. ``They have more exit strategies than 
they have votes,'' Leahy said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Enters New York Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Their tactics may differ, but long-distance  
giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. have both shown this week 
that they're determined to pry open the local telephone monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom said Wednesday it has begun offering local service  
across most of New York state. It will lease phone lines from Bell 
Atlantic, which holds a regional monopoly in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came just two days after AT&AMP;T joined forces  
with Time Warner Inc., expanding its plan to bypass phone 
monopolies around the country by sending calls over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments could mark a new phase in a turf war between  
local and long-distance companies that began in 1996 after Congress 
passed laws designed to enhance competition. That effort has 
largely failed and most consumers still have only one choice for 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Two consumer groups -- Consumers Union and the Consumer  
Federation of America -- reported Wednesday that local and 
long-distance rates have both remained relatively steady since the 
law was passed. Both groups had lobbied against the law. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's local service will be offered in the New York  
City area at a 5 percent discount to Bell Atlantic prices or in a 
flat-rate package of $14.99 for 100 calls, said spokeswoman Elena 
French. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of New York City, there is no discount. A 100-call  
package would cost $19.99 a month. Because the population is less 
dense than in the city, Bell Atlantic is charging more to lease 
those lines, French said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic was quick to declare Wednesday that the  
arrangement proves that its market is open to competition -- a 
regulatory prerequisite for local phone companies to begin selling 
long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say this is a stamp of approval by MCI WorldCom on  
Bell Atlantic having opened up completely to (federal) standards,'' 
said Jim Freeze, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the telecommunications reform law was passed three  
years ago, long-distance operators still accuse the local 
monopolies, known as Baby Bells, of denying them easy access to 
their calling networks. For their part, the Baby Bells have 
bristled at a mountain of government requirements keeping them out 
of long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're now in the frustrating position of doing is meeting  
a whole series of tests and requirements, 600-to-700 pages ... 
proving that markets are open,'' said Bell Atlantic president James 
G. Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, the MCI WorldCom deal may enable Bell Atlantic  
to apply as soon as this spring for clearance to sell long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although much delayed, this is exactly what the  
telecommunications act contemplated three years ago, so I'm happy 
to get on with it,'' said Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast with MCI WorldCom's approach, AT&AMP;T has chosen to  
circumvent the traditional telephone infrastructure and use cable 
TV wires to offer local and long-distance calling and high-speed 
Internet connections.. 
</P>
<P>
	With Time Warner on board, AT&AMP;T is now pursuing its strategy  
with help from the two largest cable companies in the country. Last 
year AT&AMP;T agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc. The combination 
could eventually serve 40 percent of American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike MCI WorldCom's New York service, AT&AMP;T's local  
offerings aren't expected to begin for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., already offers local  
calling to business customers in more than 100 markets across the 
country, and offers limited local residential service in Illinois, 
Michigan and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Bell Atlantic actually marks the second foray into  
New York's local-calling market by MCI, which was acquired by 
WorldCom last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A different arrangement with Bell Atlantic in 1997 proved  
unprofitable and was scrapped after just a few months. The new 
relationship will allow MCI WorldCom to lease customer phone lines 
as needed rather than pay for access to the entire Bell Atlantic 
network in New York.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Home Opener Set To Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies' home  
opener has been spared from being disrupted by a labor dispute 
involving GM Place arena employees. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, however, is guaranteeing that future Grizzlies games  
won't be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents about 500 arena employees, including  
security, ushers, facility and housekeeping staff, has assured Orca 
Bay Sports and Entertainment that it will take no strike action 
until the two sides meet with a mediator on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The understanding is no job action and a meeting with (the  
mediator) on Tuesday is the next step,'' confirmed Kevin Gass, 
spokesman for Orca Bay, which owns the Grizzlies, GM Place and the 
NHL's Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the union, which issued 72-hour strike notice last  
Monday, had threatened to strike this Monday's home opener against 
the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a deal or movement at the bargaining table on Tuesday,  
the union may bring back its strike threat for following GM Place 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies host the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 10 and  
Indiana Pacers on Feb. 11. The Canucks are in the midst of a 
five-game road trip, and their next scheduled home game is Feb. 13 
against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Concession workers settled their own contract in December, but  
the GM Place employees union president said they would honor the 
picket line. 
</P>
<P>
	Under British Columbia laws, replacement workers could not be  
brought in to fill the jobs of striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players would have to play, abiding by the no-strike,  
no-lockout provisions included in the new collective bargaining 
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Buys Liquidating Caldor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Midwestern retailer Kohl's Corp. is buying  
33 stores, all but one of them in New York, from Caldor Corp., 
which is being liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
	The other store is in Baltimore. Terms of the deal were not  
disclosed, and the sale is subject to approval of the bankruptcy 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldor announced Jan. 22 it was closing for good after more than  
three years in bankruptcy court protection. Shortly before that 
announcement, the New Haven Register reported the company was in 
negotiations with Kohl's, Kmart and Target about the possible sale 
of some stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldor, a $2.5 billion discount retailer with about 20,000  
employees, operated 145 stores in nine East Coast and Mid-Atlantic 
states including Connecticut and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Going-out-of-business sales at Caldor stores are expected to  
begin in several weeks. Kohl's said it plans to remodel the stores 
it purchases and reopen them in spring 2000.

<HEADLINE> Case Against Gun Industry Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Negligent marketing practices by the firearms  
industry in the South resulted in tragic shootings on the streets 
of New York City, a lawyer charged today during closing arguments 
at an unprecedented gun trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of the industry are what put the guns into the  
hands of the shooters who, tragically, shot the victims in this 
case,'' said Elisa Barnes. He is the attorney for seven plaintiffs 
seeking damages of about $2 million each in their lawsuit against 
handgun makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was to give its closing argument later in the day.  
Deliberations were expected to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 20 defendants include virtually all major American  
handgun manufacturers and several small and specialty firms. Last 
week, U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein dropped 15 wholesalers 
from the suit after expressing doubts about their liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers deny flooding the market and say they only  
meet a legal and legitimate demand for their products. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial has been closely watched as a test-run for similar  
lawsuits already filed or planned by various cities. Chicago, New 
Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami-Dade County are suing the 
industry; Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore are among those 
considering the move. 
</P>
<P>
	During the month-long trial, the plaintiffs argued that gun  
manufacturers oversupply Southern states with lenient gun laws so 
the excess flows to states with stiffer laws like New York, leading 
to underground trafficking in illegal guns, and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``This huge pool (of handguns) is like toxic waste,'' Barnes  
told the jury. ``It's been sent down the river by different 
companies.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fighting for Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is directing an expansion of  
government efforts to combat the growing economic and environmental 
threat posed by the invasion of exotic foreign plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	These predatory species, such as the zebra mussel that first  
surfaced in the Great Lakes and the Asian long-horned beetle that 
attacked maple trees in Chicago and New York, have caused in many 
cases widespread economic and ecological harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the growing threat from non-native species, Clinton was  
signing an executive order today directing agencies to ``mobilize 
the federal government to defend against these aggressive predators 
and pests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order creates a new interagency Invasive Species Council  
that within 18 months is to develop a broad management plan to 
minimize the economic, ecological and human health impacts of these 
species and keep them from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposed budget, sent to Congress earlier in the  
week, also calls for spending an additional $29 million on 
combating invasive species and on research on restoring damaged 
ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	Exotic species -- from non-native fish to various plants, bugs  
and shellfish -- have found their way into the country in numerous 
ways, such as by clinging to ships, burrowing into wooden shipping 
crates, in food, aboard aircraft or in water discharged from 
foreign freighters. 
</P>
<P>
	These unwanted pests ``threaten to wreak major economic and  
environmental havoc'' unless they are brought under control or kept 
out of the country altogether, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman along with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and  
Commerce Secretary William Daley will chair the new council, White 
House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said the costs to habitat and the economy from such  
invaders ``are racing out of control'' as the non-native species in 
many cases overpower native species and alter regional ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists estimate that more than 6,000 plants and animals have  
been introduced into the United States from abroad by accident or 
misguided intentions. Many of these species enter the country in 
ballast water that is discharged from freighters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bay Delta area around San Francisco alone, there have  
been 234 non-native exotic species recorded, with a new species 
entering the bay every 14 days, says Linda Sheehan of the Center 
for Marine Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exotic species are wreaking havoc on our coastal ecosystems,''  
Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of West Coast environmentalists recently petitioned the  
Environmental Protection Agency to regulate ballast water 
discharges from ships, calling such discharges ``the single largest 
cause of exotic species invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no reply to the petition from the EPA.  
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere has the potential damage from invading species been more  
dramatically demonstrated than with the East Asian longhorned 
beetles. It made headlines by devouring thousands of maple trees 
that lined the streets of Chicago and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetle apparently had entered the country in wooden shipping  
crates from its native China. Beginning in mid-December, new 
regulations required such crates to be heated and chemically 
treated to kill the beetle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Great Lakes, the zebra mussel, which was believed to have  
entered the United States in ballast water aboard ships, has 
dramatically altered the ecosystem and spread as far away as 
Oklahoma since the mollusk was first reported in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from the zebra mussel has been put as high as $5 billion,  
officials said. It has clogged water supplies, power station intake 
pipes and caused problems for factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-native plants already have infested more than 100 million  
acres, causing problems for farmers and reducing agricultural 
yields, according to the Agriculture Department. One plant, the 
leafy spurge, which is native to Europe and Asia, has been blamed 
for widespread damage to grazing areas in Wyoming, Montana and the 
Dakotas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Alien Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Troublesome alien species such as the Chinese  
mitten crab and the voracious Asian long-horned beetle are costing 
Americans tens of billions of dollars and threatening entire 
ecosystems. President Clinton on Wednesday promised a government 
counteroffensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order to expand federal efforts to  
combat the growing problems created by the quiet influx of foreign 
plants and animals into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Three senior administration officials, who will head a new  
interagency Invasive Species Council, sought to draw attention to 
the magnitude of the problem with a news conference at the National 
Geographic Society museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that we are being invaded by alien  
species. ... We could call this order the 'X-Files' order,'' said 
Commerce Undersecretary James Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs to habitat and the economy are racing out of  
control,'' added Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Congress passed a law requiring the government  
to address the issue of non-native species, but the problem has 
only become worse, ecologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of alien species established in the United  
States. No one really knows the exact count. And (the number) is 
rapidly growing,'' said Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson, a 
leading expert on invasive animal and plant species. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson showed slides of a ``rogue's gallery'' of alien  
predators, including the leafy spurge, a weed from Eurasia that now 
plagues 3 million acres of rangeland across the West, and Europe's 
green crab, which threatens native shellfish in the San Francisco 
Bay and New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's executive order directs the Departments of  
Agriculture, Interior and Commerce, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard to coordinate better the efforts 
against invading species. And it calls on the new council to 
develop an alien species management plan within 18 months to blunt 
the economic, ecological and health impacts of these predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman promised ``a unified, all-out  
battle against unwanted plants and animal pests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senior administration officials acknowledged that the task  
will be difficult and -- in the end -- may succeed only through 
greater international cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulties are many, the officials acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, last month the Agriculture Department imposed a  
requirement that shipping crates coming in from China be heated and 
disinfected to kill Asian long-horned beetles. 
</P>
<P>
	Such crates are believed to have brought in the beetle, which  
gained notoriety by attacking thousands of maple trees that lined 
the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Chicago, forcing many to be cut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the new requirements, Glickman conceded he doesn't have  
enough inspectors to make sure of compliance. And the Chinese 
government has accused the United States of using the issue as a 
form of trade protection. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, officials acknowledge there are thousands of  
foreign species that are beneficial, and that the United States 
also has species that cause concerns when they migrate to other 
countries. Babbitt said the long-term answer is to resolve these 
issues through international agreements that would benefit all 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists, meanwhile, maintain the administration has  
been slow in regulating ballast discharges from freighters -- one of 
the major pathways for exotic aquatic organisms such as the Chinese 
mitten crab, green crab and Asian clam, which are threatening 
native marine life in San Francisco Bay and as far north as 
Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	These invaders, says Linda Sheehan of the Center for Marine  
Conservation in San Francisco, are driving out native crabs, clams 
and threatening the local oysters -- even burrowing and weakening 
levies for flood control. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of environmental groups and the Association of  
California Water Agencies has asked the EPA to regulate freighter 
ballast water discharges under the Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Wednesday there is no immediate  
plan to regulate such discharges, though they acknowledged that 
every minute 40,000 gallons of foreign ballast water -- and a 
multitude of non-native organisms -- are dumped into U.S. harbors 
from foreign freighters.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Are Now Toni Kukoc's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- For Toni Kukoc, the days of being the  
much-chastised third option are over. 
</P>
<P>
	No more screaming from coach Phil Jackson, no more coming off  
the bench as the Chicago Bulls' sixth man, no more deferring to 
Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	On this remodeled team, Kukoc is the man, the go-to guy in what  
will surely be a season filled with losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc wears a look of relief these days, glad he was part of  
three championship teams but eager to move on in this new role. It 
means more leadership, more scoring and more shots for the 
Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need a reminder of the past, I can just look up here,''  
Kukoc says of the championship banners hanging on the walls at the 
Bulls' practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc scored 32 points in the Bulls' exhibition loss to Indiana  
earlier this week, a mixture of jump shots -- a part of his game 
that can be erratic -- and long-armed, left-handed drives to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows the Bulls' triangle offense as well as anyone and  
how to make it work, and is being counted on by rookie coach Tim 
Floyd to convey his knowledge to a host of new teammates who are 
still trying to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been interesting to watch,'' Floyd said Thursday. ``From  
a guy who was silent the first week who now seems more pronounced 
and vocal on the floor, not only with the older guys but with our 
newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc was known as ``The Waiter'' during his playing days in  
Europe for his ability to serve other players with clever, no-look 
passes. He still lists Magic Johnson, perhaps the greatest passer 
in NBA history, as the one player he'd like to face one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toni is one of the most skilled players in the league. And now  
he has to step up and be a leader,'' said new teammate Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been there and been through it, and he's going to be a  
source of strength for a young team learning and growing. He has to 
step into that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, voted the NBA's best sixth man in 1995-96 when the Bulls  
won an NBA-record 72 regular-season games, never fashioned himself 
as anything but a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he joined the Bulls, Jordan retired for the first time and  
Kukoc was crushed because it appeared his dream of playing with the 
world's best was over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan returned and the Bulls went on to three  
championships. Kukoc took his verbal beatings from Jordan and 
Jackson. With Floyd, the Bulls may not win as many games, but 
Kukoc's ears won't be ringing as much, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Jackson) wanted us to be better, but I can get it out of  
myself without being yelled at,'' Kukoc said during the Bulls' 
abbreviated training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had plenty of respect for Phil, but I didn't need the  
yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who averaged 13.3 points last season when he started 52  
games, is ready for the added burden, starting with Friday's opener 
in Utah, where the Bulls clinched the title last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be nights when the offense won't click and  
somebody will have to step up,'' he said. ``And most of all, the 
guys will be counting on me. ... I'm ready to take the 
responsibility. I didn't do it much the last five years.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Would Raise Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under President Clinton's new budget  
proposals, companies and investors would face some 70 targeted tax 
increases and 16 loophole-closings in a plan aimed at raising $82 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	A substantial portion of the package is a 55 cent-a-pack  
cigarette tax increase that would raise $34.5 billion. Other 
proposed business tax increases and new taxes, however, have upset 
Wall Street, small businesses, manufacturers, insurance companies 
and other industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress rejected some of the same proposed tax increases last  
year, and they could run into trouble with lawmakers again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan is ``kind of picking pockets and not really  
accomplishing a great deal,'' Bruce Josten, executive vice 
president for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
said Tuesday. ``Congress is not going to be duped. ... The 
likelihood of these passing is not high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups expressed bafflement at Clinton proposing tax  
increases when the federal budget is expected to continue in 
surplus for the next 25 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are especially incensed by a proposal to tax  
companies on the punitive damages they pay to people who win civil 
suits against them. Under current law, companies are charged taxes 
on criminal fines they pay, but civil damages can be deducted as a 
business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be unfair to eliminate that deduction without  
``meaningful reform of the civil justice system,'' the National 
Association of Manufacturers said. The manufacturers and other 
industries believe the civil litigation system, especially for 
product liability cases, favors people who sue over the companies 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax change would bring the Treasury some $600 million over  
five years, the administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the business groups applauded Clinton's  
proposal to extend the corporate tax credit for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, meanwhile, is particularly keen about its plans  
for closing corporate tax loopholes and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it wants to force companies to pay taxes on  
``forward'' sales of corporate stock on which a payment is 
deferred. A company sells its stock ``forward'' by agreeing to 
issue its stock at a later date in exchange for future payments. If 
a stock is selling for $100 today and it was sold forward for $105 
three years from now, the $5 per-share difference would be taxed 
under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed business tax increases and new taxes are the flip  
side of -- and the suggested way to pay for -- Clinton's proposed 
$36.2 billion in tax breaks for groups ranging from stay-at-home 
parents to the steel industry. The breaks are tailored to social 
needs such as education, health insurance and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The securities industry maintained that some of the proposals  
would hurt the stock and bond markets and undermine some 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that the administration is proposing taxes  
that would raise the cost of capital for companies seeking (money) 
to expand and strengthen their businesses,'' said Marc Lackritz, 
president of the Securities Industry Association. ``A pro-investing 
tax policy is critical to sustaining the engine driving the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bond Market Association warned that the Clinton plan  
could deter needed investment in the nation's schools, hospitals 
and other infrastructure by raising borrowing costs for companies, 
states, cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, many of which are arcane, also include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Taxes on certain kinds of stock to prevent companies from  
avoiding taxes on the sale or spinoff of subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Closing a loophole in a way that would discourage some small  
businesses from converting to so-called subchapter S corporations, 
whose shareholders get tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Taxing the investment income of industry trade associations, a  
proposal sure to be unpopular in lobbyist-rich Washington.

<HEADLINE> Terry Bowden Settles With Auburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Terry Bowden will never have a chance to  
trash Auburn. If school officials get their way, neither will his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a settlement reached with Auburn, Terry Bowden and his  
wife are barred from criticizing the school. But Auburn isn't 
through dealing with the Bowdens -- the university is now trying to 
get out of its nationally televised Sept. 2 season opener against 
Bobby Bowden's Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the the final bit of Bowden business for Auburn,  
which has been trying for months to move past Bowden's ugly 
midseason resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, reached Monday, closes the door on Bowden's 5 1/2  
seasons at Auburn. He gets a lump sum payment of $620,000, a 
lakeside home for five years and two cars the ex-coach had before 
he resigned Oct. 23 after opening the season with a 1-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, he and his wife, Shyrl, agreed not to make  
``statements that could be construed as negative or derogatory 
toward Auburn, the Auburn athletics department or its employees or 
the Auburn Board of Trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was presented to us and I didn't have a problem with  
it,'' Terry Bowden told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``My 
wife and I are comfortable with the settlement and consider it the 
end of an ugly and disappointing situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bowdens' violate the agreement, they may be required to  
repay the $620,000, pay the $850,000 mortgage on the house, which 
is owned by the Auburn Alumni Association, and give back the cars, 
which he can keep for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn athletic director David Housel said the gag order was  
``strongly recommended'' by attorneys for both Bowden and the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally did not think it was that big of a deal,'' Housel  
said. ``But the attorneys thought it was a good idea so we included 
it. It was just a routine thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Housel also said Bowden's gag order was the first of its  
kind in his five years as Auburn athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowdens' deal with the university took effect Monday, the  
same day new coach Tommy Tuberville signed a contract with the 
school worth at least $770,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Auburn will try to help Tuberville avoid the game against  
his predecessor's father. Auburn and Florida State had originally 
agreed to the Sept. 2 game, which was billed as the first Division 
I-A showdown of father and son on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Terry Bowden's resignation, the game has lost its luster.  
The Mobile Register initially reported Wednesday that Auburn was 
trying to get out of the game at a cost to Auburn of up to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not accurate to say we are trying to get out of it, but  
we are looking at all of the options that would be suitable for 
handling this situation,'' Housel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Register reported that a new opponent has been lined up for  
an Auburn home game on Sept. 4 and the school is working with ESPN, 
which owns the rights to the game, to find a replacement team to 
play FSU for the Thursday night telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Nagel, a spokesman for ESPN, said that was ``absolutely  
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is scheduled and we are taking no position to change  
this,'' Nagel said. ``We hope and expect the game to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden said if the game is canceled, FSU officials ``won't  
have had anything to do with getting out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe the red tape we had to go through to get  
this game,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``We went through a lot of 
extremes, changing our schedule and going through the conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to cancel, Auburn must buy out the game contract for  
$500,000. Auburn also would be sacrificing a guaranteed payment of 
$500,000 from FSU, The Register reported. 
</P>
<P>
	With an additional home game, however, Auburn would at least  
break even because home games earn the school a profit of 
approximately $1 million, according to Terry Windle, Auburn's 
senior associate athletic director and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still scheduled to play Florida State,'' Housel said.  
``And we have 11 games on our schedule. But we'll see what our 
options are.''

<HEADLINE> ITF Back in Court in Korda Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The legal battle surrounding Petr Korda's positive  
drug test last year at Wimbledon took another twist today as 
tennis' world governing body said it was appealing last week's 
ruling by a High Court judge in London. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last week said the ITF could not appeal a decision by  
its own appeals panel to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, the ITF said it would go before the civil  
Court of Appeal in London to challenge last week's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Korda remains free to play and has avoided a  
suspension over the positive drug test.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Extends Stay in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A top International Monetary Fund  
official, visiting Brazil to review the terms of the $41.5 billion 
aid package finalized last year, is extending his stay to further 
examine Brazilian accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer arrived Monday for what was  
supposed to be only a two-day visit but said Wednesday that amount 
of time was ``insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer's decision came just a day after Brazil abruptly  
replaced Central Bank President Francisco Lopes, who had been in 
office for only 20 days. His replacement Arminio Fraga is a former 
associate of billionaire investor George Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso rebutted criticism that  
Fraga's appointment was announced to please the IMF. According to 
press reports, the IMF wasn't happy with Lopes' stewardship of the 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fraga's appointment wasn't suggested or agreed to by the  
IMF,'' Cardoso told reporters Wednesday. During Lopes' three-week 
tenure, the real lost more than 40 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Brazil unveiled a broad fiscal plan aimed at  
shaving $16 billion from the government's budget deficit. The plan 
included a number of fiscal goals that helped Brazil qualify for 
the IMF-led credit line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among these goals was a reduction of the public deficit to  
4.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1999. The deficit now 
stands at about 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso said that Brazil would maintain its fiscal targets  
despite the recent devaluation of the real. He said market 
confidence was slowly returning and that inflation would be kept at 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Wednesday's talks between the IMF and the Brazilian  
government, World Bank representative, Gobind Nankani reaffirmed 
the bank's commitment to paying out the remaining $3.5 billion 
pledged as part of the international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank's total contribution to the package was $4.5  
billion, of which $1 billion has already been disbursed.

<HEADLINE> Mild Cervical Woes Found To Be Minor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A large study of Canadian women concluded that  
very few cases of mild cervical abnormalities detected by Pap 
smears progress to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 million women in the United States get a Pap smear every  
year, a simple test that can detect precancerous cell changes 
before they turn into cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paps detect mild abnormalities, called ``mild dysplasia,'' as  
well as severe lesions that are poised to become cancerous 
imminently. Regardless of the degree of dysplasia, women often are 
referred for more in-depth testing called colposcopy, or even a 
biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors have questioned how necessary the extra -- and  
expensive -- care is for women whose dysplasia is mild. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Toronto study published in this week's Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute concluded the risk of mild 
dysplasia progressing into more severe abnormalities or cancer was 
only 1 percent per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study should put to rest the widespread fear that women  
with mild dysplasia need immediate referral'' for in-depth care, 
instead of just monitoring with repeat Pap smears, University of 
Washington epidemiologist Cathy Critchlow concluded in an 
accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian study examined the records of almost 18,000 women  
diagnosed with dysplasia between 1970 and 1980, and tracked their 
health through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after the initial diagnosis, 29 percent of women with  
mild dysplasia were the same or had worsened. In contrast, women 
with moderate or severe dysplasia were 2.5 times to 4.2 times more 
likely to have progressed to worse dysplasia or cancer, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	During 10 years, over 60 percent of the women with mild  
dysplasia had their abnormal cells revert to normal, the study 
said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic 2000 Field Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- The Democratic presidential field for 2000,  
once expected to be a crowded, contentious free-for-all, is shaping 
up to Al Gore's liking. He faces few challengers, allowing him to 
play the vice presidency to fullest advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore traveled Wednesday to New Hampshire for the 14th time in  
five years -- his first trip of 1999 -- House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt was announcing that he will bypass the presidential 
campaign and try instead to become speaker of the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly a surprise, Gephardt's announcement was nonetheless a  
high-five affair for a Gore team already brimming with confidence. 
They lost their most potent party rival and picked up support from 
a few top Gephardt allies in this first-in-the-nation primary 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clears the field a bit,'' said Joe Keefe, one of about a  
dozen New Hampshire activists buzzing around Gore and his staff all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, a fiery Nebraskan unafraid to confront  
President Clinton and his vice president, decided in December not 
to seek the nomination. Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who was 
carving himself a niche in the party's increasingly unattended left 
wing, backed out of the race last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse  
Jackson are still pondering runs, though the later they start, the 
tougher the climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only announced challenger, former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, has the star appeal of a Hall of Fame basketball player 
but still must prove he has the money and the message to seriously 
challenge Gore. He has visited Iowa and New Hampshire, the two 
earliest voting states in 2000, without explaining forcefully why 
Democrats should abandon their vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is not Gore's problem. Message is.  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment saga has made it difficult for him to explain  
why he should succeed Clinton, other than saying: It's my turn. He 
is methodically framing a message by taking credit for the booming 
economy and staking claim to White House initiatives such as worker 
retraining and controlling community sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore surrounded himself Wednesday with students and teachers at  
a Nashua job training facility, promising more federal aid to 
workers preparing for better jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already seen some results in New Hampshire,'' he said.  
``But we've only started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was relaxed and engaging in a tightly controlled conversation  
with school officials, laughing when one student mentioned his 
robotics degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have accused me of graduating from a robotics  
program,'' Gore joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's allies think a two-man field would favor their  
candidate, giving him sole claim to any anti-Gore or pro-change 
sentiment. Indeed, Gore advisers had welcomed talk of a bigger 
field last year, saying it would dilute the strength of 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they've changed their tune, arguing that Gore has had enough  
time to build an almost insurmountable operation in New Hampshire 
and other key primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley is a great guy, and there are some other good  
Democrats thinking about getting in, but New Hampshire is already 
for Gore,'' said activist Kris Durmer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many reasons for the shrinking Democratic field,  
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--The 2000 primary schedule will be unusually compact, with many  
of the delegates chosen by mid-March. That makes money more 
important than ever. With Gephardt out, Gore is probably the only 
Democrat capable of raising $33 million by year's end, the maximum 
allowed for candidates accepting federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--History favors the vice president. Of the five second bananas  
who have sought the presidential nomination since World War II, 
only one has failed to get it: Democrat Alben W. Barkley of 
Kentucky in 1952. Five of the last 10 presidents had first served 
as vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gore is the closest thing to an incumbent without being  
president. In contrast to President Reagan's lukewarm embrace of 
Vice President George Bush in 1988, and a similar Eisenhower-Nixon 
relationship in 1960, Clinton endorsed Gore almost as soon as his 
second term began. The White House is peppered with Gore loyalists, 
and the Gore campaign is being run by a longtime Clinton ally who 
can plug into the president's political network at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore put his advantage to work Wednesday, traveling at  
taxpayers' expense for a politically useful trip. He announced $1.8 
million in federal grants to help New England states deal with 
community sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anybody here get stressed out by traffic?'' he asked at  
one town hall session on his poll-driven ``livable communities'' 
drive. ``Tell me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent national polling indicates Gore's approval ratings are  
strong and his marks for moral leadership are high, despite 
Clinton's impeachment troubles. Yet he has not been able to gain an 
edge against Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Cabinet secretary 
Elizabeth Dole, both likely GOP candidates, in head-to-head 
polling.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Ozomatli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ozomatli takes the stage like a carnival parade,  
dancing into the spotlight with a multicultural music revolution 
that combines Spanish lyrics, English-language rap and irresistible 
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new millennium opens up a world with fewer borders,  
Ozomatli -- the name is borrowed from the Aztec monkey god of 
passion and dance -- may be just the band to take us there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozo's roots in East Los Angeles provide evocative guitar,  
resonant brass and political punch. But salsa, cumbia and South 
American folk songs are only the beginning -- there's also a heavy 
dose of rap, reggae, funk, hiphop, acid jazz and pulsing turntable 
riffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? A wildly danceable melange that is brand-new and  
familiar at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you walk through L.A., you hear all these sounds,'' says  
Ulises Bella, who plays tenor saxophone and clarinet. ``Just take a 
walk and listen. That's the music of Ozomatli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're influenced by things around us -- the kind of music that  
we listen to,'' says Chicago-born rapper Chali 2na. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not rocket science,'' says funk-driven bass player  
Wil-Dog, the guy who called the band together. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs -- almost all original on the band's first album -- take  
on topics ranging from police brutality to Salvadoran revolution, 
from party time to heartache. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the most serious lyrics are laid over festive, driving  
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wil-Dog radiates joy as he high steps rubber-legged through the  
numbers with 2na, conga-player Justin ``Nino'' Poree and other 
musicians who occasionally play with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's people's music,'' he says. ``We consider it our duty to  
get people up and dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key is an eclectic three-man percussion section made up of  
Poree, former elementary-school teacher Jiro Yamaguchi on bongos 
and tabla (picked up during a stint at an Indian restaurant) and 
Latin-funk drummer William Marrufo. At 22, Poree is the band's 
youngest member. Yamaguchi, at 30, is the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozo's core emerged from a jam session at a 1995 sit-in to play  
political benefits and other activist functions. As word got 
around, the band began filling local dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Ozo has been winning fans in a hodgepodge of venues  
across the country, from Western to hiphop to last year's Warped 
Tour, from psychedelic -- a shindig last summer at Wavy Gravy's 
California spread -- to high-tech. The band wound up last year on 
TV's ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' and this month made one of 
the top-10 lists of hard-to-find musical favorites offered by New 
York Times jazz and pop critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozo's nine to 15 members -- the on-stage presence grows when they  
play at home -- luxuriate in the freedom they've created by knocking 
down the musical barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would never work with other bands -- too close-minded,''  
says Asdru Sierra, whose soaring falsetto is an Ozo trademark and 
whose trumpet rounds out the heart-lifting brass section with Bella 
and Jose ``Crunchy'' Espinosa at alto sax. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to respect each musical thread in the lively  
tapestry, ``but bring it into a new light so people can see it,'' 
says vocalist and guitar player Raul Pacheco, a former political 
consultant and father of two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everything we do works,'' Wil-Dog cautions.  
</P>
<P>
	``But the fact remains, we ain't scared to try,'' 2na says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think you have to know the rules before you can  
break them,'' Sierra says. 
</P>
<P>
	Counterculture ideals are central to Ozo's identity.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get a band together to land a record deal,'' Pacheco  
said in an interview after Ozo won scores of new fans at 
Bumbershoot, Seattle's Labor Day weekend music fest. ``We were just 
jamming and somebody liked us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stampede began in 1997, when the band was packing them into  
the Dragonfly club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden we're all going to lunch every day,'' Pacheco  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Record-company representatives would suggest ``two of you guys  
come. And we'd all show up!'' recalls Wil-Dog, cracking up at the 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had trouble with the band's one-of-a-kind mix of styles and  
collective approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know where to put you,'' Sierra whines in mocking  
imitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were like, `Who's the front man?''' he says, shaking his  
head. ``We're like, `Dude, we're a BAND!''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Ozo finally signed with musician-owned Almo Sounds, which had  
no problem handling music that defies pigeonholing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozomatli will be touring this winter and spring with the punk  
band Offspring. Known dates include: Cleveland, Feb. 24; New York 
City, Feb. 26-28; Mississauga, Ontario, March 3; Montreal, Quebec, 
March 4 or 5; Pittsburgh, March 7; Philadelphia, March 9; 
Washington, D.C., March 10. Dates for other points in the East and 
for cities in the Midwest and West have not yet been set. The tour 
is expected to end in April.

<HEADLINE> Mattel's Barbie Turns 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Can it be that Barbie -- with her perfect figure,  
big smile and long list of careers -- is having a mid-life crisis? 
</P>
<P>
	The world's most famous blonde is turning 40 in March, and like  
many of her middle-aged peers, she's trying to reinvent herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Barbie in 1999 will have a tattoo and hang out with friends  
who have nose rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barbie just isn't as cool as she used to be,'' said Marianne  
Szymanski, editor of Toy Tips magazine in Milwaukee. ``But she's 
working hard to get back in with the cool crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few thought that Barbie would ever reach 40. She's been ageless  
since she hit store shelves in 1959, always fit and trim with the 
ideal body, hair and of course, bust line. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Mattel Inc. isn't even calling this a birthday, but  
rather an anniversary of the world's best-known and best-selling 
doll. About $2 billion of Barbie dolls and accessories are sold 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	But big sales in the past aren't guarantees for the future.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kids are changing their tastes. They just don't play with  
dolls as much anymore or they stop playing with dolls at a much 
earlier age,'' said Eric Johnson, a professor at Vanderbilt 
University's Owen Graduate School of Management in Nashville, Tenn. 
``Of course, this is making Barbie nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Look at Missy Schmidt of New York. At age 8, playtime consists  
mostly of computer games and dressing up with makeup and hair 
accessories. Barbie only comes out when she's with a younger friend 
or cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barbie is fun sometimes, but I have a lot of other things I  
like to play with more,'' said Schmidt, during a recent trip to 
Toys R Us in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barbie isn't retreating to her Dream House to soothe her  
woes. A veteran of more than 75 careers in the past 40 years, 
Barbie is once again recreating herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last year, a few dolls in the Barbie line were transformed  
with bodies that better resembled the average woman, with smaller 
breasts and a more realistic shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Barbie turns 40, her look turns decidedly younger. Among  
the dolls Mattel is showcasing at next week's American 
International Toy Fair is a line of hip Generation Girls, which 
includes a doll with a nose ring, and Butterfly Art Barbie, with a 
butterfly tattoo on her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	She's also plunging even deeper into the high-tech world. There  
won't be a pink Barbie computer on the market anytime soon, but 
Barbie is expanding her interactive offerings with seven new titles 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Barbie dolls will be paired with CD-ROMs.  
New for 1999 is Working Woman Barbie, who comes with a play laptop 
and cell phone, as well as a real CD-ROM that allows a child to 
create her own business cards and stationary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Barbie to represent a lifestyle brand for girls, not  
just a brand of toys,'' said Anne Parducci, senior vice president 
of Barbie marketing for El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel. ``We want 
to make sure we capture girls in the many ways they are spending 
their time now and in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, these techno toys have wooed some girls back to Barbie.  
Nine-year-old Michelle Gonzales stopped playing with Barbie dolls, 
but loves the Barbie digital camera CD-ROM package she got for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of done with Barbie, but this was really cool,''  
she said. ``I like playing with it a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 23.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in late morning, with  
blue-chips softer as investors grappled with good -- but not great -- 
news from the high-profile technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 23.43 at 9,250.69. The Dow opened lower, bounced back but then 
retreated a second time, all within the first 40 minutes of 
trading. It lost 71 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 3.22 at 1,258.77, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 1.55 at 2,464.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,386 to 1,186 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 240.38 million, off 
slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said the  
market was taking a well-deserved breather from a nearly 2-percent 
advance in the Dow last month. The Dow is now up about 1 percent 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just kind of digesting the rally we've seen in  
January, and we had a tremendous December,'' Morris said. He said 
the market has a lot of underlying strength. Fourth-quarter 
earnings reports were ``on balance, pretty strong,'' and the 
domestic economy, which grew 3.9 percent last year, ``is very 
positive'' despite some concerns about Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were again the lead story this morning after  
Cisco Systems reported earnings late Tuesday that were one penny 
above analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco shares were down 2 17/64 at 110 1/8 in Nasdaq trading, after  
Chief Executive John Chambers warned this morning that there is 
some concern about how the Year 2000 computer issue will affect 
high-tech spending later in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares reversed an earlier rise and was off 3/16 at 47 1/4  
in leading volume on the New York Stock Exchange. Microsoft 
reversed an earlier rise in Nasdaq trading and was off 1 3/8 at 166 1/4. 
The company admitted to having delivered false testimony in its 
anti-trust trial on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber were  
up 1 3/4 at 52 1/8, after the company announced an alliance with Japan's 
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and fourth-quarter earnings that 
matched analysts' expectations. The company also said it would 
close part of an Alabama factory and lay off at least 1,320 workers 
there.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Torricelli Proposes Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on Tuesday  
outlined a proposal for $500 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 
years, defecting from fellow Democrats on what could be this year's 
most important issue in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli is working with Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell of  
Georgia on the tax-reform proposal, which will put the New Jersey 
Democrat at odds with President Clinton and party leadership on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday introduced a federal budget that forecasts  
$2.4 trillion in surpluses over the next decade. He proposed tax 
breaks totaling about $36 billion over five years, drawing 
criticism from Republicans who want more tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that he risks ``sounding like a Republican,''  
Torricelli said bigger tax cuts will increase the federal surplus 
in the long run by encouraging Americans to save their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Torricelli-Coverdell proposals would expand the 15 percent  
income tax bracket by $5,000 over five years for single filers and 
$10,000 for joint filers, raise the threshold for the 28 percent 
tax bracket and provide other tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli said he hopes to convince other Democrats that there  
is enough surplus money to bolster Social Security and Medicare and 
also deliver tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	His pitch: ``If Democrats don't participate in this tax-cutting  
effort there's going to be a tax cut anyway, (and) it's going to go 
to a privileged few families.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Notes Microsoft Video Flaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Something on the computer screen didn't look  
right, a subtle difference -- barely perceptible among the pixels -- 
where there shouldn't be any. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers and three computer experts huddled over the  
weekend to preview a high-tech, digital video demonstration that 
Microsoft Corp. intended to show the judge early this week at its 
landmark antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But the experts -- two young men in their early 20s and their  
former college professor -- quickly noticed a flaw in the video 
whose exposure would prove one of the most dramatic courtroom 
moments in more than 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Perry Mason-style fanfare, a Justice Department lawyer  
accused the software giant Tuesday of offering tainted evidence to 
the judge when it played its video purporting to show severe 
problems resulting from the government's efforts to modify the 
company's popular Windows 98 operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe from what I've seen here is, they filmed the wrong  
system,'' said James Allchin, a Microsoft senior vice president and 
a top computer scientist who later recanted his explanation. ``I'm 
not sure they would do anything like that'' intentionally to 
mislead the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had believed its demonstration to be an effective  
rebuttal against claims its Internet browser software could be 
easily removed from Windows 98. Its video, which it played in court 
Monday, shows its browser running dramatically slower after the 
government tried to disable most Internet functions in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the courtroom turnabout, Justice lawyer David Boies  
stopped the video demonstration in midframe Tuesday to reveal the 
subtle inconsistency: the border showing the program's name was 
different in one part of the video than in another. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the same variance pointed out to government lawyers by  
their own computer experts -- Edward Felten of Princeton University 
and his former students, Christian Hicks and Peter Creath -- and 
missed entirely by Microsoft's own computer talent and its 
high-priced lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we noticed on the first time through,'' Felten said  
today outside court. In the trial, Felten and his two young 
colleagues were invited by the Justice Department to sit in the 
front row of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	On the video, Microsoft's marketing director, Yusuf Mehdi, tests  
what the company said was a modified version of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's taking a very long time, however -- unusually long -- to  
access that Web site,'' Mehdi said on the video. ``That's a result 
of the performance degradation that has occurred because of running 
the (government) program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies charged -- and Allchin agreed -- that the subtle change in  
the border, called the title bar, indicated that Microsoft's test 
actually used a version of Windows unaffected by the government's 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This video you brought in here and showed for the court, that  
you checked it ... and that's just wrong, right?'' Boies snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this particular case, I do not think the (government)  
program had been run,'' Allchin conceded. But he insisted that 
performance problems exist: ``I personally tested this, and I know 
the problem exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Allchin testified that he had been mistaken, and  
that his tests were conducted properly on a modified copy of 
Windows. But Microsoft was unable until today to explain why the 
software title bars were different. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it removed software from an online service on  
the machine it videotaped after the government modified Windows, 
which it said altered the title bar but made no other changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``David (Boies) got a big bang on a very trivial issue,''  
Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, accused the government  
of ``nit-picking on issues like video production rather than 
confronting the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies said outside court there was no evidence the demonstration  
was deliberately altered, which he warned would be ``obstruction of 
justice, an outrageous thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to stand here and say something nefarious went  
on,'' Boies said. ``We don't know. ... Whether it was deliberate or 
a result of incompetence, the video was wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerage ETrade Is Back Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Executives at ETrade believe they have solved  
the software problem that halted electronic trading at the online 
brokerage and do not anticipate further problems when the market 
opens today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday morning, electronic trading was blocked for about  
75 minutes. By 11:30 a.m. EST, the company announced that trading 
had resumed, but about 5 percent of the brokerage's customers were 
unable to trade electronically throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers at the Palo Alto, Calif.-based ETrade took telephone  
orders, but a swarm of jilted online traders jammed the lines, 
traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem resulted from a change in the software used to  
process trades. An upgraded system was installed Tuesday night, and 
a minor glitch derailed the trading page, a spokeswoman said. The 
software has been fixed and submitted to another round of testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Levinson, ETrade's president, called the problem  
``embarrassing'' in an interview with CNBC, a cable TV business 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge violation of a trust,'' he said. Crisci said  
Wednesday's outage prevented him from canceling an order to buy 
stock, resulting in an unspecified loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many people were affected by Wednesday's  
outage. ETrade is one of the largest of the increasingly popular 
online brokerages, processing an average of 40,000 trades per day 
in the final three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first online brokerage to falter.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are growing pains throughout the entire industry,'' said  
Julio Gomez, founder of Gomez Advisors, a Cambridge, Mass., 
research firm that focuses on electronic commerce. ``Since 
Thanksgiving, all the big firms have been pushing the outer limits 
of their capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased volume has been fueled in part by the rise of  
Internet stocks, which have soared in recent months. Day traders, 
who try to reap profits from short-term swings in stock prices, 
have also embraced the online brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investors often complain about sluggish connections or  
delayed trades during busy sessions. While trading was heavy 
Wednesday, ETrade said volume had nothing to do with its outage, 
and rival brokerages were functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ETrade's troubles mirrored the old woes of America  
Online, which experienced persistent delays and outages in 1997 as 
millions of new Internet users signed onto its service. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending heavily to upgrade its systems, AOL continued to  
thrive. It currently has 15 million customers, plus 2 million 
through its subsidiary CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL was unmercifully castigated for its problems,'' said Phil  
Leigh, an Internet analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. ``But it came out much stronger. So will the 
Internet brokerages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the burgeoning industry, ETrade currently ranks third in  
volume behind Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Waterhouse Securities, and 
third in accounts behind Schwab and Fidelity Investments, Gomez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 2.8 million total transactions in its most recent  
fiscal quarter, up from 1.6 million in the same period of 1997. The 
company has wooed investors by offering a wide range of financial 
information on its site, including free real-time stock quotes for 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that while regular upgrades are necessary in the  
highly competitive market, the Internet brokerages must be careful 
to ensure good service. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes by, customers will grow fed up with delays,''  
Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade has set up a special e-mail address for investors who  
want to ask questions or lodge complaints: service2(at)etrade.com.

<HEADLINE> Black MDs Won't Meet in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An association representing 20,000 black doctors  
yanked its 2001 convention out of Seattle, citing a new state law 
that makes some affirmative action measures illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such legislative enactment is counter to the basic tenets upon  
which the National Medical Association was founded more than 100 
years ago,'' Lorraine Cole, the organization's executive director 
said Tuesday in announcing it would hold its convention elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiative 200, approved by voters in November, bans state and  
local governments from giving preferential treatment to women and 
minorities in awarding contracts, filling jobs or making admissions 
decisions in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	The physicians' association, which has its headquarters in  
Washington, D.C., listed as potential alternative sites Denver; 
Miami; Nashville, Tenn.; Orlando, Fla.; Philadelphia; New York and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 percent of Washington state voters approved Initiative  
200, although a majority within Seattle voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Paul Schell plans to ask the association to reconsider,  
spokeswoman Vivian Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carlson, who headed the drive to put the initiative on the  
ballot, said the medical association's decision is ``their loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless their organization was founded on the tenets of racial  
quotas and preferences, they are seriously misreading Initiative 
200 because that's all that prohibits,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Voskuhl Injury Not As Bad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Top-ranked Connecticut learned Wednesday  
that the foot injury to starting center Jake Voskuhl was less 
severe than believed, and he has been cleared to work out with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Baxter, a Houston bone specialist who treated Voskuhl  
for a stress fracture in high school, said the 6-foot-11 junior 
just reaggravated the old injury to his left foot, calling it a 
``stress aggravation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Voskuhl plays Saturday against No. 4 Stanford depends on  
how he responds at practice on Friday. Treatment is expected to be 
largely preventive measures, such the use of special shoe inserts 
or more frequent change of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Voskuhl, the team's leading rebounder, sat out Monday night's  
59-42 loss to Syracuse, the first loss of the season for UConn 
(19-1). He flew to Houston on Tuesday to be examined by Dr. Baxter, 
who has treated other prominent athletes such as Christian 
Laettner, Grant Hill and Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading scorer Richard Hamilton is nursing a bruised right thigh  
and also missed the Syracuse game. Hamilton ran some light, 
non-contact drills on Wednesday and is listed as day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> Study: Detention Can Help Cure TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nearly six years after New York City health officials got the  
power to detain tuberculosis patients who repeatedly refused 
treatment, a study finds that the controversial tactic helped 
control the disease -- and was used sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
	The program helped reverse a decade of increases in tuberculosis  
cases, and despite fears from civil libertarians and AIDS activists 
that officials would not use detention as a last resort, only 2 
percent of TB patients have been subject to the drastic measure, 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were afraid we would abuse that power. We never did,''  
said Rose Gasner, the lawyer formerly in charge of the detention 
program. She is also the lead author of the study in Thursday's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberculosis, a highly infectious lung disease transmitted by  
airborne bacteria, was once thought to be under control. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York saw a sharp increase in TB cases during the late  
1980s and early '90s, including an alarming number of patients 
infected with strains that killed quickly and were resistant to 
several antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	City health officials sent workers to patients' homes and  
workplaces, park benches, homeless shelters or crack houses to 
administer medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The city offered housing to homeless patients and offered to  
treat the AIDS, psychiatric disorders or drug and alcohol 
addictions that some TB patients also suffered. Those who accepted 
treatment were given fast-food vouchers and subway tokens. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the carrots, but the health department also got a  
stick in 1993: New rules let officials lock TB patients in a 
hospital for treatment if they repeatedly refused or failed to take 
their medicine. Dangerous TB strains resistant to several drugs 
often evolve in such patients. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, TB cases began to decline. From 1992 to  
1997, the number of new cases fell by 55 percent and new 
drug-resistant cases fell 87 percent, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that in the program's first two years, 139 of  
the city's 8,000 TB patients -- fewer than 2 percent -- were 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who were detained had been treated for TB an average of  
three times previously and had left the hospital twice against 
medical advice, the study found. Nearly all had been offered 
voluntary treatment but refused it or failed to complete it. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said those figures show that detention was used  
as a last resort. One reason is because outpatient treatment is 
less expensive than detaining a patient for months in a locked 
hospital ward, Gasner said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three-quarters of the patients subjected to legal  
orders for treatment or detention were cured by the end of 1997. Of 
the rest, most died of other diseases, such as AIDS. Four percent 
moved, refused treatment, or could not be located for follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor at Columbia University and author  
of ``Contagion and Confinement,'' a book about TB detention, said 
he would like to see the figures independently verified, but he did 
not question the general conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised New York's program for keeping most patients until  
they are cured, instead of releasing them when they are no longer 
infectious and allowing them to complete treatment in a less 
restrictive setting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've done a terrific job on the whole,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``You still should get a little uncomfortable when  
certain members of society are the ones whose rights are most 
affected by coercive measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the vast majority of TB patients -- even ones with a  
history of homelessness, imprisonment or drug abuse -- complete 
treatment voluntarily, the threat of detention helps protect public 
health, said Dr. Lee Reichman, a past president of the American 
Lung Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while there is somebody who is irresponsible  
and is a menace, and you can't get to them even with the community 
workers and everything that we have,'' said Reichman, who runs a 
similar program at the New Jersey Medical School National 
Tuberculosis Center in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also similar programs in Massachusetts, Denver and  
some California counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner said he worried that as TB rates around the country  
decline and budgets are cut, tuberculosis treatment facilities will 
close and health authorities will arrest hard-to-treat patients so 
they can admit them to prison hospitals -- as is done now in parts 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing you really want to avoid,'' he said, ``is to say  
that not taking your medicine makes you a criminal.''

<HEADLINE> L.T. Claims Forgery at Fraud Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor testified Wednesday that his  
signature was forged on bogus bank papers submitted by his onetime 
business partner and lawyer now on trial for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly elected Pro Football Hall of Famer is hoping to avoid  
going to jail with his testimony against Alfred Porro Jr., and his 
wife, Joan. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 39, pleaded guilty to filing a false 1990 tax return and  
failing to report $48,000 in income from the now-closed restaurant, 
L.T. Sports Pub in East Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	His tax problems surfaced in the investigation of the Porros,  
who were indicted in December 1996 on embezzlement, money 
laundering, bank fraud and tax evasion charges. Taylor was not 
charged with the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who returned to New Jersey from Florida where he is  
filming an Oliver Stone movie, caused a sensation when he arrived 
at the courthouse here. He was elected Saturday to the Hall of 
Fame, in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congratulations to you, you deserve to be there, buddy,''  
Porro told Taylor before his testimony began. Taylor, sitting in 
the witness stand, smiled broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered the dominant player of his time, Taylor played 13  
seasons at linebacker with the Giants, leading the team to two 
Super Bowl titles. He is just as well known for his off-the-field 
legal problems, including two drug arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Porro met in 1982 at a go-go bar that Porro once  
owned and that was a hangout for Giants players and reputed 
mobsters. Porro later represented Taylor in a paternity suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Porro and his wife, both Lyndhurst lawyers, are accused of  
stealing $276,000 in client trust funds used partly to salvage 
their failing businesses, including the Lawrence Taylor Golf Center 
in East Rutherford, and to pay off debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Porro were partners in a company that built the  
driving range, but Taylor said he was not involved in the 
construction or financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor told jurors that his signature was falsified on a bogus  
financial guarantee that Porro submitted to a bank that lent Porro 
$850,000 to develop a tract in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by Porro, who is representing himself,  
Taylor acknowledged that he did not know who forged his name and 
that it did not appear to be Porro's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Porro and his wife face dozens of years in prison  
and millions of dollars in fines. Taylor's cooperation could reduce 
his own sentence on the tax evasion charge from the minimum 
six-months in prison to probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who strolled into the courtroom wearing a navy-blue  
pinstriped suit and a dangling diamond studded ``LT'' earring, 
appeared uncomfortable during questioning by Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Perry Carbone. He fidgeted, grimaced and at times his 
voice was barely audible. 
</P>
<P>
	When Porro began, Taylor perked up, smiling and laughing. Taylor  
said he trusted Porro, despite squabbles with his former lawyer 
over their business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Porro reminded Taylor that he never billed him for representing  
him at court hearings and appeals during his numerous legal 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never charged me -- not in that way,'' a smiling Taylor  
responded. ``Don't forget Al, I had to pay back that loan and your 
share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porro replied, ``I was jammed up. I wasn't trying to stick  
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You weren't trying to stick me with it, but you did,'' Taylor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who declined comment before rushing from the courthouse,  
apparently was referring to a $200,000 loan their business venture 
obtained to renovate the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared that Taylor provided the testimony that prosecutors  
were seeking. A judge will decide whether his cooperation merits a 
lesser sentence for his cooperation. He could face up to three 
years in prison and a $100,00 fine. Taylor will be sentenced after 
the trial.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty: China Tortures Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities have arbitrarily detained  
scores of people and tortured suspects in a crackdown on separatism 
in China's Muslim far west, according to Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	Two religious teachers, scores of farmers rounded up after  
security forces killed six youths, and a doctor accused of giving 
medical treatment to separatists are among those detained in recent 
months in the western Xinjiang region, the London-based group said 
in a report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese government officials were not available for comment late  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatists fighting to free the region from Chinese control  
have assassinated officials, fought gunbattles with police and are 
blamed for bombings and other violence that have made Xinjiang one 
of China's most restive and tightly policed regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Uighurs, Xinjiang's largest ethnic group, briefly ran an  
independent state before communist forces retook the region in 
1949. Tensions between them and Chinese migrants sent to the region 
remain high. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty said some people were detained for being relatives or  
friends of political prisoners or fugitives, ``or simply because 
they are Uighurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their relatives have received no news of them, and they have  
been held without charge for several months, in violation of 
Chinese law,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty also expressed concern that Uighur political detainees  
are frequently tortured and ``that some have been left physically 
and mentally scarred as a result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, security forces shot six Uighur youths in one village  
outside the city of Yining and detained scores of others, mainly 
relatives, friends and neighbors of those killed, Amnesty said. 
They were tortured in detention, and while some were released after 
a few weeks, others remain in detention without charge, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, four men and four children were detained in  
September after being extradited from neighboring Kazakstan, 
Amnesty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were released after 18 days, but the men remain in  
detention in the city of Kashgar, in Xinjiang's southwest, it said. 
They include two religious teachers who, fearing arrest in a 
crackdown on religion, fled China in July for Kazakstan only to be 
sent back, Amnesty said.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Says He'll Win House Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Democrats say House Minority  
Leader Dick Gephardt's decision to forgo a presidential race next 
year boosts their chances for capturing control of the chamber in 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, a leader of  
his party's conservatives. ``2000 looks even better now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, D-Mo., used an 11-minute speech Wednesday to formally  
tell his colleagues that he would remain in Congress and focus on 
winning Democratic control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	His audience was more than 200 House Democrats and aides, who  
turned a gathering in a Capitol basement room into a noisy 
campaign-style rally, complete with white-on-blue hand-held signs 
reading, ``Speaker Gephardt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've handed that gavel over for the last time,'' Gephardt told  
the crowd. ``When the 107th Congress convenes in January of 2001, I 
want to take that gavel back on your behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, the 58-year-old Missourian has presided at the  
opening of three successive Congresses that Republicans have 
controlled, giving the gavel to GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and 
Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to help rebuild the trust between the people and their  
government,'' Gephardt said. He said Democrats would create a 
Congress ``that reflects the hopes and dreams of the people, rather 
than the unending drumbeat of a small minority, bent on imposing 
their will on an entire nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, he never mentioned that he had considered  
seeking his party's presidential nomination next year, nor did he 
mention the front-runner for that post, Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, campaigning in New Hampshire, refused to say  
whether Gephardt promised to endorse him or whether Gore requested 
his endorsement. ``I have pledged to do everything in my power to 
help Democrats win back the House and make Dick Gephardt speaker,'' 
the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned later by reporters, Gephardt said his prospects for  
winning that nomination or raising the millions of dollars needed 
had nothing to do with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made this a personal decision for what in my heart and my  
mind ... would make the best contribution I could make for public 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called Gephardt's decision not to run in 2000  
``the right thing for him and the House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I discussed his decision and I feel he made the choice  
for the right reasons,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt supporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
decided that winning back the House was as important to Democratic 
initiatives as retaining the White House. He also believed he had a 
better chance to become speaker than president, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would endorse Gore -- with whom he had breakfast  
Wednesday -- Gephardt said, ``I haven't made any decision on any of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By not challenging Gore, Gephardt has avoided a bitter fight  
that could have divided and distracted congressional Democrats next 
year. Though Gore is being challenged by former Sen. Bill Bradley 
of New Jersey and could draw other opponents, Gephardt was 
considered to be his strongest rival for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also leaves Democrats with their best congressional  
fund raiser and candidate recruiter focusing on House races next 
year, when control of the chamber will be in play. Republicans have 
a mere 221-211 House majority, plus one independent who leans 
Democratic and two vacant seats the GOP is likely to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a significant step closer to the majority by having him  
stay,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt aides say that in 1997 and 1998, he raised as much as  
$14 million for himself and other Democratic congressional 
candidates, and campaigned for 110 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt has also helped congressional Democrats formulate a  
more moderate message in recent years, such as their decision to 
rally behind Clinton's call last year to reserve federal surpluses 
until Social Security is overhauled. From liberals to 
conservatives, Democratic lawmakers say Gephardt is a leader they 
can trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick Gephardt is the glue that will hold this caucus  
together,'' said liberal Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Meet GOP Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wanted: A very conservative Republican to be  
president of the United States. Apply today. 
</P>
<P>
	The word went out this week to White House hopefuls, and six of  
them agreed to be interviewed today by a group of social 
conservative leaders seeking a candidate who can win the presidency 
without forsaking the party's right wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership group, which includes activists Phyllis Schlafly  
and Paul Weyrich, is the same loose coalition of social 
conservatives that helped promote the potential candidacy of Sen. 
John Ashcroft. The Missouri lawmaker decided at the last minute not 
to run in 2000, leaving an opening for conservative candidates 
seeking credibility and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,  
activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and 
broadcaster Alan Keyes are expected to be interviewed for an hour 
each in a downtown hotel, according to several people involved with 
organizing the private auditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle will talk with the group by  
telephone from a rally in Indiana, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle today took a formal step toward running by announcing the  
formation of an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is time for common sense. It is time for plain talk,''  
he said in an announcement to supporters with his wife, Marilyn, by 
his side, at a library on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed, a political strategist and former director of the  
Christian Coalition, said the effort by the leadership group ``is 
an important step in a much larger process of reaching out to the 
conservative base of the party.'' He is not taking part in the job 
interviews, but is familiar with politics in the party's 
conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it remains to be seen whether or not this particular  
group can put together a coalition of conservative groups like the 
Christian Coalition or the Eagle Forum that can actually deliver 
large numbers of votes in primary states,'' Reed said. ``But even 
if they don't, these are important individuals with important 
constituencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also remains to be seen whether the group could ever agree to  
endorse one GOP hopeful, increasing its own influence and the 
presidential prospects of its anointed candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see a consensus emerging (today), which has been the  
problem all along,'' said Schlafly, the Eagle Forum leader. ``We 
would like to have a consensus instead of being split all over the 
place. But, obviously, we're split all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ashcroft had the backing of Schlafly and others in the  
group, even he was not endorsed unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition, will question  
the candidates, though he also wonders whether a consensus 
conservative can emerge from the meeting. ``The real question is, 
can the candidate inspire grassroots activists to the polls? No 
meeting in Washington is going to answer that question,'' Tate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Tate, Schlafly and Weyrich, who runs the Free  
Congress Foundation, the group includes Mike Farris of the Home 
School Defense Association, Paige Patterson of the Southern Baptist 
Convention and activist Tim La Haye. 
</P>
<P>
	Rallying behind one candidate can be dangerous for the group and  
the candidate, Reed cautioned. If the candidate loses, the group's 
influence will be questioned. If the candidate is nominated, 
Democrats will label him a tool of the religious right, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting will not include Texas Gov. George W. Bush or former  
Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, two Republicans showing the most 
promise in early polling. The more moderate or establishment 
Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, also were not included.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Economy News Crushes Wheat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by heavy selling of wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants dumped wheat futures in droves, erasing  
early gains, on news that Pakistan, one of the largest purchasers 
of American wheat, had been unable to make purchases overnight 
because it was arrears in its credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem led Pakistan to buy 200,000 metric tons of competing  
Australian wheat and renewed concern that U.S. producers have 
months more to suffer before export business bounces back from 
world economic woes. That has been reinforced further with concern 
that the U.S. winter wheat crop, which accounts for 75 percent of 
total production, so far has seen no adverse weather to reduce its 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell on the weakness in wheat and as an early rally  
prompted farmer selling of stores crops. Soybeans fell on grains' 
troubles and amid continued concern about the possibility of bumper 
crops in Brazil, the world's second-largest grower that also has 
enjoyed beneficial weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.06 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 3/4 cents to $5.07 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rose sharply on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange after Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
announced the United States, months after its initial announcement, 
will begin buying pork and other products for shipment to 
economically beleaguered Russia. The news prompted a flurry of 
buying from meatpackers and other users. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose 1.37 cent to 64.37 cents a pound,  
while more-active April rose 1.32 cents to 66.97 cents a pound; 
March feeder cattle rose 1.28 cents to 73.80 cents a pound; 
February lean hogs fell .82 cent to 40.65 cents a pound, while 
April lean hogs rose .40 cent to 43.92 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose .98 cent 56.65 cents a pound, while March rose 1.32 
cents to 57.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 23.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in late morning, with  
blue-chips softer as investors grappled with good -- but not great -- 
news from the high-profile technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 23.43 at 9,250.69. The Dow opened lower, bounced back but then 
retreated a second time, all within the first 40 minutes of 
trading. It lost 71 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 3.22 at 1,258.77, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 1.55 at 2,464.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,386 to 1,186 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 240.38 million, off 
slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said the  
market was taking a well-deserved breather from a nearly 2-percent 
advance in the Dow last month. The Dow is now up about 1 percent 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just kind of digesting the rally we've seen in  
January, and we had a tremendous December,'' Morris said. He said 
the market has a lot of underlying strength. Fourth-quarter 
earnings reports were ``on balance, pretty strong,'' and the 
domestic economy, which grew 3.9 percent last year, ``is very 
positive'' despite some concerns about Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were again the lead story this morning after  
Cisco Systems reported earnings late Tuesday that were one penny 
above analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco shares were down 2 17/64 at 110 1/8 in Nasdaq trading, after  
Chief Executive John Chambers warned this morning that there is 
some concern about how the Year 2000 computer issue will affect 
high-tech spending later in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares reversed an earlier rise and was off 3/16 at 47 1/4  
in leading volume on the New York Stock Exchange. Microsoft 
reversed an earlier rise in Nasdaq trading and was off 1 3/8 at 166 1/4. 
The company admitted to having delivered false testimony in its 
anti-trust trial on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber were  
up 1 3/4 at 52 1/8, after the company announced an alliance with Japan's 
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and fourth-quarter earnings that 
matched analysts' expectations. The company also said it would 
close part of an Alabama factory and lay off at least 1,320 workers 
there.

<P>
	``I know exactly what it's all about now,'' Fleischer said  
Wednesday after his training run for Saturday's downhill, ``and I'm 
just going to concentrate on kicking everyone's (butt). That's an 
awesome feeling to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's super-G, Fleischer's best finish in a World Cup  
event this season was 11th in the downhill at Val d'Isere, France. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing 28-hundredths of a second behind co-champions Lasse  
Kjus of Norway and Hermann Maier of Austria, Fleischer became 
America's latest golden boy without the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to do now is just be solid and aggressive  
instead of absolute balls to the wall when I'm in the starting 
gate,'' Fleischer said. ``It was reckless abandon before, out of 
control almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 27, credits rigorous dry-land training and the snow  
leopard for his progress. After reading several books about the 
elusive cat, he bleached his hair and then painted the dark spots 
onto his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not seen a whole lot in the wild, but when they decide  
to go after their prey, it's quick and furious,'' Fleischer said. 
``That's one thing I say when I'm in the starting gate. I say that 
the snow leopard attacks. He always attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little saying is like a cadence for me. It just puts me  
in the zone, like slow-motion. You're going 80 mph, and it's just 
like you're walking a kid in a stroller through the park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, who moved from Nebraska to Vail when he was 12, will  
take his next stroll Saturday in the men's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the fourth-fastest training time Wednesday, completing  
the daunting Birds of Prey course in 1 minute, 42.73 seconds. The 
training run was delayed about 3 1/2 hours because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Peter Rzehak -- who placed second in the second downhill  
run at Kitzbuhel, Austria, last month -- finished the 1.6-mile 
course in 1:42.22 for the fastest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who ranks second in the overall World Cup  
standings, was second in 1:42.43 and Austria's Stefan Eberharter -- 
fourth in World Cup points -- finished third in 1:42.67. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup downhill leader Kjus was seventh as he fought  
recurring respiratory and sinus problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling OK,'' Kjus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer is in his own kind of comfort zone, saying he is  
seeing every snowflake like Michael Jordan sees the basketball rim. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helps that he's sleeping in his own bed, driving his own  
car, and getting slapped on the back by familiar faces everywhere 
he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of an inner celebration right now for me,''  
Fleischer said. ``I still have a lot of work to do. My goal is to 
be on the podium here and to be the best skier in the world, not 
just perform here in front of the home crowd.''

	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Chad Fleischer's snow-leopard haircut

<HEADLINE> Colo. Stops Sale of License Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado is halting the sale of driver's license  
photos to a company that uses them for an anti-fraud system, giving 
lawmakers time to consider outlawing the transaction that drew 
criticism as an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida took similar action this week, and the arrangement also  
is under fire in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens said Tuesday that legislative leaders  
had agreed to introduce a bill to block sale of the photos and 
possibly other personal data to Image Data Corp. of Nashua, N.H. A 
1997 law had allowed the Division of Motor Vehicles to sell the 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just concerned about the intrusion of government into  
areas that should be private,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data Corp. is using the photos to develop a computerized  
identification system intended to help retailers prevent fraudulent 
check cashing and credit-card charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Company co-founder Robert Houvener said Tuesday that the  
reaction in the three states had been good until the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously very surprised when we heard all this,''  
said Houvener, who got the idea for the system after one of his 
credit cards was stolen. ``Especially considering the fact that the 
system had been up and running here for six months and we had not 
received one consumer complaint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado contracted to transmit about 5 million pieces of data  
from driver's licenses for $128,000, Owens said. So far, only about 
50,000 pieces of information have been sent to Image Data. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina sold 3.5 million driver's license photos to the  
company last year for $5,000. Ten businesses in that state are 
testing the company's photo ID system. South Carolina lawmakers 
also have proposed legislation to block the sale of license photos. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush terminated a contract with  
Image Data, hours after a judge ordered the state to stop selling 
license photos and other data to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, Owens said he does not believe the state will face  
any legal problems if it suspends the sales until legislation is 
enacted banning the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens would like to see legislation outlawing the sale of such  
of information as home addresses and Social Security numbers in 
addition to license snapshots. He said the state has made that data 
available for several years, although generally to individuals 
rather than in bulk sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Coloradans should have a right to more confidentiality  
on driver's license information,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Image Data did not immediately return calls  
for comment today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Image Data's ``TrueID'' service, drivers' photos stored in  
a computer could be displayed on retailers' terminals for a few 
seconds, and only for the purpose of verifying the identity of 
someone cashing a check or using a charge card. The rest of the 
license data and the Social Security numbers would be used only to 
find and transmit the correct photograph, company officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 10 South Carolina merchants testing the system says  
it is working just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response we've gotten is customers see their driver's  
license photos come up and they think it's exciting,'' said Doug 
Manning, owner of an Exxon station in Orangeburg, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Wrongful Death Suit Filed Over Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZEELAND, Mich. (AP) -- A lawyer has raised allegations about  
unclean conditions at Bil Mar Food's plant in this western Michigan 
community in a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of a 
Tennessee woman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted meat from the Bil Mar plant has been linked to 11  
deaths, five miscarriages and still births and about 72 illnesses 
in 14 states, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., on Dec. 22  
recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other packaged meat 
products sold under a variety of names. It said they could be 
tainted with listeria bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Chicago lawyer Kenneth Moll filed the suit -- his  
second -- saying he interviewed former Bil Mar employees who talked 
about unsanitary conditions at the plant and faulty cooking 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen declined to comment on  
the allegations about unclean conditions. ``It would be difficult 
for me to comment on what he heard from some former employees,'' 
she said. Ms. Herlevsen said Sara Lee is aggressive about good 
sanitation practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Chicago accuses the company of  
negligence in the death of Helen Bodnar, a 74-year-old 
great-grandmother from Memphis who died Oct. 19 of meningitis 
brought on by a strain of listeria 
</P>
<P>
	Moll's other suit, a class-action effort, seeks to collect for  
anyone who claims to have eaten the tainted Sara Lee products. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee declined to comment on the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, a woman who had a miscarriage and lost her  
six-month-old fetus after eating tainted meat, has also sued Sara 
Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Scudder's lawsuit alleges Sara Lee officials discovered  
listeria contamination at the Bil Mar plant in July, but did not 
recall the products or notify the public until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee officials said they could not comment Wednesday on the  
suit, which seeks punitive damages based on a percentage of 
expected meat sales revenue for Sara Lee and Bil Mar over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women.

<HEADLINE> Roger Clinton Hails 1st Couple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton are confident  
``that they've gotten back on track,'' with still a lot of work to 
do in their marriage because of his problems, his brother, Roger, 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell the family unit is getting stronger every  
day,'' Roger Clinton said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger brother said he met with the president Tuesday. ``He  
sounds very upbeat, very positive and he's still as concerned as 
ever every day with the business of the country and of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the president's impeachment trial continues in the  
Senate, ``He's doing fine now. He's really doing fine. The bigger 
picture was what he had to deal with and that was the family 
situation and he's dealt with that,'' Roger Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has not discussed Chelsea Clinton's feelings with  
her. ``All we can hope for now is that Chelsea can deal with this 
because of the fact she's had two great teachers in her life to 
prepare her for situations, for adversities such as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When President and Mrs. Clinton are out of the spotlight, Roger  
Clinton said, ``I see a lot of focus, a lot of determination and a 
lot of confidence that they've gotten back on track and they still 
have much work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president had not used the words ``will you forgive  
me'' in discussing the affair with Monica Lewinsky. ``Some things 
you don't need to express in a certain way,'' Roger Clinton said. 
``We knew he was asking for forgiveness.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell today for the third  
consecutive day on continued concern over surging domestic interest 
rates and the yen's rise against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.52 points,  
or 1.31 percent, closing the session at 14,161.31. The average now 
has fallen 337.94 points this week, including Tuesday's drop of 
115.35 points, or 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 112.38 yen, down  
0.80 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than its late New 
York level of 112.05 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players worry that higher interest rates will weigh on  
profits at Japanese companies and hurt the nation's economy, which 
is now struggling to bail itself out of its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Long term interest rates in Japan began rising in December, when  
the government announced plans to issue a large volume of bonds in 
the next fiscal year starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan needs to sell more debt to pay for stimulus plans aimed at  
pumping up the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield of the benchmark No. 203 10-year government bond  
settled at 2.350 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 2.310 percent 
and its highest level since July 1997. Its price fell to 95.77 yen 
from 96.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was estimated  
at 303 million shares, down from Tuesday's turnover of 324 million 
shares. Declines outnumbered advances 976 to 186, with 128 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 16.58 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,097.15. 
The TOPIX lost 5.64 points, or 0.50 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. closed at  
573 yen ($5.1) per share, up 42 yen (37 cents), or 8 percent, from 
Tuesday's finish, on expectations that the company will form a far 
reaching alliance with Goodyear Tire and Rubber of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Sumitomo Rubber in Tokyo said the company was in  
the final stage of talks with Goodyear on the tie up, and that it 
planned to make an official comment later today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rebounded from the day's lows  
as U.S. funds bought the currency in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the session, the greenback fell to an intraday low of  
111.79 yen its lowest level since Jan. 13, when it changed hands at 
111.07 yen as rising yields on Japanese government bonds encouraged 
dealers to buy the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rebound also derived from comments by Haruhiko  
Kuroda, head of the international bureau with Japan's Finance 
Ministry who voiced concern over the weakening of the U.S. currency 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates in Japan make the yen more attractive.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 111.75 yen and 112.70 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.32 yen, down  
from 128.22 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Abortion Seeker Gives Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A woman whose plans to have an abortion were  
thwarted when a judge sent her to prison for credit card forgery 
has given birth to a baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's wonderful. I hope everything is OK,'' Judge Patricia  
Cleary said upon learning that the woman who is suing her -- Yuriko 
Kawaguchi -- had given birth to a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kawaguchi, 21, and her baby were doing well on Tuesday, said  
George Carr, one of her lawyers. The 7-pound, 1-ounce girl was born 
Monday in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Cleary of violating Ms. Kawaguchi's right to  
have an abortion by sending her to prison for an offense that gets 
most offenders probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary has said repeatedly, and reiterated Tuesday, that the  
sentence was based on the severity of the crime, which involved 
allegedly buying computers with fake credit cards and selling the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kawaguchi pleaded guilty to a forgery charge in the credit  
card scam. At that time, she referred to her ``unwanted pregnancy'' 
and told the judge: ``I will be trying to have a procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an Oct. 6 sentencing hearing, Ms. Kawaguchi was more than  
five months pregnant and sought probation. At one point the judge 
said: ``She is not having a second-term abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary, who opposes abortion, sentenced Ms. Kawaguchi to six  
months in prison, with credit for more than four months already 
spent in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court ordered Ms. Kawaguchi's release on bond  
Oct. 13 while she fights her sentence, a court battle that is 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided upon her release that she was too far along in her  
pregnancy to legally have an abortion in Ohio, which allows the 
procedure after 22 weeks only in unusual cases. 
</P>
<P>
	She said last fall she would have undergone an abortion but had  
decided to keep the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, she won permission to go to California, where she  
lives in Burlingame with her mother and sister. Phone messages left 
Tuesday for the Kawaguchi family were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Titan Rockets Near Ready for Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said Tuesday it has developed a  
plan of ``corrective actions'' to the Titan rocket fleet to prevent 
a repeat of the catastrophic satellite launch failure last August. 
</P>
<P>
	A Titan IVB, the United States' largest unmanned rocket, is  
scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Air Station, Fla., in 
late March or early April. It will be the first Titan launch since 
the August disaster in which a rocket blew up, showering more than 
$1 billion in flaming debris over the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators determined that electrical shorts in the rocket's  
power supply wiring harness most likely caused the accident. The 
plan for corrective actions includes reinspecting all wire 
harnesses on Titan launch vehicles, and redesigning or modifying

<P>
	In an announcement from Air Force Space Command headquarters in  
Colorado Springs, Colo., officials said the command's chief and the 
director of the National Reconnaissance Office have agreed on the 
plan for returning the Titan fleet to service. Most of the 
corrective actions have already been taken, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	YONGPYONG, South Korea (AP) -- NHL, take note: There's no problem  
scoring goals in the Winter Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait lost two straight games in ice hockey by a combined score  
of 79-1, routs even by football standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuwaitis were beaten 44-1 by Japan on Saturday. On Monday,  
their defense tightened in a 35-0 loss to China, with Pan Zhiqiang 
scoring eight goals. 
</P>
<P>
	While the NHL hasn't enjoyed as much scoring as it would have  
liked this season, Kazakstan has had no such difficulty. It downed 
Mongolia 40-0 on Monday. Nikolai Antropov, drafted by the Toronto 
Maple Leafs in last year's NHL entry draft, scored 10 goals.

<HEADLINE> Fleischer To Prey on Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- When Chad Fleischer decided to bleach  
his hair and add leopard-spot highlights last May, he wasn't trying 
to make a fashion statement. It was part of what he called his 
maturation process. 
</P>
<P>
	After his sixth-place performance in the super-G at the World  
Alpine Ski Championships, it's hard to argue with Fleischer's 
Rodman-esque approach to blending in among the world's fastest 
skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did a lot of research and reading on snow leopards,''  
Fleischer said Wednesday. ``They're not seen a whole lot in the 
wild. There's less than 5,000 of them left, but when they decide to 
go after their prey, it's quick and furious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer put a scare into the super-G favorites Tuesday when he  
finished just 28-hundredths of a second behind co-champions Lasse 
Kjus of Norway and Hermann Maier of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the best race of his career left him without a medal,  
Fleischer was still feeling an adrenaline rush from what he 
considered a breakthrough performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can watch video, and you can want to do all kinds of  
things with your skiing,'' Fleischer said, ``but until you actually 
do it and feel it and it's proof on paper, you don't believe it and 
you can't tune into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to Fleischer's enthusiasm is his surroundings. He moved  
to Vail from Nebraska when he was 12 and has dutifully filled the 
role of appreciative son in his resort home. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 27, can't walk down the street without someone  
shaking his hand or slapping him on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of an inner celebration right now for me,'' he  
said. ``It's something I want to share with my trainer and my team 
and my coaches and my family and my girlfriend. My goal is to be on 
the podium here and to be the best skier in the world, not just 
perform here in front of the home crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer will get his next chance Saturday in the downhill, his  
strongest event. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the fourth-fastest training time Wednesday, completing  
the daunting Birds of Prey course in 1 minute, 42.73 seconds. The 
training run was delayed about 3 1/2 hours because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Peter Rzehak -- who placed second in the second downhill  
run at Kitzbuhel, Austria, last month -- finished the 1.6-mile 
course in 1:42.22, the fastest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who ranks second in the overall World Cup  
standings, was second in 1:42.43 and Austria's Stefan Eberharter -- 
fourth in World Cup points -- finished third in 1:42.67. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup downhill leader Kjus was seventh as he fought  
recurring respiratory and sinus problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling OK,'' Kjus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, meanwhile, is in his own kind of comfort zone, saying  
he is seeing every snowflake like Michael Jordan sees the 
basketball rim. Despite his success, don't expect to see his 
American teammates jumping on the snow-leopard bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't be seeing me with leopard spots,'' Casey Puckett  
said. ``You might see another animal someday, but not leopard 
spots.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Force May Be Sent to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Bosnia-weary Congress is reacting  
skeptically to the Clinton administration's suggestion that U.S. 
troops may be needed to help enforce a peace plan in war-scarred 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There remains no such plan, despite NATO's efforts to force the  
warring parties to the bargaining table this weekend. But the 
administration's national security team has been making the rounds 
on Capitol Hill laying groundwork for such a deployment in case a 
peace plan is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not at this time support ground troops in Kosovo, because  
I do not know what the game plan is,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, R-Texas, after a briefing by Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen. ``I do not 
know what the exit strategy is, and I don't know how many of our 
forces would be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments echoed those of many lawmakers.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, Albright made a hastily arranged decision to deliver a  
major policy address on Kosovo to a foreign policy group today. A 
senior official, asking not to be identified, said Albright planned 
to explain why Kosovo was important to the national interest. The 
official declined to say whether Albright planned any major 
disclosures in the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee,  
Cohen said the promise of some U.S. peacekeeping presence might be 
crucial for nailing down a support for a peace plan from Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen predicted a three- to five-year stay if troops are  
introduced but said the U.S. ground presence would be ``relatively 
small,'' and that Europeans should comprise the bulk of the force. 
The United States would retain the lead responsibility for any 
airstrikes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any U.S. ground force would be sent into the southern Serbian  
province only after a viable peace accord is agreed to by the 
warring factions, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
the committee he envisions a U.S. contingent of 2,000 to 4,000 
troops, but he said that was just a guess as NATO hadn't yet 
decided on the size of the overall force. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, said he supports U.S. participation in a ground force 
once a peace pact is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warner said: ``Many of my colleagues quite properly are  
concerned that we're moving into another Bosnia -- open-ended 
situation, when (the) administration in years past has set 
deadlines, and those deadlines have not been met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. troops have been in Bosnia for three years. The U.S. troop  
contingent in that former Yugoslav republic now stands at 6,900, 
with the total NATO force at 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said there is support in Congress for use of air power if  
necessary to convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``that 
he must negotiate in good faith'' or for forcing Kosovo Albanians 
to hold up their end of the bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration must make a separate, and strong, case to win  
congressional support for ground forces, Warner suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration shared with lawmakers a draft of a  
U.S.-sponsored three-year peace plan that would dramatically reduce 
Serbian control over Kosovo and give the province considerable 
self-government powers -- while still allowing some continued 
Serbian military presence. Kosovo is the southernmost province of 
Serbia, the dominant republic of the two left in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also pledged to provide a series of  
benchmarks to be used as a basis for extricating U.S. troops once 
they are sent in, congressional and administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft of the peace plan suggested reducing the number of  
Serbian troops in the province from the current 25,000 to about 
4,000, according to administration and congressional officials, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. The plan would limit those troops 
to serving as a border patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., insisted  
in a letter to President Clinton on ``an immediate and complete 
withdrawal of all Serb police, security, army and paramilitary 
forces from Kosovo prior to any U.S. deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin defended some continued  
Serb military presence in Kosovo. ``The fact of the matter is that 
Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' he said. 
``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a country; Kosovo is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People might want to wish away the existence of Serbs, but  
there are Serbs there,'' Rubin said. ``And there have been 
provocations on both sides in Kosovo.''

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers confronted with  
impressive, possibly inflationary, economic growth in the United 
States but continued fragile financial conditions overseas decided 
to leave short-term interest rates unchanged today. The central 
bank's monetary policy panel -- the Federal Open Market Committee -- 
ended a two-day, closed-door meeting by signaling it had left the 
benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks at 4.75 percent. It 
has been at that level, a four-year low, since Nov. 17. 

</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose today, helped by the Federal  
Reserve, which, as expected, indicated it would not change 
short-term interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 
up 92.69 at 9,366.81. After a wobbly opening, stocks had begun to 
climb in late morning. The Dow was up 92 points at 2:15 EST when 
Fed governors made it official. Broad-market indexes, meanwhile, 
moved higher on continued strength in technology shares. The Nasdaq 
composite index with its many tech stocks was up 30.16 at 2,493.58.

	Auto Sales Up 12 Percent in January  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Snow didn't chill the climate for car buyers in  
January. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 12 percent over the 
start of 1998. General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, 
said today its sales were up 4 percent, thanks to passenger car 
sales. As a group, GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG had a 
9 percent increase in sales. GM did, however, have one dark spot: 
truck sales were down 3.8 percent. Overseas automakers did even 
better than somestic ones. Asian companies had an 18 percent 
increase, while European companies were up 21 percent, based on the 
daily sales rate.

	MCI WorldCom Has N.Y. Local Service

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. is leasing residential  
telephone lines from Bell Atlantic Corp. to offer local calling 
service in New York, the nation's No. 2 long-distance company 
announced today. The new service, available immediately, opens a 
new chapter in a contentious struggle by local and long-distance 
providers to crack into each other's markets. State and federal 
regulators have stipulated that the regional Bell telephone 
companies must open their markets to competition before they can 
begin offering long-distance service to their customers. 

</P>

	Law Said Not Cutting Telecom Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer groups said today that the lower  
cable and telephone prices promised by a 1996 law haven't 
materialized for many customers. The Consumers Union and the 
Consumer Federation of America said widespread competition that the 
telecommunications law was supposed to generate has not happened, 
and as a result prices have not gone down as anticipated. Federal 
Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard believes that 
``generally, for consumers, we're on the right track,'' said FCC 
spokeswoman Liz Rose. Decker Anstrom, president of the National 
Cable Television Association, disagreed with the report's findings 
saying that consumer have more choices every day and extensive 
federal regulation would stifle investment and innovation.

	Brazil Chooses New Bank Chief  
</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stock markets and currency

of shaking investors' already jittery nerves, yesterday's 
appointment of market insider Arminio Fraga appeared to have 
brought Latin America's largest economy a measure of credibility. 

</P>

	Limits on World Bank Checkups Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brazil, India and other major developing  
countries want to limit the ability of a World Bank inspection 
panel to make in-country investigations. The group's inspections 
deal with protests from those who say bank-financed bridges, roads 
or dams may harm them or the environment. In the past, complaints 
to the watchdog panel have come from rubber tappers in Brazil, 
rural residents forced to resettle in India, even shareholders in a 
jute mill in Bangladesh who said bank practices hurt their 
investments.

	Time Warner Profit Off  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit dropped  
58 percent as the value of its stake in a satellite broadcasting 
business was reduced. But the returns from the company's operations 
rose on the strength of its magazines, cable networks and music 
division. The company earned $90 million in the last three months 
of 1998. But that represented a loss of 17 cents a common share 
after making required dividend payouts on its preferred stock. Time 
Warner earned $216 million, or 11 cents a share, in the same period 
a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent to $7.46 billion from $6.97 
billion.

	New York Times Earnings Up 2 Pct.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. today posted a 2 percent

or 45 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent 
to $782.2 million from $768.4 million. Costs related to staff 
reductions reduced pre-tax earnings by $5.4 million, or 2 cents a 
share, in the latest quarter. Excluding those costs, the results 
matched analysts' expectations.

	Goodyear Profit Up for Quarter, Yr.  
</P>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. posted sharply  
higher earnings for the fourth quarter despite a decline in sales. 
The tire maker said today that it earned $121.5 million, or 78 
cents per share, in the final three months of 1998, compared with 
$2 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $3.2

<HEADLINE> Northwest Price Lawsuit Resurrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines' pricing practices may be  
examined in court after a federal appeals court ruling that revives 
a consumer lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled Tuesday that a district judge erred in dismissing the lawsuit 
that accused Northwest of overcharging ticket buyers since a 1986 
merger with Republic Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would send the case back to district court, but  
Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that has been litigated before three federal  
judges already and has been rejected each time until today,'' 
Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven consumers filed the lawsuit in 1997, arguing that the 1986  
merger violated antitrust law and led to higher ticket prices for 
passengers at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where 
Northwest accounts for 80 percent of the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumers, who are seeking as much as $400 million in  
alleged fare overcharges each year, sued under a section of the 
Clayton Antitrust Act that prohibits companies from 
anti-competitive use of stock and assets that they acquire. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest argued, however, that since the two airlines fully  
merged and Republic's stock ceased to exist, no claim was possible 
under that part of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year U.S. District Judge David Doty dismissed the suit,  
ruling that since the deal had been approved by the U.S. Department 
of Transportation, the plaintiffs could not challenge the merger 
based on the Clayton Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The three appellate judges disagreed, saying the section wording  
expressly provides for such a claim even when all of a company's 
stock or assets are acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, New  
York, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and 
Wisconsin filed friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the 
consumers, arguing that Doty misread the law in his earlier ruling.

<HEADLINE> Drug Combinations for AIDS Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The death of two children in a French AIDS study  
has raised possible concerns about drug combinations used to 
prevent HIV-infected mothers from passing the virus to their babies 
during birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of the drug AZT to stop mother-to-child transmission of  
HIV is often cited as one of the greatest successes in efforts 
against AIDS. The drug can cut in half the risk, which is typically 
around 20 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since AZT's benefits in this area were shown five years ago,  
doctors in the United States and France have largely switched to 
using AZT in combination with 3TC, a similar AIDS drug, for 
pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dr. Stephene Blanche and others from INSERM, the  
French research organization, presented preliminary results from a 
study that compared AZT alone to AZT plus 3TC. Of 194 babies born 
without AIDS, two who took the drug combination developed a rare 
disorder and died in their first year of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder is caused by genetic damage to the mitochondrial  
DNA, which is a possible hazard of drugs like AZT and 3TC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if there is any link at all between the deaths  
and these drugs,'' cautioned Dr. Joseph Saba of the United Nations 
AIDS program. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, experts cautioned that the two cases could be  
coincidental, and the drugs may not be involved in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanche presented his data at the 6th Conference on Retroviruses  
and Opportunistic Infections. At the same conference on Monday, 
Saba released data from a study in Africa showing that giving just 
one week of the AZT-3TC combination significantly cuts the risk of 
transmitting HIV during childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Saba said that even though the combination is widely used in  
industrialized countries, no one has seen any trend of 
mitochondrial damage or other unusual side effects in babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kevin DeCock of the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention in Atlanta said the CDC will investigate U.S. data to 
see if it turns up any health problems in the babies of women 
taking the combination. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the French study will investigate the effects of 32  
weeks of AZT and 3TC during pregnancy in the babies of 440 women. 
They will be compared with 899 who got AZT alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary results found that HIV was passed on to 3  
percent of babies whose mothers got the combination and 7 percent 
receiving AZT alone.

<HEADLINE> No More Sandwiches on Delta Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some Delta Air Lines passengers soon may find  
their food bags lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	To cut food costs, the Atlanta-based airline is taking  
sandwiches out of SkyDeli bags on 140 flights beginning Thursday, 
replacing them with crackers and cheese, or carrots and dip. 
</P>
<P>
	The bags are offered to coach passengers as they board flights  
at certain times of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	First-class fliers also will be affected. Delta is downgrading  
full meals to snacks in first class on 80 flights. Passengers on 
another 160 first-class flights will get beverages instead of 
snacks, spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flights affected are either shorter flights or between  
mealtimes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moussouri said SkyDeli contents and first-class menus are  
unchanged on most of Delta's more than 2,600 daily flights. Delta 
also will start announcing the type of food service at the gate, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks, expected to save $14 million annually, follow a $1  
billion profit in 1998. The airline's new management is touting 
efforts to rebuild its service reputation, which fell during a 
financial crisis in the early 1990s. 
</P>

	Ms. Moussouri said Delta, which cut per-passenger food expenses  
42 percent during the financial crunch, reversed the trend last 
year by beefing up SkyDeli contents and adding variety to 
first-class menus. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Delta is spending heavily on other service-related  
items such as new planes, airport boarding technology and improved 
business-class cabins on international jets.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Presses for Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat affirmed  
Wednesday he intends to carry out the stalled West Bank accords 
with Israel. Protests grew, meanwhile, over his planned meeting 
with President Clinton at a prayer breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, on a brief U.S. visit, is due to discuss peace prospects  
with Clinton at a prayer breakfast Thursday. But the spokesman for 
the breakfast chairman, Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., said Largent 
had asked Clinton last Friday ``not to politicize the breakfast by 
having the meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Brad Keena, said Largent supported Arafat's  
attendance but disapproved of Clinton's taking up controversial 
issues at the breakfast with the Palestinian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Christian leaders plan to attend the 47th breakfast  
sponsored by members of Congress. But several Christian and Jewish 
groups have called for a boycott and accused Arafat of an 
unrepentant terrorist past. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrations are expected outside the hotel. Keena called that  
evidence the breakfast had been politicized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am insistent on following up the peace process,'' Arafat  
told reporters Wednesday after a 40-minute meeting with Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is stalled, with Israel refusing to yield more land  
until Arafat's Palestinian Authority imposes tougher restraints on 
terrorism and prosecutes suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, in a brief exchange at the doorway of the State  
Department, did not say how he thought the process could be 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
	On another touchy subject, he said Palestinian leaders were  
grappling with the question of a Palestinian state. ``This can't be 
mentioned now,'' Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has urged Arafat to stop declaring  
his intention to set up a state next May if negotiations with 
Israel fail to produce what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	In her meeting with Arafat, Albright also raised concerns about  
whether terrorist suspects are treated leniently by Palestinian 
authorities, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also surveyed the stalled West Bank process and agreed to  
hold a meeting in mid-February of a joint U.S.-Palestinian 
commission to develop trade, scientific and cultural ties, Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader got a boost before arriving, though, when  
the State Department announced it had no evidence to support 
Israeli accusations that suspects in attacks on Americans had been 
set free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those charges, so far as we can tell, are simply not proven by  
any evidence,'' Rubin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rubin disputed Israel's assertion, he said that ``with  
respect to other related issues of larger numbers of people in the 
revolving door, let me say that we do have concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``revolving door'' is a reference to Israeli claims that  
suspects are detained and then quietly let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sensitive issue is Arafat's periodic declarations that  
the Palestinians will establish a state whatever the outcome of 
negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said he planned to introduce a  
resolution opposing a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian 
state. Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said 
they planned to introduce Salmon's resolution in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative that President Clinton make it crystal clear  
to Mr. Arafat that a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state 
is not an option and will not be recognized by the United States,'' 
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the administration did not support a unilateral  
declaration by the Palestinians. ``We think that would be a 
mistake, that would undermine the ability to negotiate a permanent 
status issue,'' he said. ``We have made that point very clear to 
the Palestinians, and we will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said  
he would boycott the prayer breakfast. To attend, Tate said, 
``would provide legitimacy to an unrepentant terrorist who has the 
blood of thousands on his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the National Jewish Coalition, Matt  
Brooks, said Arafat had not ``changed his ways.'' Brooks repeated 
the Israeli assertion that five suspects in attacks in which 
Americans were killed had been released.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Budget Would Raise Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under President Clinton's new budget  
proposals, companies and investors would face some 70 targeted tax 
increases and 16 loophole-closings in a plan aimed at raising $82 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	A substantial portion of the package is a 55 cent-a-pack  
cigarette tax increase that would raise $34.5 billion. Other 
proposed business tax increases and new taxes, however, have upset 
Wall Street, small businesses, manufacturers, insurance companies 
and other industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress rejected some of the same proposed tax increases last  
year, and they could run into trouble with lawmakers again. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan is ``kind of picking pockets and not really  
accomplishing a great deal,'' Bruce Josten, executive vice 
president for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
said Tuesday. ``Congress is not going to be duped. ... The 
likelihood of these passing is not high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups expressed bafflement at Clinton proposing tax  
increases when the federal budget is expected to continue in 
surplus for the next 25 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are especially incensed by a proposal to tax  
companies on the punitive damages they pay to people who win civil 
suits against them. Under current law, companies are charged taxes 
on criminal fines they pay, but civil damages can be deducted as a 
business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be unfair to eliminate that deduction without  
``meaningful reform of the civil justice system,'' the National 
Association of Manufacturers said. The manufacturers and other 
industries believe the civil litigation system, especially for 
product liability cases, favors people who sue over the companies 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax change would bring the Treasury some $600 million over  
five years, the administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the business groups applauded Clinton's  
proposal to extend the corporate tax credit for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, meanwhile, is particularly keen about its plans  
for closing corporate tax loopholes and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it wants to force companies to pay taxes on  
``forward'' sales of corporate stock on which a payment is 
deferred. A company sells its stock ``forward'' by agreeing to 
issue its stock at a later date in exchange for future payments. If 
a stock is selling for $100 today and it was sold forward for $105 
three years from now, the $5 per-share difference would be taxed 
under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed business tax increases and new taxes are the flip  
side of -- and the suggested way to pay for -- Clinton's proposed 
$36.2 billion in tax breaks for groups ranging from stay-at-home 
parents to the steel industry. The breaks are tailored to social 
needs such as education, health insurance and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The securities industry maintained that some of the proposals  
would hurt the stock and bond markets and undermine some 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that the administration is proposing taxes  
that would raise the cost of capital for companies seeking (money) 
to expand and strengthen their businesses,'' said Marc Lackritz, 
president of the Securities Industry Association. ``A pro-investing 
tax policy is critical to sustaining the engine driving the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bond Market Association warned that the Clinton plan  
could deter needed investment in the nation's schools, hospitals 
and other infrastructure by raising borrowing costs for companies, 
states, cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, many of which are arcane, also include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Taxes on certain kinds of stock to prevent companies from  
avoiding taxes on the sale or spinoff of subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Closing a loophole in a way that would discourage some small  
businesses from converting to so-called subchapter S corporations, 
whose shareholders get tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Taxing the investment income of industry trade associations, a  
proposal sure to be unpopular in lobbyist-rich Washington.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Sick of Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American public is worn out with the  
impeachment process and has grown critical of the Senate for its 
handling of President Clinton's trial, says a poll released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're mostly blaming Republicans, according to the CBS  
News/New York Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	While political analysts say there remains time for Republicans  
to change the subject after the trial and push their legislative 
agenda, the poll found unease within the GOP that the continuing 
impeachment saga will hurt the party's prospects in the 2000 
elections. Half the conservative Republicans surveyed said the way 
House and Senate Republicans have handled the matter would make it 
harder for Republican candidates to win elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than two-thirds of those polled said the Senate  
does not need to call witnesses to help senators decide how to vote 
on the articles of impeachment. Almost three-quarters said the 
videotaped testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney 
Blumenthal should not be made public, and more than three-quarters 
said the Senate trial has taught them nothing new about the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate is handling  
the trial, while 37 percent approved. Just three weeks ago, in a 
poll by CBS News, 46 percent said they approved the Senate's 
handling of the trial, and 41 percent disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who identified themselves as conservative  
Republicans, almost a third said they didn't approve of how the 
Senate was conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans were viewed as the party most capable of  
upholding moral values, Democrats were considered most able to 
tackle issues like Social Security, education and health care. 
Democrats were viewed at least as able as Republicans to handle 
issues like tax cuts and crime, normally considered the province of 
the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those questioned said the way House and Senate  
Republicans have handled the impeachment matter has hurt the public 
image of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of Americans said they hold a positive view of  
the Democratic Party, while 37 percent hold a negative view. For 
Republicans, 41 percent had a positive view, 52 percent negative. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,058 adults taken Saturday through Monday had a  
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Country Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- With one huge exception, country music  
fans will be able to see their favorites play live in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Garth Brooks, all the big names are touring this  
year, including Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, George 
Strait and Tim McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	Country music concerts grossed a healthy $150 million in 1998,  
according to Amusement Business magazine. That's a 23 percent 
improvement from 1997, but still trails the $160 million grossed in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big money is being divided by a small number of stars.  
</P>
<P>
	``After the first four or five acts, it drops off pretty  
quick,'' said Ray Waddell of Amusement Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain, who sold more than 1 million tickets in 1998, will  
continue her tour through most of 1999, with dates in Australia in 
February. McEntire and Brooks &AMP; Dunn, who toured together in 1997 
and 1998, will do separate tours in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Many artists will scramble for opening act slots on tours.  
Others have already landed on two major package shows, headlined by 
George Strait and Alan Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim McGraw, the Dixie Chicks, Jo Dee Messina, Kenny Chesney,  
veteran group Asleep at the Wheel and Mark Wills will all play on 
some of Strait's 18 stadium shows, a reprise of last year's 
smashingly successful tour. Jackson is taking Chad Brock, Clint 
Daniels, Sara Evans, Andy Griggs and Danni Leigh out on his ``High 
Mileage Road Show,'' which is modeled on the Grand Ole Opry road 
shows of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he wants to help young artists the same way Randy  
Travis and Alabama once boosted his career by letting him open 
their shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that this would be a good idea, seeing as it's so  
hard to get a leg up in the business,'' Jackson said. ``I remember 
those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsorship also can help. For example, Moore is  
promoting the Crown Royal Untamed &AMP; True 2 tour, featuring Mark 
Chestnutt, Gary Allan, Chely Wright and Keith Harling. All are with 
MCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Crown Royal is underwriting the 40-city tour, it's  
financially feasible to play smaller venues and charge less per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think in a typical business downturn like we're starting  
to experience in Nashville, we're having a 'flight to creativity.' 
We have to build things that have a perceived larger value, and to 
take the safe route,'' Moore said. ``Brooks &AMP; Dunn touring with 
Reba McEntire was a classic example of creative packaging, where 
two big headliners got together for one show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar fashion, Hank Williams Jr. and Lynyrd Skynyrd are  
touring together this year. And McGraw, a proven headliner, will 
for the second straight year open some shows for Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' McGraw said. ``I don't have to worry about  
overhead. Just pay for the bus and the band, and there's 50 or 
60,000 people waiting to see George Strait and they're real 
responsive to us. And we get paid pretty well, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't catch on with a big tour should consider cutting  
their overhead so they can work in the remaining clubs and build an 
audience, said Dick McVey, a former editor with Performance 
Magazine now working on a directory for the touring industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these acts should sell the tour buses and go back to  
vans,'' McVey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The step might be worth it, if an act can deliver the goods and  
capitalize on the public's desire for something new. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people have proven repeatedly that they're open to fresh  
new talent,'' Waddell said. ``Look at the Dixie Chicks and Shania 
Twain, who did something fresh and different musically and were 
able to break through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This indicates to me that the public is hungry for fresh  
talent. You can't do the same-old, same-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Want Clinton Trial Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some Republican governors are worried that the public  
frustration over President Clinton's impeachment trial is having a 
negative impact on the GOP. But at least one is optimistic the tide 
will eventually turn in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton is fatally wounded and will limp  
through the rest of his presidency,'' said Oklahoma Gov. Frank 
Keating. That outcome, Keating said, might help the GOP win the 
presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if that scenario holds true, Keating, chairman of the  
Republican Governor's Association, agrees that the GOP is bearing 
the brunt of public disgust now. He believes there should be ``a 
heads-up vote, yes or no'' immediately on whether to continue the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to vote today on whether to call witnesses to  
testify on the floor -- a move that could prolong President 
Clinton's trial. A vote against testimony could mean the beginning 
of the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said he hopes the trial ends as  
soon as possible. He pointed to GOP losses in last fall's 
congressional elections as proof that many Americans believe 
Republicans are responsible for what they consider partisanship and 
foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There appeared to be, here and in the rest of the country,  
support for Democrats and dissatisfaction with Republicans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster has been banging that drum for  
months, saying Republicans should end the trial speedily because 
they don't have the votes to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner this is wound up the better off the country is  
going to be, and for sure, the Republican Party,'' he said. 
``People just don't like what's happening in Washington. They don't 
like the way it's been drawn out on totally partisan lines. You 
cannot impeach a president on partisan lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP governors, including Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Cecil  
Underwood of West Virginia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska, said 
voters will judge Republicans more by what they accomplish in the 
way of programs than by the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are so wrapped up and consumed by this,  
but when you get out in the heartland, people aren't paying that 
much attention,'' said John Truscott, spokesman for Michigan Gov. 
John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the wrath of a disgusted public may cross party  
lines and leave people mad at politicians in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this process has hurt everybody. It's hurt Bill  
Clinton, it's certainly hurt his family. It's hurt the House of 
Representatives, it's hurt the Senate. In the eyes of the average 
citizen, it's a mess,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Said Helps Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public reaction to the Congress' handling of  
President Clinton's impeachment has the cash register ringing at 
the Democratic National Committee, party officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grossman, serving as the party's co-chairman for the last  
time at a $1 million fund-raiser Tuesday night in New York City, 
said the DNC had hoped to raise $1 million from small donors -- 
people who on average give $26 to the party -- in January. ``We 
raised well over $2 million,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are hundreds of thousands of citizens all over the  
country who are angry, who are outraged,'' Grossman said. ``They 
are voting with their wallets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grossman spoke before the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, attended a gathering of deep-pocketed supporters at a 
$10,000-a-plate dinner of sea bass at the exclusive Le Cirque 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's first fund-raising swing of the year began earlier  
Tuesday in Boston, where he attended a $700,000 lunch and a 
reception for smaller donors. It took place while House impeachment 
managers in Washington were quizzing presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan about his efforts to assist Monica Lewinsky's job hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	After the dinner at Le Cirque, Clinton sought to portray the  
impact of what he said were the achievements of his administration 
-- dropping crime rates, low unemployment, smaller welfare rolls and 
a robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What matters to me is the lives it changed,'' he said, adding  
that investing more in education and using the budget surplus to 
shore up Social Security ``will change the future of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a public elementary school in Boston, Clinton backed his call  
to fix or close failing schools with a $200 million proposal to 
support intervention in troubled classrooms and challenged 
Republicans to a debate over increasing accountability in the 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, concerned that Clinton's education proposals would  
encroach upon state and local school autonomy, questioned whether 
his new budget does enough to directly support teaching and whether 
it allows local school officials enough flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and  
Workforce Committee, said Clinton was seeking to micromanage local 
schools from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the president's proposals, Washington bureaucrats will  
call the shots on most of the major issues confronting states and 
local school districts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said teachers and parents want greater  
accountability from their school systems, which receive $15 billion 
in federal funds annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine any company spending $15 billion and saying,  
'Here's the money, we don't care what the results are?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton returned to Washington late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Auto Sales Up 12 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Snow didn't chill the climate for car buyers in  
January, as the industry saw its U.S. sales of cars and light 
trucks jump 12 percent over the start of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, said  
Wednesday its sales were up 4 percent, due to swift passenger car 
sales. As a group, GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG had a 
9 percent increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas automakers did even better. Asian companies had an 18  
percent increase, while European companies were up 21 percent, 
based on the daily sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry was amazingly strong,'' said analyst Maryann  
Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. ``With all the year-end clearance 
sales, I would have thought people who wanted to buy a car would 
have come in and bought a car last year. Apparently the momentum we 
saw in 1998 carried through to 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the hearty news was one blotch for GM, which reported a 3.8  
percent decline in truck sales. Most automakers that offer pickups, 
minivans or sport utility vehicles reported surging sales on the 
highly profitable models. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials said the company was still working through delays  
from labor strikes last summer that slowed the retooling needed to 
build new versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 
pickups. They said GM would add enough capacity to build 250,000 
more trucks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plants are going full-blast, but inventories aren't where  
we want them to be,'' said Donald DeVeaux, director of North 
American market analysis for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of GM's truck lineup -- such as the Chevy Tahoe,  
Jimmy SUVs and the Chevy Venture minivan -- were also down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat surprising, because the truck market is larger  
than just pickup trucks,'' Keller said. ``While GM has an inventory 
problem in the pickup sector, they have no shortage of SUVs or 
minivans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger car sales were up 11 percent over a slow January last  
year. The Oldsmobile division got the biggest boost, thanks to the 
new Alero. Pontiac and Buick also saw sales increases due to 
midsize sedans, namely the Pontiac Grand Am and Buick Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's decision to sell all its SC coupes with a third door on  
the driver's side appeared to pay off. The model's sales were up 26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Japanese automakers reported wildly different results.  
Mitsubishi Motors Co. said its sales were up 18.7 percent, while 
struggling Mazda Motor Co. said it sales fell 3.8 percent.

<P>
	Keller and GM officials said much of the increases came from  
good economic times -- low interest rates, high employment, cheap 
new car prices -- rather than sales incentives. As long as those 
factors didn't change, they said, the industry would do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people buy a car using some method of financing,'' Keller  
said. ``The actual dollar level of incentives in the market today 
is a few hundred dollars less than it was in summer, but the 
consumer is probably getting that much benefit from lower interest 
rates and low finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dream.''

<HEADLINE> Union Files Grievance for Hernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The players' association has filed a grievance  
on behalf of reliever Xavier Hernandez, who signed a $250,000, 
one-year contract with Houston after Baltimore voided his $2.7 
million, two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles voided the contract after saying the 33-year-old  
right-hander flunked a physical. Arbitrator Richard Bloch is 
scheduled to hear arguments May 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 ERA last year, is  
seeking the difference between his deals with the Orioles and 
Astros. As part of his contract with Houston, he can earn an 
additional $250,000 in roster bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch will hear the case as an interim arbitrator. Players and  
owners are searching for a new arbitrator to replace Cornell 
professor Dana Eischen, who was hired in December 1997 but quit 
after ruling in May against J.D. Drew's grievance seeking free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren didn't want to address the  
matter. The team was said to be concerned with the condition of the 
pitcher's right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those things I can't comment on because there's  
a grievance pending,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez agreed to his deal with Baltimore on Dec. 17, getting  
a contract that called for $1.2 million this year and $1.25 million 
in 2000. The Orioles had a $1.5 million option for 2001 with a 
$250,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his deal with Houston, he would get bonuses of $50,000  
each for 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days on the active major league 
roster, not including time spent on the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Cutting Edge TV Not Quite Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Analysts who watch the television  
industry say high-tech skinny sets will take years longer than 
originally expected to end up in most American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at Display Works '99-- a conference on electronic screen  
technology-- acknowledged Wednesday they've been overzealous in 
their predictions and that prices aren't nearly low enough for the 
average consumer. Instead, they said, the bulky glass ``cathode 
ray'' tubes invented 100 years ago will continue to dominate the 
market at least through the year 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's price, price, price, price, price and price,'' said  
Thomas Striegler, a flat panel display consultant from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were plenty of people in our industry who were  
overbullish about flat panel displays, but they're not even close 
to taking over the market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-inch flat panel display television sells for about $12,000.  
A comparable cathode ray tube television will cost about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would someone pay so much more for something that doesn't  
do anything better except that it's slimmer?'' asked Striegler. 
``Bragging rights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathode ray tubes, used in desktop computer monitors and  
television sets, emit a beam of electrons that illuminate phosphors 
on the inside of the screen as the beam sweeps back and forth. With 
$200 million invested in factories to make them in Japan, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and China, companies aren't moving quickly to give them 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Flat panel displays are now used in laptop computers, digital  
watch faces and other small electronic devices and use a variety of 
different technologies. Each can also be used to create skinny 
television sets that hang on a wall like a picture and sleek 
computer monitors that leave space on desks for other work. 
</P>
<P>
	They create gorgeous images, but they're tremendously expensive  
to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. is waiting for manufacturers to figure out cheaper  
ways to build flat panel displays before even trying to get in to 
the market, said Sony technical service manager Dan King. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a normal, everyday customer, you and I are not going to pay  
for a flat panel today,'' said King. ``We feel it's going to be a 
few years before these are really ready for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Werner, editor of Information Display Magazine, said his  
industry always gets very excited by the new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that old cathode ray tube refuses to go away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Werner said analysts were predicting cathode  
ray tubes would be close to obsolete by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That year keeps going further and further into the future,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Chooses New Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stock markets and currency  
transactions were slightly weaker Wednesday following the naming of 
the country's second central bank president in as many months. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of shaking investors' already jittery nerves, Tuesday's  
appointment of market insider Arminio Fraga appeared to have 
brought Latin America's largest economy a measure of credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange,  
Latin America's largest, was off 0.6 percent on thin volume. The 
real, Brazil's currency, was 1.78 to the dollar, down slightly from 
Tuesday but much stronger than Monday's 1.91. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Fraga, a former associate of billionaire  
investor George Soros, replaced Francisco Lopes, who allowed the 
real to float freely on international markets. During Lopes' 
three-week rule, the real lost more than 40 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts welcomed Fraga's nomination, saying his experience  
on international financial markets -- he also has a doctorate in 
economics from Princeton University -- will help him ward off 
speculative attacks on the real. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike Lopes, who was too much of a theorist and did not have  
the managerial capacity to stop speculators, Fraga is a veteran 
market insider who knows both sides of the coin,'' said Jose 
Luciano Dias, a Brasilia-based political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an internationally respected figure who plays according to  
market rules, he should help dispel some of dark clouds that have 
been hovering over the economy,'' said economist Marcio Pochmann of 
the University of Campinas. 
</P>
<P>
	By ``dark clouds'' he said he meant a moratorium on Brazil's  
internal and foreign debts and controls on foreign currency 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Reinaldo Goncalves, an economist at Rio de Janeiro's  
Federal University, did not see Fraga's appointment in such a 
positive light. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like letting a fox loose in a chicken coop,'' Goncalves  
told CBN radio. ``He is man with close ties to the international 
financial community and as such will attend to its needs, rather 
than the country's economic growth needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso rebutted criticism that  
Fraga's appointment was announced to please the International 
Monetary Fund. According to press reports, the IMF wasn't happy 
with Lopes' stewardship of the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fraga's appointment wasn't suggested or agreed to by the  
IMF,'' Cardoso told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Cardoso, Finance Minister Pedro Malan and Fraga met  
with IMF deputy director Stanley Fischer to review the terms of a 
$41.5 billion aid package finalized last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer, who was expected to leave Wednesday for New York,  
announced he would delay his return until at least Thursday and 
that his IMF delegation would be staying on for a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Brazil unveiled a broad fiscal plan aimed at  
shaving $16 billion from the government's budget deficit. The plan 
included a number of fiscal goals that helped Brazil qualify for 
the IMF-led credit line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among these goals was a reduction of the public deficit to  
4.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1999. The deficit now 
stands at about 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso said Brazil would maintain its fiscal targets despite  
the recent devaluation of the real. He said market confidence was 
slowly returning and that inflation would be kept at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency's devaluation spelled the end of a 1994 economic  
stabilization program that successfully brought inflation down from 
nearly 3,000 percent a year to about 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists have revised their pre-devaluation annual  
inflation estimates of near-zero in 1999 to as much as 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passengers Want More Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an unprecedented number of travelers now  
on the move, airline complaints are increasing, passengers are 
demanding more rights, and members of Congress are listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's oversold flights, frequent flier miles they can't  
redeem or travelers being trapped aboard snowbound planes, 
passengers and their supporters want customer service to be more of 
a concern for airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real point is to make sure that the airlines bring some of  
their creativity and extraordinary entrepreneurial skill into 
making sure that the passengers who use their service get through 
it without feeling like a dish rag,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have written a bill that would  
give passengers 48 hours to cancel tickets that are currently 
nonrefundable. Among other things, the bill would also require 
airlines to explain why flights are delayed and tell frequent 
fliers how many seats are available if they want to cash in their 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines got freedom with deregulation, and frankly a lot of  
them exploited that freedom unfairly,'' Wyden explained. ``It seems 
to me you have a situation where airline profits are going through 
the roof and passenger service is being left at the gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines, and even some pro-traveler groups, beg to differ.  
</P>
<P>
	``We as airline passengers keep telling airlines what we want is  
low fares, low fares, low fares,'' said David Stempler, president 
of the Air Travelers Association, a group that serves passengers 
and tries to expand air service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start mucking around with that system that has a very  
delicate balance, it's possible fares will go up for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there are signs that airline profits may have peaked, the  
numbers still show that this is a gold-plated era for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Major U.S. carriers posted net profits of $5.1 billion last  
year, down just slightly from their all-time record of $5.2 billion 
in 1997. United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, alone had 
net earnings of $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, U.S. airlines also carried an estimated 615  
million passengers in 1998, filling their planes to near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways ended the year with a record average of 72.7 percent  
of its seats filled. With so-called load factors so high, there are 
few seats between passengers, little extra room for standbys and 
almost no margin for relief when a flight is canceled and 
passengers have to be rebooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects are being felt across the system. Transportation  
Department reported Tuesday that passengers filed 9,606 service 
complaints with the department in 1998, not in itself a huge 
number, but 25 percent more than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, airlines posted a mishandled baggage rate of  
5.16 complaints per 1,000 passengers, compared with 4.96 per 1,000 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Jarvis, a law professor and author of ``Travel Law: Cases  
and Materials,'' a textbook on passenger issues, said airlines can 
afford to be rough with passengers because competition has fallen 
since the industry was deregulated in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that's partly to blame for the increase in stories about  
unruly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're packing more people into planes, you're giving them  
less service and what you're giving them is not very friendly 
service,'' Jarvis said. ``What you've done is create an environment 
for unruly behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United has been the most blunt among the major carriers in  
acknowledging the current problems. Its ads no longer brag about 
whisking customers through the ``friendly skies;'' rather, they 
make the more modest claim that United's service is ``rising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means trying to improve on-time performance by giving extra  
time between connecting flights. It also means making passengers 
more comfortable with new planes, cushier seats and individual 
video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try to be responsive to the traveling public,'' said  
United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``We are a transportation business, 
but we're also a service business. And we try to focus on that with 
all our employees.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood's New Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Television changed the night of Jan. 25,  
1996, and it's only now becoming clear how much. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Thursday. CBS needed to schedule something for a TV  
graveyard shift, opposite ``Seinfeld,'' so it aired an 
independently produced special called ``World's Most Dangerous 
Animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show collected film clips of horrifying moments from nature  
documentaries -- an elephant stomping on a trainer, a bear attacking 
a woman, sharks swallowing prey. They built toward a punch line 
endorsed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals: that man 
is most dangerous for what he's done to nature. 
</P>
<P>
	In his Los Angeles office the next day, Fox executive Mike  
Darnell scanned a printout that showed nearly one-fifth of people 
watching television the night before had tuned in to ``World's Most 
Dangerous Animals.'' Those are hard numbers to ignore. That day, 
Fox ordered its own special of the most visceral video, minus the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Animals Attack'' aired four months later, and a new  
television genre was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Reality shows, which appeal to Hollywood's love for cheap  
thrills and the just plain cheap, are the hottest and most 
controversial form of TV on today. 
</P>
<P>
	Its makers are Hollywood's renegades.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Shocking! Deadliest! Scariest! True!  
</P>
<P>
	The titles of many reality shows scream like headlines in a  
tabloid newspaper. Some are more entertaining than the programs: 
``World's Deadliest Swarms'' or ``When Good Pets Go Bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are truly the first TV shows created with the remote  
control in mind. What channel surfer would click away when he or 
she sees a building collapsing or a man putting his head in an 
alligator's mouth? 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic segments share characteristics with forbidden  
fruit and horror movies: You shouldn't be watching, you want to 
cover your eyes, but it's too hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
	A car races through an intersection, trailed by the police. An  
officer ducks behind his cruiser door to avoid gunfire. A soaked 
survivor dangles above raging floodwaters on a rope ladder 
suspended from a helicopter. A woman, thinking no one is watching, 
urinates on the desk of her boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically tapping in to people's emotions -- adrenaline,  
fear, excitement,'' Darnell said. ``I think it's what all of 
television does, whether it's fictionalized or whether it's 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through Darnell and his staff, Fox has perfected the genre.  
People gather in living rooms with their friends to watch their 
specials, like they would a football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is also familiar with ``When Critics Attack!'' No one admits  
to respecting the shows and they make many people angry. NBC 
executive Don Ohlmeyer called Fox's video of animal attacks ``one 
step short of a snuff film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're reprehensible,'' said George Gerbner, a Temple  
University professor who studies violence on television. ``They 
exploit the worst fears and nightmares of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell said he's simply trying to entertain. ``If I were doing  
news, then I would have some sort of social responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lines between news and entertainment had already been blurred by  
shows like ``COPS'' and ``A Current Affair'' when the current crop 
came in vogue. The roots stretch even deeper through the lowbrow 
entertainment of tabloids and freak shows. ``Candid Camera'' was a 
television ancestor, as well as those home video shows in which dad 
plays catch with his son and gets smacked in the head by a 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they've been turbocharged for the late 1990s.  
</P>
<P>
	``What are the worst of these shows but a carnival barker trying  
to get you into the tent? `Look at the man piercing his tongue; 
look at the 300-pound woman,''' said Erick Nelson, who runs Termite 
Art Productions in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has worked for years on the fringes of Hollywood,  
producing documentaries for MTV and VH1. Now, because of shows like 
``Busted on the Job'' and the upcoming ``Redhanded,'' in which acts 
of revenge against are caught on tape, he's in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	His company made ``World's Most Dangerous Animals.'' He's still  
proud of the show, happy to deliver a progressive message when most 
prime-time television avoids politics. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's distressed by what came next.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I opened up Pandora's box with `World's Most  
Dangerous Animals,''' he said. ``I've been trying to put it back in 
the box for the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's doesn't even want to be described as a reality show  
producer. Too many shows are exploitive, clips just designed to 
shock. He worries about shows desensitizing viewers to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Shock them so much they'll become numb to it all -- in real life  
as well as on television. ``You've got to ask yourself what are the 
consequences of your actions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The omnipresence of video cameras has made life easy for reality  
show producers. Cameras are everywhere. They secretly watch the 
movements of office workers, supermarket shoppers and ATM users. 
They're mounted on police cars as officers approach suspects. Mom 
and Dad carry one to their son's birthday party, and can easily 
point it out the window if a tornado rushes by. And there's always 
the nosy neighbor who captures a crime on film. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these cameras provide a mother lode of material for  
producers like Nelson and the industry's leader, Bruce Nash. 
</P>
<P>
	Their programs are pulled together from many sources. Nash  
negotiated with prisons for video of inmate riots that he made into 
``Prisoners Out of Control.'' Nelson worked with private security 
firms for the workplace scenes in ``Busted on the Job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers employed by Nash comb the Internet for strange news  
stories and investigate whether anyone has video. Hollywood agents 
peddle compelling video for ever-increasing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The most frequent sources are the libraries of local news  
stations. ``These shows are nothing but local news on steroids,'' 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, producers take news events -- tragedies -- and repackage  
them as entertainment months later. Nash used footage shot by a 
family on a beach vacation that caught an offshore plane tumbling 
and crashing into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started to watch that, I had no idea what was going to  
happen,'' he said. ``A lot of television, with comedy or dramas, 
you know what's going to happen. This is what television isn't -- 
it's unpredictable. It's more dramatic than what anybody could 
write dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are some places even the reality producers won't go.  
</P>
<P>
	No one dies during his shows, Nash said. He tries to stay away  
from violence for violence's sake, turning down a video of a police 
officer shooting himself accidentally. But the standard leaves a 
certain amount of wiggle room. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it was on Fox's schedule, Darnell shelved Nash's  
``Prisoners Out of Control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the tone of it was too dark, because it was prisoners,  
the dregs of society,'' Darnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the same reasons, he rejected a show called ``Crime and  
Punishment'' that showed things like prisoners writhing after being 
zapped by stun guns. 
</P>
<P>
	And Darnell said no when a producer pitched him -- in all  
sincerity -- a special called ``World's Most Embarrassing Throw-up 
Moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For network executives, reality shows are the equivalent of a  
sugar rush from a candy bar: grab one off the shelf and your 
ratings will quickly soar, at least for one night. 
</P>
<P>
	They're also cheap, compared to hiring writers and actors for a  
drama or comedy. The production costs are handled by somebody else, 
and the grainy quality of the film is part of the shtick. ABC 
Entertainment Chairman Stu Bloomberg conceded money was a factor in 
his network's decision to start developing reality shows. The WB 
recently hired a new executive with the mandate to come up with 
their own shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most satisfying to Nash was NBC's decision to order 13  
episodes of a reality series that will begin in March. Remember: 
This is a year after the network's top entertainment executive 
dismissed some of these shows as ``snuff films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden everyone's caught on the bandwagon,'' Darnell  
said. ``I don't know of a specials producer in town who won't do 
this material. In fact, people that I thought wouldn't do it have 
come to me and said, `We don't care anymore. We'll do it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Producers point out that the genre of ``nonfiction programming''  
is much broader than its critics like to talk about. Not all are 
shocking and dangerous. Nash delivered huge ratings for Fox with 
his series revealing the secrets of magicians. He has exposed 
professional wrestling's secrets, caught cheating spouses on tape 
and collected cheesy celebrity footage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying that all these shows are noble,'' he said.  
``But what I try to do is find some reason for showing you this, 
for airing these videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, a 51-year-old former bureaucrat for the North Carolina  
Department of Corrections, moved to California in 1994, peppering 
television executives with his ideas. One of the first shows he 
sold, ``Before They Were Stars,'' collected tapes of famous actors 
in their formative years. 
</P>
<P>
	He's now the busiest reality show producer in Hollywood,  
startled a few weeks ago to find a list of 120 names and numbers 
attached to his telephone. What's this? 
</P>
<P>
	Those are all the people who work for you, his assistant told  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, 43, said the genre gives a chance for talented people to  
break into a business where virtually all prime-time programming is 
produced by big studios or, increasingly, by networks themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through these shows, we're in the Big Room,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has moved toward lighter fare; he considers ``Busted on  
the Job'' a comedy show. He's looking to shoot his own material 
instead of being dependent on clips. One show he has in the works, 
``Crash Test,'' essentially takes David Letterman's idea of tossing 
watermelons out the window to see them splatter and applies it to 
Corvettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash has so many deals with different networks now that it's a  
wonder he can keep track of it all. He's looking to expand even 
further by developing situation comedies. His dream is to one day 
run the entertainment division of a major network. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows it will take a while to be accepted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Surge in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales for several automakers surged last  
month as demand for pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles 
continued to remain strong among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. all  
reported double-digit increases in sales Tuesday, while Ford Motor 
Co. experienced a 9 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect we'll see foreign brands and DaimlerChrysler picking  
up market share over Ford and GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst 
David Healy. ``These are strong numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it sold 259,615 vehicles last month -- 89,543 cars and  
170,072 light trucks. A 9 percent decline in car sales over January 
1998 was erased by a 22 percent increase in trucks, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford said last month broke a record for overall 
January sales set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All Ford truck models posted sales increases, the largest coming  
from the redesigned Windstar minivan, whose sales were up 54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing, sales and  
service, said the decrease in car sales came from a planned cut in 
sales to rental fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	One model that sold well: the new Mustang, whose sales increased  
34 percent. That car is made at Ford's River Rouge complex, which 
was shut down Monday after an explosion in the complex's power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it sold 56,176 cars and 139,631 light  
trucks last month, an increase of 18 percent over the previous 
year. The company reported strong sales for Dodge and Jeep trucks 
and SUVs, and said its large sedans -- Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler 
Concorde, LHS and 300M -- also sold well. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said some of DaimlerChrysler's gains might have come from  
the fleet sales that Ford shunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota reported a 27 percent jump in its sales for the month,  
with sales of the popular Toyota Camry sedan up 72 percent. The 
company's Lexus division benefited from sales of its two SUVs, the 
RX 300 and LX 470. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong market conditions that fueled near-record industry  
sales in the final quarter of 1998 should carry over well into 
1999,'' Yale Giesel, Toyota executive vice president, said in a 
statement. ``High consumer confidence and affordable interest rates 
will play a big part in how long the industry can maintain its 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. said U.S. sales were up 17 percent, driven by  
its Odyssey minivan and CR-V sport utility vehicle. Troubled Nissan 
Motor Co. also posted a sales gain of 4 percent, with increased 
truck sales overcoming a slight decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European automakers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and  
Volkswagen -- also posted sales gains. But Volvo AB, which Ford 
plans to buy for $6.45 billion, reported its sales declined 18 
percent from January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. is scheduled to release its sales report  
today.

<HEADLINE>  Guinea-Bissau Cease-Fire Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- The president of Guinea-Bissau and the  
rebel leader seeking to oust him agreed to a cease-fire Wednesday, 
halting the small West African nation's renewed civil war, the 
Portuguese Foreign Ministry announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign and defense ministers of Togo brokered the truce  
between President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel chief Brig. 
Ansumane Mane, the ministry statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital, Bissau, reportedly was calm after hours of intense  
battles as the rebels advanced on downtown areas of the city, 
toward the presidential palace in the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The loyalist forces, mostly troops from neighboring Senegal and  
the Republic of Guinea deployed to support Vieira, were holed up 
around the presidential palace on the eastern side of the capital 
and were heavily outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the country's 6,000-strong army have joined the  
rebellion aimed at deposing Vieira, whom the insurgents accuse of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 35 people have died and 220 have been wounded since the  
fighting flared Sunday, aid workers have said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truce could allow the repair of a November peace deal that  
halted a five-month civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the peace accord, Guinea-Bissau has 110 troops from  
ECOMOG, the defense arm of the Economic Community of West African 
States. Most of the troops are from Togo. Hundreds more were 
supposed to arrive by ship earlier this week but were unable to 
land due to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November's peace pact called for the withdrawal of foreign  
troops, a peacekeeping deployment to act as a buffer between the 
foes, an interim government of national unity, and general 
elections in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebellion, which first broke out in June, was triggered by  
the dismissal of Mane as top military commander for allegedly 
running guns to separatist fighters in Senegal. Mane denies the 
charge and has said that Vieira was behind the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinea-Bissau, a country of 1.1 million, is one of the 15  
poorest nations in the world, with an average annual Gross Domestic 
Product of $230 per capita in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Arafat Discuss Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerns about whether terrorist suspects are  
treated leniently by Palestinian authorities will be taken up with 
Yasser Arafat during his brief visit here, the State Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader got a boost before arriving, though, when  
the department announced it had no evidence to support Israeli 
accusations that suspects in attacks on Americans had been set 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those charges, so far as we can tell, are simply not proven by  
any evidence,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rubin disputed Israel's assertion, he said that ``with  
respect to other related issues of larger numbers of people in the 
revolving door, let me say that we do have concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``revolving door'' is a reference to Israeli claims that  
suspects are detained and then quietly let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat was meeting with Albright and members of Congress today,  
and hoped to have a few minutes with President Clinton at a prayer 
breakfast on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	His participation has sparked complaints by Christian  
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said  
he would boycott the breakfast. To attend, Tate said, ``would 
provide legitimacy to an unrepentant terrorist who has the blood of 
thousands on his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Thad Pinney, communications director for the  
Traditional Values Coalition, which represents 40,000 churches, 
said ``we are encouraging congressmen to boycott the breakfast 
because Arafat is an unrepentant terrorist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who is co-hosting a luncheon for  
Arafat, said continuation of the now-stalled peace process is the 
only hope for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of issues that have to be dealt with in the  
Middle East,'' he said in an interview. ``The American role is to 
push this process forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gejdenson, the senior Democrat on the House International  
Relations Committee, said he was ``frankly fearful if we do not do 
this in the near term it doesn't necessarily become easier in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other host is Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., whose family  
donated the Wye conference center where negotiations over the West 
Bank were held last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is hoping the visit can give a push to the stalled  
land-for-peace accord the Clinton administration engineered between 
Israel and the Palestinians at Wye. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for Israel to pull back on the West Bank in exchange  
for measures by the Palestinians to curb terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap concerns Israeli claims that five militants  
suspected in attacks in which Americans were victims had been set 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said ``we have checked into this thoroughly, and we have  
not seen any evidence that would confirm the charges that the 
individuals released were involved in the killing of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians had called the charges ``nonsense.''  
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu,  
rejected the U.S. finding. 
</P>
<P>
	He said five militants released by the Palestinian Authority  
were accessories to murder as participants in attacks that killed 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual killings were done by suicide bombers, so obviously  
it is not they we are talking about but the people who planned, 
organized and executed the attacks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indians Sign Wil Cordero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Wil Cordero, the troubled infielder/outfielder  
who pleaded guilty to attacking his wife in 1997, agreed Wednesday 
to a $500,000, one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, 27, spent last season with the Chicago White Sox, where  
he hit .267 (91-for-341) with 13 HRs and 49 RBIs in 96 games. He 
appeared in 83 games at first base, eight games in right field and 
four games in left. 
</P>
<P>
	While playing for the Boston Red Sox in 1997, Cordero received a  
90-day suspended sentence and ordered to attend counseling sessions 
after pleading guilty for an assault that left his wife bruised and 
bloodied. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, while playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Cordero  
was arrested for disturbing the peace after an altercation with his 
wife's former husband in a hotel on New Year's Day. He was released 
without bail and told to appear in court March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven major league seasons, Cordero has a .278 batting  
average with 71 HRs and 336 RBIs in 719 games. He was an All-Star 
with Montreal in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who also spoke with Milwaukee and Colorado, may be used  
as a backup in the outfield and behind Jim Thome at first. He also 
may see time as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to add a player of Wilfredo's caliber at  
this point in the off-season,'' Cleveland general manager John Hart 
said. ``He brings more depth to our ballclub and can help us in a 
variety of ways either as a role or every day player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Cordero could earn $500,000 in  
performance bonuses: $400,000 based on plate appearances at 
increments of 50 starting at 225 and ending at 575, and $100,000 
based on games at increments of 10 starting at 80 and ending at 
120.

<HEADLINE> Sun-Observing Satellite Now Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A month after the gyroscope that kept it  
stable failed, the SOHO sun-observing satellite is back in 
business, keeping its balance by watching the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time a spacecraft equipped with gyroscopes has  
carried on working without them, said Bernhard Fleck, European 
Space Agency project scientist for SOHO. ``We are very pleased, 
very happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $1 billion satellite was returned to service  
Tuesday, using a new computer program to help it keep its 
orientation without the failed gyroscope. SOHO stands for Solar and 
Heliospheric Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble developed on SOHO last June when it began spinning out  
of control. Scientists were able to return it to service in 
September, but it was frozen, and two of its three gyroscopes 
failed, said Fleck, who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The last gyroscope failed Dec. 21.  
</P>
<P>
	Without the gyroscopes to keep track of its position, the  
satellite had to constantly fire onboard jets to keep it pointed 
toward the sun, a practice that threatened to rapidly exhaust its 
fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleck said engineers in the Netherlands were able to develop a  
computer program that allowed the satellite to bypass the broken 
gyroscopes and instead use a star tracker to allow it to determine 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
	With that information, three spinning momentum wheels aboard the  
craft can be directed to speed up or slow down to keep it properly 
oriented, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This was done on Saturday, the craft was maneuvered to a new  
position on Monday and, on Tuesday, said Fleck, ``we returned to 
normal where the spacecraft is perfectly pointing toward the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOHO was launched in December 1995, and the mission is now  
expected to continue until 2003, allowing it to observe intense 
solar activity when the number of sunspots reaches a maximum around 
mid-2000.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Still Mulling Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The leader of the state Democratic Party  
said Wednesday there is a 50-50 chance Hillary Rodham Clinton will 
enter New York's Senate race next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, state party Chairwoman Judith Hope was saying  
she did not believe Mrs. Clinton would run for the seat being 
vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and that the first 
lady had asked her several months ago not to encourage such 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you hear me saying something different,'' Hope said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The party leader said that after spending time with the first  
lady at a $10,000-a-person Democratic fund-raising event in New 
York City on Tuesday night ``it's my very strong impression that 
she has not ruled this out ... I'm sharing with you my impressions 
that she left with me and I think with others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My best guess is that it's 50-50,'' Hope said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hope refused to say if she had spoken directly to Mrs. Clinton  
or close aides to the first lady in recent days about the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a recent poll had Mrs. Clinton leading New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a theoretical Senate matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll conducted by Quinnipiac College's Polling Institute had  
Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of registered voters to 42 
percent for the Republican mayor with 6 percent undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has said he is considering a run.  
</P>
<P>
	Much of Mrs. Clinton's support came from women, who favored her  
over Giuliani 58 percent to 36 percent. Male voters preferred 
Giuliani 49 percent to 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 1,191 registered New York voters  
was conducted Jan. 26-Feb. 1 and has a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> German Strikes Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Employers offered a 2.3 percent pay  
increase Wednesday that union leaders rejected as ``laughable,'' 
and more than 150,000 Germany industrial workers held a fourth day 
of warning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful IG Metall metalworkers union is demanding pay  
increases of 6.5 percent for 3.4 million workers throughout the 
country. The employers' previous offer was 2 percent increases plus 
one-time lump payments of 0.5 percent of pay from companies that 
can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest offer was made at third-round talks in the southern  
Baden-Wuerttemberg negotiating district, which has about 840,000 
industrial employees. New talks were scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall has set a deadline of Feb. 11 for a ``reasonable''  
offer, saying it is prepared to launch full-fledged strikes instead 
of warning strikes that last just a few hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall's negotiator Berthold Huber called the latest offer  
``unsettling news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the employers continue to stick to this line, then a vote  
and strikes are already programmed,'' union spokesman Claus Eilrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes, which have included automakers and the electrical  
industry, are being watched closely because IG Metall's contract 
traditionally sets standards for wages in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder appealed to both sides Tuesday to  
reach a compromise. He urged a ``sensible accord that respects the 
wider economic conditions,'' a reference to a slowing economy and 
unemployment at nearly 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting union demands, employers say pay raises would force  
layoffs and endanger government talks with unions and employers on 
how to create more jobs to lower unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	But IG Metall says workers deserve a greater share of German  
industry's burgeoning profits after several years of wage 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall Chairman Klaus Zwickel also has said the employers are  
not sincere about the job creation talks and are trying to use 
union wage demands as an excuse to ditch them.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Gymnast Gets OK To Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors say paralyzed gymnast Sang Lan can go  
home to China in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to go back,'' said the 17-year-old gymnast.  
``But I will miss New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, presented her with an  
award honoring her courage, from Women's Sports and Fitness 
magazine on Tuesday night, and she also got a ``Fun, Fearless, 
Force'' award from Cosmopolitan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Chinese gymnastics team, Sang was severely  
injured doing a warmup exercise during the Goodwill Games last 
summer in Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	She was paralyzed from the neck down but has regained some  
strength in her shoulders, elbows and wrists and can raise her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang was treated at Mount Sinai-New York University Medical  
Center and moved last fall to a friend's apartment in Manhattan as 
her rehabilitation continued. 
</P>
<P>
	She has received thousands of e-mails and letters from her fans  
in China. She will live with her parents, who run a business in 
Beijing.

<P>
	It wasn't among the honors handed out last Saturday night, but  
one just couldn't ignore what the makers of ``American Movie'' had 
to go through to get their documentary sold. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Jan. 26 screening, pieces of the movie theater's

included many studio executives looking to possibly buy the film.

	Three people were hurt, none seriously.

	Depending on whom you talk to, Miramax either did or didn't  
spend $2.5 million for ``Happy, Texas,'' a hilarious tale of two 
escaped convicts who wander into a small Texas town, only to be 
confused with being a gay couple hired to help train the town's 
little girls for a beauty pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the acquisition deal insisted that Miramax  
spent only $2.5 million in cash, plus agreed to a generous cut of 
the box office if the movie does well. Some of Miramax's rivals 
said the studio couldn't have gotten off that cheaply and suggested 
Miramax -- burned before with big Sundance acquisitions that didn't 
meet expectations -- was playing loose with the facts to save face. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax denied that. And all the filmmakers would say was that  
Miramax didn't have the top cash offer, but they were impressed 
with the studio's commitment to market and distribute the movie. 
It's expected to arrive at theaters later this year.

	Other deals struck in the snowy ski resort above Salt Lake City  
didn't generate any controversy -- nor that much money. All were in 
the $1 million range or below, peanuts compared with the $6 million 
to $10 million transactions the festival has seen in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deals: Artisan Entertainment picked up the creepy  
horror film ``The Blair Witch Project'' for a little over $1 
million. Fine Line Features paid $1 million for one of the best 
movies at the festival, the mother-daughter road picture 
``Tumbleweeds,'' and $400,000 for one of the funniest, the 
boy-meets-boy gay sex comedy ``Trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting ``American Movie,'' Sony Pictures  
Classics paid what sources said was the ``low six figures'' for 
``Twin Falls, Idaho'' about Siamese twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogue Pictures, a division of October Films, picked up ``Kill  
the Man'' with Luke Wilson (price unknown), while October got the 
festival's Centerpiece Premiere movie, ``Sugar Town'' with Rosanna 
Arquette and Ally Sheedy, for $1.25 million.

<P>
	The best performances at Sundance came from a young Canadian  
actress, Sarah Polley, in two films. She played the awkward young 
woman living with a much older photographer in ``Guinevere'' and 
the teen-ager having a truly bad night in the Gen-X actioner 
``Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another standout, though in much different fare, was Steve Zahn  
as the none-too-bright escaped convict who finds himself teaching a 
bunch of 5-year-old girls how to prepare for a beauty pageant in 
``Happy, Texas.'' Zahn won a special prize at Sundance for his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Other performances offered new looks at familiar TV faces  
including: Jean Smart of ``Designing Women'' as the steely mother 
in ``Guinevere,'' Tori Spelling of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' as the 
high-strung actress in ``Trick,'' and Barbara Barrie of ``Suddenly 
Susan'' as the brittle middle-aged teacher in ``Judy Berlin.''

	 *HOW 'BOUT THAT STEVEN SPIELBERG, INDIE GUY   	
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the independent film scene is associated with your  
outlaw directors with fashionably hip goatees, overextended credit 
cards and lots of that independent vision thing. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't normally think Steven Spielberg.  
</P>
<P>
	But actress Laura Dern, who was honored at the festival, singled  
out the box-office king as being as indie-minded as the next PIB on 
the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? It's simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steven Spielberg makes what he wants to make,'' said Dern, who  
appeared in Spielberg's blockbuster ``Jurassic Park'' between indie 
jobs. ``I think that is absolutely what we all want to support.''

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Stops Ala. Tire Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- The Alabama plant that established the  
rubber industry in the South 70 years ago will no longer make tires 
under a belt-tightening by Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. that will 
eliminate more than 1,300 jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts at Gadsden represent a major part of a Goodyear plan  
that will result in layoffs of up to 2,800 employees worldwide this 
year. The restructuring is an effort to cut costs by up to $150 
million a year by eliminating inefficient operations and in 
response to a business slowdown resulting from economic crises in 
Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Wednesday at least 980 Gadsden employees will  
lose their jobs this year in addition to 340 layoffs announced in 
November and set to take effect in 1999. The factory, with a work 
force of 1,550, will be reduced to making rubber for other Goodyear 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was a sharp blow to a small-town economy already  
hurting from about 150 layoffs by another major employer, Gulf 
States Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Sexton, general manager at Pierson Chevrolet, said sales are  
off 12 percent from two years ago, and business could temporarily 
drop an additional 20 percent because of Goodyear's 
belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Godfrey was worried about her future and that of husband  
David, who is scheduled to be laid off after 22 years at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	David Godfrey, 49, had a heart attack last year and is still  
five years away from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't expect many places around here to hire a  
50-year-old who's had a heart attack,'' said Mrs. Godfrey, running 
the cash register at a convenience store they own. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Opened in 1929, the Goodyear plant at Gadsden was the first  
major tire factory to be built in the South as the industry began 
leaving the North, where labor costs were higher. In better times, 
it was the driving economic force in this city of some 43,000. Now 
it is one of Goodyear's oldest and most inefficient operations. It 
cut nearly 800 jobs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The change at Gadsden was announced as Goodyear said separately  
it would acquire 10 percent of Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries 
Ltd. and gain control of the manufacturer's U.S. and Western 
European operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo owns the Dunlop tire plant in Huntsville, Ala., about a  
90-minute drive from Gadsden. But Sumitomo said it was too early to 
say whether the deal would affect employment or production in 
Huntsville.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Fire McCarver, Hire Seaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eliminating an independent and sometimes  
critical voice from their broadcast booth, the New York Mets on 
Wednesday replaced Tim McCarver with Tom Seaver, who also is 
joining the team's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame pitcher, who has not been to Shea Stadium since  
1988, will be in his retired uniform No. 41 for 10-to-12 days 
during spring training and will broadcast 50 games per season on 
WPIX, the Mets' new station. He also will have a marketing role 
with the team and work with minor leaguers during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcaster for the New York Yankees from 1989-93, Seaver  
admitted he won't be as controversial as McCarver, who had been the 
team's color analyst for 16 seasons and is regarded as the best in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last several years, a lot of commentary has been (made)  
to be critical on page one,'' Seaver said. ``I don't know if I 
would agree with that. I would agree with it when it comes to 
effort and preparation and approach to your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver has 10 Emmy Award nominations but has never won,  
primarily because John Madden has. The move doesn't affect 
McCarver's job with Fox Sports, where he is the network's lead 
analyst for its national telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were fairly blunt, saying, `We're not picking up next  
year as far as your contract is concerned,' '' he said. ``The word 
tradition was mentioned. I think that is why Tom is the guy coming 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors that manager Bobby Valentine was upset with  
McCarver's criticism last June after Mel Rojas blew a game against 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never came up to me and told me he was upset with  
anything,'' McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice president of broadcasting  
and marketing, said he knew some on the team were unhappy with 
McCarver, but didn't have first-hand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I either read about in the papers or heard about it,'' Bingham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said his philosophy won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak what you perceive as the truth,'' he said. ``If that's  
outspokenness, that's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rosen, McCarver's agent, said it may be too close to spring  
training for McCarver to line up a local broadcasting job for this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suspicion is we will over the course of the season field  
about 18 different offers for the season following,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' over-the-air games, which had been broadcast on WWOR  
since the team's inception in 1962, move to WPIX this season, with 
the Yankees moving from WPIX to WNYW, Fox's New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said McCarver would not be a good fit for WNYW because  
many of its Yankees broadcasts are on the same days as Fox network 
telecasts. The Madison Square Garden Network, which televises the 
bulk of Yankees' games on cable, wouldn't comment on McCarver's 
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, 56, won National League Cy Young Awards for the Mets in  
1969, '73 and '75, finished 311-205 with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 
strikeouts and is the most beloved player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been out of baseball the last five seasons and moved to  
California three months ago, intending to plant two or three acres 
of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
	He probably will be partnered with Gary Thorne and sometimes  
Ralph Kiner. The real attraction, however, was his role with 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really want to come back and not be involved in one  
way or another with the pitching,'' Seaver said. ``I don't want to 
be the manager. I don't want to be the general manager. I don't 
want to be the pitching coach. But I would find it somewhat hollow 
if I were not allowed to use my expertise about pitching with the 
younger pitchers. I pretty much insisted that be a part of this 
deal.''

<HEADLINE> Chemically Castrated Man Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A convicted rapist who was considered a  
success story for going through a ``chemical castration'' was 
sentenced to 40 years in prison Wednesday for a sexual attack on a 
5-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Frank Smith was convicted in November of breaking into  
the girl's house -- wearing nothing but a cloth covering his face -- 
and molesting the girl in her bed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence found at the scene was linked to Smith this summer  
after he was arrested in a peeping Tom case in the Richmond 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suspect Smith in numerous other break-ins in which a  
man entered the homes of young girls, wearing only a bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have brought this on yourself,'' Judge Buford F. Parsons  
Jr. said in sentencing Smith. ``You have brought a lot of hurt to 
other people. You know what you were doing was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 46, who cupped his left ear with his hand because of  
hearing problems, had told Parsons: ``I'm very, very sorry for what 
I've done.'' Too distraught to continue his prepared statement, the 
bearded, bespectacled Smith handed it to his attorney, who 
completed reading it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to please forgive me,'' Smith said in the statement.  
``I'll never harm anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Toby Vick said Smith will be eligible  
for parole in 12 years. The crimes occurred before Virginia 
abolished parole in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was dubbed the Ski Mask Rapist in Texas, where he was  
convicted of raping the same woman twice in 1983. As a condition of 
receiving probation instead of prison time, he agreed to take 
sexual-suppression drugs that reduce the amount of the male hormone 
testosterone the body produces. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith moved to the Richmond area after his conviction and  
appeared on CBS's ``60 Minutes'' in 1984 as a success story for 
chemical castration. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore,  
where he commuted for his treatments, said at the time that 
chemical castration suppressed the sexual appetite of offenders and 
made it easier to treat them in psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist who treated Smith,  
told the judge that Smith has voyeuristic pedophilia, a ``powerful 
biological force'' that takes over his life when he's off his 
medication. Smith stopped taking his medication after he was 
released from Johns Hopkins in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a complex deal that will shake up the global  
tire industry, Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. plans to acquire 10 
percent of Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and gain control 
of the Japanese manufacturer's U.S. and Western European 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Goodyear today announced a new cost-cutting drive  
that it said will result in the layoffs of up to 2,800 employees 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today with Sumitomo, Goodyear will  
form six joint ventures in North America, Europe and Japan. The 
move greatly expands existing cooperative agreements in linking the 
Goodyear brand and Sumitomo's Dunlop tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``The automobile industry is going global, and with their  
combined presence Goodyear and Sumitomo will have a much larger 
footprint than any of the other tire companies,'' Goodyear's 
chairman, Sam Gibara, said at a news conference this morning. The 
deal once more makes Goodyear the world's No. 1 tire manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA, the top two  
tiremakers respectively, have dominated the industry for nearly a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Goodyear and Sumitomo said they expected to increase  
profitability as a result of cost savings through the joint 
ventures and internal restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear announced separately that in response to the economic  
crises in Asia and Latin America and to inefficiencies in its North 
American operations, it is laying off 2,500 to 2,800 workers and 
cutting back operations in an attempt to reduce expenses by $100 
million to $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear's 70-year-old Gadsden plant in Alabama, one of its most  
inefficient, will end tire manufacturing by the end of 1999. The 
plant will continue to mix rubber for other manufacturing plants, 
but the number of jobs that will remain has yet to be decided. 
Sumitomo also has a plant in Alabama at Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Goodyear will pay the highly leveraged Sumitomo  
$1 billion for its contribution to the joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear, now the No. 3 tiremaker, will  
acquire about 10 percent of Sumitomo's outstanding shares while 
Sumitomo, the fifth-largest tire maker, will get about 1 percent of 
Goodyear's stock. The stock swap is worth about $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry,  
will control about 22 percent of the market once the deal is 
completed. That will make Goodyear the largest tire maker in North 
America and second-largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear said the deal should increase its annual sales by 20  
percent, or about $2.5 billion. In reporting earnings today, which 
met analysts' expectations, Goodyear said its sales last year were 
$12.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint announcement with Naoto Saito, the president of  
Sumitomo, the companies said they expect to sign definitive 
agreements on the joint ventures in May, subject to approval by the 
boards of both companies as well as by regulators in the United 
States and Japan. The alliance is expected to be operational by 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, based in Kobe, Japan, has annual sales of $4.7 billion  
but is saddled with about $2.8 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance is the best option for both of us to prosper,''  
Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear and Sumitomo already have a manufacturing agreement,  
through which Sumitomo makes Goodyear-brand tires for Nippon 
Goodyear, and Goodyear supplies Dunlop-brand tires to Sumitomo's 
U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six joint ventures, the largest will combine 14 factories  
operated by the two companies in Western Europe. Goodyear will have 
75 percent control of the venture, which generates about $4 billion 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-largest alliance will take place in the United  
States, where Goodyear will take 75 percent control of Sumitomo's 
factories in Buffalo, N.Y., and Huntsville, Ala. The facilities 
have about $800 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other joint ventures will take place in Japan, where  
Goodyear has been striving to expand its presence. Both of these 
alliances will be controlled by Sumitomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also plan to combine research and purchasing  
activities in separate joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies once shunned foreign suitors.  
</P>
<P>
	But a weak economy, deregulation of Japan's markets and rapid  
changes in the global marketplace have forced a growing number of 
Japanese businesses to link up with stronger foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent examples include Citigroup Inc.'s purchase last year of a  
quarter stake in Japan's No. 3 investment bank, Nikko Securities 
Co.; GE Capital Corp.'s takeover of Japan Leasing Corp. last month; 
and the current negotiations about a possible investment by 
DaimlerChrysler AG in Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 car company. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ford Motor Co. has held a stake in Mazda Motor  
Corp. since the early 1970s and has owned one-third of Mazda since 
1996. General Motors Corp. owns 37 percent of Isuzu Motor Ltd. and 
10 percent of Suzuki Motor Corp.

<HEADLINE> PBS Ordered To Pay $47M to Nesmith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The network of adorable Muppets and highbrow  
historical programs owes ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith nearly $47 
million for wrecking his home video distribution company, a jury 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision announced Tuesday, a federal jury rejected a  
breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by the Public Broadcasting 
Service, which claimed Nesmith owed the nonprofit corporation 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury then upheld a counterclaim of fraud, breach of contract  
and contract interference, Nesmith's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like catching your grandmother stealing your stereo,''  
Nesmith said. ``On one hand, you're happy to get the stereo back. 
On the other, you're sad to find out your grandma's a thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel decided Monday that PBS defrauded Nesmith and broke  
its contract with his now-defunct Pacific Arts Corp., which 
distributed a video library of the network's most popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``PBS firmly believes that the facts and the law in the case  
merited a ruling in our favor and we are frankly shocked at the 
verdict. We will vigorously contest the verdict,'' PBS spokesman 
Stu Cantor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesmith, 56, is best known as the knit cap- and  
sideburns-wearing member of The Monkees, a pop group created for a 
1960s TV sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	His company made a deal in 1990 to distribute the PBS Home Video  
Line. He licensed the PBS trademark and obtained home video rights 
to dozens of programs from their producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pacific Arts spent $8 million breaking the market, convincing  
stores to give up shelf space for this, putting up kiosks in 
Wal-Marts, things like that,'' said Bruce Van Dalsem, a Nesmith 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1993 the videos were selling well but Nesmith's company was  
losing money because of high costs. He decided to sell the rights 
to the accumulated video library, which could earn up to $15 
million and allow him to pay off royalties and other business 
debts, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS agreed in writing to help him recapitalize the business or,  
if that failed, cooperate in slowly winding it down to avoid 
disruption, Nesmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, while meeting with Nesmith and his staff to reassure  
them of the network's good faith, PBS officials were busy 
soliciting a dozen other potential distributors, Nesmith contended. 
</P>
<P>
	They also convinced producers of the shows to terminate  
distribution contracts with Pacific Arts en masse on Columbus Day 
1993, a federal holiday, Nesmith said. The date was chosen because 
the courts were closed and Nesmith would be unable to file for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to save his company, attorney 
Bruce Van Dalsem said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the day came, ``it rained termination notices,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	PBS then obtained the video distribution rights, split them with  
Turner Home Entertainment, and now reaps $27 million per year from 
the business, Van Dalsem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Nesmith was sued by PBS, public stations WNET-New York  
and WGBH-Boston and by Children' Television Workshop, which created 
``Sesame Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He countersued and the cases went to trial on Jan. 4.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the jury ruled PBS must pay the other plaintiffs what  
Pacific Arts owed them. Overall, jurors awarded more than $14.6 
million to Pacific Arts for the loss of the value of the video 
library and nearly $29.3 million in punitive damages. Another $3 
million was awarded to Nesmith personally.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Test GOP Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP moderates are worried the party could be  
hurt in the 2000 election by a conservative group's questionnaire 
asking Republican presidential hopefuls their positions on such 
issues as abortion and school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of conservative Republicans sent out the 10-page  
questionnaire last week as part of its effort to find a consensus 
candidate for president. Some of the party's biggest names are not 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a litmus test in the sense that we want to see where  
their heart is,'' said Tim Teepell, executive director of the 
Committee to Restore American Values, a coalition of conservative 
leaders that includes activists Paul Weyrich and Phyllis Schlafly. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition privately auditioned six potential candidates  
Wednesday and asked them to complete the questionnaire by the end 
of the week. Among those interviewed were publisher Steve Forbes, 
former Vice President Dan Quayle and social conservative Gary 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential candidates George W. Bush, Lamar Alexander, John  
McCain and Elizabeth Dole declined to take part in the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they seem to be trying to do is paint our candidates --  
all Republican candidates -- into a corner,'' said Mark Miller, a 
spokesman for the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist 
fund-raising group. ``A winning presidential campaign platform is 
not one where you have all these litmus tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a candidate who filled out the questionnaire ended up as the  
GOP nominee, the document would be a very effective road map for 
Democrats, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happened, the Gore research team could basically shut  
down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaire, a copy of which was obtained by The  
Associated Press, asked candidates detailed questions about gun 
control and education policy, as well as whether they would put a 
Nativity scene on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked a lot of questions on there, and if (a candidate has)  
a consistent pattern of being against the things we're for, I'll 
guarantee you they won't be endorsed,'' Teepell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teepell's group asked potential candidates whether the words  
``In God We Trust'' should remain on U.S. currency and whether 
states should be allowed to set their own policies on prayer and 
Bibles in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Following up the question about a Nativity scene, or creche, the  
survey asked: ``Would you place a creche on the White House lawn if 
ordered to refrain from doing so by the Supreme Court?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the questionnaire, potential candidates were asked  
to sign a pledge that their ``voting patterns'' would reflect the 
same views expressed in the survey answers. Presidents do not vote, 
but can veto legislation from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Teepell said his group will probably take some time to evaluate  
the candidates and their responses before deciding about any 
endorsement for the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee to Restore American Values is a branch of the  
Madison Project, a Virginia-based conservative fund-raising group. 
It includes many who formed a loose network of social conservatives 
that helped promote the potential candidacy of Sen. John Ashcroft. 
The Missouri Republican recently decided not to run in 2000, 
leaving an opening for conservative candidates seeking credibility 
and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good event. We covered a wide range of issues,''  
Forbes said as he left his interview. ``I thought it was very 
worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was up first, followed by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,  
broadcaster Alan Keyes, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Quayle and 
Bauer. Quayle was interviewed by telephone; the others appeared in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	The closed-door auditions were simple -- one candidate and about  
20 conservative leaders seated around a conference table at a 
Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad these leaders have decided to do this,'' Keyes  
said as he left. ``I think it's terribly important to forge some 
unity within the moral conservative movement. ... The issues they 
are talking about are the most important ones facing America.''

<HEADLINE> Strickland, Wizards Reach Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wes Unseld was ready to stand his ground in  
the negotiations with Rod Strickland and take the blame if things 
didn't work out. His boss had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lunch with Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin, general  
manager Unseld increased his offer to last year's NBA assists 
leader on Wedesday. Within hours, Strickland agreed to terms, 
ending another nasty round of negotiations involving Wizards free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Pollin) wanted Rod to know that we wanted him,'' Unseld told  
WRC-TV. ``Against my best wishes, he told me to interject something 
else into the deal. He's the boss. I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was asking for a five-year deal  
worth $55 million. The Wizards were offering a three-year contract 
worth $27 million, plus two more years worth $23 million if 
Strickland met certain performance incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise: a four-year, $40 million deal, with $35 million  
guaranteed, according to The Washington Post. The Wizards have the 
option of buying out $5 million of the $10 million fourth year if 
Strickland fails to meet certain incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was expected to attend his first practice today, just  
one day before the season opener at Indiana. Immediately, he will 
have to prove Falk's assertion, made earlier this week, that his 
client is ``probably in the best physical condition he's been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards need Strickland to get in playing shape in a hurry  
as they start a congested, lockout-induced schedule. Backup point 
guard Chris Whitney has been a reserve his whole career, and 
there's no proven depth behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Strickland will team with perennial All-Star Mitch  
Richmond, acquired in a trade before the lockout, to form one of 
the best backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's durability was one of the sticking points of the  
negotiations, which were stalled for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk contended that any player of Strickland's caliber should  
have his entire contract guaranteed. The Wizards balked at 
committing five years to a 32-year-old player who has had his share 
of off-court problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland averaged 17.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 10.5 assists  
last season, but he also was convicted of drunken driving, missed 
team functions and regularly was late for practices and games. He 
would sometimes get sick on the bench after gulping a quick 
junk-food supper before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland joined Juwan Howard (twice) and Rex Chapman as Falk's  
clients who have held difficult and very public negotiations with 
the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Falk said Strickland has ``completely changed his  
lifestyle'' and was working out like never before. Unseld was 
unimpressed, saying if a deal wasn't reached by the first game, the 
negotiations would cease and he would bear the responsibility if 
the team played poorly.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passengers Want More Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oversold flights, frequent flier miles that  
are hard to redeem and horror stories about passengers being 
trapped on planes are fueling a wave of complaints about the 
airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also triggered a congressional response and some sharp  
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real point is to make sure that the airlines bring some of  
their creativity and extraordinary entrepreneurial skill into 
making sure that the passengers who use their service get through 
it without feeling like a dish rag,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have written a bill that would  
give passengers 48 hours to cancel tickets that are currently 
nonrefundable. Among other things, the bill would require airlines 
to explain why flights are delayed and tell frequent fliers how 
many seats are available if they want to cash in their miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines got freedom with deregulation, and frankly a lot of  
them exploited that freedom unfairly,'' Wyden explained. ``It seems 
to me you have a situation where airline profits are going through 
the roof and passenger service is being left at the gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines, and even some pro-traveler groups, beg to differ.  
</P>
<P>
	``We as airline passengers keep telling airlines what we want is  
low fares, low fares, low fares,'' said David Stempler, president 
of the Air Travelers Association, a group that serves passengers 
and tries to expand air service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start mucking around with that system that has a very  
delicate balance, it's possible fares will go up for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there are signs that airline profits may have peaked, the  
numbers still show that this is a gold-plated era for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Major U.S. carriers posted net profits of $5.1 billion last  
year, down just slightly from their all-time record of $5.2 billion 
in 1997. Alone, United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, had 
net earnings of $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, U.S. airlines also carried an estimated 615  
million passengers in 1998, with planes filled to near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways ended the year with a record average of 72.7 percent  
of its seats filled. With load factors so high, there are few seats 
between passengers, little extra room for standbys and almost no 
margin for relief when a flight is canceled and passengers have to 
be rebooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects are being felt across the system. The Transportation  
Department reported Tuesday that passengers filed 9,606 service 
complaints with the department in 1998, not a huge number in itself 
but 25 percent more than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, airlines posted a mishandled baggage rate of  
5.16 complaints per 1,000 passengers, compared with 4.96 per 1,000 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Jarvis, a law professor and author of ``Travel Law: Cases  
and Materials,'' a textbook on passenger problems, said airlines 
can afford to be rough with passengers because competition has 
fallen since the industry was deregulated in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that's partly to blame for the increase in stories about  
unruly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're packing more people into planes, you're giving them  
less service and what you're giving them is not very friendly 
service,'' Jarvis said. ``What you've done is create an environment 
for unruly behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United has been the bluntest among the major carriers in  
admitting current problems. Its ads no longer brag about whisking 
customers through the ``friendly skies'' but rather make the more 
modest claim that United's service is ``rising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means trying to improve on-time performance by giving extra  
time between connecting flights. It also means making passengers 
more comfortable with new planes, cushier seats and individual 
video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try to be responsive to the traveling public,'' said  
United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``We are a transportation business, 
but we're also a service business. And we try to focus on that with 
all our employees.''

<HEADLINE> Underground Zap Comix Grows Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three decades ago, an ex-greeting card  
designer named Robert Crumb made copies of his comic artwork and 
hawked them on Haight Street from a baby carriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Zap Comix -- and a new genre of ``underground comix'' -- was born.  
Racy and anarchic, Zap rebelled against the restrictive comics code 
of the 1950s and feasted off the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll of 
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, the one-time hippie cartoonists have finally  
graduated from Haight-Ashbury head shops to an art gallery that is 
selling the original artwork for $2,500 to $20,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, who would've thought? We were trying to have fun,  
and we're still trying to have fun,'' says S. Clay Wilson, among 
Zap's original ``Magnificent 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world of cartooning was under a strict code that forbade the  
depiction of sex, drugs and profanity when Crumb slapped out the 
first issues of Zap on newsprint using an old press in 1968. It was 
a new form, one filled with the most fantastic illustrations of sex 
and drugs that generation's cartoonists had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if Walt Disney had dropped acid,'' recalls Victor  
Moscoso. ``It made no sense whatsoever but it just knocked everyone 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined in. Moscoso and Rick Griffin, famous in the 1960s  
for their psychedelic rock concert posters, soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the responsibility for putting the 'ugh' in  
underground,'' Wilson says. ``I said, 'Look, we can draw whatever 
we want. We're artists.''' 
</P>
<P>
	By 1969, Spain Rodriguez, Robert Williams and Gilbert Shelton  
had landed in San Francisco and rounded out the ``Magnificent 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Zap No. 4 was like going into orbit. It was like being in a  
rock 'n' roll band,'' Moscoso says. 
</P>
<P>
	The time was ripe for rebellion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crazy time, especially in 1969 with Vietnam, and  
protests and the Summer of Love, and LSD,'' Wilson recalls. ``It 
was like an energy was building up. San Francisco just became this 
hub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They sold Zap at head shops and under the counter at comic book  
shops, away from the gaze of censors. Some were busted -- including 
Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	They knew they were bucking the law, and took pride in being  
underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing something that was like getting revenge for all  
those years of comic book repression,'' says Rodriguez. ``It felt 
real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the cartoonists is an extraordinary artist with his own  
style and wacky vision. Williams filled full pages with his 
futuristic, phantasmagorical illustrations; Shelton's ``Fabulous 
Furry Freak Brothers'' have become as legendary as Crumb's ``Mr. 
Natural'' and ``Keep on Truckin''' counterculture icons. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the perversity of Zap that hooked readers -- the  
popping eyeballs, the sex-crazed loonies, the panels that poked fun 
at Jesus and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something different. These books changed some people's  
lives throughout the country,'' says Gary Arlington, a San 
Francisco comic bookstore owner. Readers outside San Francisco had 
inklings about the sex and drugs of San Francisco in the '60s but 
to see the scene in a comic book was mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were radical. The surf was up for all of us and we happened  
to ride some really far-out waves,'' Moscoso says. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 issues remain in print, and until Griffin's death in a  
motorcycle accident in 1991, all seven met regularly for infamous 
jam sessions. They passed panels around while drinking, drawing and 
swapping stories and jokes until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd stop and take a few tokes and have something to eat,''  
Rodriguez says. 
</P>
<P>
	But as with every rock band, there's always the threat of a  
breakup. Each had his own thing: Williams moved to Los Angeles and 
began painting; Griffin took up religion and surfing. Shelton and 
Crumb both live in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Crumb, the most famous of the group and the subject  
of a 1995 Terry Zwigoff documentary, refused to attend the last jam 
session after Moscoso and Rodriguez had already arrived to pick him 
up (Crumb doesn't drive). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like trying to quit on the Mafia,'' Crumb complains in  
his two-page strip, which he ordered his partners to include in Zap 
on the threat of taking it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	They did -- with their responses. ``Crumbolina's really going off  
the deep end,'' the strip by Moscoso and Rodriguez says, depicting 
Crumb as a foot-dragging child with a lollipop jammed in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like leaving a family, and he's not very graceful at  
it,'' Moscoso says. ``He wants to kill (Zap), but it's not his to 
kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new cartoonist was asked into the group: Paul Mavrides,  
Shelton's longtime collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being invited to the party 25 years after the beer's  
all been drunk,'' Mavrides says. ``But I respect the artists, and 
I'm flattered to have been chosen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mavrides gave his own version of events, even though he wasn't  
there to witness them. He depicts Moscoso attacking Crumb with a 
pen, a play on one of Crumb's own early cartoons about a character 
who lets fame get to his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rashomon-style exchange is featured in Zap No. 14 and the  
online magazine Salon. The originals, with Rodriguez's smudges and 
Crumb's careful use of whiteout, are for sale at the gallery 
(Crumb's for $20,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Crumb or no Crumb, Zap will live on, the cartoonists say.  
</P>
<P>
	``It never dies out. We're not going to let it,'' says  
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Wilson: ``We're still going to keep doing it until the last  
horse is hung.''

<HEADLINE> CompUSA 2ndQ Earnings Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Computer retailer CompUSA Inc. reported a 54  
percent drop in its second-quarter earnings, though still beat Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $15.6 million, or 17 cents per share, for its  
fiscal second quarter. That compares with earnings of $34.1 
million, or 36 cents per share in the year ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of analysts by First Call Corp. had projected earnings  
of 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA attributed to decrease in profits to lower sales from  
the converted Computer City stores it is continuing to operate and 
a decline in average selling prices 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the three months ended Dec. 26 increased 22 percent to  
$1.78 billion from $1.46 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were down 4.7 percent in the quarter for the 148 stores  
open one year or more. The company operates 210 stores in 67 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first six months of fiscal 1999 for the  
Dallas-based company were $23.7 million, or 26 cents a share, 
compared with $57.5 million, or 60 cents a share, a year ago. 
Six-month sales were $3.17 billion, up from $2.65 billion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from the 39 converted Computer City stores are included in  
the second quarter and six month net sales figures. They are not 
included in the comparable store sales calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA's stock rose 6 1/4 cents to close at $13.12 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> UN Workers Ordered Out of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations ordered its American  
and British employees out of Iraq on Wednesday after Baghdad 
refused to guarantee the safety of all U.N. workers from those 
countries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. security chief Benon Sevan issued the order after the  
government of President Saddam Hussein said it could only vouch for 
the safety of three American U.N. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the Iraqis guaranteed the  
safety of American U.N. employees Darlene Bisson, deputy director 
of the World Food Program, and the secretary to Prakash Shah, 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative to Iraq. Her 
name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The third American was Abdoullah Odeh, the head of the U.N.  
Development Program, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hans von Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in  
Baghdad, told Associated Press Television News on Wednesday that 
there were no American or British workers left in Iraq. He said the 
last ones left Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the United States and Britain launched airstrikes on Iraq  
in mid-December, there were 12 to 15 American and British nationals 
among the 400 U.N. employees in Iraq. In December, many U.N. 
employees went on vacation and the Americans and Britons ``were 
advised not to return,'' Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130 members of the U.N. Special Commission charged with  
disarming Iraq -- including 15 to 20 Americans and Britons -- pulled 
out on Dec. 16. Iraq has banned the commission's weapons inspectors 
from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
the reason for the order was a lack of security guarantees -- and 
``not some new problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the evacuation wasn't  
linked to any impending attack on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi government first raised the security issue in a letter  
Jan. 4, about two weeks after the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs sent a reply  
``reminding the government of its responsibilities to ensure the 
safety and security of all United Nations personnel in Iraq,'' 
Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``it was clear that the government was not going to reverse  
its decision,'' Eckhard said. He said the government only would 
vouch for the safety of three Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqis wanted Bisson, Shah's secretary, and Odeh to stay in  
Baghdad, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sevan ``did not accept that security considerations could be  
applied selectively,'' Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevan recommended to the secretary-general that all American and  
British nationals ``should leave the country as a matter of 
principle,'' and Annan agreed, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, a Foreign Office spokesman said the United Nations  
had been ``left with little choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, speaking on customary terms of anonymity, said  
``it is absurd for the (Iraqi) government to claim it can't protect 
a few individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, chief weapons inspector Richard Butler met Annan on  
Wednesday afternoon, amid speculation that he will not be part of 
the panel being established by the Security Council to assess 
Iraq's disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva called it a regular  
meeting to discuss ``developments relevant to Iraq,'' but gave no 
further details.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Stage Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- In a new blow to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch, rank-and-file IOC members mounted a revolt today 
against plans to strip them of voting rights in the selection of 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but  
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' Italian IOC 
member Mario Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said 42 IOC members had a breakfast meeting with IOC  
executive board members Wednesday to discuss the proposed new 
voting procedure for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``overwhelming majority'' of the members came out against the  
plan, Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in the history of the Olympic movement, the  
voice of the members is very, very loud,'' Pescante told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and the executive board announced Jan. 24 that the  
selection system would be overhauled as a result of the bribery 
scandals surrounding Salt Lake City's choice as host of the 2002 
Winter Games and other previous Olympic bids. 
</P>
<P>
	The board banned IOC member visits to the six 2006 candidates  
and proposed that the selection of the host city be made by a 
15-member panel rather than the full IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the proposal would be put to a special meeting of  
the assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible the general assembly will approve this  
proposal,'' Pescante said. ``I'm sure the executive board will have 
to find a new solution before then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said he and other members made a counter proposal: A  
small group of experts should narrow the field to two or three 
finalists 24 hours before the vote and let the full assembly choose 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general assembly must choose the city according to the  
charter,'' Pescante said. ``This would be a good solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the vote away from the general assembly is a radical  
move. The primary duty of IOC members has always been to choose 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a very strong inquiry into the corruption  
scandal to get rid of the bad apples,'' Pescante said. ``But it's 
necessary to respect our authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six European cities bidding for the 2006 Games are:  
Helsinki, Finland; Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; 
Turin, Italy; Zakopane, Poland; and Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection is scheduled to be made at an IOC session in  
Seoul, South Korea, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the new process for 2006 would be a trial. The  
long-term system for selecting host cities for the games of 2008 
and beyond would be decided after the 2006 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said some IOC members at the breakfast meeting charged  
that the proposed system favors Sion's candidacy. Many IOC members 
visited Sion during its unsuccessful bid for the 2002 Games, and 
rival cities view its proximity to IOC headquarters in Switzerland 
as an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said Samaranch did not attend the breakfast meeting,  
leaving vice presidents Keba Mbaye, Dick Pound, Pal Schmitt and 
other executive board members to sound out the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no response from the IOC leaders to the outcry  
from the members. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the executive board members were silent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said he believes the executive board will come up with  
a ``face-saving'' solution before the March session. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they lose at the session, it would be a disaster for the  
president and the executive board,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the revolt, Pescante said the members remain in full  
support of Samaranch, who will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at the March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident in the president,'' Pescante said. ``He is  
the only man to lead us out of the tunnel. But he must understand 
that the time of under-the-table decisions is finished.''

<HEADLINE> Fertility Clinic Births Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
reports that fertility-enhanced births nationwide jumped 25 percent 
in a year but cautions that the sharp increase could be due to 
better reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's premature to draw too many conclusions about a trend  
between last year and this year,'' Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director of 
the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the survey, 300 fertility clinics reported that their clients  
had 14,388 live deliveries from pregnancies that began in 1996. 
That's up from 11,516 reported the year before by 281 clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	The data was included in the CDC's annual consumer guide to  
fertility clinic success rates. It's only the second time the CDC 
has released the report, which was mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said it was too early to conclude that the number of  
women seeking help from fertility clinics is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The report does not rank or grade the clinics since some  
specialize in more difficult fertility cases and would naturally 
have lower success rates. But it does include other data such as 
the ``take-home baby rate,'' the multiple-birth rate and the number 
of embryos each clinic used. 
</P>
<P>
	About 38 percent of the deliveries reported in this year's guide  
were multiple births. Last year, that figure was 37 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Surge in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales for several automakers surged last  
month as demand for pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles 
continued to remain strong among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. all  
reported double-digit increases in sales Tuesday, while Ford Motor 
Co. experienced a 9 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect we'll see foreign brands and DaimlerChrysler picking  
up market share over Ford and GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst 
David Healy. ``These are strong numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it sold 259,615 vehicles last month -- 89,543 cars and  
170,072 light trucks. A 9 percent decline in car sales over January 
1998 was erased by a 22 percent increase in trucks, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford said last month broke a record for overall 
January sales set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All Ford truck models posted sales increases, the largest coming  
from the redesigned Windstar minivan, whose sales were up 54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing, sales and  
service, said the decrease in car sales came from a planned cut in 
sales to rental fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	One model that sold well: the new Mustang, whose sales increased  
34 percent. That car is made at Ford's River Rouge complex, which 
was shut down Monday after an explosion in the complex's power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it sold 56,176 cars and 139,631 light  
trucks last month, an increase of 18 percent over the previous 
year. The company reported strong sales for Dodge and Jeep trucks 
and SUVs, and said its large sedans -- Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler 
Concorde, LHS and 300M -- also sold well. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said some of DaimlerChrysler's gains might have come from  
the fleet sales that Ford shunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota reported a 27 percent jump in its sales for the month,  
with sales of the popular Toyota Camry sedan up 72 percent. The 
company's Lexus division benefited from sales of its two SUVs, the 
RX 300 and LX 470. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong market conditions that fueled near-record industry  
sales in the final quarter of 1998 should carry over well into 
1999,'' Yale Giesel, Toyota executive vice president, said in a 
statement. ``High consumer confidence and affordable interest rates 
will play a big part in how long the industry can maintain its 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. said U.S. sales were up 17 percent, driven by  
its Odyssey minivan and CR-V sport utility vehicle. Troubled Nissan 
Motor Co. also posted a sales gain of 4 percent, with increased 
truck sales overcoming a slight decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European automakers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and  
Volkswagen -- also posted sales gains. But Volvo AB, which Ford 
plans to buy for $6.45 billion, reported its sales declined 18 
percent from January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. is scheduled to release its sales report  
today.

<HEADLINE> IOC Assailed Over Drugs, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
is scrambling to save its world conference on doping from becoming 
its worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	After the opening day turned into a long session of criticism of  
the IOC's leadership and blunt questioning on whether it still 
represents the Olympic spirit during the worst scandal in its 
history, the IOC faces the task of salvaging its maligned doping 
proposals before Thursday's conclusion of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled on all fronts, the IOC hit back at government  
officials and critics from sporting institutions. Speaker after 
speaker demanded a proposed international antidoping agency be 
totally independent from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout from the Olympic bribery scandals rubbed off  
directly on its credibility at the doping conference, leaving IOC 
drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode puzzled and angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this lack of confidence,'' he said. ``I  
find that a semi-insult,'' especially coming from government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask people in the streets if there is a great confidence in  
politicians. I have some doubts,'' said de Merode, a candidate to 
run the agency's day-to-day affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	British Sports Minister Tony Banks said faith in the Olympic  
movement was ``sour and sullied'' and said Britain expects the IOC 
to clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes that the doping conference would restore some status to  
the IOC were dashed almost as soon as the meeting opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``For complete credibility, it (the agency) must be headed by  
someone other than an IOC member. Credibility is so important,'' 
U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said the IOC must  
institute democratic reforms to have credibility in the antidoping 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't go over well with some IOC officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go on the moralizing tone, the lecturing tone, you must  
be sure that everything is OK in your own country,'' IOC executive 
board member Jacques Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In such an abrasive atmosphere, the conference on Tuesday went  
looking for common ground on the issue of drug sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	While some delegates pressed for fixed minimum two-year bans  
across all sports, de Merode and Rogge proposed more flexible 
penalties that would survive legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The world soccer federation, FIFA, had a strong intervention  
ready, saying it would never accept a two-year minimum ban, even if 
it would mean being kicked out of the Olympics, as was threatened 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimming and cycling federations have also cast doubt on the  
legal workability of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputes came on the same day that the IOC cleared  
Australian officials of any wrongdoing following allegations of 
vote-buying in Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, who oversees the Sydney Games, said he reviewed documents  
provided by Australian Olympics chief John Coates and said Coates 
broke no rules when he offered $70,000 in sports aid to two African 
IOC members the night before Sydney beat Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was legal, legitimate and according to the rules,'' Rogge  
said. ``There is absolutely no problem in the way it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney case emerged as part of a widening scandal that  
started with bribery allegations surrounding the selection of Salt 
Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Games. Nine IOC members have 
resigned or been expelled so far for receiving cash payments, 
scholarships and other favors from Salt Lake.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Olympic Group May Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A reorganization of Salt Lake City's  
scandal-tainted Olympics organization could mean the arrival of 
Massachusetts millionaire Mitt Romney and the departure of two of 
Utah's most prominent businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
in 1994, has been approached about taking over as chief executive 
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, according to a source 
knowledgeable about the search for the successor to Frank Joklik, 
who stepped down while denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization also could include expanding the SLOC board  
``to add more voices,'' as well as changes in the ethics policy, 
said Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization would include a new executive committee of  
the board that does not include First Security Corp. Chairman 
Spence Eccles and PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham, another 
knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Eccles and Topham were enlisted during Salt Lake's bidding for  
the games to watch over staffers now blamed for excesses. Eccles 
has claimed he was ``deceived by others in the bid process.'' 
Topham has said the bid committee board took a strong position not 
to engage in ``activities of this nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, SLOC announced this morning that the  
long-awaited report of the investigation by its ethics panel will 
be released next week. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC scheduled a special meeting of its board of trustees for  
Tuesday morning, or, if the report is delayed, Thursday morning. 
The later day, Feb. 11, was the panel's target date when it was 
charged with looking into improprieties on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the man reputed to be behind the scholarships, guns,  
skis and cash payments to the IOC members and their kin -- former 
bid committee and SLOC head Tom Welch -- was spreading word Tuesday 
that others -- including Leavitt -- knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with CNN, Welch said many members of  
the bid committee knew of his activities -- including the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela denied it. ``Did the governor know of inappropriate  
activities? Absolutely not,'' she told KUTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said Leavitt personally met some of the scholarship  
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may have met some of the students,'' Varela said. ``He did  
not know they were on any Olympic scholarship fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's attorney, Tom Schaffer, was quoted in today's Salt Lake  
Tribune as saying details of scholarships and other controversial 
aid programs were discussed during a September 1993 meeting in 
Monte Carlo attended by Welch, Joklik, Salt Lake Mayor Deedee 
Corradini and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, Corradini and Young have denied any knowledge of  
scholarships offered to IOC members or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer said the bid committee spent the last half of 1991  
debating the ins and outs of the National Olympic Committee 
assistance program, which included the scholarships and other 
payments now under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, Schaffer said, Welch discussed on a case-by-case  
basis how to work scholarships and other aid into the budget with 
the bid board's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer maintained that all bid-committee board members  
received detailed budgets and minutes of executive-committee 
meetings. Welch also instructed financial officers to meet 
one-on-one with board members to go over budget line items, 
Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik personally saw scholarship checks before they were mailed  
to recipients, Schaffer said. The Tribune said Joklik declined to 
comment about Schaffer's statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik remains acting president until a new chief executive  
takes over. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, the son the late Michigan Gov. George Romney, was  
traveling and did not immediately return phone calls to his 
company, Bain Capital Inc. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The descendant of early, prominent Mormons, Romney has served in  
the lay clergy of the Mormon church, presiding over a group of 
congregations in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is a graduate of Brigham Young University, Harvard  
Business School and Harvard Law School and lives in Belmont, Mass., 
and Park City, Utah. He has five sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC reorganization also is expected to add a chief  
operating officer. Roger Jackson, who held a similar job during 
Calgary's 1988 Winter Games and serves on the IOC Coordination 
Commission overseeing preparations for 2002, is considered the 
front-runner for that job. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--A survey of 1,000 Americans showed overwhelming support for  
Olympic athletes and the corporations that pay their way to the 
games despite the scandal. Respondents to the survey, requested by 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and conducted by research firm Wirthlin 
Worldwide, also said major changes were needed for selecting host 
cities and how they plan the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--The USOC has been served a subpoena from the U.S. Justice  
Department, which is investigating the Salt Lake bid. Spokesman 
Mike Moran said investigators want documents, and USOC will deliver 
them. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	--The city board in Lillehammer, Norway, moved to protect the  
image of its 1994 Winter Olympics by voting to open sealed records 
from its 1992 and 1994 bids and appoint a commission to study them. 
Lillehammer insists it has a clean record and does not want it 
tainted by the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Utah's House of Representatives passed a bill that would  
establish a special Olympic oversight committee consisting of a 
dozen legislators to review the 2002 Olympic budget. Rep. Jordan 
Tanner said the intent was not to manage the Olympics, but to 
ensure taxpayer money invested in the games is paid back. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano, Japan, officials chartered a train for the IOC  
president and lavishly entertained IOC officials, according to 
memos that reveal the contents of a destroyed account book, local 
media reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In its $17.9 million bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics, the  
Nagano bid committee spent $45,000 to rent a luxury train with a 
panoramic observation car to bring IOC President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch to Nagano, the mass-circulation Mainichi newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials said today they have launched an inquiry into  
possible misconduct by IOC members during Nagano's bid for the 1998 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inquiry team made up of Japan Olympic Committee members  
will stop short of actually naming wrongdoers, said Secretary 
General Yushiro Yagi, who will head the team.

<HEADLINE> Companies Settle Diaper Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A Georgia-based maker of disposable diapers  
has agreed to pay Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. $163.5 million to settle 
P&AMP;G's complaint that the competitor infringed on a patented design. 
</P>
<P>
	Paragon Trade Brands Inc., of Norcross, Ga., agreed to pay the  
money as part of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization. Paragon was forced into reorganization a year ago 
after a Delaware judge ordered the company to pay $178.4 million to 
P&AMP;G. 
</P>
<P>
	Paragon also agreed to pay license fees to use P&AMP;G's patented  
diaper technology. Those fees amount to about 2 percent of sales 
revenues, P&AMP;G spokesman Scott Stewart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that Paragon's infringement really had hurt our  
company, and the amount of the settlement reflects that,'' Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $163.5 million payment resulted from negotiations between  
the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G had said in its lawsuit that Paragon infringed on patents  
for elastic gatherers inside diaper leg cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G, based in Cincinnati, makes and sells more than 300 brands  
of food, beverage, cosmetic, health and paper products. Some of its 
best-known brands are Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Folgers 
coffee.

didn't really expect it, there was a chance that the Fed would 
respond to recently robust economic data by raising rates, which 
would be bad for stocks because it would raise corporate borrowing 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones  
of St. Louis, said in late morning. ``this is one of the easiest 
decisions the Fed has had to make. Even if they change the bias 
toward tightening, we just remind people that that happened last 
year before they lowered interest rates twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Fed's policy decision was made known, investors could  
turn back to trying to analyze whether the generally strong 
corporate earnings in the fourth quarter will hold up this year, 
and more technical things like the ratio of advancing issues to 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The technical factors paint a picture that ``favors neither the  
bulls nor the bears,'' said Greg Nie, technical analyst at Everen 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners have often led advancers recently, even on days when  
the indexes gained, he noted. Today, advancers had a small lead. 
``Breadth indicators stink,'' Nie said, ``and once again today, it 
just isn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While market indexes continue to be pushed higher by the strong  
performance of high-profile, big companies, particularly in the 
technology sector, the rest of the market isn't following, Nie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology shares plowed ahead today, led by the  
darlings of the sector, Internet stocks, even after a glitch left 
users of E Trade, the online trading service, unable to transact 
business for few hours. E Trade shares dropped 3 points, but 
America Online shot up more than 15, both in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco Systems shares fell. The computer systems maker reported  
earnings late Tuesday that were one penny above analysts' 
expectations, but Chief Executive John Chambers warned this morning 
that there is some concern about how the Year 2000 computer issue 
will affect high-tech spending later in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber rose. The company  
announced an alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. 
and fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations. 
The company also separately announced a worldwide cost-cutting 
effort that will eliminate up to 2,800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks rose after the Fed's announcement  
removed any worries that the companies would be operating in a 
sharply different interest-rate enviroment. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Chase share rose on rumors,  
denied by both companies, that Chase was about to acquire Morgan.

<HEADLINE> GOP Slams Clinton's Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's Pentagon budget proposal  
fails to meet the military's needs, Republican lawmakers said 
Tuesday, even though it calls for the first rise in defense 
spending in more than a decade. They also gave a cool response to 
his request for new base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just fear what we will discover is that for every step the  
president wants us to believe he has taken forward, the hard 
reality of the budget will represent two steps backwards,'' said 
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, defending the day-old budget in  
an appearance before the committee, conceded that the budget falls 
short of what the military service chiefs had told Congress they 
needed. ``But this does in fact meet their most-pressing 
requirements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan includes a 4.4 percent across-the-board pay increase  
for the military. But the Senate is soon to debate legislation that 
would give the military an even bigger raise -- 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen defended anew his administration's request for two new  
rounds of base closings, insisting it would save $20 billion, plus 
$3 billion annually once the additional bases are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that two more rounds are in fact necessary,'' Cohen  
said. The administration wants the closings in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last round in 1995, Congress has rejected several  
administration attempts to close other bases it considers 
unnecessary. Republicans have accused the administration of trying 
to politicize the process -- trying to protect certain bases in 
high-electoral vote states like California and Texas, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of trust from the last go-around,'' Rep.  
James Hansen, R-Utah, told Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	And Spence, the committee chairman, suggested that even with the  
base closings the administration seeks, military needs would not be 
met. He said the budget ``appears to rely heavily on assumed 
savings, spending cuts and outlay gimmicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence also complained that the budget rescinds $900 million  
agreed to last fall, in an emergency funding bill, for expanded 
intelligence and a national missile defense. The administration is 
spending the money instead, he said, on payments to Israel and the 
Palestinians to carry out the Wye peace agreement, Spence said. The 
administration says it will find money for the intelligence and 
missile defense later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
the committee previously that the administration's budget, while 
meeting the Pentagon's most pressing immediate requirements, still 
fell short of its long-term needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that basic message Tuesday. ``I am concerned about  
the high impact the tempo of operations is having on our people, 
their families, and our aging equipment,'' Shelton testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration bills the 2000 spending plan as an increase  
of $12 billion, with a total increase of $112 billion through 2005. 
But the $12 billion represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes to spend. Much of the $12 billion is actually 
savings from lower-than-expected inflation, not new money.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes American Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A hitchhiker who beat, robbed and killed  
a man by running him over with his own car and stabbing him more 
than 30 times with a screwdriver was executed by injection 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Darick Gerlaugh, 38, was the seventh American Indian executed in  
the United States since the death penalty was restored in 1976. He 
was also the first Indian death row inmate permitted to use a sweat 
lodge for purification ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh kept his eyes shut while the death warrant was read and  
had no last words. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh, Joseph Encinas and James Leisure were convicted of  
kidnapping, robbing and killing 22-year-old Scott Schwartz in 1980. 
The three men were hitchhiking from Chandler to Phoenix and planned 
to rob whoever stopped to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two other men held Schwartz down, Gerlaugh repeatedly  
ran over him with his Lincoln Continental. Gerlaugh and Leisure 
then stabbed Schwartz. Leisure and Encinas received life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh spent two hours Saturday preparing for his death by  
praying and singing ancient songs in a sweat lodge on prison 
grounds. On Tuesday, he took part in a pipe ceremony, the 
equivalent of holy communion. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma also was to execute a man early Thursday for a  
triple-killing he committed at age 16. Sean Sellers, now 29, was to 
be the first American in four decades put to death for crimes 
committed when he was 16.

<HEADLINE> Banged Up UConn To Face Stanford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Top-ranked Connecticut, no longer  
undefeated after losing to Syracuse, is about to get some answers 
on the status of injured center Jake Voskuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 junior and leading rebounder has a stress fracture  
in his right foot and sat out Monday night's 59-42 loss. Leading 
scorer Richard Hamilton is nursing a bruised right thigh and also 
missed that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Voskuhl, averaging 7.2 rebounds, had a similar injury in high  
school. He flew home to Texas on Tuesday to be examined today by 
the orthopedic surgeon, who treated him in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Baxter of Houston has treated other prominent  
athletes such as Christian Laettner, Grant Hill and Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries hit the team a week before the Huskies travel to  
No. 4 Stanford (18-3). The last meeting was a 20-point UConn win in 
Storrs last February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you're playing a team as good as UConn, I don't think  
you'll need additional motivation,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects his team will have to contend with Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that Hamilton will be back and be every bit as  
effective as he can be,'' Montgomery said. ``You put an 
All-American back in the lineup, that's huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal are led by 6-8 junior forward Mark Madsen,  
averaging 12.9 points and 7.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, last season's Big East Player of the Year is expected  
to be ready for Stanford on Saturday if he responds to treatment. 
His 22 points per game were sorely missed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Hamilton and Voskuhl, coach Jim Calhoun was forced to  
change his starting lineup Monday for the first time in 36 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (19-1, 11-1 Big East) put on one of the worst  
offensive performances in 27 years in the loss to the No. 16 
Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn struggled against Syracuse's zone, shooting just 36  
percent, including 3-for-15 from 3-point range. The 42-point total 
was their lowest since a 41-39 overtime loss to Boston College in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss snapped UConn's 16-game Big East winning streak and its  
31-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt to watch,'' said Hamilton, who started 86 straight  
games for UConn before being sidelined Monday night. ``I hate to 
lose and I hate not playing.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerage ETrade Is Back Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A software problem prevented online investors  
from buying and selling stocks Wednesday through ETrade Group Inc., 
a dominant player in the booming Internet brokerage industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was blocked for about 75 minutes Wednesday morning. By  
11:30 a.m. EST, the company announced that trading had resumed, but 
about 5 percent of the brokerage's customers were unable to trade 
electronically throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's brokers were taking telephone orders, but a swarm of  
jilted online traders jammed the lines, traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem resulted from a change in the software used to  
process trades. An upgraded system was installed Tuesday night, and 
a minor glitch derailed the trading page, a spokeswoman said. The 
software was fixed and submitted to another round of testing 
Wednesday afternoon, and the company said it does not anticipate 
further problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Levinson, ETrade's president, called the problem  
``embarrassing'' in an interview with CNBC, a cable TV business 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors showed no mercy on ETrade's stock, pushing it down $3,  
or by 5 percent, to close at $55.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge violation of a trust,'' he said. Crisci said  
Wednesday's outage prevented him from canceling an order to buy 
stock, resulting in an unspecified loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many people were affected by Wednesday's  
outage. ETrade is one of the largest of the increasingly popular 
online brokerages, processing an average of 40,000 trades per day 
in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first online brokerage to falter.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are growing pains throughout the entire industry,'' said  
Julio Gomez, founder of Gomez Advisors, a Cambridge, Mass., 
research firm that focuses on electronic commerce. ``Since 
Thanksgiving, all the big firms have been pushing the outer limits 
of their capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased volume has been fueled in part by the rise of  
Internet stocks, which have soared in recent months. Day traders, 
who try to reap profits from short-term swings in stock prices, 
have also embraced the online brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investors often complain about sluggish connections or  
delayed trades during busy sessions. While trading was heavy 
Wednesday, ETrade said volume had nothing to do with its outage, 
and rival brokerages were functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ETrade's troubles mirrored the old woes of America  
Online, which experienced persistent delays and outages in 1997 as 
millions of new Internet users signed onto its service. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending heavily to upgrade its systems, AOL continued to  
thrive. It currently has 15 million customers, plus 2 million 
through its subsidiary CompuServe. Its pending acquisition of 
Netscape Communications Corp. will broaden its reach in the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL was unmercifully castigated for its problems,'' said Phil  
Leigh, an Internet analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. ``But it came out much stronger. So will the 
Internet brokerages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the burgeoning industry, ETrade currently ranks third in  
volume behind Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Waterhouse Securities, and 
third in accounts behind Schwab and Fidelity Investments, Gomez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 2.8 million total transactions in its most recent  
fiscal quarter, up from 1.6 million in the same period of 1997. The 
company has wooed investors by offering a wide range of financial 
information on its site, including free real-time stock quotes for 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the company announced it would spend $100 million to  
$150 million over 12 to 18 months to advertise the dolled-up Web 
site, dubbed Destination ETrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that while regular upgrades are necessary in the  
highly competitive market, the Internet brokerages must be careful 
to ensure good service. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes by, customers will grow fed up with delays,''  
Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade has set up a special e-mail address for investors who  
want to ask questions or lodge complaints: service2(at)etrade.com.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices rose in early trading Thursday  
following gains on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.68 points, or 0.58 percent, to  
14,242.99 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, 
the average lost 188.52 points, or 1.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was traded at 113.24 yen, up 0.86 yen from late in  
Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its level of 112.87 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices were rebounding Thursday from three straight  
sessions of losses following a rise in U.S. stock prices. On 
Wednesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 
92.69 points, or 1 percent, to close at 9,366.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also encouraged by a return to stability in the  
bond market early Thursday after the yield of the benchmark 
government bond surged the previous day to its highest level since 
July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.47 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,099.62. The 
TOPIX closed down 16.58 points, or 1.49 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened after U.S.  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that the U.S. government's 
strong-dollar policy has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 2.270  
percent from 2.335 percent Wednesday, driving its price up to 96.37

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Says He'll Win House Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging it was ``the worst kept secret  
in town,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt formally told fellow 
Democrats Wednesday he will forgo a 2000 run for president and 
focus on recapturing the House for his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've handed that gavel over for the last time,'' Gephardt told  
more than 200 House Democrats and aides at a raucous pep rally in a 
Capitol basement meeting room. ``When the 107th Congress convenes 
in January of 2001, I want to take that gavel back on your 
behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, the 58-year-old Missourian has presided at the  
opening of three successive Congresses that Republicans have 
controlled, giving the gavel to GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and 
Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	As supporters waved white-on-blue ``Speaker Gephardt'' signs,  
Gephardt called for Democratic unity for a Congress ``that reflects 
the hopes and dreams of the people rather than the unending 
drumbeat of a small minority bent on imposing their will on an 
entire nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt never mentioned in his 11-minute speech that he had  
considered seeking his party's presidential nomination next year, 
nor did he mention the front-runner for that post, Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned later by reporters, he said his prospects for winning  
that nomination or raising the millions of dollars needed had 
nothing to do with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made this a personal decision for what in my heart and my  
mind ... would make the best contribution I could make for public 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt supporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
decided that winning back the House was as important to Democratic 
initiatives as retaining the White House. Gephardt also believed he 
had a better chance to become speaker than president, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would endorse Gore -- with whom he had breakfast  
Wednesday -- Gephardt said, ``I haven't made any decision on any of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By not challenging Gore, Gephardt has avoided a bitter fight  
that could have divided and distracted Democrats next year. Though 
Gore is being challenged by former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey 
and could draw other opponents, Gephardt was considered to be his 
strongest rival for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also leaves Democrats with their best congressional  
fund-raiser and candidate recruiter focusing on House races next 
year, when control of the chamber will be in play. Republicans have 
a mere 221-211 House majority, plus one independent who leans 
Democratic and two vacant seats the GOP is likely to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a significant step closer to the majority by having him  
stay,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt raised as much as $14 million for himself and other  
Democratic congressional candidates in 1997 and 1998, and 
campaigned for 110 of them, according to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has helped congressional Democrats formulate a more  
moderate message in recent years, such as their decision to rally 
behind President Clinton's call last year to reserve federal 
surpluses until Social Security is overhauled. From liberals to 
conservatives, Democratic lawmakers say Gephardt is a leader they 
can trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick Gephardt is the glue that will hold this caucus  
together,'' said liberal Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Profit Up for Quarter, Yr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. posted sharply  
higher earnings for the fourth quarter despite a decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Wednesday came as Goodyear announced it has struck a  
global tire manufacturing alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber 
Industries Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The tire maker earned $121.5 million, or 78 cents per share, in  
the final three months of 1998, compared with $2 million, or 1 cent 
per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $3.2 billion from $3.3 billion a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest earnings included gains from the sale of assets of  
$6.5 million, or 4 cents per share. The 1997 results were depressed 
by a restructuring charge of $176.3 million, or $1.12 a share, and 
included income of $6.3 million, or 4 cents per share, from 
discontinued operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings of 74 cents a share without the gain in  
the latest quarter was near the 75 cents a share average that 
analysts surveyed by First Call expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear stock closed up 3.2 percent, or $1.62 1/2, at $52 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Goodyear earned $682.3 million, or $4.31 per  
share, on sales of $12.6 billion, up from 1997 profits of $558.7 
million, or $3.53 per share, on sales of $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear's worldwide tire sales increased 1.8 percent the fourth  
quarter and 1.7 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998, it proved to be a challenging year,'' said Goodyear  
chairman Samir G. Gibara. ``Weak emerging markets, volatile foreign 
currencies and brutal competitive actions impact our results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company responded with improved manufacturing processes,  
several acquisitions and corporate streamlining, Gibara said.

	UN Workers Ordered Out of Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. security chief ordered American  
and British nationals working for the United Nations to leave Iraq 
because the Iraqi government says it cannot guarantee their safety, 
officials said today. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said security 
chief Benon Sevan made the decision following a series of exchanges 
with the Iraqi leadership.

	US Troops Might Be Sent to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress  
today that the administration might end up committing a 
``relatively small'' U.S. ground force to Kosovo. Cohen said that 
would happen only if a firm peace agreement is reached between 
warring factions. Other NATO members should make up the majority of 
such a force, he said.

	Arafat Presses for Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today  
affirmed his intention of carrying out the stalled West Bank 
accords with Israel. ``I am insistent on following up the peace 
process,'' Arafat told reporters after a 40-minute meeting with 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The process is stalled, with 
Israel refusing to yield more land until the Palestinian Authority 
imposes tougher restraints on terrorism and prosecutes suspects.

	Blumenthal Faces House Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors, pushing for live testimony  
in the impeachment trial, began wrapping up their private 
questioning of witnesses today with White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. Separately, Senate Republicans were weighing a formal 
declaration that President Clinton gave false testimony to a grand 
jury.

	Clinton Trial Boosting Fund-Raising  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public reaction to the Congress' handling of  
President Clinton's impeachment has the cash register ringing at 
the Democratic National Committee, party officials say. Steve 
Grossman, serving as the party's co-chairman for the last time at a 
$1 million fund-raiser last night in New York City, said the DNC 
had hoped to raise $1 million from small donors. ``There are 
hundreds of thousands of citizens all over the country who are 
angry, who are outraged,'' Grossman said. ``They are voting with 
their wallets.''

	Russia Needs $3B To Fight Y2K Bug  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia conceded today it needs up to $3 billion to  
tackle the Year 2000 computer glitch -- six times the original 
estimate. Russia appealed to the United States to help fix 
computers that control stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Overwhelmed 
with debt, the government has long played down the cost and urgency 
of confronting the ``millennium bug,'' which could destabilize 
computer systems that control Russia's nuclear arsenal.

	Endangered Lynx To Be Freed  
</P>
<P>
	SOUTH FORK, Colo. (AP) -- Biologists were ready to release two  
female Canadian lynx today into snow-covered wilderness high in the 
Colorado backcountry. A male and a female were to be released 
tomorrow and seven lynx will follow later. The release site, on 
private land near the Rio Grande National Forest northwest of here, 
was being kept secret, though there have been no threats to the 
animals. Ranchers and farmers fought the release in court and lost.

O'Lakes 2 percent milk have been recalled in eight states because 
of possible contamination. Kohler Mix Specialties Inc., a 
subsidiary of Michael Foods Inc., announced the recall of Land 
O'Lakes' 10-ounce, 2 percent milk cartons dated Feb. 10 and Feb.

	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Rank-and-file IOC members mounted a

<HEADLINE> A Message Worth Repeating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Running out of bounds to avoid punishment was something that  
other guys did. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Walter Payton. And so when he sat in front of a packed room  
and admitted he was scared to take the next step in his life, you 
knew there had to be a very good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the people that really care about me,'' Payton said,  
choking back tears, ``just continue praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We are reminded all too often that athletes have feet of clay.  
Last weekend, for instance, featured this trifecta: O.J. Simpson's 
selection by ESPN as one of the century's 50 top athletes; Lawrence 
Taylor's election to pro football's Hall of Fame; and Atlanta 
safety Eugene Robinson's arrest for soliciting an undercover police 
officer for sex just before the Super Bowl and just after a 
Christian athletes group gave him an award for outstanding moral 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	What Payton's revelation did was remind us that the rest of an  
athlete's body parts are mortal, too. The only thing shocking, in 
fact, was how grave his condition is already. The 44-year-old 
former Chicago Bears great has a rare liver disease, and without a 
transplant, he would be lucky to survive more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I scared?'' Payton said at one point, repeating a question.  
``Hell yeah, I'm scared. Wouldn't you be scared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then he admitted something else frightened him almost as  
much, and that was the whispering campaign going on behind his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Thin and gaunt, sometimes jaundiced and fatigued, Payton barely  
resembles the 200-pound running back who always made of a point of 
giving defenders as good as he got. People who remembered only that 
Walter Payton have had a hard time adjusting to this one. So they 
began speculating. 
</P>
<P>
	``My physical appearance has changed dramatically and I have to  
deal with people. The looks, the stares, and then the accusations -- 
people guessing, `Could it be that?' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though a lot of you say you shouldn't worry about that,''  
he added, ``sometimes you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That explained why his physician, Dr. Joseph Lagattuta, spent so  
much time at the news conference explaining what diseases Payton 
wasn't suffering from. And why the doctor also went to great 
lengths to explain that while the cause of Payton's disease -- 
called primary sclerosing cholangitis, which afflicts just three in 
100,000 people -- is unknown, it wasn't related to alcohol, 
steroids, hepatitis or any kind of immunodeficiency disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the news conference, Payton covered the same ground  
over and over in a handful of separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a case where I don't drink, I don't smoke,'' he told  
ESPN later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we've done tests, we've done biopsies of the liver and  
everything else and we've come up negative. ... So what I wanted to 
do was, for the people that really cared about me and kept asking 
questions, I wanted to get it out there in one big swoop so I don't 
have to keep telling people over and over again what the problem 
is. That was one of the reasons why we had the press conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only question Payton will concern himself with now is what  
comes next. With a transplant, his chances of long-term survival 
and a return to active life are good. But Payton's need, and not 
his celebrity, will ultimately determine his place on a list of 
candidates awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he can put that celebrity to use of behalf of all those  
people -- as well as himself -- almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, baseball great Mickey Mantle was diagnosed with liver  
cancer. Five days later, he got a transplanted organ, rekindling a 
long-standing debate about whether celebrities received 
preferential treatment. Mantle's doctors and officials at the 
Southwest Organ Bank in Dallas denied it, saying that his 
condition, compatible blood type and weight were the reasons he 
wound up at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing nobody denied about Mantle's celebrity status, though,  
was how many people it swayed to become organ donors. In the weeks 
on either side of his operation, the number of request for donor 
cards at the Southwest Organ Bank went from 12 to more than 700. A 
transplant program in Philadelphia said requests there jumped from 
150 to 300. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the 1995 major league All-Star game festivities at  
The Ballpark in Arlington, about 10,000 donor cards were passed out 
at one of the events. Mantle, like Payton a tough guy, was a 
reluctant campaigner at first. But he agreed to make one a final 
public appearance later that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of heavy drinking that ruined one liver and put Mantle  
in such dire straits was an embarrassment. Still, he didn't mind 
becoming the means to a very important end. And what he told the 
crowd was this: ``If you want to do something great, be a donor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a message worth repeating.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Georgia State Professor Sues FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A college professor who was investigated by  
federal agents, allegedly for inviting a Cuban government official 
to speak at a symposium, sued the U.S. Justice Department and the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatriz Morales Cozier's federal lawsuit, filed Tuesday in  
Atlanta, seeks access to the entire file the FBI compiled on her 
during an investigation almost five years ago, when she was at 
Georgia State University. The suit asks that a federal judge review 
the file privately and determine whether ``national security'' 
justifies the deletion of many passages in the file. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cozier, who immigrated from Cuba in 1961, originally asked  
for the file through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI took 
3 1/2 years to release the file and then gave her only 30 pages of the 
62-page file, the lawsuit said, adding that many of the pages 
contained heavily edited portions under the justification of 
``national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A law-abiding citizen has the right to know why the FBI is  
spying on her through her neighbors, friends and family,'' said 
Gerald Weber, one of Ms. Cozier's lawyers from the American Civil 
Liberties Union. He argued that there is no reason national 
security would apply to her case. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI repeatedly interviewed Ms. Cozier's family, co-workers  
and friends, and looked at her real estate, employment and tax 
records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Molly Halle of the FBI's office in Atlanta declined to comment  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While at Georgia State in 1994, Ms. Cozier invited Jose-Luis  
Ponce, then secretary of the Office of Cuban Interests in 
Washington, to attend a symposium. Ponce accepted the invitation 
and allegedly criticized the U.S. government during his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks afterward, an FBI agent arrived at Georgia State and  
questioned Ms. Cozier, the lawsuit says. Ponce's visa was revoked 
in 1996 by the United States, in response to a decision by the 
communist Cuban government to expel a U.S. diplomat from Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cozier now teaches anthropology at Morris Brown College in  
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Bias Crimes Bill Nixed in Wyoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Four months after gay college student  
Matthew Shepard was beaten to death, a move to pass hate crimes 
legislation in Wyoming was scuttled Wednesday by a committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said that ended their hopes for the year.  
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming is one nine states without bias crimes laws, and  
lawmakers have rejected similar measures four times since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After Shepard's death in October, calls for a bias crimes law  
increased -- Republican Gov. Jim Geringer for the first time 
supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Geringer said Wednesday that he was disappointed the legislation  
did not reach the Senate floor for debate, but he added that no law 
can change how people think about each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I call on the people of Wyoming to do is to recognize  
that there are 480,000 of us that have unique capabilities, 
limitations whatever they might be and let's not hold that against 
each other,'' the governor said. ``Let's find a way to build the 
community of Wyoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two measures died in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Both would  
have increased the maximum fine for a felony by up to $5,000 and 
raised the maximum prison sentence by up to five years if 
prosecutors could prove the crime was motivated by bias. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. John Schiffer, the Judiciary chairman, said he hoped  
supporters of bias crime legislation would come back in future 
sessions with legislation that would have broader support. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said they objected to listing motivating factors, such  
as race, religion and sexual orientation, saying the bills offered 
special protection to certain groups. Others said no new laws are 
needed, just strict enforcement of existing measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wende Barker, state coordinator for the Wyoming Bias Crimes  
Coalition, said she was disappointed but not surprised and planned 
to try to push for such laws again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other bias crime-related bill before the Legislature is  
one that would set up a task force to examine how many bias crimes 
are committed in Wyoming. It has passed the House and is pending in 
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Texas Wins the Recruiting Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Texas finally hooked 'em on national signing day, and the  
Longhorns came away as undisputed champions in Recruiting Wars '99. 
</P>
<P>
	With an incoming class of stars led by quarterback Chris Simms  
and linebacker Cory Redding -- USA Today's offensive and defensive 
players of the year as well as Parade All-Americans -- Texas was the 
top choice of three national recruiting gurus. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than any coach in the country, Mack Brown has awakened a  
sleeping giant,'' Allen Wallace, publisher of Laguna Beach, 
Calif.-based SuperPrep magazine said Wednesday, the first day high 
school seniors were able to sign letters-of-intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Williams' record-setting Heisman Trophy season and a 9-3  
record capped by a 38-11 win over Mississippi State in the Cotton 
Bowl didn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hook 'em horns! Texas simply has the best group from top to  
bottom,'' said Bobby Burton of Austin, Texas-based The National 
Recruiting Advisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was satisfied, to say the least.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a class that can jumpstart us back to where we want to  
be,'' Brown said, ``and that's the elite of college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shocker came at the expense of Notre Dame. C.J.  
Leak, a highly-touted quarterback from Charlotte, N.C., chose Wake 
Forest over the Irish, who for months expected the 6-foot-4, 
210-pounder in the mold of Randall Cunningham to sign on with coach 
Bob Davie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, who did not sign a quarterback Wednesday, were still  
rated third by Burton and Tom Lemming of Schaumburg, Ill.-based 
Prep Football Report, but eighth by Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to be the biggest surprise of the recruiting  
season,'' Burton said. ``That kid was penciled in at Notre Dame for 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, though, came away with such standouts as defensive  
back Gerome Sapp from Houston and defensive lineman Cedric Hilliard 
from Arlington, Texas, and offensive lineman Jeff Faine from 
Florida -- both 300-pounders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, with a haul that included USA Today All-American  
offensive lineman Bryce Bishop, defensive lineman Tim Anderson, 
defensive back Michael Doss and defensive back/wide receiver Kelton 
Lindsay, was ranked second by Burton and Wallace and fourth by 
Lemming. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people overlooked Ohio State, but they filled most of  
their needs,'' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	National champion Tennessee was a three-time loser on Wednesday.  
First, Simms de-committed to Tennessee last week and signed with 
Texas on Wednesday; Derek Watson, South Carolina's Mr. Football, 
changed his mind about the Vols and signed with the Gamecocks; and 
finally Santonio Beard, a top-rated running back from Nashville, 
went for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything went right for Texas, which landed its first  
top-rated class since Lemming began his rankings 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a combination of a new coach, a Heisman Trophy and a  
winning season that was tough to beat,'' Lemming said. ``And, they 
kept kids at home while going out and signing the nation's top 
talent, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simms, the 6-5, 218-pound son of former New York Giants  
quarterback Phil Simms, was the Longhorns' biggest catch. He made a 
verbal commitment to national champion Tennessee, but changed his 
mind last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms, from Franklin Lakes, N.J., threw for 2,239 yards and 18  
touchdowns in his senior season at Ramapo H.S. He's expected to 
challenge immediately for the backup spot behind Major Applewhite. 
</P>
<P>
	Redding, 6-5 and 240 pounds from North Shore H.S. in Houston,  
had 123 solo tackles, including 22 for losses, and 112 assists. He 
also caused six fumbles and recovered five. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Parade All-Americans signing with Texas included Bo  
Sciafe, a 6-4, 225-pound wide receiver from Denver, and Alfio 
Randall, a 6-6, 270-pound offensive lineman from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was ranked eighth by Burton and not in the top 10 by  
Lemming or Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemming had Georgia's class rated second. Among the Bulldogs  
signees were wide receivers Michael Johnson from Tulsa, Okla., 
Reggie Brown of Carrollton, Ga., and Durrell Robinson of Duncan, 
S.C. Also, the Bulldogs signed running backs Bruce Thornton from 
LaGrange, Ga., and DeJuan Green from Jacksonville, Fla., the 
Sunshine State's top tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most athletic class in the country,'' Lemming said of the  
Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also checking in with top-rated classes were Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA.  
Aggies coach R.C. Slocum, trying to keep pace with Brown and the 
Longhorns, did just fine, signing some of the nation's top players, 
including defensive linemen Ty Warren of Bryan, Texas, and Brian 
West of West Monroe, La.; and linebacker Jason LeDoux of West 
Monroe, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Texas A&AMP;M signed running back Joe Weber of San Bernardino,  
Calif., one of the top runners on the West coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Among UCLA's top recruits were five Parade All-Americans -- tight  
end Mike Seidman of Westlake, Calif., linebacker Marcus Reese of 
San Jose, Calif., quarterback J.P. Losman of Venice, Calif., and 
offensive linemen Bryce Bohlander of Salem, Ore., and Shane Lehmann 
of Corona, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, a mainstay among the top recruiting classes, was  
able to sign only a dozen players because 73 are already on 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Bobby Bowden's Seminoles made a splash by signing  
several highly-rated stars, including quarterback Anquan Boldin of 
Pahokee, Fla. -- Wallace's No. 1-rated player -- running back Nick 
Maddox of Kannapois, N.C., defensive back Rufus Brown of El Paso, 
Texas; and defensive linemen Darnell Dockett of Burtonsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best 12 player group in the country,'' Wallace said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alabama had a nice haul, too. Among the top signees were Beard,  
wide receiver Antonio Carter of Tallahassee, Fla., linebacker 
Saleem Rasheed of Birmingham, Ala., and defensive lineman Kenny 
King, Daphne, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the schools with surprisingly good classes, according to  
Lemming, were Boston College -- running back William Green picked 
the Eagles over Ohio State -- Illinois and South Carolina, even 
though new coach Lou Holtz got a late recruiting start. 
</P>
<P>
	``BC dominated the East, over Penn State,'' Lemming said. ``And  
under the circumstances, South Carolina did well, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, though, did not fare well as Rick Neuheisel left for  
Washington and Gary Barnett had a hard time winning over recruits 
after coming over from Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies signed top running back prospect Paul Arnold of  
Seattle to salvage their class, but the Buffaloes lost several 
players to other schools after Neuheisel's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable signings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Quarterback Eli Manning, brother of Peyton and son of Archie,  
signed with Mississippi, his father's alma mater. Manning, 6-4, 
200, will play for new coach David Cutcliffe, who was Peyton's 
mentor at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Running back Jarrett Payton, son of Chicago Bears' Hall of  
Famer Walter, signed with Miami. So did a pair of Parade 
All-Americans -- offensive linemen Vernon Carey and wide receiver 
Andre Johnson, both from Miami.

<HEADLINE>  Walter Payton Needs Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Walter Payton ran the football with no  
fear. With a dashing style and incomparable flair, he could crash 
into a defender and run over him or just as easily juke him and go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the leading rusher in NFL history because he ran with  
such abandon and because, for 13 years, he was one of the most 
durable players -- at any position -- to ever put on a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the man they call ``Sweetness'' faces a crisis much more  
formidable than any football game that ever confronted him with the 
Chicago Bears, a challenge much greater than any defense that ever 
tried to contain him. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs a liver transplant to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest football player I've ever seen at any  
position,'' said Saints coach Mike Ditka, who coached Payton in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody can beat this thing, it's Walter. I'd like to see  
when he gets the transplant and gets on level ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 44, has a rare liver disease, and in his current  
condition would have, on average, two years to live without a 
transplant, his doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer appeared gaunt and frail at a recent news  
conference where his son announced he would play football at the 
University of Miami. So Payton called a news conference of his own 
to get his condition out in the open and curtail rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get everything straight before things got bad,''  
said Payton, who wore sunglasses and an NFL jacket and bluejeans 
that couldn't hide his thinness. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was composed until the very end when asked if he had a  
message for his legion of fans. Then the emotions came out. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the people that really care about me, just continue  
praying,'' Payton said, choking up. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Connie, patted him on the back when he couldn't  
continue. After finishing his thought in a cracking, tearful voice, 
Payton put his head down and embraced his 17-year-old son, Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need him around, for him to be there for me as I do things  
and for my sister and for my mom,'' Jarrett said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it was kind of scary because you see your dad going  
through the NFL and not coming out with many injuries. Then 
something like this happens and it kind of makes you look and say, 
`Well, he's not invincible.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, afflicts just three  
in 100,000 people, said Payton's physician, Dr. Joseph Lagattuta. 
The cause of the disease, which blocks the bile ducts, is unknown, 
but isn't related to alcohol, steroids, hepatitis or immune 
deficiency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms include fatigue and jaundice -- yellowing of the pigment  
of the eyes and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was scared, Payton responded quickly: ``Am I scared?  
Hell yeah, I'm scared. Wouldn't you be scared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's not in my hands anymore,'' he added. ``It's in God's  
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is being evaluated for a transplant at the Mayo Clinic,  
where former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker received a liver 
transplant in 1996 for the same disease. Tucker was on a waiting 
list for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said 88 percent of people who receive a liver  
transplant are alive after a year, and the long-term survival rate 
is ``very promising.'' He said most patients can return to an 
active life if they receive a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Payton won't get preferential treatment because of  
his celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Payton's illness sobered those who knew him as a  
muscular, fearless player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all humans and regardless of how rich we are, how  
fortunate we are, whatever we maybe, things like this happen,'' 
said retired Bears fullback Roland Harper, who blocked for Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll show everybody in the world how to fight,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	``While I was there, he missed one game and we nearly had to tie  
him to the bench. He never ran out of bounds. I got spoiled 
watching him run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bears owners Ed and Virginia McCaskey issued a brief statement  
saying they were ``devastated to hear that Walter is sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very dear person to our family and the entire Bears  
organization. We'll do all we can to help Walter in his current 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue: ``The love, support and  
prayers of the entire NFL are with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said the disease is difficult to diagnose and can go  
undetected for years. He initially thought it might be a gall 
bladder problem when Payton told him in October that he had felt 
ill since July. The liver problem was diagnosed within the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagattuta said Payton has significant bile-duct blockage. To aid  
his digestion and give him adequate nutrition, a plastic tube was 
surgically inserted between the vessel that carries bile from the 
liver to the intestines. But Payton said he is not taking 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, I can eat anything I want, as much as I want,  
and I still can't gain any weight,'' Payton said. But he said the 
illness has affected his sense of tastes and smell and chewing his 
favorite bubblegum makes him want to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to continue progressively to get worse to the point  
where a transplant is inevitable. That's where we are now,'' Payton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	'' Right now, I'm still healthy even though I look like I've  
lost weight. To some of you, I don't look healthy, I still am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his final season with the Bears in 1987, the 5-foot-11 Payton  
was listed at 202 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how much he weighed now, Payton wouldn't say.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he replied: ``You want to pick me up?''  
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick from Jackson State in 1975, Payton  
carried the load for mediocre Bears teams early in his career 
before leading Chicago to its only Super Bowl appearance, after the 
1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected to nine Pro Bowls and inducted into the Pro Football  
Hall of Fame in 1993, Payton holds NFL career records for yards 
gained, 16,726, and carries, 3,838. 
</P>
<P>
	He posted 77 100-yard games and 10 1,000-yard rushing seasons.  
His 275-yard rushing performance against Minnesota in 1977 still 
stands as the NFL record for rushing yards in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from football, Payton co-owned an Indy-CART  
auto-racing team and ran a restaurant and other businesses in the 
Chicago area. He served on the Bears board of directors and joined 
groups seeking NFL franchises.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Said to Influence Non-HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The power of managed care may be even greater  
than you'd expect. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do health maintenance organizations help reduce the  
overall cost of health care for their members, but they appear to 
cut medical expenses for those in traditional insurance as well, 
suggests a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managed care seems to have a spillover effect,'' said Uwe  
Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Health expenses for patients in traditional Medicare plans tend  
to fall in regions with growing HMOs, according to a study by 
Stanford University researcher Laurence Baker. He surmises that 
doctors in regions with fast-growing HMOs order fewer tests and cut 
other costs even for their patients who aren't in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest doctors used to treating HMO patients alter  
their practice habits in treating all patients either out of 
convenience or because they agree with the more conservative HMO 
treatment style, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether patients with traditional insurance get better care  
because their care is similar to that in an HMO remains open for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's study is one of the first to draw attention to the  
impact managed care has to all patients, not just those in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings raise doubts about suspicions that doctors  
treat patients differently based on their insurance coverage, said 
Reinhardt, who wrote an accompanying editorial in this week's 
edition of JAMA. Economists, he said, have long assumed doctors 
were influenced by how they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This article says the world is more complicated, and doctors  
are not the economic animals that our economic models suggest they 
are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined Medicare costs from 1990 to 1994, a time when  
HMO market share increased nationally from 15 percent to 20 
percent. The study accounted for a number of factors that influence 
health costs, including the age and health status of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker found that as HMO market share increased in a region from  
10 percent to 20 percent, Medicare hospital costs fell by 2 percent 
and Medicare physician and outpatient expenses fell by 1.5 percent. 
Medicare costs fell even more sharply in regions where HMO market 
share was bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the average Medicare expense per beneficiary was about  
$3,270. 
</P>
<P>
	Several reasons could explain how HMO cut costs for patients not  
in HMOs. The presence of health plans in a community tend to spur 
construction of more lower-cost health settings such as outpatient 
surgery centers and HMO doctors influence how non-HMO doctors 
practice, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Baker concludes the most likely cause is that doctors treat  
all of their patients the same way. And if HMOs move doctors to 
limit hospitalizations and expensive tests for their members, 
doctors follow the same approach for all their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of patients think that they can escape the effects of  
managed care by joining some other type of health plan,'' Baker 
said. ``In places with a lot of managed care that is not true.''

<HEADLINE> Endangered Lynx To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH FORK, Colo. (AP) -- For a small, secretive, wild cat, the  
endangered lynx has been unable to avoid the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, an environmental group said it set damaging fires at  
the Vail ski area to protect potential habitat areas for the lynx, 
although the cats hadn't been seen in Colorado since a 
quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, biologists were ready to release two female Canadian  
lynx into snow-covered wilderness high in the Colorado backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was no guarantee the tuft-eared cats, which weigh  
about 22 pounds each, would leave the sanctuary of their cages to 
rush into the wild, said Colorado Division of Wildlife spokesman 
Todd Malmsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been eating well. You couldn't expect them to be any  
more calm,'' said veterinarian Margaret Wild, who has been 
monitoring a collection of 11 of the mountain cats since they began 
their 1,700-mile truck ride from British Columbia last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A male and a female were to be released Thursday and the rest of  
the 11 lynx will follow later. 
</P>
<P>
	The release site, on private land near the Rio Grande National  
Forest northwest of here, was being kept secret, though there have 
been no threats to the animals. Ranchers and farmers fought the 
release in court and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx, put on the national Endangered Species list last year  
and last seen in Colorado in 1973 near the Vail ski area, has 
become a cause celebre for environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretive environmental group Earth Liberation Front said it  
set fires that caused $12 million damage at the Vail resort in 
October to protest a ski expansion the group claims would destroy 
lynx habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to restore wildlife populations also have met  
resistance. Ranchers, farmers and residents of subdivisions built 
in former wildlife habitats have opposed the reintroduction or 
preservation of species ranging from the grizzly bear to the 
prairie dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Rancher Ed Oliver, who runs cattle near here, said he isn't  
worried about the lynx killing livestock but he is concerned that 
they will lead the federal government to take away grazing permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know as we have any objection against the lynx; it's  
just if the lynx do well there, these people are going to say this 
is good lynx habitat and then maybe close it off for cattle,'' said 
Oliver, in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Byrne, a Division of Wildlife biologist, said he does not  
expect any threats against the lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lynx is very secretive,'' he said. ``It's a nocturnal  
animal. It's not a species that is going to interact with people, 
so they probably will end up in some strange places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife activists say the reintroduction of the wolf into  
Yellowstone National Park has been such a success that it is now a 
bigger attraction for visitors than the grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, five of 11 Mexican gray wolves released last year  
have been shot. Officials plan to release more, but in more remote 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, where the lynx will  
be released, are about as remote an area as any in the Western 
states. Often buried by heavy snow, the area is more than 100 miles 
from the nearest interstate highway and is the largest roadless 
wilderness in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx thrives in areas above 8,000 feet, living off the  
snowshoe hare. The lynx itself has large, snowshoe-like paws, good 
for marching through the snow or as a base for leaping to grab its 
prey. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Juans have a higher concentration of the snowshoe hare  
than the Wind River Mountains in Wyoming, the nearest existing 
population of lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	The cats remain plentiful in Canada and Alaska but fewer than  
200 are believed to remain in the Lower 48 states, mostly in Maine, 
Montana, Washington and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials hope to release at least 50 lynx in  
southwestern Colorado by the end of the year, said Malmsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics wonder whether the wild cats, rarely found south of the  
Canadian border, can survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Malmsbury said radio collars will be put on the animals and  
planes will fly over the area to monitor their progress. The 
special collars can even alert agents if an animal has died.

<HEADLINE> Cockfighting Targeted at Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing to end cockfighting, animal rights  
activists want Congress to close a loophole in a federal law that 
allows fighting roosters to be transported from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animal fighting is a bloody spectacle and has no place in a  
civilized society,'' Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the 
Humane Society of the United States, said Tuesday. ``It's important 
the Congress take a public stand against these practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., a veterinarian, is introducing  
legislation at the request of the Humane Society that would close a 
loophole in the Animal Welfare Act that allows birds to be shipped 
across state lines if cockfighting is legal in the state receiving 
the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma are the only states where  
cockfighting is still legal. Missouri and Arizona voters banned the 
practice this past November. 
</P>
<P>
	The Humane Society said cockfighting still takes place, however,  
in many states where it is banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockfighting opponents say breeders will often claim they  
possess birds not to fight in their own state but to take them to a 
state where cockfighting is legal. The claims often cause confusion 
for law enforcement officials and result in no prosecution, 
activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that there's not an interstate trade prohibition on  
the birds and the paraphernalia is a big opening for cockfighters 
to exploit,'' Pacelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Humane Society investigator Eric Sakach, ``Our experience  
has shown virtually no state is immune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the centuries-old activity, fighting roosters -- outfitted  
with blades on their heels -- are placed in a ring to slash at each 
other while spectators often bet on the outcome. The loser of the 
fight often dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals have no choice,'' said World Championship  
Wrestling champion Bill Goldberg, an Oklahoma native who is 
featured in advertisements denouncing the practice. ``It's sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in some parts of the country, cockfighting is viewed as a  
way of life that is harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get plenty of food. They get exercise,'' said Brett  
Johnson, a former New Mexico state legislator who as a lawmaker 
voted against attempts to ban cockfighting. ``The Humane Society is 
just after the little mom and pop shops. The life of a fighting 
chicken is a lot more humane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, tightening laws still wouldn't end tradition, Johnson  
said. ``It's not going to stop. All it's going to do is make a 
bunch of law abiding citizens criminals.''

<HEADLINE> Duval Stays Course to Stardom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The stone-cold expression never  
changed, even after David Duval removed his hat and wraparound 
sunglasses -- the mask that seems to keep everyone in the dark about 
his view from the top of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, Duval's outlook is no different now from when he  
first showed up on the PGA Tour with about 30 extra pounds, a 
goatee and nothing better than a second-place finish in his first 
92 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine victories in his last 29 starts, including the first  
final-round 59 in PGA Tour history, he says his game isn't that 
much different, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of work the last 15 years, you know?'' Duval said when  
asked the secret to his success. ``I take a bit of offense to that 
kind of question because I view finishing 11th my first year on the 
money list as exceptional, and I think I played great golf then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, no one is playing  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``What David Duval has done this year is beyond belief,'' Mark  
O'Meara said. ``We all know how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning four times last year, the Vardon Trophy and a  
record $2.6 million, Duval showed up in Hawaii to start the new 
season and lapped the field. Two weeks later at the Bob Hope 
Chrysler Classic, he came from seven strokes back on the last day 
with a flawless 59. 
</P>
<P>
	And then a strange thing happened last week in Phoenix -- Duval  
didn't win. One of the most unflappable figures in golf admits he 
was distracted by buzz over his 59 and even now can't grasp it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way I've come to understand it is ... I can't  
understand it,'' he said. ``Do you understand what I'm saying? I 
don't appreciate what happened, and that's how I have gotten a 
little bit of appreciation for what did happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval may not be the most understood player on tour. He says  
it's possible that his robot-like demeanor may lead to a false 
perception of his personality, although he is accommodating and 
approachable and will leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not as engaging as O'Meara, the talkative son of a  
furniture salesman. He is not as exciting as Tiger Woods, who still 
commands galleries three times the size of Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara is playing the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am with  
Ken Griffey Jr., while Woods is paired again with Kevin Costner. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval? He'll play with Scott Regner, a friend from back home in  
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``His personality is his personality,'' O'Meara said. ``He's not  
going to change that. You have to admire a guy who's that way. He 
goes along and does his business, and does it quite well. He lets 
his clubs do the talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly speak louder than the world golf rankings, which  
continues to list Tiger Woods at No. 1, although probably not for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval has stopped searching for meaning in his 59, he also  
has given up his inquiry into the ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be considered the best player for however long  
that can be, and I may have gotten there, I don't know,'' he said. 
``Somebody is going to have to explain to me what I'll have to do 
to get to No. 1. I can't think of what else I could do, and that's 
why I'm not concerned about it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is only one thing to be concerned about this week, and  
that hasn't changed, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it rain or will it shine?  
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Pebble Beach was a washout when PGA Tour  
officials decided to scrap the tournament after only two rounds 
could be squeezed in because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, they went to extreme measures to finish the  
tournament -- the second round was played in February, the third and 
final round played in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine has bathed the Monterey Peninsula this week, which led  
someone to ask O'Meara, ``How does it feel to actually get a 
practice round in this year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that O'Meara needs one. Phil Mickelson may be the defending  
champion, Duval may be the hottest player in golf, but O'Meara is 
the king of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only five-time winner of the old Bing Crosby and new  
AT&AMP;T, and also won the U.S. Amateur in 1979 at Pebble Beach 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could ever be too depressed coming here,''  
O'Meara said. ``This place doesn't owe me anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last victory at Pebble was two years ago when he closed with  
a 67 for a one-stroke victory. Tied for second that year was Woods, 
whose eagle putt on the 72nd hole to force a playoff grazed the 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The other runner-up? Duval, who tied the course record with a 62  
in the third round but stood off to the side as someone else 
accepted the Waterford crystal. That doesn't happen very often 
these days.

<HEADLINE> Kids in Hot Water Over Beer Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The teen-age organizers showed outstanding  
organizational skills, renting a warehouse, chartering buses and 
persuading nearly 300 of their peers to buy tickets at up to $55 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	But to the school district gave the whole thing an F, because  
what the kids put together was an elaborate beer bash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, acting on a tip, descended on the party about midnight  
Saturday and ticketed more than 150 teen-agers from the Park 
Cities, two wealthy enclaves north of downtown Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, about 200 students were suspended from  
extracurricular school activities, including sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a society we often look the other way rather than face  
tough issues head-on,'' said Highland Park school Superintendent 
John Connolly in announcing the disciplinary action. ``This school 
district will not look the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entrepreneurial organizers rented the warehouse for $1,000  
and chartered city buses to transport partygoers, authorities said. 
Nearly 300 tickets were sold at $35 to $55 each, and police said 
about 250 people ranging in age from 14 to 19 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Tasian, an 18-year-old Highland Park senior identified as a  
main organizer, was charged with supplying alcohol to minors. A 
34-year-old man hired as a bouncer at the party also was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The first casualty of the extracurricular ban was the boys  
varsity basketball team, which lost a game 32-30 on Tuesday, 
playing without four of its starting players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this means there are not enough students to perform in an  
activity or play a sport, then those activities will be canceled,'' 
Principal Bob Albano said. The students were only suspended from 
after-school activities because they can't be suspended from school 
for something that wasn't school-sponsored.

<HEADLINE> NKorea Said Increasingly Volatile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials say North Korea's  
military discipline appears to be eroding, but there is no 
reduction in the threat the communist nation poses to U.S. and 
South Korean forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging hearing Tuesday, the officials named Korea,  
Iraq and international techno-terrorism as the key national 
security challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can hardly overstate my concern about North Korea,'' CIA  
Director George Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
``In nearly all respects, the situation there has become more 
volatile and unpredictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes, head of the Defense Intelligence  
Agency, cited intelligence reports that describe North Korean 
soldiers out of uniform, marketplace activity going on without 
governmental control, and frequent disruptions in the course of a 
military unit's training. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this will encourage the North to rely still more  
heavily on risky brinkmanship in its dealings with the United 
States,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, North Korea continues to expand its conventional military  
forces and its ballistic missile capability. 
</P>
<P>
		   U.S. intelligence is closely following a massive North Korean  
construction project at Kumchang-ni, an underground complex large 
enough to house facilities for making plutonium and other 
weapons-grade material for nuclear weapons, Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned that North Korea has a covert  
program,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Tenet nor Hughes see any reduction in tension with the  
Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. Though hampered by international 
sanctions, Iraq could, under the right circumstances, develop a 
large inventory of weapons of mass destruction, cruise missiles and 
short- and medium-range missiles and could expand its air and 
ground forces dramatically by 2020, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absent a fundamental change in governance, uncertain  
circumstances and a revitalization of military capability will be 
Iraq's direction,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared text submitted to the committee, Tenet described  
Saddam as ``more frustrated and desperate to break out of (U.S.) 
containment'' but cautioned that he maintains a firm grip on power, 
``leaving few vulnerabilities that can be exploited by those 
opposed to his rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is under increasing pressure from Congress to develop  
covert strategies aimed at toppling Saddam, though most Iraqi 
experts give the effort little chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrorism remains a key national security concern and Tenet said  
Americans and American interests are increasingly the target of 
international terrorists. Attacks by the suspected terrorist Osama 
bin Laden, believed responsible for last summer's U.S. embassy 
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, ``could occur at any time,'' Tenet 
said.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage ETrade Is Back Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A software problem prevented online investors  
from buying and selling stocks Wednesday through ETrade Group Inc., 
a dominant player in the booming Internet brokerage industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was blocked for about 75 minutes Wednesday morning. By  
11:30 a.m. EST, the company announced that trading had resumed, but 
about 5 percent of the brokerage's customers were unable to trade 
electronically throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's brokers were taking telephone orders, but a swarm of  
jilted online traders jammed the lines, traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem resulted from a change in the software used to  
process trades. An upgraded system was installed Tuesday night, and 
a minor glitch derailed the trading page, a spokeswoman said. The 
software was fixed and submitted to another round of testing 
Wednesday afternoon, and the company said it does not anticipate 
further problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Levinson, ETrade's president, called the problem  
``embarrassing'' in an interview with CNBC, a cable TV business 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors showed no mercy on ETrade's stock, pushing it down $3,  
or by 5 percent, to close at $55.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge violation of a trust,'' he said. Crisci said  
Wednesday's outage prevented him from canceling an order to buy 
stock, resulting in an unspecified loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many people were affected by Wednesday's  
outage. ETrade is one of the largest of the increasingly popular 
online brokerages, processing an average of 40,000 trades per day 
in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first online brokerage to falter.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are growing pains throughout the entire industry,'' said  
Julio Gomez, founder of Gomez Advisors, a Cambridge, Mass., 
research firm that focuses on electronic commerce. ``Since 
Thanksgiving, all the big firms have been pushing the outer limits 
of their capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased volume has been fueled in part by the rise of  
Internet stocks, which have soared in recent months. Day traders, 
who try to reap profits from short-term swings in stock prices, 
have also embraced the online brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investors often complain about sluggish connections or  
delayed trades during busy sessions. While trading was heavy 
Wednesday, ETrade said volume had nothing to do with its outage, 
and rival brokerages were functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ETrade's troubles mirrored the old woes of America  
Online, which experienced persistent delays and outages in 1997 as 
millions of new Internet users signed onto its service. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending heavily to upgrade its systems, AOL continued to  
thrive. It currently has 15 million customers, plus 2 million 
through its subsidiary CompuServe. Its pending acquisition of 
Netscape Communications Corp. will broaden its reach in the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL was unmercifully castigated for its problems,'' said Phil  
Leigh, an Internet analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. ``But it came out much stronger. So will the 
Internet brokerages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the burgeoning industry, ETrade currently ranks third in  
volume behind Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Waterhouse Securities, and 
third in accounts behind Schwab and Fidelity Investments, Gomez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 2.8 million total transactions in its most recent  
fiscal quarter, up from 1.6 million in the same period of 1997. The 
company has wooed investors by offering a wide range of financial 
information on its site, including free real-time stock quotes for 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the company announced it would spend $100 million to  
$150 million over 12 to 18 months to advertise the dolled-up Web 
site, dubbed Destination ETrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that while regular upgrades are necessary in the  
highly competitive market, the Internet brokerages must be careful 
to ensure good service. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes by, customers will grow fed up with delays,''  
Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade has set up a special e-mail address for investors who  
want to ask questions or lodge complaints: service2(at)etrade.com.

<HEADLINE> Meissnitzer Leads Austrian Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Alexandra Meissnitzer showed why she is the  
world's top female skier this season, leading an Austrian sweep of 
the super-G on Wednesday in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer overcame a tricky wind and a rolling, bumpy course  
to reach the finish in 1 minute, 20.53 seconds, just .03 seconds 
faster than teammate Renate Goetschl and .21 ahead of Austria's 
Michaela Dorfmeister. 
</P>
<P>
	When Germany's Hilde Gerg, who started right behind Dorfmeister,  
finished only fourth, Meissnitzer knew she had the gold medal while 
her cheering section in the grandstand celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep gave Austria five of the six medals awarded so far in  
the championships. Hermann Maier shared the gold with Norway's 
Lasse Kjus in the men's super-G on Tuesday, with Hans Knauss 
claiming third. 
</P>
<P>
	At the finish area, Meissnitzer's close friend, injured American  
downhiller Picabo Street, plunged through a crowd to hug the 
champion. The Austrian and the American became friends after they 
shared a podium at St. Anton, Austria, in 1996, and Meissnitzer 
spent the summer with Street after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, who started two spots behind Meissnitzer in 11th,  
pressed her teammate's pace all the way down Vail's International 
course, then clapped her hands to her helmeted head when she saw 
how narrowly she had missed the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Melanie Turgeon, racing despite a painful flare-up of  
the back problems that have plagued her this season, was the top 
North American in the field, 19th in 1:22.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The top American was Kate Monahan of Aspen, Colo., 23rd in  
1:22.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, was on pace for the best  
finish by an American when she lost control and missed a gate on a 
series of bumps just before the final dive into the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 26th in the field  
of 43 in 1:23.23 and Caroline Lalive of Steamboat Springs, Calif., 
was 28th, 2.73 back of the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Gail Kelly, Sara-Maude Boucher and Anne Marie  
Lefrancois were 31st, 32nd and 34th. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Sibylle Brauner took a spectacular spill midway  
through her run, her skis helicoptering as she plunged toward the 
safety nets. After lying on the snow for several moments, Brauner 
got up and walked off, waving to the cheering crowd below.

<HEADLINE> Skiing: Maier, Kjus Tie for Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Lasse Kjus' health appears to have  
lasted just long enough -- down to a hundredth of a second, as a 
matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 World Cup overall champion from Norway has long had  
respiratory trouble, and even surgery two years ago to correct a 
sinus problem didn't cure his ills. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recurring bouts of flu, colds and sore throats, Kjus has  
remained one of the best ski racers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he added another entry on his long list of  
accomplishments by tying Austria's Hermann Maier for the men's 
super-G gold medal in the first event of the World Alpine Ski 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, Kjus said during the postrace press conference that  
he hadn't felt too well Wednesday morning and that he had a sore 
throat by the afternoon. He headed for bed -- and some insiders 
among the Norwegian delegation said he would head home without 
competing in another event. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does go home, Kjus will do so with the first shared gold  
in the history of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Maier each tripped the timer in 1 minute, 14.53 seconds  
after markedly different trips down the Birds of Prey course. 
Maier, winner of three of four races this season in defense of the 
super-G title he won a year ago, dominated at the top of the 
course, leading Kjus by .19 seconds at the first intermediate and 
by .18 after the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really hit any of the turns on the top of the steep,  
but halfway down I got it together and managed to ski well from 
there on down,'' Kjus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier could only wonder how he'd have done if his tricky back  
hadn't been acting up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to forget about my back problem,'' he said. ``But I  
wasn't always able to push at 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze medal went to Austrian Hans Knauss, who was lucky to  
even make the field and then unlucky enough to miss out on the 
first-place tie by a hundredth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three days ago, the coaches made the decision that I would ski  
in this event, so this (bronze medal) is also good for the 
coaches,'' Knauss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier and Kjus were more than willing to accept being linked in  
the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world championship is the world championship whether you  
win alone or together,'' Maier said. ``Lasse skied well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to share with Hermann,'' Kjus said. ``He's a great  
skier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first medal in a World Championships, so I'm very  
happy,'' Knauss said. ``It's hard at the moment, a hundredth of a 
second behind the gold medal, but I'm happy with my bronze medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-place ties have occurred seven times in the history of  
World Cup ski racing, and there have been other races in which the 
top three were separated by a hundredth of a second. But neither 
had ever occurred before in a World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In a race in which medals go only to the top three, Austria's  
Stephan Eberharter, the 1991 super-G world champion, was a 
hard-luck fourth, .22 seconds back. Switzerland's Paul Accola, fast 
on the top before fading a bit at the bottom, was fifth in 1:14.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail native Chad Fleischer earned a roaring ovation from the  
crowd with the fastest early time. Although it wasn't enough for a 
medal, he did claim sixth, only .28 back of the co-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bonus to do this in America, in Vail, in front of a  
hometown crowd,'' Fleischer said. ``I made just a couple little 
mistakes and that's the three-tenths I'm out by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race more than made up for Monday's snowstorm that wiped out  
what was to have been the opening event of these championships, the 
women's super-G. That race was rescheduled for today.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt will not  
seek the presidency in 2000, avoiding a bitter primary fight 
against Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Several advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity Tuesday,  
said he planned to inform Gore in a private meeting this morning 
before making his decision public at an evening meeting of House 
Democrats, most of whom urged the Missouri lawmaker to remain in 
Congress and help eliminate the Republicans' paper-thin hold on the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take back the House, but it's going to take all of our  
attention and all of our money,'' said Democratic strategist Dane 
Strother. ``Now we don't have to worry about any of that being 
diverted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now Gore doesn't have to worry about Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	With his own fund-raising operation and network of allies,  
Gephardt stood as the greatest threat to the vice president's White 
House ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has got to be very good news for the Democratic Party and  
it's good news for us,'' said Gore strategist Bob Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's decision was not a surprise. He was less inclined to  
run for the White House after Democrats fared surprisingly well in 
the November elections and pulled to within six seats of regaining 
control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies of Gephardt, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
determined that winning back the House was as important to 
Democratic initiatives as retaining the White House. And he worried 
that a divisive primary would hurt the party's chances in both. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also realized he had a better shot at becoming speaker  
than president, several Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to be daunting for Gephardt to see Gore sitting in his  
way,'' Democratic consultant Dane Strother said. ``We've never not 
nominated a sitting vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has most of the advantages of an incumbent: He flies Air  
Force Two from coast to coast, meets with a network of activists 
and donors beholden to the White House and taps President Clinton's 
political operation at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore will not be unopposed. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, a Hall of Fame professional basketball player, is 
challenging Gore for the nomination. Sen. John Kerry of 
Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson are 
considering races. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats suggested Bradley could benefit by Gephardt's  
withdrawal if no other Democrat enters the race to split any 
anti-Gore votes. The vice president's advisers say the sentiment 
against Gore isn't strong enough to buoy Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, praised Gephardt.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could do practically any job in American he chose. If he  
chooses to stay in the House and seek to be speaker, I'll do 
everything I can to help him be speaker,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's spokesman said the senator will base his decision about  
a presidential run on a number of political and personal factors, 
including, in a small way, Gephardt's decision.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fighting for Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is directing an expansion of  
government efforts to combat the growing economic and environmental 
threat posed by the invasion of exotic foreign plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	These predatory species, such as the zebra mussel that first  
surfaced in the Great Lakes and the Asian long-horned beetle that 
attacked maple trees in Chicago and New York, have caused in many 
cases widespread economic and ecological harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the growing threat from non-native species, Clinton was  
signing an executive order today directing agencies to ``mobilize 
the federal government to defend against these aggressive predators 
and pests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order creates a new interagency Invasive Species Council  
that within 18 months is to develop a broad management plan to 
minimize the economic, ecological and human health impacts of these 
species and keep them from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposed budget, sent to Congress earlier in the  
week, also calls for spending an additional $29 million on 
combating invasive species and on research on restoring damaged 
ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	Exotic species -- from non-native fish to various plants, bugs  
and shellfish -- have found their way into the country in numerous 
ways, such as by clinging to ships, burrowing into wooden shipping 
crates, in food, aboard aircraft or in water discharged from 
foreign freighters. 
</P>
<P>
	These unwanted pests ``threaten to wreak major economic and  
environmental havoc'' unless they are brought under control or kept 
out of the country altogether, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman along with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and  
Commerce Secretary William Daley will chair the new council, White 
House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said the costs to habitat and the economy from such  
invaders ``are racing out of control'' as the non-native species in 
many cases overpower native species and alter regional ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists estimate that more than 6,000 plants and animals have  
been introduced into the United States from abroad by accident or 
misguided intentions. Many of these species enter the country in 
ballast water that is discharged from freighters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bay Delta area around San Francisco alone, there have  
been 234 non-native exotic species recorded, with a new species 
entering the bay every 14 days, says Linda Sheehan of the Center 
for Marine Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exotic species are wreaking havoc on our coastal ecosystems,''  
Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of West Coast environmentalists recently petitioned the  
Environmental Protection Agency to regulate ballast water 
discharges from ships, calling such discharges ``the single largest 
cause of exotic species invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no reply to the petition from the EPA.  
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere has the potential damage from invading species been more  
dramatically demonstrated than with the East Asian longhorned 
beetles. It made headlines by devouring thousands of maple trees 
that lined the streets of Chicago and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetle apparently had entered the country in wooden shipping  
crates from its native China. Beginning in mid-December, new 
regulations required such crates to be heated and chemically 
treated to kill the beetle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Great Lakes, the zebra mussel, which was believed to have  
entered the United States in ballast water aboard ships, has 
dramatically altered the ecosystem and spread as far away as 
Oklahoma since the mollusk was first reported in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from the zebra mussel has been put as high as $5 billion,  
officials said. It has clogged water supplies, power station intake 
pipes and caused problems for factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-native plants already have infested more than 100 million  
acres, causing problems for farmers and reducing agricultural 
yields, according to the Agriculture Department. One plant, the 
leafy spurge, which is native to Europe and Asia, has been blamed 
for widespread damage to grazing areas in Wyoming, Montana and the 
Dakotas.

<HEADLINE> Brother Honored for Saving Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. GEORGE, S.C. (AP) -- After waking to smoke and flames in  
their home last month, Annette and Richard Kitt roused the family 
and thought they had gotten everyone out safely. 
</P>
<P>
	But their son, 9-year-old Xavier Mason, realized his 11-year-old  
sister, Shanetta, was missing. Before his mother could stay stop, 
Xavier, who sleeps in his athletic shoes, had gone back into the 
house to rouse his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	For his act that saved his sister the night of Jan. 2, Xavier  
was honored Wednesday at a luncheon hosted by his school district. 
</P>
<P>
	``She loves me so much,'' said the third-grader from St. George  
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	The other family members living in the house -- Kitt's father and  
two of Xavier and Shanetta's siblings ages 8 and 15 -- escaped the 
house unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Report Selves to Pac-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Less than a month after leaving Colorado to take  
the coaching job at Washington for $1 million a season, Rick 
Neuheisel is in hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington assistant coaches were in four prospects' homes when  
they weren't supposed to be, in violation of NCAA rules, Neuheisel 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Huskies turned themselves in to the Pac-10 for  
having five of their assistant coaches visiting prospects Sunday, 
which is considered a quiet period during the football recruiting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, both the UW's compliance director and  
the new Colorado coach contend Neuheisel violated another NCAA rule 
when he telephoned some of his former Colorado players. His 
successor in Boulder, Gary Barnett, calls that tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know coach Neuheisel has called some of them in their homes  
and has tampered a little bit,'' Barnett told the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, categorically false,'' Neuheisel responded. ``What  
I did was say goodbye to some of my former athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had attempted to call Barnett Tuesday, but Barnett  
did not return his call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that no player was swayed in any manner on that  
particular day,'' Neuheisel said. ``But that will all be subject to 
NCAA interpretation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado wrote a letter of protest to the Huskies last Thursday  
and sent copies of it to the NCAA, the Pac-10 and the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	UW compliance director Ralph Bayard said Neuheisel needed  
Colorado's permission to talk to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayard said Colorado accused Neuheisel of trying to get many  
Buffaloes players to transfer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something we want to have happen,'' Bayard added.  
``We've worked very hard to make sure that our compliance program 
is working and it's functioning and our coaches and staff are 
adhering to the rules and regulations. But mistakes are made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huskies athletic director Barbara Hedges, who hired Neuheisel on  
Jan. 9, ``was upset, obviously,'' Bayard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he had not been aware that the Sunday visits were  
a rules violation. When a high school coach mentioned the problem 
Monday, Neuheisel said he talked to Hedges and Bayard, then called 
the Pac-10 headquarters to report the violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rule against the Sunday visits had been on the  
books since 1995, Neuheisel said he wasn't aware of it and it 
didn't come up before because he'd always finished his recruiting 
visits by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, we arrived late,'' Neuheisel said. ``Normally,  
our recruiting efforts are way done by this time and there isn't 
any need to be in anybody's home on that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mistake. I was unaware of the rule.''  
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said the Huskies visited kicker John Anderson, of  
Boyton Beach, Fla.; cornerback Chris Massey, of Moreno Valley, 
Calif.; cornerback Domynic Shaw, of Oakland, Calif., and safety 
Clayton Hawthorne, of Victoria, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm embarrassed by it,'' Neuheisel said. ``Unfortunately, this  
was an error. I take full responsibility for it and I hope to tell 
you that it will never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel expects a light slap on the wrist for the violation.  
The four players in question were immediately declared ineligible 
by UW officials, but the Huskies expect to get their eligibility 
back in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no official sanction other than maybe a letter  
of reprimand (from the Pac-10) for myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel left Colorado to become Washington's coach after Jim  
Lambright was fired. In Boulder, he was replaced by former 
Northwestern coach Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Washington was handed a two-year bowl ban for NCAA  
rules violations, leading to the retirement of Don James as coach 
and Lambright's elevation from defensive coordinator to head coach 
two weeks before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also were penalized 20 football scholarships.

<HEADLINE>  NBA's Clippers Face Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- How's this for typical Clippers luck: They  
win the NBA draft lottery a year after Tim Duncan turns 
professional, and he immediately becomes one of the league's best 
big men. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being regular participants in the lottery, the Clippers  
have missed out on such stars as Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, 
Kevin Garnett, Antoine Walker, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Allen Iverson, 
Keith Van Horn and Jason Kidd in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They selected Antonio McDyess second overall three years ago,  
only to trade him away and watch him become a star. 
</P>
<P>
	They took Michael Olowokandi with the first overall pick last  
summer, and he signed with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League two 
days before NBA players and owners agreed to a labor settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers can't win for losing. And mostly, they lose. That  
probably won't change much during the abbreviated season that 
begins Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to make the playoffs,'' said former NBA great  
Elgin Baylor, vice president of basketball operations for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers couldn't do much worse than last year. They went  
17-65 and missed the playoffs for the 19th time in 22 years. They 
haven't won a playoff series since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the season ended, coach Bill Fitch was fired with  
a four-year record of 99-229. The team waited until the lockout was 
settled before hiring former Boston and Milwaukee coach Chris Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers did catch a break on Jan. 25 when Kinder Bologna  
granted Olowokandi an early release from his contract. He joined 
the Clippers last weekend and hopes to be ready to contribute right 
away. However, missing training camp will be a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi completed his first full workout with the Clippers on  
Sunday -- five days before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's big, he's mobile, he looks like he's going to be a good  
addition to this club,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a first-round draft choice who averaged 11.5  
points and 4.2 rebounds as a rookie last season, missed several 
days of practice and both Clippers exhibition games because of a 
thigh injury. He returned the same day Olowokandi had his first 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intensity and physical toughness that both of those guys  
bring made a great impact,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, Taylor, Lorenzen Wright, Rodney Rogers, Lamond  
Murray and rookie Brian Skinner, another first-round draft choice, 
give the Clippers some talent and depth in the frontcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	The backcourt is a different story. Point guards Darrick Martin  
and Pooh Richardson, and shooting guards Eric Piatkowski and James 
Robinson don't figure to give the team nearly enough all-around 
ability for success. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Ford and his players are speaking  
enthusiastically. Of course, everyone starts a new season with a 
clean slate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attitude of the players is different,'' Martin said.  
``Hopefully, we can continue this atmosphere. We've got some guys 
who can play.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Force May Be Sent to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A NATO-led peacekeeping force could be needed  
in Kosovo for three to five years to enforce any peace accord and 
might include up to 4,000 American troops, the Clinton 
administration told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at a Senate hearing, and in private briefings with  
lawmakers, President Clinton's national security team sought to 
prepare Congress for the possibility of a second U.S. ground 
commitment in the Balkans. U.S. troops have been in Bosnia for the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton team encountered considerable skepticism.  
</P>
<P>
	The administration also shared with lawmakers a draft of a U.S.  
sponsored peace plan that would dramatically reduce Serbian control 
over Kosovo and give the province considerable self-government 
powers -- while allowing some continued Serbian military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also pledged to provide a series of  
``benchmarks'' to be used as a basis for extricating U.S. troops 
once they are introduced, congressional and administration sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels have agreed to participate in  
weekend peace talks demanded by the United States and NATO allies 
as pressure increased on Serbia's hard-line government to join the 
talks. NATO has threatened airstrikes if Serbia and the rebels 
aren't talking by Saturday and closing a peace deal by Feb. 19 
under talks organized by the United States and five European 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. ground presence could be crucial to any peace accord  
because Kosovo's Albanians ``would not feel confident of having a 
NATO force that doesn't have some representation by the United 
States,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel that we, in fact, by participating in some measure  
on the ground, would give them the confidence they would not be 
attacked by Serb forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen predicted a three- to five-year stay, if troops are  
introduced, but said the U.S. ground presence would be ``relatively 
small,'' and that Europeans should make up the bulk of the 
peacekeeping force. The United States would retain the lead 
responsibility for any airstrikes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the most detailed description yet of what such a force  
might look like, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, told the committee he envisioned an overall NATO presence 
of from 20,000 to 30,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our numbers could be very low, down maybe possibly as low as  
2,000 to 4,000,'' Shelton said. ``And I would see that being the 
maximum number that we would be asked to contribute, even if they 
decided to go in with 30,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton stressed that his figures were hypothetical because  
``the numbers are still being worked. The numbers that we would be 
asked to give would depend on what the final numbers are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had its work cut out for it in lobbying a  
Congress weary of the long entanglement in Bosnia and concerned 
about a decline in military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, said that the administration had wide support in 
Congress for airstrikes, if necessary, to force both sides to the 
bargaining table. But, he said, a U.S. ground presence was another 
issue -- one for which the administration would have to make a 
persuasive case if a peace plan is put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this juncture, there is a fork in the road,'' said Warner,  
who has advocated a U.S. ground presence for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security  
Adviser Sandy Berger later joined Cohen and Shelton to give a 
private briefing to senators on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	One crucial issue is whether the U.S. forces would be under U.S.  
or NATO command. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner proposed that U.S. ground contingent be placed under the  
command of a British commander, while the overall operation remain 
under a U.S. commander. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft of the peace plan shown to lawmakers would reduce the  
number of Serbian troops in the province from the current 25,000 to 
about 4,000, according to administration and congressional 
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The plan would 
grant the province significant powers of self-government while 
limiting the future Serbian presence mainly to that of a border 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin defended some  
continued Serb military presence in the province. ``The fact of the 
matter is that Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a 
country, Kosovo is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People might want to wish away the existence of Serbs,'' Rubin  
added. ``But there are Serbs there. And there have been 
provocations on both sides in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that any agreement leading to U.S. troops in Kosovo  
would have to be accepted by all the rival factions, including a 
commitment on the part of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
the Serbs. ``There must be a real agreement,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers expressed skepticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``As we have seen in Bosnia, we have been there for more than  
three years, and it wasn't just one deadline lapse -- it was 
three,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. ``We are now running up 
to $20 billion and going. And I don't think anybody really knows 
exactly when the end point will come.''

<HEADLINE> Land O' Lakes Milk Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) -- Single-serving cartons of Land  
O'Lakes 2 percent milk are being recalled because of possible 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler Mix Specialties Inc. announced the recall Tuesday of  
10-ounce cartons dated Feb. 10 and Feb. 11. The company said the 
milk could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, which can 
cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, 
frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant code of PLT 27-416 is printed on the top seal of the  
carton, along with the code date. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised not to drink the milk and to return it  
instead for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	The milk is distributed in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North  
Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Ducks Sleep Habits Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers say ducks are capable of what teachers and bosses  
have suspected of the rest of us -- sleeping with one eye open. 
</P>
<P>
	After putting their ducks in a row, and videotaping them,  
researchers found mallards on the end of each row spent more time 
asleep with one eye open, apparently looking for predators. 
</P>
<P>
	The more the ducks felt threatened, the more they slept with one  
eye open, said lead author Niels C. Rattenborg, a graduate student 
at Indiana State University, Terre Haute. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unique aspect is not that they do it, but that they  
control it,'' Rattenborg said. ``When they sleep at the edge of a 
group they tend to perceive greater risk, so they spend more time 
sleeping with one half of their brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ducks with one eye open were still awake enough to detect  
predators, said the authors of the study, which appears Thursday in 
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied four groups of four ducks held in plastic  
boxes, which were arranged in a row. Ducks on the end were found to 
sleep with one eye open 31.8 percent of the time, compared to 12.4 
percent of the time for ducks in the central position. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ducks in the center did not open one eye more than the  
other, while ducks on each end kept the eye facing away from the 
group open 86.2 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain wave readings of the ducks showed that the half of the  
brain receiving signals from the closed eye indicated that half of 
the brain was sleeping. Signals from the half of the brain 
receiving signals from the open eye showed a state between fully 
awake and asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Rattenborg said other animals, such as dolphins and other  
aquatic mammals show the ability to sleep with half their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts argue that those animals aren't really sleeping at  
times when their eye is open. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David F. Dinges, director of sleep and chronobiology studies  
at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said the 
findings are important, but should be duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to many people, how would you like to sleep one  
hemisphere at a time while the other half of the brain works, most 
would jump at it,'' Dinges said. ``But, we don't know the quality 
of the duck's consciousness. We don't know what the restorative 
potential of that sleep is.''

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Nick Nolte  

</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* Nick Nolte has the look of a ravished angel, and a set  
of gravely, husky vocal cords that seem to have been marinated in 
spirits, swaddled in cigarette smoke and frayed by impassioned 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Nolte was born in Omaha, Neb., on Feb. 8,  
1941. 
</P>
<P>
	He was virtually an unknown itinerant actor until he was 35,  
when he was cast in the 1976 TV miniseries ``Rich Man, Poor Man.'' 
He went on to star in such films as ``Who'll Stop the Rain,'' 
``North Dallas Forty,'' ``48HRS.'' with Eddie Murphy, ``Cape Fear'' 
and ``The Prince of Tides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Nolte decided to avoid big studio pictures in  
favor of more meaningful roles. Those parts include Col. Gordon 
Tall, a frenzied battalion commander in Terrence Malick's ``The 
Thin Red Line,'' and a small-town cop in the midst of a severe 
breakdown in ``Affliction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If a script grabs me, I do it. Working on a film should be a  
life-affirming experience,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Affliction,'' Nolte packed on 50 pounds to play a  
booze-bloated abusive father. He won best actor awards from the New 
York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics 
for the role. 
</P>
<P>
	His upcoming films include ``Simpatico'' with Albert Finney and  
``Breakfast of Champions'' opposite Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote: ``The biggest paydays I get now are $250,000, half a  
million. I used to make six or seven million dollars. But that was 
a terrible trap for me. I hated those experiences.''

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co.'s $1 billion global  
alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. restores 
Goodyear's place as the world's largest tire maker -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal that makes Goodyear a $15 billion business is expected  
to spur more consolidation in the $70 billion tire industry as 
rivals try to protect their profits in the face of excess capacity 
and cheap imports from Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Goodyear announced a new global cost-cutting drive  
that will result in the layoffs of up to 2,800 employees, many of 
them in Gadsden, Ala., where Goodyear will stop making tires at a 
plant that established the rubber industry in the South 70 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving Goodyear's decision to reduce its work force of 95,000  
by as much as 3 percent and to team up with Sumitomo, is a glut of 
tire production capacity. Today's radial tires last four times 
longer than the bias-ply treads of the 1960s, so people don't have 
to replace them as often. At the same time, new technology has made 
tire factories more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear's competitors, wrestling with the same issues, may also  
look for partners to help cut costs while expanding into new 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consolidation is where the industry is being driven,'' said  
Bruce Davis, special projects editor for Rubber and Plastics News 
and Tire Business, two trade publications. ``There are three or 
four candidates out there who could use a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most likely targets, Davis said, are Japan's Yokohama  
Rubber Co. Ltd., Toyo Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. Ltd., Italy's Pirelli SpA 
and Korea's Kumho Tire Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's leader, Japan's Bridgestone Corp., and No. 2  
Michelin SA of France, have dominated the industry for nearly a 
decade and could be in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	While consolidation and new technology should create better  
tires and healthier companies, the changes can be difficult for 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear said Wednesday it would lay off between 2,500 and 2,800  
employees in North America, Asia and Latin America in an effort to 
save up to $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear's plant in Gadsden, which is one of its oldest and most  
inefficient, will stop making tires at the end of this year, 
eliminating the jobs of at least 1,320 of the plant's 1,550 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	David Godfrey will likely be among them. Godfrey, 49, has spent  
22 years at the Gadsden plant, and had a heart attack last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't expect many places around here to hire a  
50-year-old whose had a heart attack,'' said his wife, Louise. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goodyear has to sharpen its competitive edge. The Akron,  
Ohio-based company reported Wednesday that tire sales grew less 
than 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weak emerging markets, volatile foreign currencies and brutal  
competitive actions impacted our results,'' said Samir G. Gibara, 
Goodyear's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibara is hoping Sumitomo will be the elixir to turn rubber into  
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the day's announcements, which included a  
report of earnings that met Wall Street expectations. Goodyear's 
stock rose 3.2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, where it 
gained $1.62 1/2 to close at $52. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear will invest $1 billion into the new global alliance  
with Sumitomo, and form six joint ventures that will give Goodyear 
control of Sumitomo's operations in the United States and Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear will also acquire 10 percent of Sumitomo's stock, worth  
about $88 million. Sumitomo will acquire the same dollar value of 
Goodyear's stock, or about 1 percent of Goodyear's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, currently the world's third-largest tire producer, and  
Sumitomo, No. 5, already have a manufacturing agreement. Sumitomo 
makes Goodyear-brand tires for Nippon Goodyear, and Goodyear 
supplies Dunlop-brand tires to Sumitomo's U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, based in Kobe, Japan, has annual sales of $4.7  
billion, but is saddled with about $2.8 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance is the best option for both of us to prosper,''  
said Naoto Saito, president of Sumitomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, Sumitomo and Goodyear will be able to better serve  
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The automobile industry is going global, and with their  
combined presence, Goodyear and Sumitomo will have a much larger 
footprint than any of the other tire companies,'' Goodyear's Gibara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a competing alliance between Goodyear's rivals could shift  
the balance of power before the Goodyear-Sumitomo partnership takes 
effect Sept. 1, pending approval of regulators at home and abroad 
and the boards of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the trade publications editor, said, ``I wouldn't be  
surprised to hear of a deal tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Enters New York Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in a week, a long-distance  
phone company has set it sights on cracking open local phone 
monopolies with promises of cheaper rates. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom said Wednesday it has begun offering local phone  
service across most of New York state, using lines leased from the 
Northeast regional monopoly, Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes just two days after long-distance rival  
AT&AMP;T Corp. joined forces with Time Warner Inc., expanding its plan 
to bypass phone monopolies around the country by sending calls over 
cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's developments could mark a new phase in a turf war  
between local and long-distance companies that began in 1996 after 
Congress passed legislation designed to enhance competition. That 
effort has largely failed and most consumers still have only one 
choice for local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Two consumer groups -- Consumers Union and the Consumer  
Federation of America -- reported Wednesday that local and 
long-distance rates have both remained about steady since the law 
was passed. Both groups had lobbied against the law. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's local service will be offered in the New York  
City area at a 5 percent discount to Bell Atlantic prices or in a 
flat-rate package of $14.99 for 100 calls, said spokesperson Elena 
French. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of New York City, there is no discount. A 100-call  
package would cost $19.99 a month. Because the population is less 
dense than in the city, Bell Atlantic is charging more to lease 
those lines, French said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic was quick to declare Wednesday that the  
arrangement proves that its market is open to competition -- a 
prerequisite for it to begin selling long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say this is a stamp of approval by MCI WorldCom on  
Bell Atlantic having opened up completely to (federal) standards,'' 
said Jim Freeze, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the telecommunications reform law was passed three  
years ago, long-distance operators still accuse the local 
monopolies, known as Baby Bells, of denying them easy access to 
their calling networks. For their part, the Baby Bells have 
bristled at a mountain of government requirements keeping them out 
of long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're now in the frustrating position of doing is meeting  
a whole series of tests and requirements, 600-to-700 pages ... 
proving that markets are open,'' said Bell Atlantic president James 
G. Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, the MCI WorldCom deal may enable Bell Atlantic  
to apply as soon as this spring for clearance to sell long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although much delayed, this is exactly what the  
telecommunications act contemplated three years ago, so I'm happy 
to get on with it,'' said Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast with MCI WorldCom's approach, AT&AMP;T has chosen to  
circumvent the traditional telephone infrastructure and use cable 
TV wires to offer local and long-distance calling and high-speed 
Internet connections.. 
</P>
<P>
	With Time Warner on board, AT&AMP;T is now pursuing its strategy  
with help from the two largest cable companies in the country. Last 
year AT&AMP;T agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc. The combination 
could eventually serve 40 percent of American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike MCI WorldCom's New York service, AT&AMP;T's local  
offerings aren't expected to begin for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., already offers local  
calling to business customers in more than 100 markets across the 
country, and offers limited local residential service in Illinois, 
Michigan and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Bell Atlantic actually marks the second foray into  
New York's local-calling market by MCI, which was acquired by 
WorldCom last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A different arrangement with Bell Atlantic in 1997 proved  
unprofitable and was scrapped after just a few months. The new 
relationship will allow MCI WorldCom to lease customer phone lines 
as needed rather than pay for access to the entire Bell Atlantic 
network in New York.

<HEADLINE> Mild Cervical Woes Found To Be Minor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A large study of Canadian women concluded that  
very few cases of mild cervical abnormalities detected by Pap 
smears progress to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 million women in the United States get a Pap smear every  
year, a simple test that can detect precancerous cell changes 
before they turn into cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paps detect mild abnormalities, called ``mild dysplasia,'' as  
well as severe lesions that are poised to become cancerous 
imminently. Regardless of the degree of dysplasia, women often are 
referred for more in-depth testing called colposcopy, or even a 
biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors have questioned how necessary the extra -- and  
expensive -- care is for women whose dysplasia is mild. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Toronto study published in this week's Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute concluded the risk of mild 
dysplasia progressing into more severe abnormalities or cancer was 
only 1 percent per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study should put to rest the widespread fear that women  
with mild dysplasia need immediate referral'' for in-depth care, 
instead of just monitoring with repeat Pap smears, University of 
Washington epidemiologist Cathy Critchlow concluded in an 
accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian study examined the records of almost 18,000 women  
diagnosed with dysplasia between 1970 and 1980, and tracked their 
health through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after the initial diagnosis, 29 percent of women with  
mild dysplasia were the same or had worsened. In contrast, women 
with moderate or severe dysplasia were 2.5 times to 4.2 times more 
likely to have progressed to worse dysplasia or cancer, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	During 10 years, over 60 percent of the women with mild  
dysplasia had their abnormal cells revert to normal, the study 
said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Loses Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- ``Wanted'' posters and a Web site listing  
names and addresses of ``baby butchers'' amount to illegal threats, 
and the anti-abortion activists who created them must pay $107 
million in damages, a federal jury says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury saw the posters for what they are -- a hit list for  
terrorists,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, 
which joined several abortion doctors and a clinic in suing the 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet within minutes of Tuesday's verdict, First Amendment experts  
said it went too far and defendants said they would appeal, calling 
it a threat to constitutionally protected political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really just a statement from the court that says, `Please  
shut up,''' said defendant Michael Bray. ``It's an obscene assault 
upon the right to free speech. It says that when an abortionist 
cries out that he feels frightened by the speech of others, that 
the speakers should shut their mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed under the U.S. racketeering statute and a  
1994 federal law that makes it illegal to incite violence against 
abortion doctors or their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike previous cases brought under the 1994 law, this one did  
not involve any physical confrontations or explicit threats. 
Because of that, the anti-abortion activists contended the Internet 
site and the posters were protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was a Web site called ``The Nuremberg Files'' that  
lists hundreds of abortion doctors accused of committing ``crimes 
against humanity'' and invites readers to send in doctors' 
addresses, license plate numbers and even the names of their 
children. When three doctors on the list were killed, their names 
were shown crossed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild West-style posters were handed out at rallies and in  
abortion doctors' neighborhoods, offering a $5,000 reward for 
information about a ``Deadly Dozen'' doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs now want an injunction shutting down the Web  
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of squelching free speech,'' said Dr.  
Elizabeth Newhall. ``Free speech is not in jeopardy. Women and 
their providers are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-week trial, doctors who performed abortions who  
were on the list testified that they lived in constant fear, used 
disguises, bodyguards and bulletproof vests, and instructed their 
children to crouch in the bathtub if they heard gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants maintained they were simply political protesters  
collecting data on doctors in hopes of one day putting them on 
trial like Nazi war criminals were at Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury took 4 1/2 days to reach its verdict, which consisted of  
$106.5 million in punitive damages and $500,000 in compensatory 
damages. As part of the tight security surrounding the case, the 
judge said the names of the eight jurors will never be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants emphasized the verdict would not alter their tactics,  
and said the huge jury verdict would have nothing more than 
symbolic impact because they have transferred their assets to make 
themselves ``judgment-proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal experts said the verdict is on shaky ground because  
U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones used a lesser standard than the 
Supreme Court, which said threats must be likely to cause 
``imminent lawless action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones told the jury that the posters and Web site should be  
considered threats if they can be taken as such by a ``reasonable 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Schwartz, a First Amendment expert at American University  
in Washington, said the verdict goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't really reached the stage in free speech that merely  
saying things without the likelihood that they'll be acted on soon 
amounts to a threat, a real threat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anti-abortion people have been saying these kinds of  
things for years. This talk that they're murderers, that they're 
mass murderers even, is protected speech. We're very solicitous of 
speech, even the speech we hate.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Cirrhosis Mortality Rate Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Surprisingly few drinkers in Wisconsin die  
from cirrhosis of the liver despite the state's comparatively high 
rate of alcohol consumption, a new medical report finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, known as the dairy state, ranks as one of the top  
five states in per capita consumption of alcohol. Yet its death 
rate from liver cirrhosis, a disease linked to drinking, is among 
the lowest, according to a report published today in the Wisconsin 
Medical Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it an ecologic fallacy,'' said Dr. Patrick Remington,  
one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ranks Wisconsin No. 1 in overall alcohol consumption,  
with 69 percent of adults surveyed indicating they drink alcohol. 
Wisconsin also ranks first in binge and chronic drinking, at 27 
percent, based on a survey that defined chronic drinking as having 
two or more drinks daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrhosis, which causes irreversible scarring of the liver,  
typically results from years of heavy drinking -- six to 12 drinks 
daily for men and four to eight drinks daily for women. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25,000 Americans died from cirrhosis between 1990 and  
1994, including about 350 people in Wisconsin, ranking the state 
43rd, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the  
University of Wisconsin medical school, said further study is 
warranted, especially given the large body of research implicating 
chronic heavy drinking as the primary risk factor for cirrhosis.

<P>
	He offered a simple hypothesis for the surprising results: The  
state's high percentage of drinkers means that alcohol consumption 
is distributed more evenly across the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin has a large number of people drinking alcohol ``but  
not a high number of people consuming at problem levels,'' 
Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that in the U.S. as a whole, 50 percent of alcohol is  
consumed by the 10 percent of heaviest drinkers, probably does not 
apply to Wisconsin,'' he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	While booze may not be killing as many people in Wisconsin as  
expected, drinking was a factor in 43 percent of the state's 721 
traffic fatalities in 1997, the state transportation department 
said. Nationally, the rate of deadly crashes involving alcohol was 
39 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Says He'll Win House Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging it was ``the worst kept secret  
in town,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt formally told fellow 
Democrats Wednesday he will forgo a 2000 run for president and 
focus on recapturing the House for his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've handed that gavel over for the last time,'' Gephardt told  
more than 200 House Democrats and aides at a raucous pep rally in a 
Capitol basement meeting room. ``When the 107th Congress convenes 
in January of 2001, I want to take that gavel back on your 
behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, the 58-year-old Missourian has presided at the  
opening of three successive Congresses that Republicans have 
controlled, giving the gavel to GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and 
Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	As supporters waved white-on-blue ``Speaker Gephardt'' signs,  
Gephardt called for Democratic unity for a Congress ``that reflects 
the hopes and dreams of the people rather than the unending 
drumbeat of a small minority bent on imposing their will on an 
entire nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt never mentioned in his 11-minute speech that he had  
considered seeking his party's presidential nomination next year, 
nor did he mention the front-runner for that post, Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned later by reporters, he said his prospects for winning  
that nomination or raising the millions of dollars needed had 
nothing to do with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made this a personal decision for what in my heart and my  
mind ... would make the best contribution I could make for public 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt supporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he  
decided that winning back the House was as important to Democratic 
initiatives as retaining the White House. Gephardt also believed he 
had a better chance to become speaker than president, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would endorse Gore -- with whom he had breakfast  
Wednesday -- Gephardt said, ``I haven't made any decision on any of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, campaigning in New Hampshire, refused to say  
whether Gephardt promised to endorse him or whether Gore requested 
his endorsement. ``I have pledged to do everything in my power to 
help Democrats win back the House and make Dick Gephardt speaker,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with him earlier Wednesday, President Clinton  
called Gephardt's decision ``the right thing for him and the House 
of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By not challenging Gore, Gephardt has avoided a bitter fight  
that could have divided and distracted Democrats next year. Though 
Gore is being challenged by former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey 
and could draw other opponents, Gephardt was considered to be his 
strongest rival for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	There still could be some skirmishes over the next two years  
between Gephardt and the White House. Gephardt has not been shy 
about opposing the president on trade issues. And should a 
legacy-minded Clinton seek to cut deals with Republicans on 
overhauling Social Security or other issues, he could run into 
opposition from Democratic lawmakers eager to deny the GOP such 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we disagree in the future, and I'm sure that will happen,  
I'll be saying what I believe,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also leaves Democrats with their best congressional  
fund-raiser and candidate recruiter focusing on House races next 
year, when control of the chamber will be in play. Republicans have 
a mere 221-211 House majority, plus one independent who leans 
Democratic and two vacant seats the GOP is likely to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a significant step closer to the majority by having him  
stay,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt raised as much as $14 million for himself and other  
Democratic congressional candidates in 1997 and 1998, and 
campaigned for 110 of them, according to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has helped congressional Democrats formulate a more  
moderate message in recent years, such as their decision to rally 
behind President Clinton's call last year to reserve federal 
surpluses until Social Security is overhauled. From liberals to 
conservatives, Democratic lawmakers say Gephardt is a leader they 
can trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick Gephardt is the glue that will hold this caucus  
together,'' said liberal Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Settles With Bowden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn officials are finished dealing  
with Terry Bowden. Now they'd like to get out of dealing with Bobby 
Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn athletic director David Housel said Wednesday the school  
is looking at alternatives to its Sept. 2 season opener against 
Florida State, a game originally billed as a father-son matchup. 
But now that Terry Bowden is no longer Auburn's coach, playing 
against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles doesn't seem so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not accurate to say we are trying to get out of it, but  
we are looking at all of the options that would be suitable for 
handling this situation,'' Housel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school reached a financial settlement with Terry Bowden on  
Monday, which bans the former Tigers coach and his wife from 
criticizing the school. Now Housel -- and new Auburn coach Tommy 
Tuberville -- want out of the Florida State game. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I don't want is for our players to have to rehash what  
has gone on over the last three months,'' Tuberville said. ``I 
would just hate for them to have to go through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting out of the game would be the final bit of Bowden  
business for Auburn, which has been trying for months to move past 
Terry Bowden's ugly midseason resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement closes the door on Terry Bowden's 5 1/2 seasons at  
Auburn. He gets a lump sum payment of $620,000, a lakeside home for 
five years and two cars the ex-coach had before he resigned Oct. 23 
after opening the season with a 1-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, he and his wife, Shyrl, agreed not to make  
``statements that could be construed as negative or derogatory 
toward Auburn, the Auburn athletics department or its employees or 
the Auburn Board of Trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was presented to us and I didn't have a problem with  
it,'' Terry Bowden told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``My 
wife and I are comfortable with the settlement and consider it the 
end of an ugly and disappointing situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bowdens' violate the agreement, they may be required to  
repay the $620,000, pay the $850,000 mortgage on the house, which 
is owned by the Auburn Alumni Association, and give back the cars, 
which he can keep for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said the gag order was ``strongly recommended'' by  
attorneys for both Bowden and the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally did not think it was that big of a deal,'' Housel  
said. ``But the attorneys thought it was a good idea so we included 
it. It was just a routine thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowdens' deal with the university took effect Monday, the  
same day Tuberville signed a contract with the school worth at 
least $770,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Auburn will try to help Tuberville avoid the game against  
his predecessor's father. The Mobile Register initially reported 
Wednesday that Auburn was trying to get out of the game at a cost 
to Auburn of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Register reported that a new opponent has been lined up for  
an Auburn home game on Sept. 4, and the school is working with 
ESPN, which owns the rights to the game, to find a replacement team 
to play FSU for the Thursday night telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Nagel, a spokesman for ESPN, said that was ``absolutely  
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is scheduled and we are taking no position to change  
this,'' Nagel said. ``We hope and expect the game to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden said if the game is canceled, FSU officials ``won't  
have had anything to do with getting out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe the red tape we had to go through to get  
this game,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``We went through a lot of 
extremes, changing our schedule and going through the conference.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Makes Fox Ratings Champ / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another lopsided Super Bowl kept the television  
ratings down, but the Fox network wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 127.5 million people watched at least one minute of  
Sunday's contest between Denver and Atlanta, Nielsen Media Research 
said Tuesday. As expected, the huge audience enabled Fox to easily 
capture the week's ratings crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The average audience for the full game of 83.7 million made it  
the second lowest-rated Super Bowl game since 1971. Only San 
Francisco's rout of Denver in 1990 had lower ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But one number was most important to Fox: more than $150 million  
in advertising revenue it earned during the game and its pre- and 
post-game shows. The network said it was the largest single day of 
revenue in television history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also convinced an estimated 22 million viewers to stay  
around after the game to watch a preview of its new animated 
series, ``Family Guy.'' The series begins airing regularly in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, Fox had a 13.2 rating and 21 audience share. CBS  
was second with an 8.0 rating and 13 share, NBC had a 7.5 rating 
and 12 share and ABC was fourth with a 6.8 and 11. The WB had a 3.2 
rating and 5 share among the developing networks, UPN had a 2.1 and 
3 and Pax TV had a 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB's Monday night family drama, ``7th Heaven,'' scored the  
highest rating of any program in the network's history last week. 
It beat its own record set last Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners for the week were CBS' initial airing of ``The  
Shawshank Redemption'' and NBC's new drama ``Providence,'' leading 
the network to its fourth straight win on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the losers: the movies ``Mr. Wrong'' on ABC and  
``Clueless'' on NBC. Critics' favorite ``Cupid,'' just canceled by 
ABC, was again the network's lowest rated program for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program with an 8.7 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' had 
an 8.5 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 7.9 
and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 25-31, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``Super Bowl XXXIII,'' Fox, 40.2; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' Fox,  
33.0; ``Super Bowl Pre Game,'' Fox, 32.5; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' 
Fox, 22.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 13.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.2; ``Family 
Guy,'' Fox, 12.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 12.5; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 11.8; 
``Simpsons,'' Fox, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Results From Impeachment Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from a CBS News/New York Times poll released  
Wednesday on President Clinton, impeachment and Congress. When 
results don't total 100 percent, the remainder didn't know or 
didn't respond: 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Senate is handling  
the impeachment trial? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 37 percent; disapprove, 56 percent. Just three weeks  
ago, 46 percent approved, 41 percent disapproved. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think Senate Republicans and Democrats are working  
together in a fair and nonpartisan matter, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, working together, 19 percent; no, not working together, 76  
percent. In November, 30 percent said the two sides were working 
together in the House Judiciary Committee, 59 percent not. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think Republicans in the Senate have mostly conducted an  
impartial trial to find out if any serious crimes occurred, or have 
mostly conducted a partisan trial to damage Bill Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Impartial, 28 percent; damage Clinton, 60 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the way the House and Senate Republicans have  
handled the impeachment matter has helped or hurt the public image 
of the Republican Party? 
</P>
<P>
	Helped, 17 percent; hurt, 66 percent; no effect, 5 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,058 adults was conducted Saturday through Monday  
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Are Rodman's Options Dwindling? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's options for the upcoming  
season appear to be diminishing by the day, with the Los Angeles 
Lakers perhaps the only team still interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Rodman, the NBA's top rebounder in each of the  
last seven seasons, wanted to play for the Orlando Magic, who are 
coached by Chuck Daly -- Rodman's coach in Detroit from 1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	But Magic general manager John Gabriel indicated Wednesday the  
chances of that happening are slim, mainly because Rodman has made 
it clear he wishes to receive special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on one phone call, this thing had a pulse a couple days  
ago,'' Gabriel said from Orlando, Fla. ``It's coming close to dying 
out here real fast as we get ready to start our season (Friday 
night against the New York Knicks). 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to meet with him. We respect him very much as a  
player, but there was process for this organization in regard to 
issues off the floor that we're going to stick to. If that process 
doesn't happen, this signing won't happen. We're going to stick to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat, both  
considered possibilities for Rodman, also said Wednesday it was 
extremely unlikely there would be an attempt to sign him at this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executive vice president Jerry West has expressed an  
interest in Rodman, but said he was uncertain whether Rodman would 
be interested in the Lakers, who can offer him a veteran minimum 
starting salary of $1 million under the new labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has played on five of the last 10 NBA championship  
teams -- including the last three with the Bulls -- recently 
mentioned the Lakers as one of the teams he was interested in 
joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal has pushed in recent days for the Lakers to  
sign Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team can use his physical ability,'' said first-year  
Lakers guard Derek Harper, who like Rodman is 37 years old and 
nearing the end of his playing career. ``The problem with Dennis is 
how he's going to conduct himself off the basketball court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West reportedly spoke Tuesday with one of Rodman's new agents,  
Steve Chasman, to see if there was interest on Rodman's part in 
playing for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasman has served as Rodman's talent agent for over a year and  
works for International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chasman is not a certified agent with the players'  
union, meaning he can't negotiate a contract for Rodman. Rodman is 
also represented by Andrew Reif and Richard Levy, and both are 
certified with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Marozas, a spokeswoman for ICM, said Wednesday there  
would be no comment on Rodman's plans at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley formerly represented Rodman, but ended his  
affiliation with him last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to talk about Rodman,'' Lakers spokesman John  
Black said Wednesday. ``It's a rumor. We're not answering questions 
concerning Rodman.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Hook Winning Recruiting Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Texas has waited a long time to start braggin' on its football  
team again, so pardon a few million Longhorns followers for 
celebrating in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hook 'em horns! Texas simply has the best group from top to  
bottom,'' Bobby Burton of the Austin, Texas-based The National 
Recruiting Advisor said Wednesday after he and two other national 
recruiting gurus declared the Longhorns winners of Recruiting Wars 
'99. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas coach Mack Brown brought in 28 players on national signing  
day, and the Longhorns' haul included USA Today's offensive and 
defensive players of the year, 11 players the newspaper ranked 
among the nation's best and four Parade All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Atop the list are quarterback Chris Simms, son of New York  
Giants quarterback Phil Simms, and linebacker Cory Redding, USA 
Today's top two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This class sends a message nationally that we're really  
serious about being a top program again,'' Brown said. ``It's a 
class that can jumpstart us back to where we want to be -- the elite 
of college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lemming of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Prep Football Report, said  
Texas had the top-rated class for the first time since he began his 
rankings 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a combination of a new coach, a Heisman Trophy winner  
in Ricky Williams and a winning season,'' Lemming said. ``They kept 
kids at home while going out and signing the nation's top talent. 
That's tough to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 218-pound Simms, from Franklin Lakes, N.J., made a  
verbal commitment to Tennessee, but changed his mind last week. 
Simms threw for 2,239 yards and 18 touchdowns in his senior season 
at Ramapo H.S., and is expected to challenge immediately for the 
backup spot behind Major Applewhite. 
</P>
<P>
	Redding, 6-5 and 240 pounds from North Shore H.S. near Houston,  
had 123 solo tackles, including 22 for losses, and 112 assists. He 
also caused six fumbles and recovered five. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Simms and Redding, the two other Parade  
All-Americans to go for Texas were Bo Sciafe, a 6-4, 225-pound wide 
receiver from Denver, and Alfio Randall, a 6-6, 270-pound offensive 
lineman from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shocker came at the expense of Notre Dame. C.J.  
Leak, a highly touted quarterback from Charlotte, N.C., chose Wake 
Forest over the Irish, who for months expected the 6-4, 210-pounder 
in the mold of Randall Cunningham to sign on with coach Bob Davie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, who did not sign a quarterback Wednesday, were still  
rated third by Burton and Lemming, but eighth by Allen Wallace of 
Laguna Beach, Calif.-based SuperPrep magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a stunner,'' said Wallace, who dropped the Irish from  
second to eighth after he heard the news. ``Nobody could have 
predicted Leak. He gave no indication he was going to Wake Forest. 
This was the biggest surprise of the day, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, though, signed a few standouts, including three USA  
Today All-Americans in defensive back Gerome Sapp from Houston, 
defensive lineman Cedric Hilliard from Arlington, Texas, and 
offensive lineman Jeff Faine from Sanford, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, with a haul that included USA Today All-American  
offensive lineman Bryce Bishop, defensive lineman Tim Anderson, 
defensive back Michael Doss and defensive back-wide receiver Kelton 
Lindsay, was ranked second by Burton and Wallace and fourth by 
Lemming. 
</P>
<P>
	National champion Tennessee was a three-time loser. First, they  
lost Simms; then Derek Watson, South Carolina's Mr. Football who 
also verbally committed to the Vols, changed his mind and signed 
with the Gamecocks; and finally Santonio Beard, a top-rated running 
back from Nashville, went for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was ranked eighth by Burton, but was not in the top  
10s of Lemming or Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia got the nod from Lemming as the second-best class. Among  
the Bulldogs' signees were wide receivers Michael Johnson from 
Tulsa, Okla., Reggie Brown of Carrollton, Ga., and Durrell Robinson 
of Duncan, S.C. Also, the Bulldogs signed running backs Bruce 
Thornton from LaGrange, Ga., and DeJuan Green from Jacksonville, 
Fla., the state's top tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most athletic class in the country,'' Lemming said of the  
Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also checking in with top-rated classes were Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA.  
Aggies coach R.C. Slocum, trying to keep pace with Brown and the 
Longhorns, did just fine. Texas A&AMP;M signed a bunch of top 
prospects, including defensive linemen Ty Warren of Bryan, Texas; 
Brian West of West Monroe, La.; linebacker Jason LeDoux of West 
Monroe, La.; and running back Joe Weber of San Bernardino, Calif., 
one of the top runners on the West coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Among UCLA's top recruits were five Parade All-Americans -- tight  
end Mike Seidman of Westlake, Calif., linebacker Marcus Reese of 
San Jose, Calif., quarterback J.P. Losman of Venice, Calif., and 
offensive linemen Bryce Bohlander of Salem, Ore., and Shane Lehmann 
of Corona, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, a mainstay among the top recruiting classes, was  
able to sign only a dozen players because 73 were already on 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Bobby Bowden's Seminoles made a splash by signing  
several highly rated stars, including quarterback Anquan Boldin of 
Pahokee, Fla. -- Wallace's No. 1-rated player -- USA Today 
All-American running back Nick Maddox of Kannapolis, N.C., 
defensive back Rufus Brown of El Paso, Texas; and Parade 
All-American defensive linemen Darnell Dockett of Burtonsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best 12 player group in the country,'' Wallace said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alabama had a nice haul, too. Among the top signees were Beard,  
wide receiver Antonio Carter of Tallahassee, Fla., and a pair of 
Parade All-Americans -- linebacker Saleem Rasheed of Birmingham, 
Ala., and defensive lineman Kenny King of Daphne, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the schools with surprisingly good classes were Boston  
College -- Parade All-American running back William Green picked the 
Eagles over Ohio State -- Illinois and South Carolina, even though 
new coach Lou Holtz got a late recruiting start. 
</P>
<P>
	``BC dominated the East, over Penn State,'' Lemming said. ``And  
under the circumstances, South Carolina did well, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, though, did not fare well as Rick Neuheisel left for  
Washington and Gary Barnett had a hard time winning recruits after 
coming over from Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies signed USA Today and Parade All-American running  
back Paul Arnold of Seattle to salvage their class, but the 
Buffaloes lost several players to other schools after Neuheisel's 
departure. 
</P>

	Also, Neuheisel said Wednesday that some of his assistants were  
in his prospects' homes on Sunday, a violation of NCAA rules since 
that day was considered a quiet period during the recruiting 
season. In addition, Barnett said Neuheisel violated another NCAA 
rule by calling former Colorado players, and he ``tampered a bit.''

<P>
	Other notable signings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Quarterback Eli Manning, brother of Peyton and son of Archie,  
signed with Mississippi, his father's alma mater. Manning, 6-4, 
200, will play for new coach David Cutcliffe, who was Peyton's 
mentor at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Running back Jarrett Payton, son of Chicago Bears' Hall of  
Famer Walter, signed with Miami. So did a pair of Parade 
All-Americans -- offensive linemen Vernon Carey and wide receiver 
Andre Johnson, both from Miami.

<HEADLINE> Bill Targets Sweepstakes Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sweepstakes that use deception to lure people  
into buying magazine subscriptions or other products by mail could 
be fined up to $2 million under legislation introduced Wednesday in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require sweepstakes mailings to clearly state  
that customers don't need to buy anything to enter, said the 
measure's sponsor, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Sweepstakes offers 
also would be required to accurately state the value of prizes 
offered, the odds of winning and the name of the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fines would range from $50,000 to $2 million, depending on the  
number of pieces of mail sent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen countless examples of mailings that deceptively  
promise extravagant prizes in order to entice consumers to make 
unnecessary purchases,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Wisconsin sued Publishers Clearing House last  
month, accusing it of using deceptive advertising to persuade 
consumers to buy magazines and merchandise and of illegally 
targeting the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Family Publishers agreed to pay Wisconsin  
and 24 other states $50,000 each to settle allegations of deceptive 
sweepstakes advertising.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Climate Watcher Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government advisory panel says it has  
concerns about the accuracy of data being used to fuel the intense 
debate over possible climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deficiencies in the accuracy, quality and continuity of the  
records ... place serious limitations on the confidence that can be 
placed in the research results,'' the National Research Council 
said in a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Climate change has become a hot topic with the growing concern  
that rising levels of certain chemicals in the atmosphere could 
trap additional heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature 
to rise. Scientists and politicians on both sides of the issue 
regularly trade jabs, citing various studies of temperature 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear we do not have a climate observing system ...  
This may be a shock to many people who assume that we do know 
adequately what's going on with the climate, but we don't,'' said 
Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo., who independently reviewed the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a weather observing system primarily now and the big  
swings in weather from day to day are easy to catch ... but for 
climate we are interested in more subtle changes from year to year, 
especially trends,'' Trenberth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Blackmon, a member of the committee that prepared the  
new study, noted that a few years ago the government began 
installing new weather recording systems at airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers soon began noticing what seemed like a climate  
change but turned out to be merely the instrument change, said 
Blackmon, also of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
</P>
<P>
	When instruments are changed without an overlap to compare their  
readings, differences in the devices may result in confusion, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was illustrated just last month when scientists at  
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and others at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that last 
year was the hottest on record -- but came up with different 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Data provided by NASA researchers indicated an average 1998  
worldwide temperature of 58.5 degrees Fahrenheit, while NOAA 
estimated it at 58.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike sciences where strict laboratory controls are the rule,  
climate researchers have to rely on observations collected in 
different countries and using differing instruments, Thomas R. 
Karl, chairman of the committee that prepared the report, noted in 
his forward. Karl heads the National Climatic Data Center in 
Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Adequate weather and climate records go back only a bit over a  
century in the United States and not much longer in other 
countries. During that period, instruments for measuring such 
things as temperature, humidity and wind have changed constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems even occur with the most modern observing machines,  
noted Trenberth. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council faulted the federal government for  
not coordinating climate studies and failing to have one agency 
organize the data and make sure information is consistent. The 
National Research Council is the research arm of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jesus Rios started working in the fields at  
age 8, dug ditches with his father after high school classes and 
graduated with a grade-point average above 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory McConnell Jr., grandson of a black law professor, also  
got high grades in high school, played varsity tennis and won a 
full-tuition scholarship to an East Coast college. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet both McConnell and Rios were denied admission last fall to  
the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	They joined five other high-achieving minorities Tuesday in a  
lawsuit accusing the university system's flagship campus of using 
discriminatory entrance policies that placed too much weight on 
test scores and advanced-placement courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an admissions process that grants preferences to the  
privileged,'' attorney Joseph Jaramillo of the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight given to the Scholastic Assessment Test, an  
examination of English and math fluency, and advanced-placement 
grades has a discriminatory effect on blacks, Hispanics and 
Filipinos, and lacks ``educational justification,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced-placement courses, worth an additional grade point in  
UC admissions ratings, are far more available in predominantly 
white high schools, Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of California's high schools, disproportionately  
in minority areas, offered no advanced-placement classes during the 
1997-98 academic year, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What advanced-placement and SAT scores don't show is talent  
and ability to succeed in college,'' said another of the 
plaintiffs, Justine Certeza, a freshman at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks court orders requiring Berkeley to admit the  
seven minority students and adopt an admissions policy that gives 
qualified blacks, Hispanics and Filipinos ``a fair and equal 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such policies are still possible despite California's ban on  
race and sex preferences in state and local government programs, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said the campus retains  
``a strong commitment to access and diversity'' despite ``a new set 
of legal limitations'' -- the UC Regents' ban on affirmative action 
in admissions, later broadened to all state and local government 
programs by Proposition 209. 
</P>
<P>
	When the regents' policy took effect for freshmen last fall,  
minority admissions dropped at all UC campuses, and particularly at 
Berkeley, the most prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley campus has reduced its reliance on test scores and  
``intensified our recruitment efforts'' for underrepresented 
minorities, Berdahl said.

<HEADLINE>  Separatists Protest in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Separatists rallied today in East Timor  
for a third consecutive day, as the Indonesian government blamed 
the pro-independence groups for recent unrest in the troubled 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 chanting protesters, buoyed by a surprise offer from  
Indonesia to consider independence for the former Portuguese 
colony, demanded that the Indonesian military withdraw troops at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
	They gathered at Santa Cruz cemetery in East Timor's seaside  
capital of Dili, where Indonesian troops fired on separatists in 
1991, killing dozens and drawing international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975 after the  
colonizers withdrew and annexed it a couple weeks later, unleashing 
separatist rebel fighting and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian officials have said the nation's highest legislative  
body may discuss independence for East Timor if its people reject 
an autonomy proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been progress in U.N.-sponsored talks between  
Indonesia and Portugal, which the United Nations still considers 
the administering power in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has invited Portuguese Foreign  
Minister Jaime Gama and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas for 
a new round of talks in New York on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas said anti-Indonesian East Timorese who have demanded a  
referendum on independence were largely responsible for recent 
violence in the troubled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the pro-referendum groups that have been very active and  
sometimes very aggressive in the last few weeks,'' Alatas told 
Associated Press Television News. ``We are trying to keep the 
situation under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of villagers had taken shelter in Suai, 50 miles  
southwest of Dili, after violence and threats between pro- and 
anti-independence groups. About 200 refugees who said they were 
harassed by pro-Indonesian gunmen were staying at the home of a 
pro-independence leader in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas denied accusations by pro-independence activists that the  
military had systematically armed East Timorese civilians who want 
their homeland to stay part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said civilian guards in East Timor had been given weapons to  
reinforce the police under a nationwide law enforcement program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police need some reinforcement to ensure law and order,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of pro-Indonesian East Timorese was expected to  
meet with government officials in Jakarta this week to argue 
against independence. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor was riven by internal conflict when Indonesia  
invaded, and many fear that old antagonisms will fuel more violence 
if Indonesia pulls out thousands of troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a time to use confrontation, physical confrontation,  
because then it will show that we are not a mature society,'' said 
Abilio Araujo, a former separatist leader who met with Alatas 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President B.J. Habibie outlined Indonesian policy on  
East Timor in a meeting with Stanley Roth, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an American issue, this is an Indonesian issue,''  
Roth said afterward.

<HEADLINE> Rolling Stone Magazine Being Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- D.A.R.E, an anti-drug program used in schools  
across the country, has sued Rolling Stone magazine for $50 
million, alleging it was libeled in an article written by a 
journalist who admitted making up part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 1998 article by freelance writer Stephen Glass said  
the Culver City-based program tried to ``silence critics, suppress 
scientific research and punish nonbelievers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D.A.R.E. has a separate $10 million libel complaint against  
Glass. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that Rolling Stone  
managing editor Robert Love requested a derogatory article about 
D.A.R.E. to further editor-publisher Jann Wenner's ``ongoing 
efforts to discredit anti-drug organizations.'' Love and Wenner 
also are named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking action against Rolling Stone to defend our  
reputation and recoup the damages incurred by these libels,'' said 
D.A.R.E president Glenn Levant. 
</P>
<P>
	Love countered that his magazine acted responsibly. ``We are  
confident that the magazine will be vindicated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this libel action as little more than an attempt to  
intimidate and discourage legitimate debate on the viability of the 
D.A.R.E program,'' Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glass was a writer for the New Republic when he confessed to  
making up stories for that magazine and others where he freelanced, 
including Rolling Stone. He was fired from the New Republic and is 
now a law student at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	D.A.R.E., or Drug Abuse Resistance Education, was founded by the  
Los Angeles Police Department in the 1980s during the tenure of 
former police chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, police officers visit elementary school  
classrooms to explain the dangers of drugs. In recent years, 
D.A.R.E. has expanded to include lessons on such topics as 
violence, cigarette smoking and date rape.

<HEADLINE> IOC Facing Membership Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Efforts to deal with the Olympics'  
worst corruption scandal were attacked from within for the first 
time Wednesday as rank-and-file members rebelled against changes in 
picking future host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	As its showcase conference on drugs in sports foundered through  
another day of bitter arguments and watered-down penalties for 
cheating, the IOC leadership faced a rare revolt over proposed 
reforms stemming from the Salt Lake bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in the history of the Olympic movement, the  
voice of the members is very, very loud,'' Italian IOC member Mario 
Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no call from within the exclusive club for the  
resignation of International Olympic Committee president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch, Pescante said change was needed and must come 
from the very top. ``The time of under-the-table decisions is 
finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The credibility of the IOC came under attack for a second  
straight day at the world anti-doping conference, with athletes and 
officials questioning its legitimacy in the wake of corruption 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Canada and indeed throughout the world, there is a high  
degree of cynicism, a high degree of skepticism and a high degree 
of mistrust in the IOC as an organization,'' Renn Crichlow, a 
former world champion kayaker from Canada, told the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference stumbled on two key issues: creation of a global  
anti-drug agency and imposition of uniform drug penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest challenge to Samaranch's eroding power came  
across town earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	At a breakfast meeting with IOC executive board officials,  
Pescante said an ``overwhelming majority'' of 42 members came out 
against plans to strip the general assembly of voting rights in the 
selection of the host city for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but  
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' Pescante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and the executive board announced Jan. 24 that the  
selection system would be changed as a result of the bribery 
scandals surrounding Salt Lake City's choice as host of the 2002 
Winter Games and other previous Olympic bids. 
</P>
<P>
	The board banned IOC member visits to the six 2006 candidates  
and proposed that the selection be made by a 15-member panel rather 
than the full assembly at a meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the vote away from the general assembly is a radical  
move. The primary duty of IOC members has always been to choose 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some hurt feelings that we were being classified in  
that group of guilty IOC members,'' said U.S. member Jim Easton. 
``It's like taking the candy away from the bad boy -- you won't get 
the vote any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is due to come up for a vote at an emergency IOC  
session March 17-18. A two-thirds vote of the 106 members is needed 
for adoption, and the reaction Wednesday showed those votes were 
not there. It is extremely rare for the full membership to go 
against leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible the general assembly will approve this  
proposal,'' Pescante said. ``I'm sure the executive board will have 
to find a new solution before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they lose at the session, it would be a disaster for the  
president and the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a counter proposal, Pescante and others said a small group of  
experts should narrow the field to two or three finalists 24 hours 
before the vote, then let the full assembly choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not unreasonable,'' Easton said. ``It's a system that  
makes some sense. If (the cutoff) was done very late in the game, 
there would be no chance for anyone to go out and abuse any 
privileges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six European cities bidding for the 2006 Games are:  
Helsinki, Finland; Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; 
Turin, Italy; Zakopane, Poland; and Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton said the members should be willing to accept some  
sacrifices as a ``public- relations exercise'' in the wake of the 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to pay some small penalties to restore confidence,  
we should do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said the members maintained full support of Samaranch,  
who will put his leadership to a vote of confidence at the March 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the only man to lead us out of the tunnel,'' Pescante  
said. ``But he must understand that the time of under-the-table 
decisions is finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executive board member Kevan Gosper of Australia reacted  
cautiously to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take a look at their view,'' he said. ``We don't want to  
ram something down the session's throat that they can't digest. 
We're not locked in. I'm not saying we'll change it. But we'll look 
at something if it represents appropriate reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the drug conference, the IOC ran into more trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials backed off on proposals for a fixed minimum two-year  
sanction for serious drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls from leading athletes for tougher sanctions across  
all sports, the conference moved to allow federations to impose 
shorter penalties in ``exceptional circumstances'' for fear of 
being overruled by civil courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of a $25 million international doping agency was  
held up by continued wrangling between governments and the IOC over 
who should control the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of the 15-member European Union, British  
Sports Minister Tony Banks rejected the proposal giving the IOC a 
leading role in the agency. Banks called for urgent consultations 
between both sides to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Vereen, deputy director of the White House drug control  
office, said: ``An independent organization is required -- and 
independence means just that, independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the agency will require linkage to the IOC, any control  
by the IOC would obviate the agency's independence and destroy its 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said the IOC was ready to give  
governments a 50-percent role in the agency -- and would expect the 
governments to contribute financially. 
</P>
<P>
	While the conference had been expected to finalize details of  
the project, Pound said he would be happy with a consensus on 
establishing the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton acknowledged the IOC's credibility will be further eroded  
unless concrete decisions are adopted in Thursday's final 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be tough if we don't come out of here with something  
pretty positive,'' he said. ``But we have to be careful we don't 
just jump to do something if it's not the right thing. If we make a 
mistake, it's hard to undo it.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Seek Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- For Kosovo's ethnic Albanians,  
agreeing in principle to a U.S. proposal for self-rule over the 
next three years is the easy part. The deal-breaker at peace talks 
in France may be what comes next. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of Kosovo's Albanians, independence from the Yugoslav  
republic of Serbia is the goal. At the peace talks, however, the 
ethnic Albanians will be alone in demanding independence. Besides 
Yugoslavia, the United States and the five other sponsoring powers 
oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	All members of the Balkan Contact Group -- the United States,  
Russia, France, Britain, Italy and Germany -- fear that an 
independent Kosovo state would set a dangerous precedent that could 
produce similar demands by ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, 
Montenegro and even Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakup Krasniqi, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, said  
Tuesday in central Kosovo that the guerrillas are ready to 
participate in the international peace conference scheduled to 
start Saturday in Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	Krasniqi said the rebels would bring their own ideas, including  
making Kosovo an international protectorate during a three-year 
interim period provided for in a U.S.-drafted peace formula. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Serbs and the Contact Group insist on ruling out  
independence, many analysts believe no ethnic Albanian leader could 
accept a resolution without being branded a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must leave the door open to independence,'' said ethnic  
Albanian Mahmut Bakali, former president of the Communist Party in 
Kosovo. ``I'm afraid the use of the word `autonomy' is a nebulous 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a U.S. formula, endorsed by the Contact Group as the basis  
for the France negotiations, Kosovo would be granted the sweeping 
self-rule that Milosevic withdrew in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	This would include control of internal police and  
internationally supervised elections for a Kosovo government. 
Because ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's 2 
million people, they would dominate the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years, the Serbs and the Kosovo government could  
review the agreement. The Serbs are likely to demand that the 
review not address total independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kosovo Albanians will insist that total independence  
remain an option, ideally in a referendum limited to voters in the 
province rather than all of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and European diplomats, anxious to resolve the conflict,  
have warned the KLA that they risk losing international support and 
goodwill if they refuse to attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ethnic Albanians, however, view such meetings with  
suspicion. To Kosovo's Albanians, their troubles started at a 
conference in London in 1913, when major powers gave the province 
to Serbia, whose troops had seized it the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	If the independence issue remains vague, however, the whole  
question -- with its dangerous implications for redrawing borders in 
the volatile southern Balkans -- could explode again. 
</P>
<P>
	Although none of the Contact Group members have openly said so,  
they clearly hope a period of autonomy will make the issue of 
independence less compelling to the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if the agenda is limited to autonomy, working out the  
details won't be easy. So much is at stake -- for the Albanians and 
for Serbs, who hold strong historical ties to the region -- that 
haggling out the details of ``self-rule'' could be enormously 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Much will depend on how much pressure the sponsors exert -- and  
on which party. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beverly Hills Mulls Fur Warning Tag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Furs sold in this chic city could  
soon come with a new label, though it won't be one from a trendy 
new designer. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters will decide whether to force merchants to tag fur items  
with labels stating that the animals may have been electrocuted, 
gassed, poisoned, clubbed, stomped or drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council voted Tuesday to hold a special election on May  
11 to let voters decide if they should adopt the nation's first law 
requiring such labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Fur-bearing items costing over $50 would be covered. Those in  
violation could be fined $100 per item. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Les Bronte said Wednesday he dislikes the $60,000 cost of  
the special election and worries about a ``pelt posse'' of police 
having to check tags in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card-sized warnings would read: ``Consumer notice:  
This product is made with fur from animals that may have been 
killed by electrocution, gassing, neck breaking, poisoning, 
clubbing, stomping or drowning and may have been trapped in 
steel-jaw leghold traps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the tag is misleading because it does not describe  
how the animals in a specific coat were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the waiter in the restaurant able to give you the  
information about what bait was used to catch the fish you're 
eating?'' asked Keith Kaplan, president of the Southern California 
Fur Association. ``That's an unreasonable burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Montgomery, campaign manager for Beverly Hills Consumers  
for Informed Choices, countered: ``We're saying that these are 
methods the fur industry uses and letting people decide if they 
want to support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery's group gathered more than 3,300 signatures,  
effectively forcing the council to place the measure on the ballot 
in this city of 33,000. Animal rights groups and celebrities 
including Jack Lemmon, Jay Leno, Vidal Sassoon, Pat Boone and Sid 
Caesar signed the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president of the Humane Society of  
the United States, said his group endorses the measure and has 
contributed $5,000 to its passage, with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Fur sales in Beverly Hills, everything from belts to full-length  
minks, total about $20 million a year, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group contends the industry tries to deceive buyers  
into thinking animals are killed by lethal injection or other 
painless means. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're afraid if people know the truth they won't buy the  
product,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, fur retailers said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a consumer asked, we certainly would tell them,'' said  
Douglas Fine, manager of Somper Furs. ``I've never been asked the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> Slain Gay Student's Parents Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- The parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay  
college student beaten to death last October, say they don't want 
his death used by activists to further any political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very frightening concept as a parent that your son now  
becomes a martyr, a public figure for the world,'' Judy Shepard 
told ``Dateline NBC'' for a story scheduled to air Friday. ``He's 
just our son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some gay advocacy groups have invoked Shepard's case in seeking  
harsher sentences for people convicted of crimes that involve bias 
against the victim. A move to pass hate crimes legislation in 
Wyoming was defeated Wednesday by a committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Shepard was found Oct. 7 beaten with a handgun  
and tied to a fence outside the University of Wyoming college town 
of Laramie, 40 miles west of Cheyenne. He died five days later in a 
Colorado hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he was chosen as a victim in part because he was  
gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanity Fair also reported in its March issue that Shepard tested  
HIV-positive at the Fort Collins, Colo., hospital where he died. 
The magazine said two men who fought with suspects Russell 
Henderson and Aaron McKinney following Shepard's attack may have 
come into contact with Shepard's blood and have been put on AIDS 
drugs. The article did not give a source. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany County Coroner Julie Heggie told The Associated Press  
that she had no information about whether Shepard was HIV-positive. 
``I know that's not in the autopsy report,'' Heggie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Poudre Valley Hospital did not return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard told Vanity Fair that her son had previously tested  
negative for the virus. The AP was unable Wednesday to contact the 
Shepards, who live in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents described their son as a sometimes naive young man  
who was often too trusting for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC and Vanity Fair stories revealed that Shepard had been  
attacked and raped in Morocco while he was on a high school trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney, both of Laramie, have been charged with  
murder and are awaiting trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death 
penalty against both. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anger really isn't there yet,'' Mrs. Shepard said. ``I am  
sure it will come. ... They've done something horrible to my life, 
to my son, to my family, and I don't want to waste any of my 
feelings on them. I'm saving it all for Matt.''

<HEADLINE> Layoffs at Bil Mar After Listeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZEELAND, Mich. (AP) -- Bil Mar Foods has laid off 241 employees,  
or 19 percent of its work force, because of problems associated 
with a listeria outbreak linked to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs were announced Tuesday as part of what the company  
says will be a year-long ``reconfiguration'' of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain of listeria bacteria traced back to the plant has  
been tied to 11 deaths and five miscarriages or still births, 
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reconfiguration is voluntary,'' Sara Lee spokeswoman  
Theresa Herlevsen said today. ``It's a technology issue ... we're 
always looking at the best processes for our plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant temporarily laid off part of its 1,275 work force in  
December both because of a voluntary recall of hot dogs and deli 
meats made there and a previously scheduled shutdown of some parts 
of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Herlevsen said today she did not know how many people were laid  
off in December, but said the cuts announced Tuesday make 241 of 
those layoffs permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Sara Lee officials had decided to move the plant's  
turkey boning and slaughtering operations to a facility in Storm 
Lake, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar voluntarily recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and  
other packaged meats following a federal investigation into an 
outbreak of listeria, which has now been found in 16 states.

<HEADLINE> After Hedge Fund Loses, 2 Jump Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Myron S. Scholes, one of the Nobel laureates who  
helped build Long-Term Capital Management LP, is leaving the hedge 
fund along with William Krasker, a veteran Wall Street risk-taker, 
marking the first well-known names to leave the firm since its 
near-collapse in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital Management lost more than $4 billion in a  
bizarre six-week financial panic after the Russian economic crisis 
flared last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to orchestrate a  
private bailout for fear that a failure of the hedge fund would 
spread to other funds that had made similar investments and lead to 
a collapse of world financial markets. A group of investment banks 
pitched in $3.6 billion in exchange for 90 percent ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, financial markets have rebounded sharply and the  
fund is on safer ground. But the scare has focused new attention on 
hedge funds -- the largely unregulated investment funds that can 
make risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholes, 57, will return to lecturing and writing at Stanford  
University's Graduate School of Business, where he is an emeritus 
professor of finance. He also will be a consultant to Long-Term 
Capital and keep his investment in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholes, who married in October, said he had planned to spend  
more time in California, where he owns a home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis that LTCM faced in August and September initially  
delayed the implementation of that plan, but has ultimately allowed 
me to relocate to California on a permanent basis,'' Scholes said 
in a statement. ``This move is possible now that LTCM's fund has 
stabilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scholes, and a fellow recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in  
Economic Sciences, Robert C. Merton, used financial models to help 
reduce the risk of these investments, but they couldn't predict the 
market's wild behavior when Russia defaulted on its international 
debt, and stock markets plunged around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid and unexpected losses at Long-Term Capital led many  
investors and onlookers to chastise those who put so much faith in 
the mathematical models of Scholes and Merton. 
</P>
<P>
	Krasker, 46, joined Long-Term Capital from Salomon Brothers,  
where he was a managing director and a member of the research team 
in the firm's arbitrage group. Prior to his Wall Street career, he 
was a professor at the Harvard School of Business. Krasker also 
plans to do consulting work for Long-Term Capital.

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Food Shortage Said Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Some North Koreans are getting more  
food after leader Kim Jong Il ordered an end to distribution 
delays, South Korea's intelligence agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food situation in some parts of North Korea shows signs of  
easing, with international relief food being distributed to 
ordinary people,'' the National Intelligence Service said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim issued a special directive in December ordering that food  
rations not be delayed for more than 12 days and that the usual 
twice-a-month food distribution schedule be kept, the service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The service said people living in at least two provinces  
bordering China -- North Pyongan and Jagang -- are now given more 
food regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	The service said it could not determine whether food shortages  
in other parts of North Korea were also easing. 
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence agency said North Korea had been distributing  
most donated food to government officials, soldiers and other 
members of the elite, but it began to expand the distribution to 
others following Kim's directive. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials based in Pyongyang, the North's capital, have  
consistently said they have no evidence of donated food being 
diverted to the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the improved distribution, the black-market price of  
rice in the two North Korean provinces fell to one-third of what it 
was during the worst period last year, the intelligence service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The service's statement was contrary to reports by U.N.  
officials working in North Korea to oversee distribution of 
international food aid. 
</P>
<P>
	David Morton, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in North Korea,  
told reporters in Beijing last week that famine will persist in the 
communist country if more is not done to revive its decrepit rural 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended the North's food aid distribution program, saying  
that U.N. monitors were confident that the aid was being given to 
people in most need. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has appealed for $376 million in 1999 to  
alleviate the food shortages and health problems resulting from 
prolonged malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years of bad weather, combined with decades of economic  
mismanagement, have caused the collapse of the farming system in 
North Korea, leaving its 22 million people largely dependent on 
foreign charity.

<HEADLINE> Feds Meet To Discuss Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers meeting today to  
determine whether interest rates should be changed are confronted 
with a rip-snorting, and possibly inflationary, economic expansion 
at home but still-fragile economies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	This world slump -- spreading to Brazil and elsewhere in Latin  
America -- poses enough of a threat to the U.S. economy and 
financial markets to keep the Fed's monetary policy panel from 
raising interest rates when it concludes a two-day, closed-door 
meeting today, most economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the surprisingly robust recent economic numbers --  
including record new home sales and the fastest overall rate of 
economic growth in 2 1/2 years in the October-December quarter -- would 
prompt the Federal Open Market Committee to raise interest rates to 
cool demand and head off the possibility of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem is that an increase in rates could touch off a  
sharp drop in the stock market. That, in turn, could quickly 
snowball into big trouble in the so-called real economy, where 
Americans earn their living and buy cars, homes, haircuts and 
cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that stock prices are driving consumer spending  
to an extent I don't think we have seen before,'' said economist 
Norman Robertson of Smithfield Trust Co. in Pittsburgh. ``And so 
the Fed is indeed over a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending by Americans not only is propelling the U.S. economy,  
it's fueling the export sales that are the one bright spot for much 
of the rest of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``That spending is very dependent on high stock prices and easy  
credit,'' said economist William A. Brown of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. 
``Were there to be a reverse in financial markets ... I think you'd 
be surprised at how quickly we could move from a world of 
surprising strength to a world of surprising weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe just such a reverse is entirely possible  
as waning world demand increasingly crimps the profits of American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, someday, the price of a share of stock has to be  
related to a company's earnings,'' said economist Carl R. 
Tannenbaum of LaSalle Banks in Chicago. ``And corporate earnings 
are really very flat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, for now, the U.S. stock market is holding its own. With its  
drop Tuesday of 72 points to 9,274, the Dow Jones industrial 
average is up 1 percent from the start of the year, on top of a 16 
percent gain last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It plunged nearly 20 percent in the weeks after Russia's ruble  
was devalued in August but swiftly recovered in October and 
November after the Fed cut the benchmark rate on overnight loans 
between banks three times, reducing it from 5.5 percent to 4.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last month that  
rescuing the market was not, and is not, the central bank's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is the maximum sustainable growth of the U.S.  
economy, not particular levels of asset prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Greenspan acknowledged that the stock market's  
impact on consumer spending has become ``real and significant.'' A 
severe drop in stock prices ``could lead to a considerable 
weakening of consumer demand,'' which accounts for two-thirds of 
the nation's economic activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The link between Wall Street and Main Street presents the Fed  
with a challenge, said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you let a little bit of air out of a bubble without  
collapsing it?'' Jones asks. ``That's Greenspan's dilemma. This may 
be his ultimate test as Fed chairman.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Still Mulling Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The leader of the state Democratic Party  
said Wednesday there is a 50-50 chance Hillary Rodham Clinton will 
enter New York's Senate race next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, state party Chairwoman Judith Hope was saying  
she did not believe Mrs. Clinton would run for the seat being 
vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and that the first 
lady had asked her several months ago not to encourage such 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you hear me saying something different,'' Hope said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The party leader said that after spending time with the first  
lady at a $10,000-a-person Democratic fund-raising event in New 
York City on Tuesday night ``it's my very strong impression that 
she has not ruled this out ... I'm sharing with you my impressions 
that she left with me and I think with others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My best guess is that it's 50-50,'' Hope said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hope refused to say if she had spoken directly to Mrs. Clinton  
or close aides to the first lady in recent days about the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a recent poll had Mrs. Clinton leading New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a theoretical Senate matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll conducted by Quinnipiac College's Polling Institute had  
Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of registered voters to 42 
percent for the Republican mayor with 6 percent undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has said he is considering a run.  
</P>
<P>
	Much of Mrs. Clinton's support came from women, who favored her  
over Giuliani 58 percent to 36 percent. Male voters preferred 
Giuliani 49 percent to 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 1,191 registered New York voters  
was conducted Jan. 26-Feb. 1 and has a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Ford Scrambles After Deadly Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- As investigators made their first  
cautious foray into Ford Motor Co.'s explosion-ravaged River Rouge 
plant, the automaker hoped to minimize the disaster's effect on its 
factories nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The damaged power plant, deemed structurally unsound, sat idle  
Tuesday as most of the complex's 10,000 workers were ordered to 
stay home a day after the blast that killed one worker and 
critically injured 15 more. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had limited access to the unsafe powerhouse. Over  
the next few days, unstable pieces of reinforced concrete will have 
to be demolished and one of its towering smokestacks will need to 
be reinforced to make the site safer, The Detroit News reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, a boiler inspector joined police and firefighters  
in visiting the plant, said Michigan Department of Consumer and 
Industry Services spokeswoman Maura Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The power station served six Ford factories: a Mustang assembly  
plant and parts factories that make such things as engines, doors, 
hoods and glass. If production doesn't resume quickly, work could 
be slowed at 16 of the No. 2 automaker's 20 North America assembly 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre River Rouge complex was once the world's largest  
auto plant. Henry Ford built it in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials weren't sure when production there would resume.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't tell you until we push the button and see if it  
works,'' River Rouge manager Art Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Production was consequently slowed Tuesday at a number of Ford  
plants across the country. Work hours were trimmed at assembly 
plants in Wayne, where Escorts are built; Wixom, where the Town Car 
and Lincoln Continental are built; Lorain, Ohio, where Ford 
Econoline vans are made; and St. Thomas, Ontario. All but the Wixom 
plant were to resume full production today. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime shifts were halted Tuesday at four other plants -- in  
Kansas City, Mo., Norfolk, Va., Oakville, Ontario, and St. Paul, 
Minn. -- that make Ford pickup trucks. Only the St. Paul plant was 
to resume overtime shifts today.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Bill Murray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nick the oily lounge singer would be dedicating  
a song to him, though not really meaning it. The name-dropping 
movie critic probably wouldn't have seen the movie, but would have 
something arch to say anyway. And the old ``Weekend Update'' gossip 
commentator would simply conclude: ``Get outta here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can just picture Bill Murray's various wiseacre characters  
from ``Saturday Night Live'' registering disbelief over Bill Murray 
the movie star getting raves as a serious actor. 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK. Murray's skeptical, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' he says. ``After all this time, all of a sudden  
I'm legit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that Murray hasn't tackled dramatic roles before. One  
attempt at a serious starring role came in ``The Razor's Edge,'' a 
1984 remake of a 1946 film starring Tyrone Power and based on the 
Somerset Maugham novel. But most critics hated it, and filmgoers 
stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, though, the 48-year-old actor is being singled out for his  
performance in the quirky coming-of-age comedy ``Rushmore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has been named best supporting actor by the Los Angeles and  
New York film critics as well as the National Society of Film 
Critics. He also received a Golden Globe nomination, and he's 
touted as a possible Academy Award candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	With a disheveled look and wild hair that make him a look like a  
younger Professor Irwin Corey, Murray says he doesn't quite know 
how to take all the plaudits. ``It sort of knocks you off kilter a 
little bit,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He admits that when the Golden Globe went to Ed Harris (for  
``The Truman Show'') he felt a little pouty, and demonstrates by 
comically protruding his lower lip like Charles Laughton in 
``Mutiny on the Bounty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did they even invite me?'' he says, going into a mock  
whine. ``I don't want their champagne. Who cares if I got a little 
box of chocolates to take home?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Anderson, the director and co-writer of ``Rushmore,'' says  
the role of self-made millionaire Herman Blume was written with 
Murray in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he'd be funny and real,'' he said in an interview.  
``And also there was a sort of this sadness about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blume stands as the embodiment of the old saying: Money can't  
buy happiness. He has an indifferent wife and two spoiled, 
cretinous sons at Rushmore, a private school. 
</P>
<P>
	Life brightens, though, when he takes on 15-year-old Max Fischer  
(played by Talia Shire's son, Jason Schwartzman) as a protege. Part 
of their bond comes from Blume's working-class background and the 
fact that Max is one of the few poor kids at the hoity-toity 
institution, but complications arise when Max and Blume both become 
smitten with the same first-grade teacher (Olivia Williams). 
</P>
<P>
	When Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson came to him and said  
he'd be playing a tycoon, Murray grimaced and said, ``Tycoon?!'' 
But then he rethought it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I think about it, I am sort of a tycoon. I've made  
money in my business, made more money than, you know, my neighbors 
... and really came from no money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray went to a school like Rushmore, where almost everyone  
else had money and cars, while he had to bum rides. The fifth of 
nine children growing up in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, he 
worked during summers as a caddy to pay his tuition. By the time 
their father, a lumber salesman, died in 1969, the older Murray 
children were on their own or paying their way through Catholic 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once that tuition was paid, that was it,'' Murray says,  
laughing. ``There wasn't any extra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the kids who had cars and money back then borrow money from  
him -- and he chortles gleefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really sweet,'' he says. ``I remember this one kid  
calling me and asking me to borrow money, and I just loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So that blue-collar chip on the shoulder is a great part of who  
he is -- as Murray's own son pointed out to him after Murray told 
him: ``If you grow up a spoiled rich kid, I will probably kill 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's friend and ``Ghostbusters'' co-star Harold Ramis once  
said that success didn't spoil Murray, but it did confuse and 
darken him. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's funny early films -- ``Meatballs'' (1979),  
``Caddyshack'' (1980), ``Stripes'' (1981), and ``Ghostbusters'' 
(1984) -- grossed more than a half-billion dollars. But then he kept 
a low profile for four years until he starred in ``Scrooged'' as a 
nasty TV executive in yet another retelling of Dickens' ``A 
Christmas Carol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, he scored with ``Mad Dog and Glory,'' playing a complex  
mobster who is in therapy and sees himself as a stand-up comedian, 
and ``Groundhog Day,'' as the cynical weatherman trapped in a time 
warp. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Murray has been memorable in smaller roles,  
notably ``Tootsie,'' ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' ``Ed Wood,'' even 
``Space Jam.'' Over the past decade, Murray made a few clinkers, 
such as ``Larger Than Life'' and ``The Man Who Knew Too Little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those bombs help explain why some have referred to his recent  
success as a comeback. But Murray shrugs off the word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been using that term for years anyway. `I'm back. I'm  
back now,''' he says, going into his patented lounge lizard voice. 
``How can it be my comeback? I never won anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for all the recent laurels aimed his way? They're ``more like  
a lifetime achievement award,'' he jokes.

<HEADLINE> Judge Troubled by Microsoft Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a second day of courtroom drama, the  
government pointed out new problems Wednesday with a video 
demonstration prepared by Microsoft Corp. in an attempt to support 
a central argument in its landmark antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson shook  
his head to admonish a senior Microsoft executive: ``I can't rely 
on it (the video). It's very troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over a four-minute segment, a government lawyer pointed to  
software icons that appeared -- then disappeared and reappeared -- on 
the screen of the computer purported to have been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly has not turned out as a good video  
demonstration,'' Microsoft senior vice president James Allchin 
conceded on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Justice Department lawyer David Boies,  
Allchin acknowledged that Microsoft had tested several computers, 
but edited together video segments so it appeared a single computer 
was being tested during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Boies said he didn't know whether the video flaw was  
intentional. ``The videotape is simply not reliable as evidence,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said outside court that it planned to recreate the  
demonstration overnight with government experts watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make very good software,'' said the company's lead in-house  
lawyer, William Neukom. ``We didn't make a very good tape. ... It's 
frankly our fault. We've got to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin had testified previously that his ``total trust in my  
team'' assured him that Microsoft's tests were performed using 
clean computers containing only Windows software with the 
government's modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	But the video showed telltale remnants of other programs, such  
as parts of Microsoft's Office business software. 
</P>
<P>
	In some frames, an icon for an Office program is visible on the  
computer screen; in others, it's missing. Later, it reappears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the impression given is, this is the same machine,''  
Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Allchin said. But he later acknowledged:  
``Yes, there were multiple machines involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, now you know there were multiple machines?'' Boies asked  
incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had believed that the demonstration would be an  
effective rebuttal of the government's claims that its Internet 
browser software could be easily removed from Windows 98. The video 
shows its browser running dramatically slower after the government 
tried to disable most Internet functions in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is central because the government alleges that  
Microsoft's design forces consumers who use Windows also to use its 
browser, discouraging use of rival software. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Boies stopped the video in midframe to first point  
out a discrepancy: the border showing the browser's name was 
different in one part of the video than in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies charged -- and Allchin agreed -- that the subtle change in  
the border, called the title bar, indicated that Microsoft's test 
actually used a version of Windows unaffected by the government's 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	But later Allchin testified that the demonstration appeared  
tainted simply because unrelated software from an online service 
was removed from the company's test computer, causing a subtle 
change in how the title looked. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's three computer experts -- two young men in their  
early 20s and their former college professor -- found the latest 
problems with Microsoft's video during the Wednesday lunch break, 
Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same team noticed the earlier discrepancy for the government  
the same weekend Microsoft made a copy available for them to 
preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Microsoft's explanation, the debacle caused the  
company serious problems in how its legal fight is perceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Gray, a California antitrust lawyer analyzing the case  
daily for the San Jose Mercury News, wrote: ``The last time the 
United States government inflicted this much punishment on a foe, 
the evening news was filled with aerial photography of bombed-out 
vehicles and burning Iraqi tanks on the highway leading out of 
Kuwait City.''

<HEADLINE> China To Test Securities Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China plans to test securities executives  
in April to improve ethics and standardize the industry, state 
media said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives with more than two years experience and no record of  
rule violations will be eligible, the Xinhua News Agency and the 
newspaper China Securities News said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exam is part of efforts to ``help the healthy and stable  
development of the stock market and to standardize it,'' Xinhua 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't say what would happen to those who fail, or whether  
the test would be required later for all industry participants. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is the latest of many measures taken by regulators to  
try to tame China's stock markets, which have been plagued by 
frequent cases of insider trading and other forms of market 
manipulation since they were established in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Faces House Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors, pushing for live testimony  
in the impeachment trial, began wrapping up their private 
questioning of witnesses today with White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. Separately, Senate Republicans were weighing a formal 
declaration that President Clinton gave false testimony to a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal's deposition today marks the last of three for the  
Republican prosecutors who hoped to bolster their case that 
witnesses should be questioned on the Senate floor. But senators 
who viewed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped deposition showed little 
enthusiasm for hearing her in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors who questioned presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan at the Capitol on Tuesday elicited some testimony they felt 
could help their case for live testimony, sources familiar with his 
deposition said. Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney who found 
Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York, altered his account of a breakfast 
meeting with the former White House intern that prosecutors have 
focused on, according to the sources, who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Blumenthal, his value in the Senate trial rests in his  
testimony about a conversation at the start of the Lewinsky scandal 
last year. The aide quoted Clinton as saying he had rebuffed Ms. 
Lewinsky after she ``came at me and made a sexual demand on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that  
she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it 
and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she 
wouldn't be the stalker anymore,'' Blumenthal told the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``stalker'' moniker swiftly became a news story staple,  
always attributed to unidentified sources. In grand jury testimony, 
Blumenthal denied having passed along the information to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers are trying to show that Clinton's motive was to  
feed a false account to his aides that would find its way into the 
investigation of prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Republicans looking to the end of the  
impeachment trial are weighing a formal declaration that Clinton 
``willfully provided false and misleading testimony'' to Starr's 
grand jury last summer, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are laboring over a draft ``fact-finding''  
document that says Clinton engaged in a course of conduct designed 
to ``alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of 
evidence and testimony'' in the sexual harassment lawsuit that 
Paula Jones filed against him, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the two forms of the proposal makes a finding that  
Clinton committed perjury or obstructed justice, as alleged in the 
articles of impeachment passed by the House. Republicans hope to 
attract the support of at least a few Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Olympia Snowe said  
today the final disposition of the case should include a Senate 
recognition that Clinton committed wrongdoing -- even though there 
are not enough votes to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Hatch said the  
best way would be for the Senate to adjourn the trial with a 
finding ``that says he did lie under oath and he did commit 
obstruction of justice. You don't accuse him of any criminal 
activity ... (but) recognize the House vote as the highest form of 
condemnation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe said most senators want a yes-or-no vote on the articles  
of impeachment. After that vote, she said, the Senate needs to 
recognize that Clinton committed wrongdoing and make that finding 
``part of the indelible record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont spoke dismissively of  
such Republican efforts beyond a straight yes-or-no vote on 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have more exit strategies than they have votes,'' Leahy  
said outside the room where Blumenthal was questioned today. ``We 
should make every senator actually stand up and say how they are 
going to vote on the articles of impeachment. ... This cockamamie 
idea of finding of fact or some other thing makes no sense at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition, Jordan gave ground on testimony from a year  
ago that he never had breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky, who said the 
meal was memorable because she understood Jordan to be suggesting 
she should destroy drafts of notes she'd written to Clinton. 
Confronted with a receipt for the breakfast, Jordan conceded to 
House prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., that the breakfast 
occurred, but remained adamant he never instructed or suggested 
that Ms. Lewinsky destroy any love letters, said sources familiar 
with his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also said for the first time that the former intern  
called him to discuss her affidavit denying a sexual relationship 
with the president. Jordan said he listened to Ms. Lewinsky and 
suggested she talk to her private attorney but asserted he had no 
reason to believe the affidavit was false because he never believed 
she had a sexual relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan asserted that Clinton was behind his efforts to find Ms.  
Lewinsky a job but that the effort was never designed to buy her 
silence, sources familiar with the testimony said. In the initial 
days of the scandal a year ago, Jordan said it was presidential 
secretary Betty Currie who asked him to initiate the job search.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An Air Force F-16 flown by a student pilot  
crashed Wednesday during a surface attack training mission. The 
pilot ejected safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was the only one aboard the $20 million jet, was

<P>
	At least one other pilot, an instructor, was in the air at the  
time, but the number of planes participating in the maneuver was

	Senior Airman Eric Petosky, another Luke spokesman, said the jet  
went down shortly before 10 a.m. over the Barry M. Goldwater range, 
just east of Yuma in southwest Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's crash was the fourth of an F-16 since October. None  
of the crashes have been fatal.

<HEADLINE> Settlement OK'd in Delta Miles Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After 10 years of litigation, a judge has  
approved the settlement of a class-action lawsuit that accused 
Delta Air Lines Inc. of violating its frequent-flier program. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will allow certain members of Delta's  
frequent-flier program to receive a package of benefits based on 
the number of miles accumulated before July 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify, frequent fliers would have to have built up at least  
40,000 frequent-flier miles, Delta spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1988 after Delta placed restrictions on  
frequent mile usage and seat availability without informing 
frequent fliers of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a breach of contract,'' said attorney Gil Gordon, who  
represented the Delta passengers who filed the lawsuit. ``They 
can't retroactively change the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, qualifying members can receive double  
frequent-flier miles for every Delta domestic flight for a year, 
discounts of up to $150 per flight or relaxed restrictions on the 
number of frequent-flier mile users on a particular flight, 
Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials estimate 580,000 Delta customers could benefit  
from the settlement, which was reached in September and given final 
approval late Monday by Cook County Circuit Judge Judith Cohen. Its 
cost was placed at between $11 million and $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta, the nation's third-largest air carrier,  
already has sent a notice to eligible customers. They have until 
March 18 to return their proofs of claim, Moussouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said it took 10 years to settle the lawsuit because Fort  
Worth, Texas-based American Airlines is contesting a lawsuit 
involving the same issues raised against Delta. American, the 
nation's second-largest air carrier, contends the Federal Aviation 
Administration gives it the right to set prices and put conditions 
on tickets, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is representing a group of American passengers in a  
class-action lawsuit contesting the airline's decision to raise the 
frequent flier mileage for a free ticket from 20,000 miles to 
25,000 miles.

<HEADLINE> MLB May Move Series to Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Puerto Rico could be the next international  
frontier for major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-game series between the Chicago White Sox and Texas  
Rangers in May might be moved to San Juan, according to officials 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	No final decision has been made, the officials said, adding  
there is a 50-50 chance the series will be moved. It currently is 
scheduled for May 10-12 at Comiskey Park in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, baseball is opening the season outside the  
United States and Canada. The NL champion San Diego Padres moved 
their home opener on April 4 to Monterrey, Mexico, where the Padres 
met the New York Mets two years ago in the first regular season 
games ever played outside the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, baseball is considering a proposal to have the  
Seattle Mariners open the 2000 season in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	AL Most Valuable Player Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez, among  
the top Puerto Ricans in the major leagues, make the Rangers the 
focal point for any games in Puerto Rico, the baseball officials 
said, speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Texas had the fourth-highest attendance average in the  
AL last year, 36,141, making the Rangers reluctant to give up any 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had the third-lowest attendance in the AL, averaging  
17,609. As part of any agreement, the White Sox would be 
compensated for the lost home games, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, the executive director of baseball operations in  
the commissioner's officer, said there's a possibility of playing 
in Puerto Rico, but declined to identify the teams involved. 
Others, however, confirmed the Rangers-White Sox series was the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't contacted me at all,'' White Sox general manager  
Ron Schueler said. ``We haven't heard anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers general manager Doug Melvin did not return a telephone  
call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Study: Races Find Common TV Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The great divide between black and white  
television viewers appears to be narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study suggests there is more common ground in what each  
race watches because TV networks are doing a better job putting 
together multiethnic casts and some networks are less actively 
seeking to appeal specifically to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last three months of 1998, six shows ranked among the  
20 most-watched series in both black and white homes, according to 
the study by TN Media, an advertising buying firm. They were 
``ER,'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``Monday Night Football,'' ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The CBS Sunday Movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the two races had only ``Monday Night Football''  
in common as a favorite show. 
</P>
<P>
	The three entertainment series on the recent list have  
multiethnic casts, which is becoming a more frequent practice, said 
Stacey Lynn, vice president of broadcast research at TN Media. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger networks that tried to establish themselves by appealing  
to a black audience -- Fox, the WB and UPN -- have recently broadened 
their appeal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is now the top-rated network among both blacks and whites  
after several years in which Fox had the largest claim on the black 
audience, the study said. CBS's ratings are remarkably similar for 
both races. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be because CBS's shows appeal to an older audience and  
many of the black-oriented programs on other networks are aimed at 
young people, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point there is a lot of common ground and age is one  
of those things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still significant differences. ``The Steve Harvey  
Show,'' the WB's Thursday night comedy, is the most popular show 
among blacks. Few whites watch it, though: last week it ranked 
101st on the Nielsen Media Research list of 132 prime-time 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB and UPN still have significantly higher ratings among  
blacks. So far, the WB is doing a much better job than its rival in 
broadening its audience without alienating blacks, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is having the most difficult time attracting a black  
audience. NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said last month 
the network needed to do a better job reflecting the country's 
diversity instead of concentrating on wealthy, white city-dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Black households watch an average of 70 hours of television each  
week and white households watch 50 hours, the study said. The gap 
has steadily shrunk over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> AMA, Editor Resolve Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former editor of the Journal of the American  
Medical Association -- fired because he published a sex poll that 
coincided with President Clinton's impeachment trial -- reached an 
agreement with the AMA that allows him to contribute articles to 
the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA and Dr. George D. Lundberg issued a statement Wednesday,  
saying they resolved ``substantive differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It did not elaborate on the agreement, and the AMA would not  
release any other information. Lundberg and his attorney did not 
return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Lundberg ``intends to devote the same effort,  
skill and determination that he brought to JAMA for nearly two 
decades to critical medical and health issues, as well as 
contributing to scientific medical research and journalism, 
including JAMA, subject to editorial discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg was fired Jan. 15 by AMA President E. Ratcliffe  
Anderson Jr. after publishing a survey regarding students' 
attitudes toward sex. Ratcliffe said it inappropriately interjected 
the organization into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed 59 percent of college students questioned in  
1991 didn't consider oral-genital contact as having ``had sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firing prompted an outcry from editors of other medical  
journals and others in the medical profession who said it damaged 
the journal's credibility and editorial independence.

<HEADLINE> 'Steel City' Is Heavy Metal Tap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A steel plant hardly seems to be an appropriate  
backdrop for a tap show. 
</P>
<P>
	But when you hear the bang of scaffolding combined with 14 pairs  
of stomping steel heels in ``Steel City,'' the heavy metalization 
of tap makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steel City'' is a noisy, dazzling spectacle. It features 10  
men and four women who use forklifts and old cars as their tap 
floor and jackhammers as their partners, with a live rock band 
blaring from above. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really energetic, very energetic -- it's something you  
have to see. You'll either love it or hate it,'' said choreographer 
Dein Perry, who introduced audiences to his Aussie brand of 
industrial tap with the hit show ``Tap Dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Steel City'' made its American debut at Radio City Music Hall  
last month, before beginning a 40-city North American tour. The 
tour includes stops in Las Vegas, Toronto and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry's tap show is attracting a new generation with its young,  
energetic cast and music by Tim Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Steel City'' is not the slap-happy dancing popularized in  
such Broadway musicals as ``42nd Street'' or the Ruby Keeler 
revival of ``No, No, Nanette.'' Nor is it the jazzier steps that 
tap wizard Savion Glover celebrated in ``Bring in 'da Noise, Bring 
in 'da Funk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You could call it ``testosterone tap.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from an industrial background. I'm like a heavy  
machinist,'' said Perry, 38, a native of Newcastle, Australia. ``I 
just sort of figured that it would be good to use actual real 
things and ... put them in tap dance and put it along with rock 'n' 
roll music as well. It makes for a whole different picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry began tap when he was 6 but stopped taking lessons when he  
was 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, ``I was watching Gregory Hines on television one  
day, and it just inspired me so much, with his tap dancing and his 
feet, it just got me hooked again,'' he said. ``I was missing it 
because it was something that was trained into me and drummed into 
me as a kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``there's no actual tap dance companies in Australia,  
only what we get to see from American television really,'' Perry 
began performing tap in his native country. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers in ``Steel City,'' wearing hard hats and  
bluejeans, stomp their feet furiously while banging on lockers, 
cars and other metal props strewn about the crowded stage. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the show seems as much of a daredevil act as a dance  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty rigorous,'' said cast member Melissa Gibson, 23.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty mentally demanding, too, because there's lots of  
equipment and everything onstage, so you've really got to be aware 
and always on the ball,'' she said. ``It's kind of a dangerous 
show, there's always an element of danger. We drive forklifts in 
the show, so the girls had to go and get their forklift license, so 
that was fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One highlight features dancers tapping inside crates hoisted  
into the air by forklifts. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, the dancers descend from above the stage on  
ropes. Then, in midair, they dance sideways against the mesh 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry will not be along for the ``Steel City'' tour. He will be  
back home in Australia with his wife and 14-month-old son, working 
on a film about dance in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not good now for me,'' he said, noticeably weary after  
his plane trip from Australia. ``I've been doing it for five years, 
but I've had enough. I'm basically going to perform here at Radio 
City and set it up for touring and send it on its way.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Fete Aaron at Gala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hank Aaron, who became baseball's career home run  
king 25 years ago, says today's astronomical salaries may keep his 
record from being broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a luncheon Wednesday, Aaron was asked if he thought  
his record would be eclipsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a possibility, but I don't think so,'' he replied. ``Not  
because I don't think that players have the ability, but I think 
it's the longevity of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other political and sports leaders are to  
honor Aaron at a gala Friday night that will celebrate Aaron's 65th 
birthday, begin baseball's commemoration of the 25th anniversary of 
his 715th homer and raise funds for the Chasing the Dream 
Foundation he and wife Billye started to provide grants to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who totaled 755 homers over 23 years, said his highest  
salary was $225,000 -- just $25,000 more than the current minimum. 
Stars making millions every season aren't as likely to play so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players today are going to make so much money that they  
don't need to keep playing. It was a long time before I even made 
$50,000,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one in particular with an excellent chance would be  
Ken Griffey Jr. He's young, he's had some great years and in a 
couple years he's probably going to sign one of the biggest 
contracts of all time. And so, whether he's going to keep focused 
on how high his ability can carry him is something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, already has 350 homers. Aaron, who never made a run  
at the single-season record, said more seasons like last -- in which 
Mark McGwire hit 70 and Sammy Sosa 66 -- could make his record 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, if they keep hitting home runs the way they hit  
them last year -- 50, 60, 70 -- you know they could catch the record 
pretty quick,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing eras, he said today's players work more with weights  
and are generally stronger, but that starting pitching and overall 
level of competition was higher in his first decades of play. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't quibble with those who proclaimed the 1998 Yankees  
the best team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be very honest, that Yankee team last year was very  
scary,'' he said. ``That team is about as good as you're going to 
put together. I think it was good enough to beat anybody, really.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Decry Story on Chelsea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife said Wednesday  
they were ``profoundly saddened'' by a decision by People 
magazine's editors to feature a story about their daughter, 
Chelsea, on its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``For over six years, the media has understood and respected the  
unique situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spotlight 
focused on her parents,'' the Clintons said in a prepared 
statement. ``We have been very grateful for the media's restraint 
in allowing Chelsea the privacy that any young person needs and 
deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons said People chose to run the story ``despite  
personal appeals with respect to her privacy and her security from 
her parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine is scheduled to go on the street Friday with a  
cover photo of Chelsea with her mother and the headline: ``Hillary 
&AMP; Chelsea -- Grace Under Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People bills the eight-page story inside as ``an intimate look  
at the deep bond of love that sustains the Clinton women through 
their painful family ordeal'' in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and 
the impeachment of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great deal of admiration for this mother-daughter  
relationship,'' People's managing editor, Carol Wallace, said in 
response to the White House statement. ``Chelsea is nearly 19 years 
old and a poised young adult. We feel that because she is an 
eyewitness to the family drama and historical events unfolding 
around her she is a valid journalistic subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People magazine spokeswoman Dianne Jones, reached at her home  
late Wednesday, could not immediately comment on the article or on 
the protest from the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said they didn't believe there were any  
startling revelations in the magazine's upcoming issue, but that 
the Clintons were chagrined to see their daughter, who will turn 19 
on Feb. 27, the subject of a cover story. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Clintons found fault  
with ``more the concept than the detail'' of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The media tended to take a hands-off approach toward Chelsea  
while she was a high school student, but her move to Stanford 
University in 1997 generated a spate of news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, administration officials said the upcoming issue  
of People crossed a line: ``There's never been a cover story on 
Chelsea,'' said Marsha Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said the Clinton's statement was not intended to dispute  
any particular facet of the article. ``It's just that it exists at 
all,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their statement, the Clintons said ``we deeply regret and are  
profoundly saddened by the decision of People.'' The also said they 
hoped that ``the media will continue its policy of restraint with 
respect to our daughter.''

<HEADLINE> Daughter Defends Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Glenn Hoddle broke down and cried after learning  
his 13-year-old daughter sent a letter pleading for him to remain 
coach of England's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so very proud of her,'' Hoddle was quoted as saying. ``I  
had managed to hold myself together through all this but that was 
the last straw. Someone told me Zara had written this note and I 
just started to cry. Today was one of the saddest days of my life 
but Zara's support helped me through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle, who reportedly will receive $835,000 for the final 18  
months of his contract, was fired as England's coach Tuesday. The 
move came three days after The Times of London quoted him as saying 
disabled people are being punished for ``the sins of a past life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid widespread condemnation, Hoddle insists his words were  
misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, pleading for The Football Association not to fire  
him, sent a letter to the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this situation is the most pathetic reason for someone  
to maybe lose their job and to have so much hassle over,'' she 
wrote. ``If you would take time to listen to what his explanation 
is, then maybe you would understand it a bit more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Hoddle gone, Howard Wilkinson, the FA's director of  
football, will coach England against World Cup champion France next 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson has been mentioned as a permanent replacement along  
with Terry Venables, whom Hoddle replaced; David Platt, who just 
left Sampdoria of Genoa after seven weeks as coach; former 
Switzerland coach Roy Hodgson; Aston Villa coach John Gregory; 
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger; and Newcastle coach Ruud Gullit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head is spinning. I can't see the pace stopping,''  
Wilkinson said. ``Until we've got Wednesday's game out of the way 
not much else will occupy my thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's a fact of life that we managers have to  
live in a goldfish bowl. We might not like it but we have to deal 
with it. I don't think it's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	England has churned through several coaches in the 1990s -- Bobby  
Robson, Graham Taylor, Terry Venables and Hoddle -- each having to 
deal with the pressure for success on the field and the intense 
media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters is the chaos within the FA. Chief executive  
Graham Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman resigned in the wake of a 
bribes-for-votes scandal in which they arranged a $5 million grant 
to Wales' FA, reportedly to gain a vote for Wiseman in an 
international election.

<HEADLINE> Wrongful Death Suit Filed Over Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZEELAND, Mich. (AP) -- A lawyer has raised allegations about  
unclean conditions at Bil Mar Food's plant in this western Michigan 
community in a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of a 
Tennessee woman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted meat from the Bil Mar plant has been linked to 12  
deaths, three miscarriages and 79 illnesses in 16 states, according 
to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., on Dec. 22  
recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other packaged meat 
products sold under a variety of names. It said they could be 
tainted with listeria bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Chicago lawyer Kenneth Moll filed the suit -- his  
second -- saying he interviewed former Bil Mar employees who talked 
about unsanitary conditions at the plant and faulty cooking 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen declined to comment on  
the allegations about unclean conditions. ``It would be difficult 
for me to comment on what he heard from some former employees,'' 
she said. Ms. Herlevsen said Sara Lee is aggressive about good 
sanitation practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Chicago accuses the company of  
negligence in the death of Helen Bodnar, a 74-year-old 
great-grandmother from Memphis who died Oct. 19 of meningitis 
brought on by a strain of listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Moll's other suit, a class-action effort, seeks to collect for  
anyone who claims to have eaten the tainted Sara Lee products. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee declined to comment on the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women.

<HEADLINE> Politics Surround Prayer Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organizers worked hard to keep Thursday's  
National Prayer Breakfast free of politics. But politics is all 
over this year's event -- on the guest list, on the program, even 
outside the hotel where it is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	Things haven't always been this way in the history of a  
breakfast originally meant to give Washington's various factions an 
hour in which they could abandon their differences for prayer and 
reflection. Ironically, it was Mother Teresa who opened the door to 
change in 1994, when she spoke out on abortion and attracted the 
media's glare. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, political conflict is walking in with the guests.  
</P>
<P>
	First, there is Yasser Arafat, who decided after three years to  
accept a standing invitation to the ecumenical event. Then, there 
are those who refuse to attend because the Palestinian leader will 
be there, as well as some lawmakers who tried to get him 
disinvited. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there is President Clinton, in the midst of his own  
spiritual challenge, speaking before a crowd consisting of some of 
his impeachers and seizing a chance to rub shoulders with world 
leaders from Albania to Norway. Not to mention the Christian 
protesters who will hold a vigil outside to object to the way 
Clinton mixes spirituality with -- you guessed it -- politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this prayer breakfast degenerating from what it once was  
many years ago, to nothing more than a political photo op,'' said 
the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense 
Coalition, which he described as a social activist organization 
that is ``more public and more prophetic'' than political. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney said his group would gather outside the Washington  
Hilton Hotel while the breakfast is going on to urge Clinton to 
``stop using Christianity for political gain, truly repent and seek 
God with all his heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has openly talked about faith since he's been in  
the White House,'' Mahoney said. ``But the reality is his lifestyle 
and his policies do not match the teachings of the church. Is Mr. 
Clinton truly repentant? Let's look at this repentance process. I 
think it's tied to politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tying politics to this breakfast is old hat for the president.  
Last year, he asked Americans to back him up with prayer as he 
wrestled with a possible military showdown with Iraq. The year 
before, he called on Washington's elected elite to purge itself of 
``this toxic atmosphere of cynicism'' to work on funding social 
programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Clinton is seizing the chance to have private talks  
with his counterparts from Albania, Macedonia and Norway who will 
be in attendance, the White House said -- while decrying those who 
object to Arafat's presence as perpetrators of political silliness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a morning of prayer and reconciliation,'' said White  
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``We believe that it's unfortunate 
that that spirit of reconciliation is being ignored by some, and 
that people have made the decision that the normal politics of 
Washington should intrude on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer breakfast was first convened in 1942 by members of  
Congress. Presidents did not attend until Dwight Eisenhower in 
1953. Now it draws up to 4,000 guests at $250 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	It only became a public display in recent years; C-SPAN has  
covered it for the past three years and this year, a small pool of 
reporters will go inside with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast is coordinated by a committee, and a different  
host is tapped each year, alternating between Democrats and 
Republicans, senators and House members. This year's host is Rep. 
Steve Largent, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Largent refused to rescind Arafat's invitation -- as Rep. Michael  
Forbes, R-N.Y., and Rep. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y, asked him to do -- 
and Christian Coalition director Randy Tate said he would stay 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is precisely the type of event that people like Mr.  
Arafat ought to be invited to,'' Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list itself, stored on a computer, is largely a  
secret. But it usually revolves around the same leaders -- members 
of Congress, prime ministers, diplomats -- from year to year. Over 
the past three years, both Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu were offered a chance to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat finally said yes this year; Netanyahu declined. The  
committee inquired and learned the Israeli leader had a scheduling 
conflict and therefore did not forward the official invitation, 
said Largent's spokesman Brad Keena.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Reeves a Weighty Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Bryant Reeves has eaten  
himself out of a starting job with the Vancouver Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	After showing up to training camp about 40 pounds over his  
playing weight of last year, Reeves will likely be coming off the 
bench when the Grizzlies open their NBA season at Sacramento on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's making steady improvement. He's working very  
hard, doing all the extra work that we're asking him to do,'' coach 
Brian Hill said Wednesday. ``I think he's moving in the right 
direction. But we still have a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Reeves would start on Sunday, Hill replied: ``It's  
unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, veteran journeyman Tony Massenburg, who started  
both exhibition games last weekend, will get the job in the 
interim. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, the club's first draft pick and the only member left  
from its expansion 1995-96 season, reported to camp at about 318 
pounds. He's reportedly shed about 15 pounds, but that still would 
put him about 25 pounds over where he was listed at the start of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies second-leading scorer last season and fourth among  
NBA centers, Reeves said he is a little red-faced about the 
potential of losing his starting job -- especially now that his 
six-year, $66 million contract extension kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a point of embarrassment. I don't know, I haven't  
been faced with that yet. We'll wait until that happens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Reeves out of shape, Hill said it has hampered his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just playing differently than the way I anticipated,''  
said Hill. ``We don't have the double-threat inside with Shareef 
(Abdur-Rahim) and Country in the post. I can't have Country on the 
floor with as many minutes as I would like to have him.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Japan's Economy Still Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy remains in a severe condition, with  
corporate earnings and the labor market continuing to deteriorate 
nationwide, said a government survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry's report on regional economic disparities  
also showed that industrial activity remained sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions along the industrial corridor linking Tokyo and Osaka  
are ``severe,'' while those in southern Japan are generally 
stagnant, according to the report, which cited regional ministry 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that increased public works spending in most regions was  
not leading to a recovery in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations continued to slash capital spending and payrolls as  
they struggled to restructure their operations amid Japan's worst 
economic downturn since the end of World War II, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment was still being hurt by near record high  
unemployment levels, but there were some signs of improvement in 
personal consumption, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of large electrical appliances have been strong in Tokyo  
and Osaka, while supermarkets in some areas have benefited from 
winter bargain sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall outlook for the economy remains dark, the report  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Italy Marks Cable-Car Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAVALESE, Italy (AP) -- Shops closed and townspeople filled the  
church in this Alpine ski resort today, joining relatives of 20 
Europeans who plunged to their deaths a year ago when a U.S. Marine 
jet sliced a gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain that one year ago visited the lives of so many people  
is our pain,'' said the Rev. Renzo Caserotti. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a natural death, it is a death against nature. It is  
a death that could have been avoided, caused by an airplane that 
flew very low, outside all rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 300 people jammed the Roman Catholic church, many  
carrying bouquets of red roses. Relatives were red-eyed, holding 
back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats from Milan and Rome and Marine Maj. Gen. Ronald G.  
Richard represented the U.S. government and the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine jet, an EA-6B Prowler flying low during a training  
mission from a nearby base, snapped the cable over the slopes of 
Mount Cermis in the accident that briefly strained U.S.-Italian 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how painful it was, Sindy Renkewilz said she wanted to  
come to see the spot where her father and sister died. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time here and it really hurts,'' said  
Renkewilz, 20. ``But I think I need to do this, to lay some flowers 
where they died and think about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town declared today a day of mourning, ordering shops closed  
in memory of the dead: two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, 
three Italians, two Austrians and one Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, the mayor of Cavalese, Mauro Gilmozzi,  
unveiled a memorial stone in the town cemetery bearing the names of 
the 20 victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``These names will remain sculpted in our memory and in our  
hearts,'' Gilmozzi said. ``This memorial stone should warn against 
the evil man can cause when he acts without respect for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives planned a rendezvous at the precise spot and at  
the precise minute when the gondola came smashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the families demanded the United States quickly  
resolve wrongful death claims so they could receive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group complained that Congress had allocated funds to help  
the town, which suffered after the resort's ski season was ruined, 
but set aside hardly anything for them. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, relatives have received $5,000 each from the United  
States to cover immediate expenses plus $62,000 from the Italian 
government, 75 percent of which was reimbursed by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer representing the German and Polish families, John  
Arthur Eaves, said he wanted $5 million in losses for each of his 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed U.S. legislation to compensate the victims' families  
died in the last session of Congress. A Pentagon spokesman said the 
funds were available and payment would be made as soon as Italian 
courts rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Relatives of victims have also suffered some material  
losses,'' Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said at 
today's unveiling ceremony. ``I want to thank our friend and ally 
the United States for promptly coming to our aid to help find a 
fair solution to the problem of compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new gondola began running in January after the local province  
paid most of the $11 million bill. The funds allocated by the 
United States will eventually reimburse the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense and prosecution lawyers agree that the ski lift wasn't  
marked on the map given to the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, but 
prosecutors claim he was flying too fast and too low when the jet 
struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-martial on charges of involuntary manslaughter begins  
Thursday. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., faces a possible 
200-year sentence if convicted of the 20 counts. He also is charged 
with destroying government and private property and dereliction of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., faces court-martial Feb. 22 on 20 counts each of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligent homicide.

<HEADLINE> Pirates, Steelers Get Stadiums' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pirates and Steelers sighed with relief  
Wednesday after the state Legislature approved funding for two new 
stadiums that will lock the teams into staying in Pittsburgh for at 
least 30 more years. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came one week before interim funding to build the  
Pirates' PNC Park would have expired, a development that could have 
led owner Kevin McClatchy to sell or move the small-market 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with a regional sales tax and $116.4 million from the  
two teams, the state will fund a 65,000-seat football stadium -- the 
first to be occupied solely by the Steelers -- and a 38,000-seat 
Pirates ballpark that will be the smallest of the majors' new, 
vintage-era stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The $650 million state plan approved Wednesday also frees up  
about $80 million each for new stadiums in Philadelphia for the 
Phillies and Eagles, plus $330 million for other construction 
projects throughout Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Pittsburgh stadiums will cost about $230 million each,  
with the state paying approximately one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking will be April 1 for the Pirates' ballpark, to be  
built on a riverfront lot adjacent to Three Rivers Stadium, with an 
anticipated opening in April 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers expect to open their new stadium on the opposite  
side of Three Rivers that same fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day the steel starts coming out of the ground, you'll see  
a pride in this region you haven't seen in a long time,'' McClatchy 
said. ``I think it will be even more dramatic than it was in 
Cleveland, which they also said wasn't a good baseball town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Rivers, one of the now-antiquated wave of multipurpose  
stadiums built in the early 1970s, will be demolished once the new 
stadiums are built. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote came after Gov. Tom Ridge and House leaders  
agreed to a compromise deal in which the state will apply excess 
taxes generated by the new stadiums to pay down the $320 million 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams must make up the difference in 10-year intervals if  
the increased revenues don't match the anticipated amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear debates across the country, whether stadiums are  
economic generators. What we're doing here is seeing if they are 
economic generators -- and we'll cover the difference if they're 
not,'' McClatchy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a creative solution and might be a model for other  
cities across the country. Now, we have to perform and draw fans 
and do everything we said we would do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have agreed to cover any cost overruns, which,  
considering those occurred in other cities, could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people ask are you thrilled and jumping for joy, I say,  
`We still have work to do,' '' Steelers president Dan Rooney said. 
``We've come together on this, but this is not going to be an easy 
thing. We still have to cover any cost overruns, and we have to 
cover any tax shortfalls.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite exuberant U.S. economic growth that  
showed no sign of slowing as the year began, Federal Reserve 
policy-makers decided against raising short-term interest rates on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with the continuing spread of world financial turmoil  
and the renewed risk it could spillover into the United States, 
they concluded a two-day, closed-door meeting by leaving the 
benchmark rate on overnight loans unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been at that level -- a four-year low -- since Nov. 17. The  
Fed lowered it from 5.5 percent in three quarter-point moves over a 
seven-week span to insulate the U.S. economy from the turmoil then 
rocking financial markets following the collapse of the Russian 
ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase would have produced higher rates on a variety of  
business and consumer loans ranging from credit-card balances to 
car loans. The decision to forgo one was widely expected, and the 
stock market showed little reaction. The Dow Jones industrial 
average, up about 70 points before the Fed announcement, closed up 
93 points at 9,367. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are divided about the future course of interest rate  
policy. Some, including Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, 
anticipate no change in rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth is certainly too strong to justify any easing,'' he  
said. ``At the same time, the complete lack of inflation, not to 
mention the ongoing global crisis, make a tightening both 
unnecessary and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others believe the inflationary threat posed to wages and  
eventually prices by shortages of skilled workers will prompt the 
Fed to raise rates later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Tim O'Neill, of the Bank of Montreal, said the spread  
of financial turmoil to Brazil last month, forcing the sharp 
devaluation of its currency, has only delayed Fed action. He 
predicted the central bank would increase the benchmark rate to 6 
percent by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed will tighten ... once price pressures mount and the  
global economy recovers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slowing, as anticipated, the economy accelerated  
during the final three months of last year. It grew at a 5.6 
percent annual rate, the most in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the Fed has little reason to rein in growth because  
inflation shows no sign of worsening appreciably. Consumer prices 
rose just 1.6 percent last year, the smallest rise in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In congressional testimony last month, Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan said the economy ``has continued to grow more rapidly 
than can be accommodated on an ongoing basis.'' He said the growth 
continued to shrink the pool of available workers and, under those 
conditions, labor costs cannot be expected to remain in check 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But one problem for policy-makers is that an increase in rates  
could touch off a sharp drop in the U.S. stock market. That, in 
turn, could quickly depress consumer spending, which accounts for 
two-thirds of economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Fed Seen Keeping Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials like to say that  
interest-rate policy is aimed at Americans on Main Street, not at 
Wall Street's hard-charging traders. 
</P>
<P>
	But with stock-market gains increasingly propelling everything  
from record home sales to car buying, many economists believe the 
Fed has little choice but to cater to the whims of a touchy, 
overvalued market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that stock prices are driving consumer spending  
to an extent I don't think we have seen before,'' said economist 
Norman Robertson of Smithfield Trust Co. in Pittsburgh. ``And so 
the Fed is indeed over a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship, said economist Robert Dederick of Northern  
Trust Co. in Chicago, is ``sort of a mutual admiration society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is doing well and therefore the stock market is  
doing well. The market is doing well and that helps the economy do 
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that the same relationship can hold true in  
reverse. A drop in the market could quickly translate into trouble 
in the so-called real economy, where Americans earn their living 
and buy cars, homes, haircuts and cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, it's really the U.S. consumer that's the one  
point of strength in the global economy -- and that spending is very 
dependent on high stock prices and easy credit,'' said economist 
William A. Brown of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were there to be a reverse in financial markets ... I think  
you'd be surprised at how quickly we could move from a world of 
surprising strength to a world of surprising weakness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe just such a reverse is entirely possible  
as waning world demand increasingly crimps the profits of American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, someday, the price of a share of stock has to be  
related to a company's earnings,'' said economist Carl R. 
Tannenbaum of LaSalle Banks in Chicago. ``And corporate earnings 
are really very flat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's monetary policy panel -- the Federal Open Market  
Committee -- began a two-day, closed-door meeting Tuesday. It is 
confronting evidence of rapid economic growth that, usually, would 
prompt the policy-makers to raise interest rates to cool demand and 
head off the possibility of increased inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists, however, believe the Fed will leave short-term  
rates unchanged. That's despite surprisingly boomy signs that 
include record new home sales -- at annual rates of 1.02 million in 
November and 978,000 in December -- and the fastest overall rate of 
economic growth in 2 1/2 years -- 5.6 percent in the October-December 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Fear that financial markets are vulnerable, that an  
interest-rate increase or a renewed outbreak of world financial 
turmoil could cause a repeat of last fall, when the Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks plunged nearly 20 percent in the weeks 
after Russia's ruble was devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	The market swiftly recovered in October and November after the  
Fed cut the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks three 
times, reducing it from 5.5 percent to 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last month that  
rescuing the market was not, and is not, the central bank's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is the maximum sustainable growth of the U.S.  
economy, not particular levels of asset prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Greenspan acknowledged that the stock market's  
impact on consumer spending has become ``real and significant.'' A 
severe drop in stock prices ``could lead to a considerable 
weakening of consumer demand,'' which accounts for two-thirds of 
the nation's economic activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking on the bright side, economist Lynn Reaser of NationsBank  
Corp. in Jacksonville, Fla., said the increasing interdependence 
between stock prices and consumer spending gives the Fed the 
ability to stimulate or rein in demand much more swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It actually increases the ability of policy to address any  
potential problems of overheating or contraction,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the link between Wall Street and Main Street presents the  
Fed with a challenge, too, said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. 
Lanston &AMP; Co in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you let a little bit of air out of a bubble without  
collapsing it?'' Jones asks. ``That's Greenspan's dilemma. This may 
be his ultimate test as Fed chairman.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Are Now Kukoc's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Toni Kukoc is no longer the third option  
for the Chicago Bulls. He doesn't have to defer to Michael Jordan 
or Scottie Pippen or listen to Phil Jackson scream at him for 
defensive lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc is now the man, the go-to guy in what will surely be a  
season filled with losses following a massive retooling by the 
six-time champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He is aware of what is ahead and is eager because the new and  
expanded role will require from him more leadership, more scoring, 
more shooting and increased responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need a reminder of the past, I can just look up here,''  
Kukoc says of the championship banners hanging on the walls at the 
Bulls' practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc scored 32 points in the Bulls' exhibition loss to Indiana  
earlier this week, a mixture of jump shots -- a part of his game 
that can be erratic -- and left-handed drives to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows the Bulls' triangle offense as well as anyone and is  
being counted on by rookie coach Tim Floyd to convey his knowledge 
to a host of new teammates still trying to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been interesting to watch,'' Floyd said Thursday. ``From  
a guy who was silent the first week who now seems more pronounced 
and vocal on the floor, not only with the older guys but with our 
newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc was known as ``The Waiter'' during his playing days in  
Europe for his ability to serve other players with clever passes. 
He still lists Magic Johnson, perhaps the greatest passer in NBA 
history, as the one player he'd like to face one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toni is one of the most skilled players in the league. And now  
he has to step up and be a leader,'' said new teammate Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been there and been through it, and he's going to be a  
source of strength for a young team learning and growing. He has to 
step into that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, voted the NBA's best sixth man in 1995-96 when the Bulls  
won an NBA-record 72 regular season games, never fashioned himself 
as anything but a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he joined the Bulls, Jordan retired for the first time and  
Kukoc was crushed because it appeared his dream of playing with the 
world's best was over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan returned, and the Bulls went on to three  
championships. Kukoc took his verbal beatings from Jordan and 
Jackson. With Floyd, the Bulls may not win as many games, but 
Kukoc's ears won't be ringing as much, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Jackson) wanted us to be better, but I can get it out of  
myself without being yelled at,'' Kukoc said during the Bulls' 
abbreviated training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had plenty of respect for Phil, but I didn't need the  
yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who averaged 13.3 points last season when he started 52  
games, is ready for the added burden, starting with Friday's opener 
in Utah, where the Bulls clinched the title last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be nights when the offense won't click and  
somebody will have to step up,'' he said. ``And most of all, the 
guys will be counting on me. ... I'm ready to take the 
responsibility. I didn't do it much the last five years.''

<HEADLINE> Romney Eyed for Salt Lake IOC Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A reorganization of Salt Lake City's  
scandal-tainted Olympics organization could see Massachusetts 
millionaire Mitt Romney brought in and two of Utah's most prominent 
businessmen depart. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
in 1994, has been approached about taking over as chief executive 
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, according to a source 
knowledgeable about the search for the successor to Frank Joklik, 
who stepped down while denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization also could include expanding the SLOC board  
``to add more voices,'' as well as changes in the ethics policy, 
said Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization would include a new executive committee of  
the board that does not include First Security Corp. Chairman 
Spence Eccles and PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham, another 
knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eccles and Topham were enlisted during Salt Lake's bidding for  
the games to watch over staffers now blamed for excesses. Eccles 
has claimed he was ``deceived by others in the bid process.'' 
Topham has said the bid committee board took a strong position not 
to engage in ``activities of this nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the man reputed to be behind the scholarships, guns,  
skis and cash payments to the IOC members and their kin -- former 
bid committee and SLOC head Tom Welch -- was spreading word Tuesday 
that others -- including Leavitt -- knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with Cable News Network, Welch said  
many members of the bid committee knew of his activities -- 
including the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela denied it. ``Did the governor know of inappropriate  
activities? Absolutely not,'' she told KUTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said Leavitt personally met some of the scholarship  
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may have met some of the students,'' Varela said. ``He did  
not know they were on any Olympic scholarship fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's attorney, Tom Schaffer, was quoted in a copyright story  
in The Salt Lake Tribune today as saying details of scholarships 
and other controversial aid programs were discussed during a 
September 1993 meeting in Monte Carlo attended by Welch, Joklik, 
Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, Corradini and Young have denied any knowledge of  
scholarships offered to IOC members or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer said the bid committee spent the last six months of  
1991 debating the ins and outs of the National Olympic Committee 
assistance program, which included the scholarships and other 
payments now under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, Schaffer said, Welch discussed on a case-by-case  
basis how to work scholarships and other aid into the budget with 
the bid board's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer maintained that all bid-committee board members  
received detailed budgets and minutes of executive-committee 
meetings. Welch also instructed financial officers to meet 
one-on-one with board members to go over budget line items, 
Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik personally saw scholarship checks before they were mailed  
to recipients, Schaffer said. The Tribune said Joklik declined to 
comment about Schaffer's statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik remains as acting president until a new chief executive  
takes over. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, the son the late Michigan Gov. George Romney, was  
traveling and did not immediately return phone calls to his 
company, Bain Capital Inc. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The descendant of early, prominent Mormons, Romney has served in  
the lay clergy of the Mormon church, presiding over a group of 
congregations in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is a graduate of Brigham Young University, Harvard  
Business School and Harvard Law School and lives in Belmont, Mass., 
and Park City, Utah. He has five sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC reorganization also is expected to add a chief  
operating officer. Roger Jackson, who held a similar job during 
Calgary's 1988 Winter Games and serves on the IOC Coordination 
Commission overseeing preparations for 2002, is considered the 
front-runner for that job. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--A survey of 1,000 Americans showed overwhelming support for  
Olympic athletes and the corporations that pay their way to the 
games despite the Salt Lake City corruption scandal. Respondents to 
the survey, requested by the U.S. Olympic Committee and conducted 
by research firm Wirthlin Worldwide, also said major changes were 
needed for selecting host cities and how they plan the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--The USOC has been served a subpoena from the U.S. Justice  
Department, which is investigating the Salt Lake bid. Spokesman 
Mike Moran said investigators want documents, and USOC will deliver 
them. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	--The city board in Lillehammer, Norway, moved to protect the  
image of its 1994 Winter Olympics by voting to open sealed records 
from its 1992 and 1994 bids and appoint a commission to study them. 
Lillehammer insists it has a clean record and does not want it 
tainted by the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Utah's House of Representatives voted 60-14 for a bill that  
would establish a special Olympic oversight committee consisting of 
a dozen legislators to review the 2002 Olympic budget. Rep. Jordan 
Tanner, R-Provo, said the intent was not to manage the Olympics, 
but to ensure taxpayer money invested in the games is paid back. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano, Japan, officials chartered a train for the IOC  
president and lavishly entertained IOC officials, according to 
memos that reveal the contents of a destroyed account book, local 
media reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In its $17.9 million bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics, the  
Nagano bid committee spent $45,000 to rent a luxury train with a 
panoramic observation car to bring IOC President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch to Nagano, the mass-circulation Mainichi newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials said today they have launched an inquiry into  
possible misconduct by IOC Committee members during Nagano's bid to 
host the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inquiry team made up of Japan Olympic Committee members  
will stop short of actually naming wrongdoers, said Secretary 
General Yushiro Yagi, who will head the team.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall as Fed Leaves Rate Alone / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Wednesday after the Federal  
Reserve announced it would not lower short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 3/16  
point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.25 percent from 5.24 percent on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left the benchmark rate on overnight loans unchanged at  
4.75 percent after concluding a two-day, closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, which had been strong most of the day on expectation of  
the news, remained bullish. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 
92.69 to 9,366.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which have been drifting lower all week, also  
weren't helped by the growing attractiveness of Japanese bonds. 
Yields of the 10-year bond hit an 18-month high Wednesday as 
investors prepare for a massive bond issue in the next fiscal year 
starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to down 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities were 
down 1/8 point to 7/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index fell 2.56 points  
to 1,309.57 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.46 percent as the  
discount fell 0.05 percentage point to 4.36 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.53 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 percentage 
point to 4.38 percent. One-year yields were 4.57 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.01 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 11/32 from 125 5/16 late 
Tuesday. The average yield to maturity fell to 5.12 percent from 
5.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bunk-Bed Safety Standards Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bunk bed manufacturers would face mandatory  
standards under guidelines proposed Wednesday by federal safety 
regulators as a way to reduce the number of children who die from 
getting stuck in the popular double-deckers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 57 children have died since 1990 in bunk bed accidents,  
usually after getting their heads trapped in the gap between the 
frame and headboard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
At least 59 others have reported ``near-misses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe a mandatory rule offers the best opportunity we have  
to solve the tragic problem before us,'' said Commission Chairwoman 
Ann Brown. ``These deaths can be prevented, if only the companies 
who make these beds would follow the safety standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would mirror voluntary standards that have  
existed for nearly a decade. They call for any gap to be less than 
3 1/2 inches and guardrails on both sides of the top bunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has recalled more than a half-million bunk beds  
since November 1994, but Brown said most manufacturers adhere to 
the guidelines. Her concerns stem from the importers and small 
manufacturers who ``make 40 or 50 bunk beds in their garage and 
then go out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed standards were approved by two of the three panel  
members. Commissioner Mary Sheila Gall abstained, saying agency 
investigators have ``not produced sufficient evidence to conclude 
that a mandatory rule would significantly reduce the risk of 
serious injury.'' She said she decided to abstain rather than 
oppose the proposal because she wanted an open discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to make a final recommendation in  
four to six months after receiving public comment.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor in Fund-Raise Probe Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who headed the  
investigation of President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign says 
he is resigning an interim position in San Diego because U.S. 
Attorney General Janet Reno planned to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication when Charles LaBella, the  
interim U.S. attorney for San Diego, would leave office. 
</P>
<P>
	As chief of Reno's campaign finance task force, LaBella  
recommended that a special prosecutor look into possible 
fund-raising improprieties. Reno rejected his request. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella, 47, told the Los Angeles Times that Reno and her top  
deputy, Eric Holder, told him they were planning to ask the local 
federal court to replace him as interim U.S. attorney with fellow 
prosecutor Gregory Vega, who is in line to get the job permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I did not have the confidence of the attorney  
general and the deputy attorney general and so I think it's time to 
move on,'' said LaBella, a 16-year veteran of U.S. attorney offices 
in New York and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	That was disputed by Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin.  
``We have not lost confidence in Chuck LaBella. He has been a fine 
interim U.S. attorney,'' Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella learned that he would not be nominated to take the job  
on a permanent basis shortly after his July 16 recommendation for 
an independent counsel, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has 
questioned whether the two actions were related. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of Mr. LaBella's sharp difference with Attorney  
General Reno over the appointment of independent counsel, that has 
all the indications of retribution,'' Specter said. He threatened 
to raise the issue during confirmation hearings for Vega. 
</P>
<P>
	Vega, 44, was recommended by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., in  
August to be permanent U.S. attorney for San Diego and Imperial 
counties. The White House hasn't yet submitted his name to the 
Senate for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella had been named interim U.S. attorney by Reno after Alan  
Bersin resigned last spring to become San Diego schools 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, such interim appointments stand only for 120  
days. After that, the local federal court must reappoint the 
interim prosecutor while the appointment process is underway in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the San Diego court named LaBella, allowing him to  
continue running the office pending Vega's expected nomination, but 
after LaBella resigns Reno will be free to name Vega as interim 
U.S. attorney.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Center Roberts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Wanting a big body to back up Hakeem Olajuwon,  
the Houston Rockets got one of the biggest Wednesday by agreeing to 
contract terms with 7-foot, 290-pound Stanley Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston already had signed Antoine Carr to back up Olajuwon, but  
Carr is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery and will be out 
four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of Roberts would seem to end any interest the  
Rockets had in free agent Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't think that we would,'' Rockets executive vice  
president Carroll Dawson said. ``You are always looking to improve 
your team and you never say never, but we don't think that's going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts averaged 6.2 points and 4.9 rebounds in 74 games with  
the Minnesota Timberwolves last season. Before that, he spent five 
seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to look at all of our options and Stanley  
Roberts was available and interested in playing here,'' coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich said. ``We hope that he will come in healthy and in 
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some Rockets liked the idea of Rodman bringing his  
multicolored head to Houston, Olajuwon wasn't so sure Rodman's 
boisterous personality would work with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was serious (pursuing Rodman),'' Olajuwon  
said. ``I think the team chemistry so far has worked. I think the 
team would be skeptical to make a choice like that. I think this is 
the right move.''

<HEADLINE> Thomson Recalling 424,000 Radios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Thomson Consumer Electronics announced  
Wednesday that it is voluntarily recalling about 424,000 radio 
cassette players because the devices can pose a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson has received three reports of appliance outlets on its  
GE Spacemaker units overheating and catching fire, causing minor 
property damage. No injuries have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our testing revealed that the product failure may occur with  
prolonged and repeated usage of the appliance outlet over a period 
of years,'' Thomson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson is making the recall in cooperation with the U.S.  
Consumer Product Safety Commission. The voluntary recall covers 
units with model number 7-4285 that were sold in department, 
electronic and discount stores nationwide from January 1992 through 
December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit is designed for under-the-cabinet use and includes an  
AM/FM stereo cassette player, a light and appliance outlet which 
people can use to plug in additional items. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson, which has its North American corporate headquarters in  
suburban Indianapolis, says consumers should unplug the units 
immediately. They can call 800-464-7022 to receive a free 
replacement unit.

<HEADLINE>  Robinson Not Hiding at Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Eugene Robinson waded into the group of  
autograph seekers, chatting and signing the caps, footballs and 
assorted pieces of paper thrust at him. 
</P>
<P>
	A little later, he yelled at his son, ``Good try, Brandon, atta  
boy,'' as the 9-year-old futilely tried to chase down a much bigger 
boy running with the ball on the Pro Bowl practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after a nightmarish weekend that included being  
charged with soliciting an undercover officer for sex and then 
getting burned for a key touchdown in Atlanta's Super Bowl loss to 
Denver, Robinson was trying to get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I don't intend to do is cower and hide,'' the  
Falcons' safety said Wednesday after working out with the NFC 
all-star squad. ``That's not my personality. God made me a person 
who really likes and cares about people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very encouraged by the support I've received. My  
teammates and my friends, everybody has been very supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's wife, Gia, their 11-year-old daughter and son Brandon  
are with him in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how everything is going with his family, Robinson replied,  
``It's good. I think everything is going very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, on the advice of his attorney, he would not answer  
questions about his arrest last Saturday night for allegedly 
offering an undercover police officer $40 for oral sex in a seamy 
area of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	After the mostly sleepless night that followed, he started for  
the Falcons the next day and let the Broncos' Rod Smith get behind 
him for an 80-yard TD reception. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest around 9 p.m. EST Saturday came just 12 hours after  
Robinson, nicknamed ``The Prophet'' for his religious beliefs, 
received the 1999 Bart Starr Award from the Christian group 
Athletes In Action, annually honoring an athlete of high moral 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declared his innocence after the arrest, but he still  
apologized publicly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His Falcons teammates at the Pro Bowl said they still consider  
Robinson an outstanding man. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever been around Eugene for 15 minutes, you'd  
realize what a great person he is,'' running back Jamal Anderson 
said. ``We still think about him, respect him, the same way we 
always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jesse Tuggle went to Robinson's room to speak with  
him Saturday night after he heard of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with him, looked him in the eyes and told him, `I  
still believe in you. You've got to go on like it never happened.' 
We talked about everything we had done to get where we were (in the 
Super Bowl), and what we had to do in the game,''' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle and Anderson said they don't think Robinson's arrest, and  
the possible distraction, played any part in the Falcons' 34-19 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into the game absolutely the same as we would have  
anyway,'' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Anderson: ``I'd love to be able to use that as an excuse,  
but it sure didn't affect anything in terms of my running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, is expected to be arraigned on the misdemeanor  
count within the next 30 days. He could have charges dropped 
through a diversion program commonly offered in such cases. If he 
is not offered pretrial intervention, Robinson could face a maximum 
penalty of about 60 days if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, in his third Pro Bowl, has 53 career interceptions,  
tops among active players. The Super Bowl with the Falcons was his 
third; he played in two for Green Bay.

<HEADLINE> Geldof Launches Romania TV Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Atomic Media Group, led by Irish rock  
singer Bob Geldof, launched a music TV channel Wednesday which 
started broadcasting into 750,000 homes throughout Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not aiming at those youngsters who stood in bread lines  
during communism, but for those who grew up surfing the Internet,'' 
said Tudor Giurgiu, Atomic's creative director. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of communist rule in late 1989, cable television  
stations have flourished in this country of 23 million. In 
Bucharest, there are nine television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Atomic is being distributed in Romania by 70 relay stations. Its  
programs comprise western and local music as well as news on music 
and cinema performers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based Atomic has 140 employees and plans to hire more  
people soon, said British Executive Manager David Williams. Most of 
the VJs, or video jockeys, are around 20 and are students. 
</P>
<P>
	Atomic Media Group has already launched a similar TV channel in  
Poland, and the company has plans to expand in three western 
countries, including a chain of cafes and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Geldof, 43, was not at the launch. He was awarded an honorary  
knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for setting up the charity Band 
Aid, which raised millions of dollars for Ethiopian famine victims.

<HEADLINE> Lakers May Be Rodman's Only Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If Dennis Rodman wants to play for a  
championship contender this season as previously stated, the Los 
Angeles Lakers might be his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	And his earning potential with them is extremely limited  
compared to what he's made in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Orlando Magic, Miami Heat and Houston  
Rockets, all possible destinations for the 37-year-old Rodman, 
indicated Wednesday they aren't interested in his services. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt, Rodman's quirky ways are a significant factor.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the last seven  
seasons, expressed a desire to play for the Magic, who are coached 
by Chuck Daly -- Rodman's coach with the Detroit Pistons from 
1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel indicated the chances of that  
happening are slim, mainly because Rodman has made it clear he 
wishes to receive special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on one phone call, this thing had a pulse a couple days  
ago,'' Gabriel said from Orlando, Fla. ``It's coming close to dying 
out here real fast as we get ready to start our season (Friday 
night against the New York Knicks). 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to meet with him. We respect him very much as a  
player, but there was process for this organization in regard to 
issues off the floor that we're going to stick to. If that process 
doesn't happen, this signing won't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executive vice president Jerry West has expressed an  
interest in Rodman, but in the team can only offer a veteran 
minimum starting salary of $1 million under the new labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who earned a total of $18 million from the Chicago Bulls  
in the last two seasons, recently mentioned the Lakers as one of 
the teams he would be interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal has pushed in recent days for the Lakers to  
sign Rodman, who has played on five NBA championship teams in the 
last 10 years, including three straight with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team can use his physical ability,'' said first-year  
Lakers guard Derek Harper, who, like Rodman, is 37 years old and 
nearing the end of his playing career. ``The problem with Dennis is 
how he's going to conduct himself off the basketball court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West reportedly spoke with one of Rodman's new agents, Steve  
Chasman, earlier this week to see if there was interest on Rodman's 
part in playing for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasman has served as Rodman's talent agent for over a year and  
works for International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chasman is not a certified agent with the players  
union, meaning he can't negotiate a contract for Rodman. Rodman is 
also represented by Andrew Reif and Richard Levy, and both are 
certified with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Marozas, a spokeswoman for ICM, said there would be no  
comment Wednesday on Rodman's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley formerly represented Rodman, but ended his  
affiliation with him last week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Surge in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales for several automakers surged last  
month as demand for pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles 
continued to remain strong among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. all  
reported double-digit increases in sales Tuesday, while Ford Motor 
Co. experienced a 9 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect we'll see foreign brands and DaimlerChrysler picking  
up market share over Ford and GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst 
David Healy. ``These are strong numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it sold 259,615 vehicles last month -- 89,543 cars and  
170,072 light trucks. A 9 percent decline in car sales over January 
1998 was erased by a 22 percent increase in trucks, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford said last month broke a record for overall 
January sales set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All Ford truck models posted sales increases, the largest coming  
from the redesigned Windstar minivan, whose sales were up 54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing, sales and  
service, said the decrease in car sales came from a planned cut in 
sales to rental fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	One model that sold well: the new Mustang, whose sales increased  
34 percent. That car is made at Ford's River Rouge complex, which 
was shut down Monday after an explosion in the complex's power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it sold 56,176 cars and 139,631 light  
trucks last month, an increase of 18 percent over the previous 
year. The company reported strong sales for Dodge and Jeep trucks 
and SUVs, and said its large sedans -- Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler 
Concorde, LHS and 300M -- also sold well. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said some of DaimlerChrysler's gains might have come from  
the fleet sales that Ford shunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota reported a 27 percent jump in its sales for the month,  
with sales of the popular Toyota Camry sedan up 72 percent. The 
company's Lexus division benefited from sales of its two SUVs, the 
RX 300 and LX 470. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong market conditions that fueled near-record industry  
sales in the final quarter of 1998 should carry over well into 
1999,'' Yale Giesel, Toyota executive vice president, said in a 
statement. ``High consumer confidence and affordable interest rates 
will play a big part in how long the industry can maintain its 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. said U.S. sales were up 17 percent, driven by  
its Odyssey minivan and CR-V sport utility vehicle. Troubled Nissan 
Motor Co. also posted a sales gain of 4 percent, with increased 
truck sales overcoming a slight decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European automakers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and  
Volkswagen -- also posted sales gains. But Volvo AB, which Ford 
plans to buy for $6.45 billion, reported its sales declined 18 
percent from January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. is scheduled to release its sales report  
today.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Lakers May Be Courting Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers executive vice president  
Jerry West has talked briefly with Dennis Rodman's new agent, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question. We've discussed it, but  
everyone's putting the cart before the horse,'' West told the Los 
Angeles Times. ``We don't have any idea whether there's any 
interest on his (Rodman's) part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had a conversation Tuesday with Rodman's agent,  
Steve Chasman, who said he would discuss the situation with Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Rodman, who has won the last seven NBA  
rebounding titles and been on five of the last 10 NBA championship 
teams, has indicated his signing preferences with either the 
Orlando Magic or the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers could offer Rodman a veteran minimum starting salary  
of $1 million, the Times said. For the past two seasons, Rodman has 
made $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets also were said to be interested in Rodman,  
especially since an injury to reserve forward Antoine Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would definitely help us,'' one anonymous Rocket told the  
Houston Chronicle. ``With Dennis, Charles (Barkley) and Dream 
(Hakeem Olajuwon), we'd get two and three shots every trip down 
court. That's how many offensive boards we'd be getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Heat coach Pat Riley said last week his team would be  
interested in Rodman if the former Bulls would abide by team rules 
of conduct

<HEADLINE> Democrats Threaten Party Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans searched for an exit from  
President Clinton's impeachment trial on Wednesday, struggling to 
resolve internal differences while Democrats accused them of 
considering ``extralegal devices'' to condemn the president without 
removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican prosecutors questioned the third of three  
witnesses in the case, and said they hoped to win approval for live 
testimony, a request that could bring Monica Lewinsky before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the 45  
Senate Democrats were united in opposition, and some Republican 
senators also expressed misgivings. ``Personally, I am not going to 
support appearances of witnesses before the U.S. Senate,'' said 
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the witness issue, Republicans labored to agree among  
themselves on a proposal for a formal finding of presidential 
wrongdoing. The latest draft alleged Clinton ``willfully provided 
false and misleading'' grand jury testimony and impeded efforts to 
uncover evidence in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	As envisioned by Republicans, the formal finding of wrongdoing  
would require only a majority vote to pass, rather than the 
two-thirds needed for conviction on impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But it drew a chorus of criticism from Democrats, who said they  
were ready with numerous amendments to the GOP proposal, including 
some that would cite Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for 
prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Republicans persist in demanding live witnesses and  
demanding more depositions, and demanding extralegal devices like 
findings of fact, the more it becomes a Republican trial,'' Daschle 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans also expressed opposition to the so-called  
``finding of fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives people a middle way out. It's a bad precedent,'' said  
Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a closed-door meeting at the end of the day, Sen.  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said of the idea, ``It's still up in the 
air. It's not soaring but it's not falling either. It's up in the 
air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also renewed its objections to the proposal, at  
the same time spokesman Joe Lockhart pledged a restrained response 
if -- as expected -- Clinton is acquitted on the two articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I now declare in a post-impeachment era, this is a gloat-free  
zone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators met privately late in the day, and released  
a letter sent to the White House in which they asked Clinton to 
submit voluntarily to a sworn deposition to answer questions in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your knowledge, intent, actions and omissions are central to  
the charges. ... Personal answers from you should prove beneficial 
in our efforts to reconcile conflicting testimony,'' the 
Republicans wrote in a request the White House rejected before the 
letter was even dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., told reporters he expected a vote when the trial resumes 
on Thursday on a proposal to release the depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky and two other witnesses, both in written transcripts and 
videotapes. He suggested they could remain under seal for a limited 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he  
wants approval for live testimony by Ms. Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, the 
three witnesses who testified in private depositions this week. A 
scaled-back request is also possible, for live testimony by one or 
two witnesses or the showing of portions of the videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether House prosecutors should be permitted to air  
portions of the tapes during their closing arguments, Daschle said, 
``Our view is that if you're going to air a deposition, you better 
air the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Senate officials conceded it would be difficult to secure  
enough votes to prevail on a call for live testimony, particularly 
with public opinion in favor of a swift end to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic maneuvering came as Blumenthal was questioned in  
a heavily secured room in the upper reaches of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the deposition, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said Blumenthal repeated the testimony he gave a grand 
jury last year concerning a conversation he had with Clinton about 
the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The president lied 
to him, Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky submitted to depositions earlier in the  
week as prosecutors probed for information that could buttress 
their case against the president. White House lawyers also attended 
the depositions but gave no indication they heard any revelations 
that caused them alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice for  
attempting to conceal his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Republicans' draft document on a ``finding of  
fact'' against Clinton was an unconstitutional move designed to 
inflict damage on him.	   Several Democrats cited an argument advanced in a Washington 
Post opinion article by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who also 
argued forcefully at a closed-door caucus during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators must answer two questions, Byrd wrote: whether the  
president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and, if so, 
whether he should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lift this burden from the shoulders of senators by offering  
them a way to convict the president without having to accept 
responsibility for removing him from office would, in effect, 
bastardize the impeachment process,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters opposition to the plan would be  
aggressive. The strategy, he said, ``will be of course to offer an 
array of amendments. And we will do that as long as it appears that 
a finding of fact resolution could pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., added another objection. ``I smell an  
ulterior motive here,'' he said. ``Pass findings of fact by 
majority vote and ... it will be used by Ken Starr or another 
prosecutor in a subsequent criminal case.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Must Start Over Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons spent the entire season  
trying to prove they weren't a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they've got do it all over again.  
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I've been here, we'd reach the playoffs one year,  
and the next year was a disaster,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, 
a member of the Falcons for 12 seasons. ``I'm hoping those years 
are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Dirty Birds'' took Atlanta to the Super Bowl for the first  
time in the franchise's 33-year history, but they still have 
another flight to make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have never had back-to-back winning seasons, a point  
raised quite often by coach Dan Reeves even as he was guiding 
Atlanta to the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come an awful long ways,'' Reeves said, after the  
extraordinary season ended with a 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. 
``What we're trying to do now is fight for home-field advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has ever played the NFL title game on its home field.  
The Falcons have a chance to be the first when the Super Bowl comes 
to the Georgia Dome on Jan. 30, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I'll remember most: getting a chance to be at the  
Super Bowl and see what it's like,'' defensive end Chuck Smith 
said. ``Next year, we have to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta got the offseason started Tuesday by making five players  
available to the Cleveland Browns for the expansion draft: safety 
Chris Bayne, running back Harold Green, tight end Ed Smith, 
linebacker Ben Talley and offensive lineman Dave Widell. 
</P>
<P>
	Widell played only one game, while Bayne and Green spent  
extensive time on the inactive list. Smith and Talley had limited 
roles as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Those players who return in 1999 can expect to find heightened  
expectations, a tougher schedule and an already long-in-the-tooth 
team that will be another year older. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, in particular, is starting to take on the look of  
the ``Over The Hill Gang,'' with five starters who will be 32 years 
or older by the start of next season. Average age of the entire 
unit: 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A youth movement is under way, centering around the team's last  
two No. 1 draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Michael Booker, the top choice in 1997, took on a  
larger role when injuries plagued starter Ronnie Bradford. 
Linebacker Keith Brooking, picked No. 1 last year, gradually worked 
his way into a regular role in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needed early on to study films and anticipate, take notes  
and understand,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``I think 
he needs to apply all the tools he has because he has unbelievable 
tools and is going to be a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking eventually figures to take over a regular spot at  
outside linebacker, while second-year player Henri Crockett is the 
heir apparent to Tuggle at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett are entering the final year of  
their contracts, and both will be 34 at the beginning of next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	While the corners -- Bradford and Booker on one side, Pro Bowler  
Ray Buchanan on the other -- are still in their 20s, how much longer 
can Eugene Robinson (36 in May) and William White (33 next month) 
keep producing at the safety positions? 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was a Pro Bowler and the unquestioned leader of the  
secondary, barking out orders on the field, reciting Bible passages 
in the locker room. But the Prophet's once-spotless reputation took 
a devastating blow when he was arrested on a charge of soliciting 
an undercover police officer for sex the night before the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be a man about it,'' Robinson said of his  
off-the-field scandal. ``I'll let my lawyer handle it, but I won't 
run from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Age also is a concern at receiver. Terance Mathis and Tony  
Martin were the second-most productive duo in the league -- 
combining for 2,317 yards -- but Mathis will be 32 in June and 
Martin turns 34 early next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line, led by Bob Whitfield at left tackle and  
rookie Ephraim Salaam on the right side, is a young group with 
plenty of room to improve. Twenty-four-year-old O.J. Santiago needs 
to work on his receiving skills, but seems set for a long, 
productive career at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the offense revolves around All-Pro running back  
Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler, a Pro Bowler for the 
second year in a row. Depth at those positions will be a major 
focus of the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record with 410 carries this season, mainly  
because his top backup was rookie Ken Oxendine, a seventh-round 
pick. Byron Hanspard, who missed the season with a knee injury, has 
barely started his rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was backed up by 45-year-old Steve DeBerg, so finding  
an experienced -- and much younger -- backup also will be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But those are questions for the days and months to come. For  
now, the Falcons want to relish the moment a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out of nowhere,'' Buchanan said. ``Nobody gave us a  
chance to do anything. But we believed in ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the process starts again.

<HEADLINE> Congress Tackles `Red Tape' Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New House Speaker Dennis Hastert is trying to  
get off to a smooth start by giving priority to bills making 
federal laws and rules less onerous -- measures that are sure to win 
some Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is to take up a bill Thursday to extend a 1995 law  
designed to ensure that the private sector, as well as state and 
local governments, will be better protected from federal laws that 
impose new rules but don't help pay for the added costs of those 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week the House is scheduled to debate a bill that waives  
fines for small businesses that make minor errors in filing 
required federal paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill up for a vote in the House Small Business Committee  
today would make it easier for small businesses to file paperwork 
electronically or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The House speaker sets the legislative agenda, and Hastert,  
R-Ill., decided to give priorities to these bills to show that 
``the Republican Congress is returning to work on core issues,'' 
said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., sponsor of the bill waiving fines 
for small businesses. ``It's the first of several indications that 
Congress is getting back to the things that people care about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, Pete Jeffries, said it was natural to give  
priority to the bills ``because they have bipartisan support and we 
can ring up a couple of legislative victories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate as well, Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., John  
Breaux, D-La., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., are backing a ``regulatory 
right-to-know'' bill that would require the White House budget 
office to provide Congress with annual reports on the benefits and 
costs of federal regulatory programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three House bills all passed in similar forms last year with  
some Democratic support, but didn't make it through the Senate. The 
White House voiced strong opposition to the two bills dealing with 
so-called unfunded mandates on states and cities and the 
fine-waiver bill, saying they could make it harder for the federal 
government to legislate or monitor issues involving human health, 
safety and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 unfunded mandates law, a central part of the House GOP  
``Contract With America,'' required analyses of the costs of new 
programs on both the public and private sector and allowed members 
to raise points of order, or parliamentary objections, to bills 
that don't help pay for new costs on the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill, sponsored by Reps. Gary Condit, D-Calif., and Rob  
Portman, R-Ohio, would also give lawmakers the right to object to 
bills that would cost the private sector more than $100 million in 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit and Portman, at a Rules Committee hearing Tuesday, argued  
that objections had been raised only seven times under the 1995 law 
and there was no evidence the procedure would be used to delay or 
stop needed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., a leading GOP  
environmentalist, said the bill would give industries a tool to 
help defeat legislation and ``would intimidate committees so they 
would be more reluctant to pass bills to protect the environment, 
health or safety.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Humor Dominates Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Sen. Peter Fitzgerald didn't get a chance  
to say much between his election victory and his sworn vow of 
silence taken for the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	So, he wanted to ask his wife to see him take the stage at an  
annual dinner for congressional correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I didn't ask her. I passed a note to the chief  
justice and he asked her,'' deadpanned the Illinois Republican. 
``The way things are going in the Senate, this may be my only 
opportunity to say anything my entire first term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald joined fellow Senate newcomer Charles Schumer,  
D-N.Y., and two freshmen House members in entertaining the 
Washington Press Club Foundation's 55th annual congressional 
dinner, where impeachment trial humor dominated much of the 
black-tie affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The verdict is as foreordained as the plot on ``Melrose  
Place'' and the people, I might add, are a lot less pretty,'' 
concluded comedian Harry Shearer, master of ceremonies for the 
event. He likened the debate over whether to vote on a censure or a 
finding of fact that the president did wrong to ``the political 
equivalent of the Bud Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Fitzgerald, Schumer played on the ``Senate silence'' theme  
by coming on stage and saying he was ``honor bound under pain of 
imprisonment not to say a word about what's going on in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So thank you again, and goodnight,'' Schumer said, feigning to  
exit the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Often chided for his fondness for the camera lens, Schumer  
didn't stay away too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know on second thought I suppose I can talk about it,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speakers did manage to get a few laughs with jokes that had  
nothing to do with impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, did it at his own expense.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been called a Hoover because I often operate in a  
vacuum,'' joked Simpson. ``Now you know why in the most Republican 
state in the nation ... this Republican wins with 53 percent of the 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay woman  
elected to Congress and Wisconsin's first female representative in 
Washington, figured out why she had received an invitation to 
speak. She was chosen because she represents a group that 
historically has suffered discrimination, stereotyping and unfair 
treatment in the workplace, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I'm talking about blondes,'' punned the fair-haired  
Baldwin, who then ticked off a list of blonde jokes. She said that 
being a lesbian is not by choice, being a blonde is. ``I choose 
every other week,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mike Maddux Stays With Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos signed 37-year-old  
right-handed reliever Mike Maddux to a minor-league contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, the older brother of Braves ace Greg Maddux, proved an  
invaluable asset to a Montreal relief corps made up nearly entirely 
of raw rookies last season when -- after being invited to spring 
training as a non-roster player -- he made the club after an 
impressive training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	And, despite two stints on the disabled list, Maddux managed 51  
appearances totalling 55 23 innings. After the All-Star break, 
Maddux was 2-2 with one save and a 2.93 ERA. At Olympic Stadium, he 
was 1-1 with an impressive 1.57 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Arrested for Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A star minor-league defenseman could face  
up to four years in jail after being charged with using his hockey 
stick as a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Trboyevich of the Anchorage Aces was released from jail  
early Wednesday after posting $20,000 bail. He was scheduled to 
appear in Fresno County court Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich cross-checked Jacques Mailhot of the Fresno Falcons  
about five minutes into the first period Tuesday night. He was 
tossed from the game and suspended pending a review by the West 
Coast Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich was assessed with a major penalty for high-sticking  
and a match penalty for attempting to injure after the cross-check. 
Mailhot apparently didn't suffer any serious injury and continued 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty triggered a bench-clearing brawl that led to the  
ejection of 11 players. The Aces lost six players, leaving them 
with 11 for the rest of the game, which they lost 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich and Mailhot also had a run-in Jan. 1 in Anchorage.  
During that game, Mailhot hit Trboyevich in the mouth with his 
stick. Trboyevich lost part of a tooth and needed 10 stitches to 
close a gash in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were on the road with their teams Wednesday and  
could not be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Aces General Manager Derek Donald said his front office is  
looking into the incident and hoping the case can be resolved 
outside the court system. He had not yet seen the tape but 
questioned whether the charge was substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I gather, there's not any injury involved,'' he  
said. ``I don't know if Dean was fairly charged in this case. We 
just hope after the heat of the moment everybody makes the best 
decision for everyone involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mailhot who wanted Trboyevich arrested, making the  
request between the first and second periods, said Falcons 
spokesman Eric Broadwater. An off-ice official called authorities, 
and Mailhot was questioned at Selland Arena. Trboyevich was 
arrested at his hotel after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jacques Mailhot wanted to press charges,'' Broadwater said.  
</P>
<P>
	It is rare, but not unprecedented, for a hockey player to face  
criminal charges for action on the ice. Usually the league 
determines the punishment for violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	If the criminal charge is pursued, it can be treated as a  
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, or a felony 
punishable by two to four years in a state prison. A $10,000 fine 
could also be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	League president Mike McCall said he recalled at least one other  
similar arrest last year, but the charges in that case were dropped 
after mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall said it is always up to individual players to pursue  
charges, and the league would never interfere with that privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there's a fine line between the leagues governing  
themselves and players feeling what happened to them warrants 
further action,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coe Calls U.S. Drug Policies Lax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Former Olympic champion Sebastian  
Coe accused the United States of double standards Wednesday, citing 
reports that sprinter Dennis Mitchell escaped a drug ban by blaming 
sex and beer for his positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to foster confidence ... when somebody like Dennis  
walks away after claiming that elevated levels of testosterone were 
due to sex and beer the night before,'' Coe said. ``This stretches 
credibility to the breaking point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, 100-meter bronze medalist at the 1992 Olympics, was  
suspended by the world governing body IAAF after testing positive 
last April for high levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member drug panel of USA Track &AMP; Field cleared Mitchell  
in December. The USATF did not release the details of Mitchell's 
defense nor the reasons for its decision to exonerate him. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Daily Telegraph reported last month that Mitchell won  
his case on grounds that his positive result resulted from having 
sex four times and drinking five bottles of beer the night before 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say this type of thing, that drinking beer and (having  
sex) changes the level of testosterone,'' said Prince Alexandre de 
Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission. ``Please, let's 
be serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we must have some credibility.''  
</P>
<P>
	Coe, the 1,500-meter champion at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics,  
said Mitchell's acquittal only served to fuel growing mistrust and 
encourage drug use among athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``For athletes to have confidence in the system, they have to  
believe that people are serious about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe said the United States had a contribution to make to the  
anti-drug fight, but added: ``Come to the table after you have 
first cleaned your own back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz claimed  
he was unaware of Mitchell's ``sex-and-beer'' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bizarre case,'' he said, ``but you can probably find  
something like this in another country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Coe's remarks, Schultz said, ``Some will say it's a cheap  
shot. Fine, he can say what he wants. The important thing is that 
everybody cleans up their own backyards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF drug commission is expected to study the Mitchell case.  
It could refer the case to an arbitration panel, where Mitchell 
would face the possibilty of a two-year ban being reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second day in a row that a U.S. athlete was cited as  
an example of alleged American hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge cited  
baseball hero Mark McGwire's highly-publicized use of 
androstenedione as an example of the lax drug standards in the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell today for the third  
consecutive day on continued concern over surging domestic interest 
rates and the yen's rise against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.52 points,  
or 1.31 percent, closing the session at 14,161.31. The average now 
has fallen 337.94 points this week, including Tuesday's drop of 
115.35 points, or 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 112.38 yen, down  
0.80 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than its late New 
York level of 112.05 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players worry that higher interest rates will weigh on  
profits at Japanese companies and hurt the nation's economy, which 
is now struggling to bail itself out of its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Long term interest rates in Japan began rising in December, when  
the government announced plans to issue a large volume of bonds in 
the next fiscal year starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan needs to sell more debt to pay for stimulus plans aimed at  
pumping up the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield of the benchmark No. 203 10-year government bond  
settled at 2.350 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 2.310 percent 
and its highest level since July 1997. Its price fell to 95.77 yen 
from 96.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was estimated  
at 303 million shares, down from Tuesday's turnover of 324 million 
shares. Declines outnumbered advances 976 to 186, with 128 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 16.58 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,097.15. 
The TOPIX lost 5.64 points, or 0.50 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. closed at  
573 yen ($5.1) per share, up 42 yen (37 cents), or 8 percent, from 
Tuesday's finish, on expectations that the company will form a far 
reaching alliance with Goodyear Tire and Rubber of the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Airlines Suit Resurrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines' pricing practices may be  
examined in court after a federal appeals court ruling that revives 
a consumer lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled Tuesday that a district judge erred in dismissing the 
lawsuit, which accused Northwest of overcharging ticket buyers 
since a 1986 merger with Republic Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would send the case back to district court, but  
Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline would appeal the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that has been litigated before three federal  
judges already and has been rejected each time until today,'' 
Austin said. ``We think this is an incorrect decision. We believe 
that on review it will be found to be so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven consumers filed the lawsuit in 1997, arguing that the 1986  
merger violated antitrust law and led to higher ticket prices for 
passengers at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where 
Northwest accounts for 80 percent of the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumers, who are seeking as much as $400 million in  
alleged fare overcharges each year, sued under a section of the 
Clayton Antitrust Act that prohibits companies from 
anti-competitive use of stock and assets that they acquire. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest argued, however, that since the two airlines fully  
merged and Republic's stock ceased to exist, no claim was possible 
under that part of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year U.S. District Judge David Doty dismissed the suit,  
ruling that since the deal had been approved by the U.S. Department 
of Transportation, the plaintiffs could not challenge the merger 
based on the Clayton Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The three appellate judges disagreed, saying the section wording  
expressly provides for such a claim even when all of a company's 
stock or assets are acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from 11 states had filed friend-of-the-court  
briefs on behalf of the consumers, arguing that Doty misread the 
law in his earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great news for air travelers, good for competition,''  
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said. ``It could be a way to 
secure competitive prices or damages for noncompetitive prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has maintained it does not engage in unfair  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day strike by pilots that shut down the carrier last fall  
increased debate about airline competition in areas served by 
Northwest, which operates hubs in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit and 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The states who filed friend-of-the-court briefs in the case are  
Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, 
South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Beverly Hills Debates Anti-Fur Tags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Fur coats in the fancy shops on  
Rodeo Drive may soon come with a warning label with gruesome 
details of how the fur's original wearers -- the animals -- were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a petition drive by animal rights activists, citizens  
of this mecca of luxury shopping will get the chance May 11 to vote 
on a referendum requiring furriers to tag their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumer notice: This product is made with fur from animals  
that may have been killed by electrocution, gassing, neck breaking, 
poisoning, clubbing, stomping or drowning and may have been trapped 
in steel-jaw, leg-hold traps,'' the tag would read. 
</P>
<P>
	A reluctant City Council voted 3-1 Tuesday, with one abstention,  
to call the initiative election. Mayor Les Bronte was the lone 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want our police officers going to stores and checking  
the linings of coats,'' Bronte said. ``We don't need a pelt posse 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group called Beverly Hills Consumers for Informed Choices  
collected the signatures of more than 3,300 registered voters, 
forcing the council to put the measure on the ballot. Supporters 
believe it would be the first fur warning of its kind in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The group says most furriers tell buyers that the animals are  
killed by injection, which isn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president of the Humane Society of  
the United States, supports the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fur is purely a status symbol, and more and more it is a  
symbol of cruelty,'' he said. ``Beverly Hills has a warm climate. 
The only reason why people would want to wear fur is for the 
status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed law doesn't take into account that there are no  
laws regulating the killing of animals for their fur, countered 
Teresa Platt, executive director of Fur Commission USA, an 
association representing mink and fox farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For mink, the preferred method is gas, and for fox it's  
injection, but occasionally it is something different,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed tag ``lists a variety of methods by which the  
animals may or may not have been put down,'' she added. ``Imagine 
if such a label were required for meat, chicken, fish, medicine -- 
the list is endless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For William Carothers, of Santa Barbara, who was looking for a  
fox-trimmed leather coat at Somper Furs for his wife for 
Valentine's Day, said the tag wouldn't affect his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love animals myself, but fur has been worn forever,'' he  
said. ``I learned long ago that Bambi no longer runs in the wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The manager of Somper Furs, Douglas Fine, called the ballot  
measure ``one more attempt by the extreme animal activists to 
generate publicity to hurt the fur industry.''

<HEADLINE> No Ring Ceremony for These Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- There will be no public ring ceremony for  
the gutted champions from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new-look Bulls, the dismantled ones, won't be holding such a  
celebration Feb. 9 when they meet Atlanta in their first game at 
the United Center. Instead, they'll unfurl their sixth championship 
banner as a salute to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not bummed at all. Even though we don't have our same guys  
here, I'm not shocked,'' veteran guard Ron Harper said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who has been booed at past ring  
ceremonies, on Wednesday handed out 1997-98 championship rings to 
the seven remaining players from last year's team -- Harper, Toni 
Kukoc, Randy Brown, Dickey Simpkins, Bill Wennington, Rusty LaRue 
and Keith Booth -- and to assistant coaches Frank Hamblen, Tex 
Winter and Bill Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the same with everybody being gone, but we had it  
(an informal ceremony) in our little nest up stairs,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, the man most responsible for the six titles,  
already had his latest ring. He received it three weeks ago from 
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf as part of his retirement news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bulls Steve Kerr, Scottie Pippen, Jud Buechler, Joe  
Kleine and Luc Longley, who have joined other teams since last 
season, will get theirs at later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have individual ceremonies for guys who aren't  
here,'' Krause said. ``We will make presentations to Steve, 
Scottie, Joe, Jud and Luc when they are in here, or we will go and 
make presentations to them at their places where they are employed 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr's San Antonio Spurs and Buechler's Detroit Pistons will  
make trips to the United Center. But Houston, which has Pippen, and 
Phoenix, with Longley and Kleine, will not. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also announced they are planning a tribute to former  
coach Phil Jackson on April 4 when they host Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls trimmed their roster to 15 Wednesday by waiving center  
Priest Lauderdale and forward Matt Steigenga.

<HEADLINE> $14M in Mentoring Grants Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton announced $14 million  
in federal grants Wednesday to support mentoring programs in 73 
cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House event, Mrs. Clinton also released a new Justice  
Department report that said children who have a guiding adult 
figure in their lives were 46 percent less likely to use drugs, 33 
percent less likely to hit another person and 50 percent more 
likely to attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report confirms what we already have known,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said, ``that one caring adult can make all the difference 
in a child's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton acknowledged critics say that parents should play  
that role, but added, ``...I've lived long enough ... to know that 
that's not always the way it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Mrs. Clinton said that she would dedicate all the  
proceeds from her forthcoming book, ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'' -- a 
collection of photos of the Clintons' cat and dog and letters that 
children have written to them -- to the National Park Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Must Start Over Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons spent the entire season  
trying to prove they weren't a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they've got do it all over again.  
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I've been here, we'd reach the playoffs one year,  
and the next year was a disaster,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, 
a member of the Falcons for 12 seasons. ``I'm hoping those years 
are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Dirty Birds'' took Atlanta to the Super Bowl for the first  
time in the franchise's 33-year history, but they still have 
another flight to make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have never had back-to-back winning seasons, a point  
raised quite often by coach Dan Reeves even as he was guiding 
Atlanta to the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come an awful long ways,'' Reeves said, after the  
extraordinary season ended with a 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. 
``What we're trying to do now is fight for home-field advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has ever played the NFL title game on its home field.  
The Falcons have a chance to be the first when the Super Bowl comes 
to the Georgia Dome on Jan. 30, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I'll remember most: getting a chance to be at the  
Super Bowl and see what it's like,'' defensive end Chuck Smith 
said. ``Next year, we have to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta got the offseason started Tuesday by making five players  
available to the Cleveland Browns for the expansion draft: safety 
Chris Bayne, running back Harold Green, tight end Ed Smith, 
linebacker Ben Talley and offensive lineman Dave Widell. 
</P>
<P>
	Widell played only one game, while Bayne and Green spent  
extensive time on the inactive list. Smith and Talley had limited 
roles as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Those players who return in 1999 can expect to find heightened  
expectations, a tougher schedule and an already long-in-the-tooth 
team that will be another year older. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, in particular, is starting to take on the look of  
the ``Over The Hill Gang,'' with five starters who will be 32 years 
or older by the start of next season. Average age of the entire 
unit: 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A youth movement is under way, centering around the team's last  
two No. 1 draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Michael Booker, the top choice in 1997, took on a  
larger role when injuries plagued starter Ronnie Bradford. 
Linebacker Keith Brooking, picked No. 1 last year, gradually worked 
his way into a regular role in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needed early on to study films and anticipate, take notes  
and understand,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``I think 
he needs to apply all the tools he has because he has unbelievable 
tools and is going to be a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking eventually figures to take over a regular spot at  
outside linebacker, while second-year player Henri Crockett is the 
heir apparent to Tuggle at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett are entering the final year of  
their contracts, and both will be 34 at the beginning of next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	While the corners -- Bradford and Booker on one side, Pro Bowler  
Ray Buchanan on the other -- are still in their 20s, how much longer 
can Eugene Robinson (36 in May) and William White (33 next month) 
keep producing at the safety positions? 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was a Pro Bowler and the unquestioned leader of the  
secondary, barking out orders on the field, reciting Bible passages 
in the locker room. But the Prophet's once-spotless reputation took 
a devastating blow when he was arrested on a charge of soliciting 
an undercover police officer for sex the night before the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be a man about it,'' Robinson said of his  
off-the-field scandal. ``I'll let my lawyer handle it, but I won't 
run from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Age also is a concern at receiver. Terance Mathis and Tony  
Martin were the second-most productive duo in the league -- 
combining for 2,317 yards -- but Mathis will be 32 in June and 
Martin turns 34 early next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line, led by Bob Whitfield at left tackle and  
rookie Ephraim Salaam on the right side, is a young group with 
plenty of room to improve. Twenty-four-year-old O.J. Santiago needs 
to work on his receiving skills, but seems set for a long, 
productive career at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the offense revolves around All-Pro running back  
Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler, a Pro Bowler for the 
second year in a row. Depth at those positions will be a major 
focus of the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record with 410 carries this season, mainly  
because his top backup was rookie Ken Oxendine, a seventh-round 
pick. Byron Hanspard, who missed the season with a knee injury, has 
barely started his rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was backed up by 45-year-old Steve DeBerg, so finding  
an experienced -- and much younger -- backup also will be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But those are questions for the days and months to come. For  
now, the Falcons want to relish the moment a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out of nowhere,'' Buchanan said. ``Nobody gave us a  
chance to do anything. But we believed in ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the process starts again.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 92.69 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes posted strong gains Wednesday as  
the Federal Reserve, as expected, left interest rates unchanged for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	After a shaky start, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.69  
to close at 9,366.61 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes moved higher on continued strength in  
Internet stocks. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 10.10 to 1,272.09 , 
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 29.99 to 
2,493.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were on a Fed-watch for much of the day. Although they  
didn't really expect it, there was a chance that the Fed would 
respond to recent reports of a robust economy by raising rates to 
cool things down, something that would increase corporate borrowing 
costs and could send the economy and corporate profits retreating. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing against a tightening was the concern that higher rates  
could choke off consumer buying, which many economists believe has 
propelled the economy and the stock market to unprecedented 
expansion. In addition, any Fed action that would slow the U.S. 
economy would only add to the global economic woes that already 
have engulfed Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Fed's decision was disclosed at 2:15 p.m. EST,  
investors could refocus on whether the generally strong corporate 
earnings reports of recent weeks, which covered the fourth quarter 
of 1998, will hold up in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	More arcane issues also are on investors' minds. Greg Nie, a  
technical analyst at Everen Securities said market-watchers are 
worried about indicators like the ratio of advancing issues to 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on days when the popular indexes gained, decliners have  
often outnumbered advancers, Nie noted. On Wednesday, when the 
index were sharply higher, advancers had only a small lead. 
</P>
<P>
	While market indexes continue to be pushed higher by the strong  
performance of high-profile, big companies, particularly in the 
Internet sector, the rest of the market isn't following, Nie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even problems at ETrade, a leading online trading service that  
was unable to transact business for portions of the trading day, 
failed to knock the Internet sector off course. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ETrade shares dropped 3 points to 55 1/4, Yahoo! jumped  
35 1/8 to 358 1/16, after its chief executive spoke encouragingly 
Tuesday about the outlook for the Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber climbed 1 5/8 to 52. The  
company announced an alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber 
Industries Ltd. and fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' 
expectations. Separately, the company announced a worldwide 
cost-cutting effort that will eliminate up to 2,800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 2 3/8 to 91 3/4, and Chase rose 2 5/8 to  
79 3/8 on rumors that Chase was about to acquire Morgan. The companies 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks also rose after the Fed left interest  
rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.48 to 598.58,  
and the American Stock Exchange's market value index was up 3.64 at 
713.27. In composite trading, volume on the NYSE was 1.05 billion 
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's 1.01 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 2.00 to  
423.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, the Nikkei 226 index in Tokyo fell 1.31 percent, the  
DAX in Frankfurt dropped 1.57 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London 
declined 1.21 percent, and the CAC in Paris fell 1.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seemingly unstoppable U.S. economy should  
keep rolling along this year even as the global economic turmoil 
pushes America's trade deficit to another record high, the Clinton 
administration predicted today. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the annual ``Economic Report of the President,'' the  
administration said the economy seemed well-positioned for 
continued growth in part because inflation is at a significantly 
lower level now than at the same period in the country's two other 
lengthy expansions, in the 1960s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, on the verge of another American century, our economy is  
at the pinnacle of power and success,'' President Clinton 
proclaimed in his message transmitting the report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion, unlike some previous ones, is both wide and  
deep,'' Clinton said, noting wage gains among a number of 
disadvantaged groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages for blacks and Hispanics have posted rapid gains in the  
past two years, according to the report, prepared by the 
president's Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, employment rates among male high school dropouts,  
single women with children and immigrants have all increased, the 
council said. Hourly wages for men in the bottom 10 percent of wage 
earners have increased by 6 percent since 1993, after adjusting for 
inflation, after having fallen during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration economists gave credit for the turnaround to the  
long recovery pushing unemployment down to a three-decade low last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you run a strong economy long enough, it really does get  
down to the bottom,'' said Rebecca Blank, one of three economists 
on the council. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's forecast projected that overall growth, as  
measured by the gross domestic product, would decline to 2.4 
percent this year, a significant slowdown after the 3.9 percent 
expansion in 1998. With last year's growth, the economy wrapped up 
a three-year stretch of the best growth performance since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But CEA Chairman Janet Yellen noted that inflation in the  
current expansion is much better-behaved than in the other two 
lengthy periods without recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the 1982-89 period and the 1961-69 periods, inflation  
started to rise significantly by the seventh year, sowing the seeds 
for recessions as the Federal Reserve stepped in to combat rising 
price pressures with interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion has been not only long, but excellent,  
particularly in its record on inflation,'' Yellen told reporters at 
a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The current expansion is the longest in peacetime history and if  
it lasts until next February it will become the longest on record, 
surpassing the 106 months of the 1961-69 recovery, a period that 
covered the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The good performance on inflation last year, when consumer  
prices rose just 1.6 percent, was helped by the Asian crisis, which 
pushed one-third of the globe into recession and triggered steep 
price drops for oil and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration predicted that inflation would rise slightly  
this year, to 2.3 percent, while unemployment, now 4.3 percent, was 
expected to increase slightly because of the growth slowdown, to 
4.9 percent at the end of the year. The administration's 
projections are in line with private economists' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in overall economic growth expected this year will  
result from a slowing in consumer spending and business investment, 
two of the driving forces behind the recovery, and a further 
expansion in the trade deficit, which the administration said would 
probably set another record. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slowdown, Yellen said a recession is unlikely,  
although some unforeseen event, such as a huge stock market 
correction that forced a bigger-than-expected retrenchment by 
consumers, could topple the economy into a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Some private economists are forecasting a recession year because  
of the disruptions they expect from the Year 2000 computer problem, 
when some older computer programs will misread 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's advisers, however, said that all the work being  
done to upgrade both private industry and government computers 
could actually boost GDP growth slightly this year and will lessen 
the chances of a serious disruption to the U.S. economy next 
January.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers confronted with  
rip-snorting, possibly inflationary, economic growth in the United 
States but continued risk of spillover from fragile financial 
conditions overseas decided to leave short-term interest rates 
unchanged today. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's monetary policy panel -- the Federal Open  
Market Committee -- ended a two-day, closed-door meeting by 
signaling it had left the benchmark rate on overnight loans between 
banks at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been at that level, a four-year low, since Nov. 17. The Fed  
had lowered it from 5.5 percent in three quarter-point moves over a 
seven-week span to insulate the U.S. economy from the turmoil then 
rocking financial markets following the collapse of the Russian 
ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, financial markets have become more stable and the  
economy has continued to grow at a surprisingly robust rate. During 
the final three months of last year, it shot up at a 5.6 percent 
annual rate, the strongest in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In congressional testimony last month, Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan said the economy ``has continued to grow more rapidly 
than can be accommodated on an ongoing basis.'' He said the growth 
continued to shrink the pool of available workers and, under those 
conditions, labor costs cannot be expected to remain in check 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But policy-makers apparently decided that world financial  
turmoil -- which last month spread to Brazil, causing a sharp 
devaluation in its currency -- still posed enough of a threat to the 
U.S. economy and financial markets to make raising rates risky. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem is that an increase in rates could touch off a sharp  
drop in the U.S. stock market. That, in turn, could quickly 
snowball into big trouble in the so-called real economy, where 
Americans earn their living and buy cars, homes, haircuts and 
cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that stock prices are driving consumer spending  
to an extent I don't think we have seen before,'' said economist 
Norman Robertson of Smithfield Trust Co. in Pittsburgh. ``And so 
the Fed is indeed over a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending by Americans not only is propelling the U.S. economy,  
it's fueling the export sales that are the one bright spot for much 
of the rest of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``That spending is very dependent on high stock prices and easy  
credit,'' said economist William A. Brown of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. 
``Were there to be a reverse in financial markets ... I think you'd 
be surprised at how quickly we could move from a world of 
surprising strength to a world of surprising weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe just such a reversal is entirely  
possible as waning world demand increasingly crimps the profits of 
American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, someday, the price of a share of stock has to be  
related to a company's earnings,'' said economist Carl R. 
Tannenbaum of LaSalle Banks in Chicago. ``And corporate earnings 
are really very flat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, for now, the U.S. stock market is holding its own. About 15  
minutes before the Fed announced the conclusion of today's meeting, 
the Dow Jones industrial average was up 72 points at 9,346. That's 
nearly 2 percent higher than the start of the year, on top of a 16 
percent gain last year. The market showed little reaction to 
today's expected announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last month that  
rescuing the market was not, and is not, the central bank's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is the maximum sustainable growth of the U.S.  
economy, not particular levels of asset prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Greenspan acknowledged that the stock market's  
impact on consumer spending has become ``real and significant.'' A 
severe drop in stock prices ``could lead to a considerable 
weakening of consumer demand,'' which accounts for two-thirds of 
the nation's economic activity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lobos Starting Forward Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The transient career of New Mexico  
forward Damion Walker has found another exit. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, one of the nation's top high school players four years  
ago, was suspended indefinitely Wednesday by New Mexico coach Dave 
Bliss for violating team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss, whose No. 17 ranked Lobos (17-5) have lost three of their  
last four and are struggling to stay in contention for an NCAA 
tournament bid, would not elaborate on the reason for the 
suspension or on what rules Walker violated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bliss said it had nothing to do with Walker's play this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he's had some ups and downs, Damion's basketball is not  
the focus of the suspension,'' Bliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss also didn't rule out the possibility of Walker rejoining  
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fairness to Damion, this suspension is indefinite,'' Bliss  
said. ``The team will miss him and we still consider him part of 
the team. I had a conversation with Damion today and I feel he 
understands. Hopefully, things will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he wasn't told what he needed to do to get back on  
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I agree with it (suspension)? No, I don't agree with it,''  
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Dallas (Texas) Lincoln High School, Walker was a  
McDonald's All American his senior season. He signed with TCU and 
was an immediate impact player. He was named the Southwest 
Conference's Newcomer of the Year and was the second highest 
scoring freshman in the country, while averaging 20.5 points and 
8.8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	His scoring and playing time declined in his sophomore year and  
after that season the 6-foot-7, 225-pound power forward transferred 
to New Mexico. He sat out last season and was expected to team up 
with Lobo center Kenny Thomas to give New Mexico a formidable 
inside game this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't happened.  
</P>
<P>
	While Thomas has averaged 17 points and 10.6 rebounds a game,  
Walker has struggled both on offense and defense and his playing 
time has steadily declined. He played just 8 minutes, scored 2 
points and had no rebounds in the Lobos' 57-39 loss to Utah on 
Monday. He was averaging 10.5 points and 4.4 rebounds for 22 games, 
but his numbers in seven Western Athletic Conference games were 7.4 
points and 4 rebounds a game.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Faces House Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Senate Republicans weighing a formal  
declaration that President Clinton provided false grand jury 
testimony, House managers in Clinton's impeachment trial are 
questioning a White House aide who says he heard the president 
refer to Monica Lewinsky as ``the stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Blumenthal's deposition today marks the last of three  
witnesses called by House prosecutors who hope to bolster their 
case that witnesses should be questioned on the Senate floor. But 
senators who viewed Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped deposition showed 
little enthusiasm Tuesday for hearing her live. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors who questioned presidential pal Vernon Jordan  
at the Capitol on Tuesday elicited some testimony they felt could 
help their case for live testimony, sources familiar with the 
testimony said. Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney who found 
Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York and a lawyer, altered his account of 
a breakfast meeting with the former White House intern that 
prosecutors have focused on, according to the sources, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Blumenthal, his value in the Senate trial rests in his  
testimony about a conversation at the start of the Lewinsky scandal 
last year in which Clinton said he had rebuffed Ms. Lewinsky after 
she ``came at me and made a sexual demand on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that  
she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it 
and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she 
wouldn't be the stalker anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stalker moniker swiftly became a news story staple, always  
attributed to unidentified sources. In grand jury testimony, 
Blumenthal denied having passed along the information to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers are trying to show that Clinton's motive was to  
feed a false account to his aides that would find its way into the 
investigation of prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Republicans looking to the end of the  
impeachment trial are weighing a formal declaration that Clinton 
``willfully provided false and misleading testimony'' to Starr's 
grand jury last summer, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are laboring over a draft ``fact-finding'' document  
that also says Clinton engaged in a course of conduct designed to 
``alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of 
evidence and testimony'' in the sexual harassment lawsuit that 
Paula Jones filed against him, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the two forms of the proposal makes a finding that  
Clinton committed perjury or obstructed justice, as alleged in the 
articles of impeachment passed by the House. Republicans hope to 
attract the support of at least a few Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Olympia Snowe said  
today the final disposition of the case should include a Senate 
recognition that Clinton committed wrongdoing -- even though there 
are not enough votes to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Hatch said the  
best way would be for the Senate to adjourn the trial with a 
finding ``that says he did lie under oath and he did commit 
obstruction of justice. You don't accuse him of any criminal 
activity ... (but) recognize the House vote as the highest form of 
condemnation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe said most senators want a yes-or-no vote on the articles  
of impeachment. After that vote, she said, the Senate needs to 
recognize that Clinton committed wrongdoing and make that finding 
``part of the indelible record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said such a finding would  
violate the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition, Jordan gave ground on testimony from a year  
ago that he never had breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky, who said the 
meal was memorable because she understood Jordan to be suggesting 
she should destroy drafts of notes she'd written to Clinton. 
Confronted with a receipt for the breakfast, Jordan conceded to 
House prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., that the breakfast 
occurred, but remained adamant he never instructed or suggested 
that Ms. Lewinsky destroy any love letters, said sources familiar 
with his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also said for the first time that the former intern  
called him to discuss her affidavit denying a sexual relationship 
with the president. Jordan said he listened to Ms. Lewinsky and 
suggested she talk to her private attorney but asserted he had no 
reason to believe the affidavit was false because he never believed 
she had a sexual relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan asserted that Clinton was directly behind his efforts to  
find Ms. Lewinsky a job but that the effort was never designed to 
buy her silence, sources familiar with the testimony said. In the 
initial days of the scandal a year ago, Jordan said it was 
presidential secretary Betty Currie who asked him to initiate the 
job search. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers said they would press ahead for calling witnesses  
to the Senate floor, despite the lack of startling new revelations 
from Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never felt we needed any bombshell,'' House Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said. ``What we need is to validate 
the record'' on alleged perjury and obstruction of justice and ``it 
is our intention to seek live witnesses.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Continue Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets fell Wednesday amid  
bad corporate news and signals that the region's financial troubles 
are far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks fell for the third consecutive day on continued  
concern over surging domestic interest rates and the Japanese 
currency's rise against the U.S. dollar. The higher interest rates 
are making the yen more attractive to investors, but a higher yen 
could harm profits for Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.52 points,  
or 1.31 percent, closing at 14,161.31. The Nikkei has fallen 337.94 
points this week, including Tuesday's 1 percent drop of 115.35 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 112.38 yen, down 0.80 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level 
of 112.05 yen overnight. Earlier, the dollar fell to an intraday 
low of 111.79 yen -- the dollar's lowest level since mid January. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares were dragged lower by banking companies  
that are losing money in China. The blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 
82.87 points, or 0.87 percent, to 9,419.85. 
</P>
<P>
	The session was otherwise quiet, with many investors staying out  
while awaiting news on any U.S. interest rate changes, expected 
after a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hong Kong banks have been hit by mounting unrecoverable  
debts from entities in mainland China. On Wednesday, International 
Bank Of Asia Ltd. reported that its 1998 net profit plummeted 80 
percent, a day after larger Bank of East Asia announced a 56 
percent decline in annual profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, banking shares also took a beating as investors  
worried about mounting problem loans after Bangkok Bank PCL, the 
country's largest commercial bank, reported nonperforming loans 
equivalent to 48 percent its total at year end. 
</P>
<P>
	Bangkok's benchmark SET index lost 9.01 points, or 2.6 percent,  
to close at 338.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, the key index fell to a new 32-month low on news that  
a legislator who also is a top businessman bounced checks in a 
high-profile case that raised concerns over links between commerce 
and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index closed down 5.78 points, or 0.1  
percent, at 5,743.86, the lowest level since May 22, 1996, when it 
finished at 5,732.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Liu Ping-wei bounced checks of 200 million Taiwan  
dollars (U.S. $6.2 million) as the Hai Shan business group he heads 
suffered from a property market slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher, boosted by the rise in  
shares of international call operator PT Indosat and a stronger 
currency. The JSX Composite Index rose 5.392 points, or 1.3 
percent, to 410.556. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell on concerns over unfavorable  
loan growth data released Tuesday. The benchmark Composite Index 
fell 10.71 points, or 1.9 percent, to 568.84. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose on strong foreign demand for key  
index heavyweights led by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. 
The PSE index rose 32.09 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,007.38. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares in South Korea fell on lingering worries over the  
economic crises in Russia and Brazil. The Kospi index plunged 2.5 
percent, or 13.95 points, to 553.33. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices fell on concern over corporate profits.  
The Straits Times Index fell 19.80 points, or 1.4 percent, to at 
1,366.79. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares rose on stronger commodity prices and  
anticipation of stronger consumer spending. The All Ordinaries 
index closed at 2,918.2, up 11.2 points, or 0.38 percent.

<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares ended higher, led by market  
bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital

<HEADLINE> Georgia Girls Sports Escorts Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- On college football signing day, Audra Towson  
scans the list of Georgia Bulldogs signees looking for familiar 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few years, she'll watch with pride the progress of  
the players Georgia signed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Towson has never scored a touchdown or made a tackle, but what  
she does on Friday nights in January has a lot to do with how the 
Bulldogs fare on Saturday afternoons each fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Towson, 22, is president of the Georgia Girls, a group of about  
70 female students who spend their winter weekends going to dinner 
with high school football stars and showing them around town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like hostesses,'' said Dominique Holloman, a sophomore.  
``You could think of it as a tour guide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools, mostly in the South, have similar organizations --  
the Bama Belles (Alabama), Vol Hostesses (Tennessee), Gator Guides 
(Florida) and Tiger PAWS (Clemson). 
</P>
<P>
	Some people say such groups amount to a university-sponsored  
escort service. Tennessee fans taunted Georgia Girls at a game last 
season, insinuating that they used sex to sign players. And some 
Georgia professors also have been critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that these hospitality teams are all female and  
the football players are all male sets up the expectation that what 
is being given out is sex appeal,'' said Victoria Davion, who 
teaches a feminist philosophy class. ``They're selling sex appeal 
as an enticement to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recruits sometimes compare which school has the prettiest  
hostesses, Bulldogs linebacker Adrian Hollingshed says, but the 
players don't expect relationships with the women. And the Georgia 
Girls know a pretty smile isn't going to persuade a player to 
commit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the people that we recruit are intelligent. They're  
coming for the coaches, the facilities and the football team,'' 
sophomore Sanshia Patrick said. ``We're just there to make sure 
they don't have a terrible visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls say while some mild flirting may go on, it  
never goes beyond that. Many of them are in their 20s and wouldn't 
consider dating teen-agers, no matter how good they are at 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls know there's a fine line that they cannot cross,''  
Towson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools stay away from escort groups altogether, or make  
them coed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that, and we won't,'' said Bob Chamiel,  
coordinator of football operations at Notre Dame. ``I think 
everybody has their own way of recruiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Michigan, a group of male and female volunteers do office  
work for the program and pass out name tags to recruits on game 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls stay busy in January, when recruits make  
official campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fridays, they dress up for dinner with the players. Each  
woman takes basic football lessons and studies up on her recruit -- 
where he's from, his parents' names and his position -- to keep the 
conversation flowing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls accompany the recruits, players and coaches to  
dinner again on Saturday nights, sometimes followed by a tour of 
Athens' nightlife. Because the players are underage, bars are 
rarely on the itinerary, with the usual destinations being 
basketball games or bowling alleys. 
</P>
<P>
	During the unofficial visits in the fall, the women sit with the  
recruits at games, show them around campus and answer questions 
about student life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play a part in making them feel more comfortable at the  
school,'' says Haley Cagle, a vice president. ``Sometimes they'll 
confide stuff in us that they don't tell the coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some current players say the Georgia Girls made their tense  
recruiting visits easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls we got here are real informative,'' freshman  
linebacker William Witherspoon said. ``They come up to you and ask 
if you have any questions so you don't just sit there wondering 
when you should ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The application process to become a Georgia Girl is competitive.  
Last year, more than 200 girls applied for about 80 spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look for girls that are vivacious, outgoing and  
informative,'' Towson said.	   There aren't a lot of rules regarding behavior, with the Georgia 
Girls being trusted to use their best judgment. One thing that is 
strictly forbidden is wearing anything other than the school colors 
on game days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even get picky if it is not the color red we want,'' Towson  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Georgia Girls say they joined the group to become  
part of the football program -- perhaps the most dominant aspect of 
campus life in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like more than just a person in the stands,'' Holloman  
said. ``I'm actually part of something, not just an onlooker. It's 
kind of like being the ultimate fan.''

<HEADLINE> Union Files Grievance for Hernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The baseball players association has filed a  
grievance on behalf of reliever Xavier Hernandez, who signed a 
$250,000, one-year contract with Houston after Baltimore voided his 
$2.7 million, two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles voided the contract after saying the 33-year-old  
right-hander flunked a physical. Arbitrator Richard Bloch is 
scheduled to hear arguments May 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 6-6 with one save and a 3.57 ERA last year, is  
seeking the difference between his deals with the Orioles and 
Astros. As part of his contract with Houston, he can earn an 
additional $250,000 in roster bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch will hear the case as an interim arbitrator. Players and  
owners are searching for a new arbitrator to replace Cornell 
professor Dana Eischen, who was hired in December 1997, ruled last 
May against J.D. Drew's grievance seeking free agency and then 
quit, effective last Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren didn't want to address the  
matter. The team was said to be concerned with the condition of the 
pitcher's right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those things I can't comment on because there's  
a grievance pending,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Differ on How To Fix Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's no dispute that many of America's  
schools are falling apart, but President Clinton and Republicans 
who run Congress disagree on which schools to fix first and how to 
pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton is asking for new tax credits  
for bonds that would raise $25 billion for school modernization. 
Republicans like the concept, but they contend that too much of the 
president's plan targets inner-city schools at the expense of 
growing suburbs and neglected rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids in rural America and suburban America need new schools,  
too,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. ``Indeed, suburban areas may need new schools 
the most since population growth in suburbs continues to explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their need for repairs was highlighted when the American Society  
of Civil Engineers last year gave public schools an F in a survey 
of the nation's greatest infrastructure problems. It was the only 
sector to get the lowest possible grade. 
</P>
<P>
	That report found a third of all elementary and secondary  
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class 
in substandard buildings. Almost half lacked the wiring to 
accommodate computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some recent examples: A high school track team in suburban  
Burnside, Ill., held practices at a prison with better facilities. 
At some New York City schools, urinals were hidden behind plywood 
so bathrooms could become classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our school buildings are literally crumbling,'' said Luther W.  
Graef, president of the engineers' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimated renovation and repair of America's schools  
would cost $112 billion, with $60 billion more needed to provide 
space for an expected 3 million new students over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than asking Congress for sharp increases in direct  
spending -- something the GOP is reluctant to do -- Clinton proposed 
Monday in his fiscal 2000 budget the creation of tax credits aimed 
at spurring investors to buy two types of bonds that would raise 
almost $25 billion over two years for school repair and 
modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	Total cost of the tax credits is pegged at $3.7 billion over  
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the National School Boards Association in a speech  
Monday that the credits would help provide money to fix up 5,000 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many schools I've been in where there were as  
many kids back in the house trailers as there were in the regular 
classrooms,'' Clinton said. ``I don't know how many I've been in 
where there were rooms closed off because the buildings were 
breaking down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One type of bond would raise $22 billion over two years, with  
tax credits paying the interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the money would be set aside for up to 125 school districts  
with the most low-income students. The other half would be divvied 
up among the states -- again based on the number of low-income 
students statewide -- for state officials to spend as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $400 million would be set aside for certain needy  
native American schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials say the arrangement should blunt  
GOP criticism that the bond proceeds would benefit primarily big 
cities -- often Democratic Party territory -- instead of addressing 
growth in the suburbs where more Republicans live. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal would address both of those problems,'' said  
department spokeswoman Julie Green. ``The way we're submitting the 
proposal, the bonding authority would be split half and half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans do not see it that way. Archer is considering an  
alternative that would relax certain federal bond rules to make 
existing tax-exempt bonds for school construction more attractive 
to investors -- a plan he says would spread the money more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe all students in all districts, not just the ones  
the president picks, should have the same opportunities for new 
schools,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP also is questioning the second part of Clinton's  
proposal that would raise an estimated $2.4 billion over two years 
by expanding an existing program providing tax credits to bond 
investors for projects that include matching money from private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Such bonds, begun in 1997, have not proven popular on Wall  
Street, mainly because they are hamstrung by complex restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only been a couple of deals,'' said John Vogt, vice  
president of the Bond Market Association. ``Our priority is to 
emphasize the existing municipal bond market. We think that's an 
effective part of a school modernization program.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Chooses New Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- When the Brazilian government  
dismissed Central Bank president Francisco Lopes and replaced him 
with a former George Soros associate, it seemed to be giving 
currency speculators a taste of their own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Arminio Fraga worked for the billionaire  
investor Soros, advising him on emerging markets such as Brazil's. 
His appointment Tuesday was the government's latest move to halt 
the financial crisis that has gripped Brazil and threatens to 
buffet other Latin American economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``By bringing to the Central Bank his experience on the other  
side of the table, he will certainly be an asset for Brazil,'' 
Finance Minister Pedro Malan told Globo News on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's appointment was generally well received. Brazil's  
currency, the real, strengthened on the news and while the stock 
market declined, losses were less than might be expected with such 
a shift. 
</P>
<P>
	The real was trading today at 1.75 to the dollar, down slightly  
from Tuesday but much stronger than Monday's 1.91. Stocks on the 
Sao Paolo exchange opened slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	During Lopes' short-lived presidency -- he was at the helm less  
than a month, the real had lost more than 40 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first impression this unexpected change may give to the  
international community is one of total chaos,'' said Jose Luciano 
Dias, a Brasilia-based political analyst. ``But in a few days it 
will become clear that the change was necessary for Brazil to 
regain its credibility and the confidence of the international 
financial community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga, who arrived in Brasilia on Tuesday afternoon, headed  
straight for the Finance Ministry where he met with Malan and 
International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Stanley 
Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan, Fischer and a team of IMF economists spent much of  
Tuesday reviewing the terms of a $41.5 billion IMF-led aid package 
finalized last November in light of Brazil's currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the switch, the government took pains to say that  
the foreign exchange policy initiated by Lopes just three weeks ago 
would remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes threw his support  
behind the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He, more than anyone else, understands the actions of  
speculators,'' Magalhaes told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the support, Fraga has no easy task ahead of him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fraga's nomination doesn't mean that all of Brazil's problems  
are solved,'' said Marcelo Guterman, fund manager with Lloyd's 
Asset Management. ``We need new direction, the IMF accord is being 
reviewed and if the policies are bad, no one man will hold it 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And opposition politicians criticized Fraga's proximity to  
Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has just handed over the Central Bank to one of the  
biggest speculators in the world,'' leftist Workers' Party 
president Jose Dirceu told reporters in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has taken pains to stress that Fraga is no longer  
associated with Soros. Fraga was a managing director at Soros Fund 
Management, a private New York-based investment management firm, 
where his main responsibility was investing strategies for emerging 
markets. Earlier he worked for New York-based Salomon Brothers and 
also taught at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Fraga served as the Central Bank's director  
of international affairs and was involved in earlier negotiations 
with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he is confirmed, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho Neto of  
the Central Bank will serve as interim president and Fraga will 
serve as a special adviser to Malan. Senate confirmation hearings 
won't begin until Congress reconvenes on Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> House Wants Live Impeach Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting Monica Lewinsky on the impeachment  
trial witness stand will let senators look her in the eye -- but 
psychologists say that's a chancy way to judge someone's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, studies show that to spot liars through their demeanor,  
most people might just as well flip a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do better at lie detection if they can't see the  
face,'' says Brandeis University psychology professor Leslie A. 
Zebrowitz. ``People can control their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show most people do ``a tiny bit better than chance'' in  
judging someone's truthfulness by their facial expressions, body 
language and the tone of their voice, Zebrowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like Pinocchio's nose'' to help judge whether  
someone is telling the truth, adds Bella DePaulo, a University of 
Virginia psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal to testify in person 
at the Senate, or at least for the Senate as a whole to watch the 
videotaped testimony about President Clinton's efforts to hide his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., urged senators to ``look them in the  
eye'' to judge their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that a trial involves live witnesses,'' Rep. James  
Rogan, R-Calif., said Wednesday after questioning Blumenthal behind 
closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	But DePaulo said more than 100 psychological studies have shown  
people can correctly identify a liar by studying his or her 
demeanor only 54 percent of the time on average, not much better 
than flipping a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even professional lie-catchers -- judges, police officers, CIA  
polygraphers -- generally did no better than chance in a 1991 study 
by Paul Ekman and Maureen O'Sullivan of the University of 
California at San Francisco. Only Secret Service agents could 
consistently spot a deceiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people simply are great liars. They know people think a  
liar won't look them in the eye -- so they make sure to look someone 
in the eye while telling a falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbal clues tend to be better indicators of lying because  
they're harder to control, Zebrowitz said. Someone's voice pitch 
might get higher, or they may pause more often than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekman's book, ``Telling Lies,'' said he often wisecracks that  
the criminal justice system seems designed to make it hard to spot 
liars by their demeanor. Suspects have plenty of time to rehearse 
their answers and may have repeated a false account so often they 
start to believe it, he wrote. An innocent suspect's fear of not 
being believed may be misinterpreted as a sign of guilt, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, courts routinely instruct jurors to look at witnesses'  
demeanor to judge whether they are credible. And the Constitution's 
Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to be 
confronted by their accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our adversarial system is based on the idea that a jury can  
assess the truth by seeing and listening to witnesses,'' said 
American University law professor Thomas Sargentich. ``I think we 
ought to recognize its limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C., criminal defense lawyer William Moffitt said  
squirming on the witness stand may not be the sign of a lie, but 
the way a witness tells a story can help jurors decide whether it's 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	He said conversations with jurors after trials show they find it  
significant when a witness leaves out some information or 
emphasizes one part of a story over another. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-examination also helps when witnesses are confronted with  
their previous inconsistent statements, Moffitt said.

<HEADLINE> Networks Pour On the Miniseries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What do Lauren Bacall, the 1960s, alien  
invaders and Winnie-the-Pooh have in common? They're part of the 
fierce February ``sweeps'' competition for television viewers and 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Big ratings mean bigger advertising bucks for TV stations, and  
the networks do their best to accommodate with specials, movies 
and, for a change, consecutive new episodes of sitcoms and dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 4-March 3 bonanza may not be enough to banish the  
winter chill, but it warms our heart when television goes out of 
its way for us. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are highlights (all times EST):  
</P>
<P>
 *MOVIES AND MINIS: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Roswell: The Aliens Attack,'' a drama based on speculation  
that a crash site at Roswell, N.M., is linked to UFOs; 8 p.m. 
Thursday, Feb. 4, UPN. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Night Ride Home,'' features Rebecca DeMornay, Keith  
Carradine and Ellen Burstyn in a drama about a family shattered by 
the death of a child; 9 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 7, CBS.

<P>
	-- ``The 60s,'' a two-part miniseries, mixes history and fiction  
(and music, lots of it) to revisit that tumultuous decade. Charles 
Dutton, Jerry O'Connell, Jordana Brewster and Leonard Roberts star; 
9 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 7, and Monday, Feb. 8, NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Murder at 75 Birch'' stars Melissa Gilbert and Gregory  
Harrison in a fact-based drama about a woman who suspects her 
brother-in-law may have murdered his wife; 9 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 9, 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Deep in My Heart,'' a drama that follows the journey of a  
black girl born to a white mother in the early 1960s and given up 
for adoption, with Anne Bancroft, Lynn Whitfield and Gloria Reuben; 
9 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 14, CBS. 
</P>
<P>

T. Nelson, inspired by the experiences of police officer Tom 
Walker, author of ``Fort Apache, the Bronx;'' 9 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 
14, and Monday, Feb. 15, NBC. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medicare Won't Cover Drug Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Scott Baumgartner has good news and bad  
news for his elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A 
revolutionary new drug can treat their disease, but it costs up to 
$1,000 a month and Medicare won't pay for it -- or any prescription 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame to have to say, `Well, here's this medicine' --  
they've all read about it, they know it might help them -- `but you 
can't do it,''' Baumgartner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some patients in his Spokane, Wash., practice are taking the  
drug, Enbrel, for a few weeks at a time as they can afford it. 
Others simply stay with inferior treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the government health insurance program for 39 million  
elderly and disabled Americans, has never paid for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton as well as many Republicans would like to  
change that. But the costs could be daunting for a program already 
facing a shaky financial future. 
</P>
<P>
	New drugs are among the greatest medical advances in recent  
years, reducing heart attacks and cancer deaths and even slowing 
the progress of AIDS. As a result, the lack of prescription 
coverage is becoming a bigger problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If elderly Americans are not getting the medicines they need,  
it's costing the nation a lot of dollars for increased medical 
care,'' said Dr. Raymond Woosley, who heads the pharmacology 
department at Georgetown University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel is an extreme example. But the costs of older drugs also  
can add up: one common blood thinner used to avoid blood clots in 
heart and stroke patients costs $60 a month and a common heart drug 
$180. Older Americans take five or six prescription drugs on 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he wants to add drug coverage to Medicare --  
assuming he and lawmakers can find a way to ensure the program can 
provide the benefits it already promises. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has suggested using some of the expected federal  
budget surplus for Medicare. Even so, Medicare is expected to run 
short of cash as the huge baby boom generation retires, entering 
the program in waves around 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	That has members of a commission advising the president and  
Congress on Medicare searching for options. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would like to have a drug program if we can find a way  
to pay for it,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates about two-thirds of senior citizens  
have some drug coverage. Most get it through retiree health 
benefits offered by former employers, or through supplemental 
policies known as Medigap that they buy on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Others get coverage through the small number of Medicare HMOs,  
or through Medicaid public assistance for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the percentage of large companies offering health benefits  
to their retirees has dropped by 20 percent in the 1990s. And a 
recent Consumer Reports study found Medigap prices have gone up as 
much as a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, HMOs squeezed by Medicare's cost-cutting are curbing  
drug reimbursements offered as perks to attract the elderly, or 
limiting them to cheaper generic or older brand-name drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: The newest drugs, expensive because they're  
developed at tremendous cost to companies trying to return profits 
to investors, are out of reach for many. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that Medicare will  
actually lose money in the long run if the elderly cannot get the 
best medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent study, for example, attributed a rash of broken hips  
to retirees taking older antidepressants, which are cheaper but can 
cause a drop in blood pressure and thus dizziness, Woosley said. 
Newer but more expensive antidepressants don't affect blood 
pressure as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``A prescription drug costs an awful lot less than a  
hospitalization,'' Woosley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the upfront expense of paying drug costs for the elderly is  
daunting. One government estimate found that adding even a modest 
benefit -- having Medicare pay, for example, 75 percent of their 
drug bills -- would cost at least $20 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, senior citizens are pressing hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can have the pretense of having an adequate  
health care program in the future without having drug coverage,'' 
said John Rother of AARP, the largest organization of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Medicare commission members also fear that if the  
government starts paying for retirees' drugs, corporate retirement 
benefits might dry up. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, they are considering another option: Requiring  
private insurers to offer better, cheaper drug benefits to seniors. 
Then, new Medicare subsidies could help the poorest get private 
coverage, so government spending would be limited to those who need 
it most.

<HEADLINE> House Wants Live Impeach Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting Monica Lewinsky on the impeachment  
trial witness stand will let senators look her in the eye -- but 
psychologists say that's a chancy way to judge someone's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, studies show that to spot liars through their demeanor,  
most people might just as well flip a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do better at lie detection if they can't see the  
face,'' says Brandeis University psychology professor Leslie A. 
Zebrowitz. ``People can control their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show most people do ``a tiny bit better than chance'' in  
judging someone's truthfulness by their facial expressions, body 
language and the tone of their voice, Zebrowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like Pinocchio's nose'' to help judge whether  
someone is telling the truth, adds Bella DePaulo, a University of 
Virginia psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon  
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal to testify in person 
at the Senate, or at least for the Senate as a whole to watch the 
videotaped testimony about President Clinton's efforts to hide his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., urged senators to ``look them in the  
eye'' to judge their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that a trial involves live witnesses,'' Rep. James  
Rogan, R-Calif., said Wednesday after questioning Blumenthal behind 
closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	But DePaulo said more than 100 psychological studies have shown  
people can correctly identify a liar by studying his or her 
demeanor only 54 percent of the time on average, not much better 
than flipping a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even professional lie-catchers -- judges, police officers, CIA  
polygraphers -- generally did no better than chance in a 1991 study 
by Paul Ekman and Maureen O'Sullivan of the University of 
California at San Francisco. Only Secret Service agents could 
consistently spot a deceiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people simply are great liars. They know people think a  
liar won't look them in the eye -- so they make sure to look someone 
in the eye while telling a falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbal clues tend to be better indicators of lying because  
they're harder to control, Zebrowitz said. Someone's voice pitch 
might get higher, or they may pause more often than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekman's book, ``Telling Lies,'' said he often wisecracks that  
the criminal justice system seems designed to make it hard to spot 
liars by their demeanor. Suspects have plenty of time to rehearse 
their answers and may have repeated a false account so often they 
start to believe it, he wrote. An innocent suspect's fear of not 
being believed may be misinterpreted as a sign of guilt, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, courts routinely instruct jurors to look at witnesses'  
demeanor to judge whether they are credible. And the Constitution's 
Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to be 
confronted by their accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our adversarial system is based on the idea that a jury can  
assess the truth by seeing and listening to witnesses,'' said 
American University law professor Thomas Sargentich. ``I think we 
ought to recognize its limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C., criminal defense lawyer William Moffitt said  
squirming on the witness stand may not be the sign of a lie, but 
the way a witness tells a story can help jurors decide whether it's 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	He said conversations with jurors after trials show they find it  
significant when a witness leaves out some information or 
emphasizes one part of a story over another. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-examination also helps when witnesses are confronted with  
their previous inconsistent statements, Moffitt said.

<HEADLINE> Bucks' Allen Negotiating Own Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- When Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen  
signs his six-year, $70.9 million contract extension, he won't have 
an agent skimming a multimillion-dollar cut off the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has done his own negotiating because the NBA's new labor  
agreement sets limits on what players can earn based on years of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks owner U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl took time off from the  
president's impeachment proceedings recently to meet with Allen, 
who said Wednesday the senator agreed to pay him the maximum salary 
allowed a third-year player: $9 million to start, with annual 
raises of 12.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same contract recently signed by Kobe Bryant, Allen  
Iverson, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Antoine Walker, all three-year 
stars who would have been eligible for free agency after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has hired celebrity lawyer Johnnie Cochran at $500 an hour  
to look over the deal, which he said could be finalized by next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's far different from the $2,836,000 he would have had to  
pay an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said in his case, at least, an agent was unnecessary.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can come in right now and say, `Well, we can get you  
this much,' '' Allen said. ``Because I know what everybody's limit 
is. So, that renders an agent in my situation moot, because there's 
nothing more that he can get for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, Allen doesn't think contract negotiations should be worth  
millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I got to this point where somebody can step in  
and say, `We're going to get the max for you, then we're going to 
take $1 million off the top,' '' Allen said. ``I feel like for what 
I've done to get to this point, I want to keep it in with the 
people that have gotten me here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks coach George Karl was thrilled that Allen was working  
without an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's wonderful,'' Karl said. ``I don't think there's a need  
for agents in today's game for rookies (who have a salary scale) or 
great players. You might need an agent for marketing purposes or 
advertising or merchandising or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But contract negotiations are simple stuff now.''  
</P>
<P>
	Doesn't it concern him that Allen would get bogged down with  
money matters instead of the business of playing basketball? 
</P>
<P>
	``You all think negotiating a big contract is bothersome,'' Karl  
said, chuckling. ``It's fun negotiating to be rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when Allen signs his extension, he'll be the richest player  
in franchise history. Glenn Robinson got a 10-year, $68.25 million 
contract as the top draft pick in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen and Robinson said they hope point guard Terrell Brandon  
decides to stay with them in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The new collective bargaining agreement stipulates other teams  
can't pay him as much as the Bucks, but Brandon wants to test free 
agency for the first time in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it one time before I retire,'' said Brandon, who  
hasn't ruled out staying in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon said he's already being courted -- by his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been taking me to lunch a little more often than  
usual,''. Brandon said. ``Glenn and Ray want me to end my career 
here, and it makes me feel good.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Stage Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- In a new blow to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch, rank-and-file IOC members mounted a revolt today 
against plans to strip them of voting rights in the selection of 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but  
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' Italian IOC 
member Mario Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said 42 IOC members had a breakfast meeting with IOC  
executive board members Wednesday to discuss the proposed new 
voting procedure for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``overwhelming majority'' of the members came out against the  
plan, Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in the history of the Olympic movement, the  
voice of the members is very, very loud,'' Pescante told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and the executive board announced Jan. 24 that the  
selection system would be overhauled as a result of the bribery 
scandals surrounding Salt Lake City's choice as host of the 2002 
Winter Games and other previous Olympic bids. 
</P>
<P>
	The board banned IOC member visits to the six 2006 candidates  
and proposed that the selection of the host city be made by a 
15-member panel rather than the full IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the proposal would be put to a special meeting of  
the assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible the general assembly will approve this  
proposal,'' Pescante said. ``I'm sure the executive board will have 
to find a new solution before then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said he and other members made a counter proposal: A  
small group of experts should narrow the field to two or three 
finalists 24 hours before the vote and let the full assembly choose 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general assembly must choose the city according to the  
charter,'' Pescante said. ``This would be a good solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the vote away from the general assembly is a radical  
move. The primary duty of IOC members has always been to choose 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a very strong inquiry into the corruption  
scandal to get rid of the bad apples,'' Pescante said. ``But it's 
necessary to respect our authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six European cities bidding for the 2006 Games are:  
Helsinki, Finland; Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; 
Turin, Italy; Zakopane, Poland; and Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection is scheduled to be made at an IOC session in  
Seoul, South Korea, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the new process for 2006 would be a trial. The  
long-term system for selecting host cities for the games of 2008 
and beyond would be decided after the 2006 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said some IOC members at the breakfast meeting charged  
that the proposed system favors Sion's candidacy. Many IOC members 
visited Sion during its unsuccessful bid for the 2002 Games, and 
rival cities view its proximity to IOC headquarters in Switzerland 
as an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said Samaranch did not attend the breakfast meeting,  
leaving vice presidents Keba Mbaye, Dick Pound, Pal Schmitt and 
other executive board members to sound out the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no response from the IOC leaders to the outcry  
from the members. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the executive board members were silent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pescante said he believes the executive board will come up with  
a ``face-saving'' solution before the March session. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they lose at the session, it would be a disaster for the  
president and the executive board,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the revolt, Pescante said the members remain in full  
support of Samaranch, who will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at the March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident in the president,'' Pescante said. ``He is  
the only man to lead us out of the tunnel. But he must understand 
that the time of under-the-table decisions is finished.''

<HEADLINE> Principal Beating Called Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white principal beaten outside his  
predominately Hispanic elementary school reportedly sought outside 
help to ease growing tensions twice before he was attacked this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's assault on 65-year-old Norman Bernstein, principal of  
Burton Elementary in the Panorama City section of the city, is 
being investigated as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was ambushed as he stepped from his car by two men who  
held a sharp object to his throat and punched him in the head, said 
police Detective David Escoto. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein described the men as Hispanics. One attacker told him,  
``We don't want you here, white principal,'' Escoto said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated and released from a local hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that  
Bernstein had asked the Anti-Defamation League last month for help 
in dealing with what he saw as growing anti-white sentiment at the 
750-pupil school. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted ``advice regarding what was potentially a  
discriminatory situation he felt he was experiencing,'' said Sue 
Stengel, a lawyer for the group. The ADL sent him complaint forms, 
but they were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein also called on Los Angeles Unified School District  
administrators for help, said Eli Brent, president of the 
principals union. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Bernstein was told he might be dismissed or demoted  
because his administration might be responsible for the unrest, 
Brent told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred as the nation's second-largest school  
district struggles with teaching 681,000 students from widely 
different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The school where the 
attack took place is 90 percent Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors can sometimes lead to racial tensions and  
misunderstandings, school officials said, but racially motivated 
violence against principals and teachers is rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers said some parents are upset that Bernstein is not  
Hispanic and does not speak Spanish. Others said the attack was 
simply a matter of disaffected individuals using the white-Hispanic 
issue to spread hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents at all schools say they want to change principals  
sometimes,'' said teacher's aide Pedro Mendoza, who rushed 
Bernstein to the hospital. ``But they wouldn't go to the extent of 
hurting an individual.''

<HEADLINE> Juror Says Plaintiff Got Ripped Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Bowen and his fellow jurors sat  
through two weeks of testimony in a civil case, then never got to 
pass judgment because the judge dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen is so sure the Joanne Bragg got a raw deal in the case  
that he has offered her a gift of $5,000 to help finance an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took an informal poll of his fellow jurors and they  
all agreed that Ms. Bragg deserved a judgment of at least $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wrong to take it away from the jury,'' he said of the  
judge's action. ``We are the ones who heard all the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg, whose lawsuit claimed a bank helped her ex-husband  
steal money from her, has never met Bowen but is thrilled by his 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when many people see jury service more as an  
inconvenience than a civic duty, Bowen said he never hesitated to 
step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my viewpoint, it's the right thing to do,'' said Bowen,  
who owns a Burbank firm that clears titles for mortgage companies. 
``I wanted to make sure she would ultimately get her day in 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time a juror has refused to drop a case. In  
Dalton, Ga., last year, a criminal court juror reluctantly voted to 
convict a man of molesting a 13-year-old boy, then spent his own 
money to hire an attorney to appeal. The alleged victim admitted he 
lied and the defendant was freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bowen's offer stands out.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of jurors in civil cases becoming that  
emotionally involved,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of the 
Loyola University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg's attorney probably can legally accept the juror's  
money since he did not ask for it, said Lynne Geminder, an ethics 
expert for the California Bar Association who also teaches ethics 
at Loyola University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg, a real estate broker in Hawthorne, 14 miles south of  
Los Angeles, sued Hawthorne Savings &AMP; Loan Association in December, 
claiming bank officers helped her ex-husband, Brian Oliver, steal 
an estimated $200,000 from their joint bank accounts from 1989 to 
1991. The two had owned and operated a construction business 
together until their divorce in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Bragg failed to prove that Hawthorne Savings caused her  
substantial damage, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William 
C. Beverly said when he dismissed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Heyman, lawyer for Hawthorne Savings, argued that Oliver  
used the money to pay off loans the couple had incurred jointly in 
their business-- not for his personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court said he hadn't taken any money he wasn't entitled  
to,'' Heyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Bowen shouldn't have reached any conclusion because  
the trial was aborted before the bank got to present its case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found that a little offensive,'' Heyman said. ``Courts  
admonish juries to keep an open mind until they hear both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg says that because of her court fight, she fell behind  
on mortgage payments and lost her four-bedroom, $300,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she lives in a converted garage behind her mother's house  
while her daughters, Amanda, 12, and Jessica, 9, sleep in the main 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to live in the same house as my kids,'' she said.  
``I have to try to get myself out of this mess.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Lobbies for High-Speed Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America Online is part of a lobbying coalition  
formed Wednesday with the aim of getting access to high-speed 
Internet and data lines controlled by cable TV companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the OpenNet coalition comes almost a week  
after the Federal Communications Commission decided not to open a 
proceeding that would force cable companies to share high-speed 
lines with their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the FCC said it would keep an eye on the matter to ensure  
that consumers' options for Internet service are not restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to the technology has pitted the cable industry against  
AOL and consumer and interest groups and has produced an intense 
lobbying battle over what the FCC and Congress should do. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition's ``scheme would surely slow broadband  
deployment,'' said National Cable Television Association President 
Decker Anstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to AOL, others involved in the coalition are:  
MindSpring Enterprises, Prodigy Communications Corp., Netscape, US 
West, MCI WorldCom, Cable &AMP; Wireless USA, Washington Association of 
Internet Service Providers, CyberRamp Internet Services, 
Bertelsmann Internet Services, ConnectNet and the Texas Internet 
Service Providers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	US West President Sol Trujillo, attending a conference here,  
told reporters that his company will press lawmakers for 
legislation giving companies access to cable's high-speed lines. He 
also said US West will seek legislation permitting it and the 
nation's four other Bell companies to move data across local 
calling boundaries, something they aren't allowed to do now. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL and MindSpring also were among groups urging the FCC to  
force cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. to provide rivals access 
to its high-speed lines as a condition of merging with AT&AMP;T. 
Analysts are saying the FCC is not expected to impose that 
condition on the merger.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Be Sentenced Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two men Mike Tyson attacked at a fender  
bender think the former heavyweight champ shouldn't go to jail. The 
prosecutor feels otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion that counts is that of Judge Stephen Johnson, who on  
Friday will determine whether Tyson's latest comeback is done after 
just one fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will sentence the fighter on two counts of second-degree  
assault, prompting a decision in Indiana on whether Tyson violated 
his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to jail here, it's much, much more likely he'll go  
to jail there,'' said Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson must determine whether Tyson is ``nothing less than a  
time bomb buried in our back yard'' -- as argued by Montgomery 
County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler -- or a ``different Mike'' 
who has taken well to therapy and has become a more caring person -- 
as put forth by his adviser Shelley Finkel and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after  
a minor three-car accident in the Washington suburb of 
Gaithersburg, Md. On Dec. 1, Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he 
neither protests the assault charges nor admits guilt -- and could 
receive up to 20 years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He acted inappropriately that day,'' Tyson's wife, Monica, who  
was driving when the accident occurred, told The Washington Post. 
``But he never intentionally struck anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, were paid  
an undisclosed amount to avoid a civil suit shortly before Tyson's 
plea. Both will be present Friday, ready to testify on Tyson's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any inference that we've been purchased or bribed is off the  
wall,'' said Saucedo's lawyer, Glenn Culpepper. ``From the very 
beginning, my client said he didn't want him to convicted, he 
wanted him to be helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyer, who will ask for probation, plans to call  
character witnesses, including one from a Washington homeless 
shelter where Tyson has been doing volunteer work. He will also 
point out Tyson's goodwill acts while training in Arizona -- he 
visited teen-age inmates and paid for the funeral of a 2-year-old 
girl shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who lives in Bethesda, Md., is undergoing therapy at  
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that his actions speak for themselves. You're seeing a  
different Mike,'' Finkel said. ``This was a minor accident. The two 
defendants settled with him and said they wanted him to get help, 
and that's what happened. What more could you ask?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution sees things differently. Gansler called Tyson a  
``bully'' who committed ``road rage.'' The prosecutor quoted the 
November Playboy interview in which Tyson called himself a 
``hateful individual'' and said, ``I know I'm going to blow one 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The state need go no further than the defendant's own  
statements to arrive at the conclusion that (he) is not only 
volatile, but dangerous,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also details Tyson's rape conviction in Indiana, seven  
brushes with the law as a juvenile, as well as the infamous fight 
in which Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in June 
1997. Tyson subsequently had his boxing license revoked for a year 
before returning to knock out Francois Botha in a comeback bout 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	What Gansler cannot do is ask the judge to put Tyson in jail.  
The no-contest plea agreement negotiated by Gansler's predecessor 
forbids that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler doesn't like that agreement. So he's been publicly  
saying Tyson should go to jail while telling the judge that Tyson 
should be sentenced to a ``period of executed incarceration,'' 
which technically could mean home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyer calls that a ``violation of the rules of  
professional conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the judge a dunce, that he doesn't read The Washington Post  
or the AP wire? ... I'm asking for straight probation. I really 
think he deserves it,'' Kemp said.

<HEADLINE> Planning Crucial To Saving Farms / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTERVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- Doctors, lawyers, teachers, secretaries,  
even plumbers have pensions and retirement savings. Farmers often 
have only the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	They and their children may spend their lives working the land --  
raising barns, silos and fencing; buying livestock and machinery; 
planting crops; improving the soil; and perhaps leasing other 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't make much money. In 1995, the average farm family net  
income in Pennsylvania was $13,000. As the saying goes, they end up 
land rich and cash poor. 
</P>
<P>
	So how do they retire without selling everything? How can they  
ease into retirement and still pass on the land to their children? 
And how do their children get the money to buy a farm? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find the most cost-effective way to do that,''  
said Pam Wolfe, 37, who with her sister eventually wants to take 
over her father's dairy farm in Dunbar, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we've done on that farm, I didn't do myself: The  
whole family did it,'' said her father, Albert Ferens, 61. ``I want 
to learn about transferring the farm to the younger generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wolfe and her father were among farmers at a workshop this  
week sponsored by Farm Link, a nonprofit organization that wants to 
save Pennsylvania's family farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers learned about business and estate planning,  
financing, farm management and farmland preservation. They heard a 
few success stories and some tales about families who didn't 
transfer the farm properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having fewer and fewer people assume farms from their  
families. If it gets serious enough, we won't have people with 
on-farm experience. And eventually, that leads to more 
industrialization of agriculture,'' said Marion Bowlan, director of 
Harrisburg-based Farm Link. ``We have a real crisis in the making 
if we don't get some more people into farming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Pennsylvania's farms still are family owned,  
but the numbers are declining precipitously, Mrs. Bowlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, the state had about 51,500 farms; in 1992, that number  
dropped to 44,870. When the 1997 census statistics are released, 
Mrs. Bowlan expects the numbers to reveal even more declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as troubling are statistics that show twice as many farmers  
are over the age of 55 as under 35 and that a quarter of the 
state's farms will change hands in the next decade, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bowlan and other experts worry that farmers aren't making  
provisions to hand over control to their sons and daughters early 
enough for the next generation to build equity to repay their 
parents and continue to make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell farmers that if your son is 40 years old and he still  
doesn't own any of the business, it's unlikely he'll stick 
around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is that farmers either don't want or don't  
know how to pass on the farm so parents receive enough to live on 
and children aren't saddled with unreasonably harsh debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting started in the planning process is the No. 1 issue. We  
all know it's going to happen someday, but it's so easy to put it 
off,'' said John Becker, a Penn State professor of agricultural 
economics who gave a workshop on estate planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Nehrig, a fourth-generation farmer who works with the  
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, said his father formed a 
limited partnership with him years ago. Now Nehrig is doing the 
same so his son can take over their 1,200-acre dairy and grain farm 
in Indiana County. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to put it together and do it all at once. You  
can do a little as you go,'' Nehrig said. ``The hardest part was 
just sitting down and doing it.''

<HEADLINE> Toys Go Techno at 1999 Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first set of batteries in the Furby have yet  
to fade and the scouts are already on the lookout for the must-have 
toy of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one or two of the thousands of toys showcased at next  
week's American International Toy Fair will be lucky enough to 
reach ``hot toy'' status. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to succeed: High-tech toys that show great  
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no blueprint to success when it comes to Toy Fair,''  
said Chris Byrne, a toy consultant who works at The Toy Book, trade 
publication. ``But there's no doubt that there will be lots of 
attention paid to anything that's really different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toy industry went through some growing pains last year.  
Sales in 1998 were less than stellar, falling 0.3 percent to $15.2 
billion from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, there was evidence of a shift in spending  
away from traditional toys -- dolls, board games and activity sets -- 
to interactive toys, CD-ROMs and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Furby thrived. Children -- and their parents -- liked  
that the furry, Gremlin-like doll spoke its own language and could 
interact with them. It added some spontaneity to playtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering 1999, more toymakers are stepping up their  
technological offerings -- even with some classic toys like Kermit 
the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro has a CD-ROM for its 50-year-old Easy-Bake Oven brand  
that lets kids place a template over a computer keyboard and 
``bake'' virtual cookies and cakes. Microsoft inserts a computer 
chip into a line of plush Teletubbies, allowing the dolls to play 
games and interact with specially encoded videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Play-By-Play's My Best Friend doll can actually converse with a  
child, thanks to the voice-recognition technology inside the doll. 
Playmates launches friend.link, a handheld device that lets kids 
send each other digital messages by radio frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, makes its first foray into  
toys in a joint venture with Mattel. The Intel Play X3 Microscope 
plugs into a computer and magnifies objects by up to 300 times on 
the screen, while the Intel Play Me2Cam is a camera that allows 
kids to project their moving images onto a computer monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than ever, we are seeing the marriage of technology and  
toys because this is what today's kids want to have during 
playtime,'' said Eric Johnson, a professor at Vanderbilt 
University's Owen Graduate School of Management in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	While technology rules, there won't be a shortage of toys tied  
to popular movies and television shows. Toymakers like these 
products because they receive free advertising from the heavy 
publicity that these entertainment properties get. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot movie license for 1999 is ``Star Wars,'' with its first  
prequel, ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' due out in May. Lego 
will launch its first ever toy license with a line of space ship 
building blocks tied to ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For television, Tyco Preschool extends its Sesame Street brand  
with Magic Talking Kermit The Frog, who will ribbit and make 
fly-catching sounds when his stomach is squeezed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though there is no guaranteed formula for success in the toy  
business, manufacturers understand that those who can snare a hot 
children's property are often on track to generate big sales,'' 
said Charles Riotto, executive director of the International 
Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, toymakers will show many classic toys, which remain the  
backbone of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's Barbie will debut in a series of celebrity dolls as  
comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. Usually tiny Hot 
Wheels will get a little bigger with a new line of larger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Furby, the hot toy of Christmas past isn't disappearing.  
In fact, Tiger Electronics says that Furby might sign some 
television and film deals this year. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the Furby excitement building in 1999, Tiger will use a  
marketing tool that Ty Inc. proved to be very successful with its 
Beanie Babies dolls. It will release four limited edition Furbys, 
which will only be offered at certain times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've only seen the beginning of Furby,'' said Tiger  
spokesman Marc Rosenberg.

<HEADLINE> Pregnancies Hampered by Coke, Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pregnant women who smoke cigarettes or use cocaine have a higher  
risk of miscarriage, the most common problem of pregnancy, a study 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
	While other studies have suggested a link, this was the first to  
use hair and urine testing to determine women's drug use and 
smoking, instead of relying on their own reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we have learned from this study is that  
self-reporting is far from perfect,'' said Dr. Roberta Ness, of the 
University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, lead author of 
the study reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers are almost twice as likely to miscarry as nonsmokers,  
and cocaine users are nearly one-and-a-half times as likely to 
miscarry as nonusers, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 percent of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortions  
treated by doctors, but many women do not seek medical care for 
early miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at 970 women who sought emergency room  
treatment for miscarriage or other problems at the Hospital of the 
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia while they were less 
than 22 weeks pregnant. Most of the women were black, poor, single 
and had not received prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
	Four hundred suffered a miscarriage, while 570 carried their  
pregnancies beyond 22 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hair sample tests showed nearly 29 percent of the women who  
miscarried had used cocaine, compared to 20 percent of women with 
continuing pregnancies. Urine tests showed about 35 percent of the 
women who miscarried were smokers, compared to 22 percent of the 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews, only 14 percent of the women who miscarried  
admitted using cocaine, and only 30 percent admitted smoking 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers did an impressive job of isolating the effects  
of tobacco and cocaine on fetal health, said Dr. James Mills, of 
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the link between cocaine use and miscarriage was not  
entirely persuasive, Mills wrote in an accompanying editorial. The 
increased risk was small and other factors could have skewed the 
results, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found no link between drinking or marijuana use and  
spontaneous abortion.

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Want Clinton Trial Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Among the many Americans who hope the Senate brings the  
impeachment process to a quick close are some Republican governors, 
who fear their party is bearing the brunt of public disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to vote Thursday on whether to call witnesses  
to testify on the floor -- a move that could prolong President 
Clinton's trial. A vote against testimony could mean the beginning 
of the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said he hopes the trial ends as  
soon as possible. He pointed to GOP losses in last fall's 
congressional elections as proof that many Americans already blamed 
Republicans for what they consider partisanship and foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There appeared to be, here and in the rest of the country,  
support for Democrats and dissatisfaction with Republicans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster has been banging that drum for  
months, saying Republicans should end the trial speedily because 
they don't have the votes to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner this is wound up the better off the country is  
going to be, and for sure, the Republican Party,'' he said. 
``People just don't like what's happening in Washington. They don't 
like the way it's been drawn out on totally partisan lines. You 
cannot impeach a president on partisan lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the Republican  
Governor's Association, said the GOP is shouldering the blame for 
the public's frustration and that there should be ``a heads-up 
vote, yes or no'' immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Keating thinks the GOP will benefit in the long run.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton is fatally wounded and will limp  
through the rest of his presidency,'' he said. That outcome, 
Keating said, might help the GOP win the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP governors, including Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Cecil  
Underwood of West Virginia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska, said 
voters will judge Republicans more by what they accomplish in the 
way of programs than by the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are so wrapped up and consumed by this,  
but when you get out in the heartland, people aren't paying that 
much attention,'' said John Truscott, spokesman for Michigan Gov. 
John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the wrath of a disgusted public may cross party  
lines and leave people mad at politicians in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this process has hurt everybody. It's hurt Bill  
Clinton, it's certainly hurt his family. It's hurt the House of 
Representatives, it's hurt the Senate. In the eyes of the average 
citizen, it's a mess.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jesus Rios started working in the fields at  
age 8, dug ditches with his father after high school classes and 
graduated with a grade-point average above 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory McConnell Jr., grandson of a black law professor, also  
got high grades in high school, played varsity tennis and won a 
full-tuition scholarship to an East Coast college. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet both McConnell and Rios were denied admission last fall to  
the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	They two joined six other high-achieving minorities Tuesday in a  
lawsuit accusing the university system's flagship campus of using 
discriminatory entrance policies that placed too much weight on 
test scores and Advanced Placement courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an admissions process that grants preferences to the  
privileged,'' attorney Joseph Jaramillo of the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight given to the Scholastic Assessment Test, an  
examination of English and math fluency, and Advanced Placement 
grades has a discriminatory effect on blacks, Hispanics and 
Filipinos, and lacks ``educational justification,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced Placement courses are far more available in  
predominantly white high schools, Jaramillo said. The courses are 
worth an additional grade point in UC admissions ratings, which is 
what allows students like Rios to have averages above 4.0, or 
straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of California's high schools, disproportionately  
in minority areas, offered no Advanced Placement classes during the 
1997-98 academic year, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Advanced Placement and SAT scores don't show is talent  
and ability to succeed in college,'' said another of the 
plaintiffs, Justine Certeza, a freshman at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks court orders requiring Berkeley to admit the  
eight minority students and adopt an admissions policy that gives 
qualified blacks, Hispanics and Filipinos ``a fair and equal 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such policies are still possible despite California's ban on  
race and sex preferences in state and local government programs, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said the campus retains  
``a strong commitment to access and diversity'' despite ``a new set 
of legal limitations'' -- the UC Regents' ban on affirmative action 
in admissions, later broadened to all state and local government 
programs by Proposition 209. 
</P>
<P>
	When the regents' policy took effect for freshmen last fall,  
minority admissions dropped at all UC campuses, and particularly at 
Berkeley, the most prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berkeley campus has reduced its reliance on test scores and  
``intensified our recruitment efforts'' for underrepresented 
minorities, Berdahl said.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Howard Working on Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Problem child Chris Webber is gone, leaving  
longtime buddy Juwan Howard to pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Washington Wizards prepare to open the lockout-shortened  
season Friday, Howard knows the pressure is on him to turn the 
Wizards into a playoff team on the court -- and to behave when he's 
in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to say that we embarrassed ourselves as a team and  
the organization, and also this city,'' Howard said. ``And we need 
to regain that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's bad enough that the Wizards have been to the playoffs just  
once in 12 years and haven't won a playoff series since 1982, but 
last year the team's marquee players were all over the police 
blotter -- then spurned fans by not turning up for events designed 
for season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, with his marijuana-related troubles, was the biggest  
culprit, but Howard and point guard Rod Strickland weren't far 
behind. Howard was a no-show for the filming of the team video and 
an autograph session and was the one who opened his home to 40 or 
so people for a late-night party that led to accusations of sexual 
misconduct against both Howard and Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, it was no surprise when Wizards owner Abe Pollin said the  
stiffer fines for missing functions and other personal behavior 
clauses in the new collective bargaining agreement were just as 
important to him as the billions of dollars the two sides haggled 
over during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand his point,'' Howard said. ``I'm one who also  
needs to take notice and be one of those examples to lead on and 
off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, Howard fought to clear his name and won a  
defamation suit against the woman who accused him of sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew those were false allegations,'' Howard said. ``I knew  
to a certain point they would affect me on the court and off the 
court. I wanted to send a message out there to her and many others 
who have falsely accused people, athletes and nonathletes, that you 
can't do that and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he says he is now more cautious about what he does,  
attempting to avoid situations that could lead to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' Howard said. ``Unfortunately, I trust people too  
much. I have to be a lot more careful. There are people out there 
who are trying to do everything possible to hurt you, physically 
and mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bernie Bickerstaff, who has addressed the behavior and  
image problem with his players, said Howard's words are fine, but 
he must prove himself over time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed what I see, not necessarily what I  
hear,'' Bickerstaff said. ``If you're going to walk the line, 
you've got to stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad behavior was one of the reasons cited for Webber's trade to  
the Sacramento Kings in May. The Wizards received two veteran 
gentlemen, Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe, but Howard misses his 
former ``Fab Five'' teammate: They were together six of the last 
seven years, with the University of Michigan, then the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we played in the intrasquad scrimmage (last week), I was  
throwing some no-look passes to guys up under the basket, and 
usually those will turn out to be dunks,'' Howard said. ``It was a 
strange feeling. I'm going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's numbers have been consistent during his four years in  
Washington. His points-per-game average has ranged from 17.0 to 
22.1, and his rebounds from 7.0 to 8.4. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Webber gone, Howard will move from small forward back  
to his natural power forward position and shoulder more of the 
scoring -- and especially the rebounding -- load. The Wizards don't 
have a true rebounding center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot to prove to myself personally, because I want to  
play at the level that the best of this game is playing,'' Howard 
said. ``I want to play at the same levels as the Karl Malones, the 
Grant Hills, the Shaquille O'Neals and so on. I'm willing to take 
that step.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Plant Checked for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Engineers today explored the  
blast-damaged power plant at the Ford Motor Co. River Rouge complex 
-- home of the Model T -- to decide if it was safe enough for 
investigators to begin looking for the cause of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the complex's 10,000 employees had been ordered to stay  
home a day after the blast killed one man, critically injured 15 
others and knocked out electrical service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some limited work resumed at the complex today, with generators  
supplying the power, but the loss of most of its production had 
already slowed work at Ford assembly plants elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to the power plant included ``substantial reinforced  
concrete blown loose by the blast,'' as well as movement in at 
least one of its towering smokestacks, Dearborn police Chief Ron 
Deziel said. Other damage included a caved-in roof and mounds of 
debris, Fire Chief Jack McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unstable sections will have to be demolished and the damaged  
smokestack will have to be reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
	A safety assessment team checked the power house this morning to  
determine if investigators can safely enter to look for the cause 
of the explosion, Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety is paramount for us, we want to make sure it's  
structurally sound,'' Sharkey said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials have refused to speculate about what caused the  
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre River Rouge complex was once the world's largest  
auto plant and was the home of the Model T. The power house 
produced enough electricity to serve a city the size of Boston, 
Ford has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The power station served six Ford factories in the complex: a  
Mustang assembly plant and parts factories that make such things as 
engines, doors, hoods and glass. Its stamping plant supplies 16 of 
the No. 2 automaker's 20 North America assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford brought in generators Tuesday, and Sharkey said partial  
production resumed today in three factories: the fuel tank area of 
the engine plant, part of the stamping plant and part of the frame 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're slowly starting to ramp back up,'' Sharkey said. He  
couldn't say how many employees were on the job today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the blast, production was slowed Tuesday at a number  
of Ford plants across the country. Work hours were trimmed at 
assembly plants in Wayne, where Escorts are built; Wixom, where 
Lincoln's Town Car and Continental are built; Lorain, Ohio, where 
Ford Econoline vans are made; and St. Thomas, Ontario. All but the 
Wixom plant were to resume full production today. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime shifts were halted Tuesday at four other plants -- in  
Kansas City, Mo., Norfolk, Va., Oakville, Ontario, and St. Paul, 
Minn. -- that make Ford pickup trucks. Only the St. Paul plant was 
to resume overtime shifts today.

<HEADLINE> Mets Fire McCarver, Hire Seaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eliminating an independent and sometimes  
critical voice from their broadcast booth, the New York Mets on 
Wednesday replaced Tim McCarver with Tom Seaver, who also is 
joining the team's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame pitcher, who has not been to Shea Stadium since  
1988, will be in his retired uniform No. 41 for 10-to-12 days 
during spring training and will broadcast 50 games per season on 
WPIX, the Mets' new station. He also will have a marketing role 
with the team and work with minor leaguers during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcaster for the New York Yankees from 1989-93, Seaver  
admitted he won't be as controversial as McCarver, who had been the 
team's color analyst for 16 seasons and is regarded as the best in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last several years, a lot of commentary has been (made)  
to be critical on page one,'' Seaver said. ``I don't know if I 
would agree with that. I would agree with it when it comes to 
effort and preparation and approach to your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver has 10 Emmy Award nominations but has never won,  
primarily because John Madden has. The move doesn't affect 
McCarver's job with Fox Sports, where he is the network's lead 
analyst for its national telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were fairly blunt, saying, `We're not picking up next  
year as far as your contract is concerned,' '' he said. ``The word 
tradition was mentioned. I think that is why Tom is the guy coming 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors that manager Bobby Valentine was upset with  
McCarver's criticism last June after Mel Rojas blew a game against 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never came up to me and told me he was upset with  
anything,'' McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice president of broadcasting  
and marketing, said he knew some on the team were unhappy with 
McCarver, but didn't have first-hand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I either read about in the papers or heard about it,'' Bingham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said his philosophy won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak what you perceive as the truth,'' he said. ``If that's  
outspokenness, that's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rosen, McCarver's agent, said it may be too close to spring  
training for McCarver to line up a local broadcasting job for this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suspicion is we will over the course of the season field  
about 18 different offers for the season following,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' over-the-air games, which had been broadcast on WWOR  
since the team's inception in 1962, move to WPIX this season, with 
the Yankees moving from WPIX to WNYW, Fox's New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said McCarver would not be a good fit for WNYW because  
many of its Yankees broadcasts are on the same days as Fox network 
telecasts. The Madison Square Garden Network, which televises the 
bulk of Yankees' games on cable, wouldn't comment on McCarver's 
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, 56, won National League Cy Young Awards for the Mets in  
1969, '73 and '75, finished 311-205 with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 
strikeouts and is the most beloved player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been out of baseball the last five seasons and moved to  
California three months ago, intending to plant two or three acres 
of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
	He probably will be partnered with Gary Thorne and sometimes  
Ralph Kiner. The real attraction, however, was his role with 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really want to come back and not be involved in one  
way or another with the pitching,'' Seaver said. ``I don't want to 
be the manager. I don't want to be the general manager. I don't 
want to be the pitching coach. But I would find it somewhat hollow 
if I were not allowed to use my expertise about pitching with the 
younger pitchers. I pretty much insisted that be a part of this 
deal.''

<HEADLINE> Land O'Lakes Recalls 2 Percent Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) -- The possibility of contamination  
has spurred the recall of single-serve cartons of Land O'Lakes 2 
percent milk in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten-ounce cartons of the milk dated Feb. 10 and Feb. 11 were  
recalled in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana, said Kohler Mix Specialties Inc., a 
subsidy of Michael Foods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday said the milk could be contaminated with  
Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, which can cause serious and 
sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly 
people and others with weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler spokesman Mark Witmer said fewer than 1,000 cases were  
affected. Each case holds 24 cartons. The plant code of PLT 27-416 
is printed on the top seal of the carton. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of serious illness as a result of the  
possible contamination, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised not to drink the milk and to return it  
instead for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Johnson for Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Defensive tackle Ellis Johnson has been  
rewarded with a five-year contract extension by the Indianapolis 
Colts after having the most successful season of his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis Star reported Wednesday that Johnson signed an  
extension valued at $25 million, including a $5 million signing 
bonus. He would have been in the final season of his original 
five-year contract in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts confirmed the extension Wednesday, but declined to  
discuss its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension would make Johnson, a first-round draft pick in  
1995, one of the 10 highest-paid defensive tackles in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels real good that they have that much faith in me,''  
Johnson said. ``I'm really hooked on Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extension is the latest move by club president Bill Polian  
to improve a defense that was 29th among the league's 30 teams in 
total yards allowed, yards rushing and points allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts finished 3-13 for the second consecutive year and  
fired defensive coordinator Rusty Tillman was fired after one 
season with the team and replaced by Vic Fangio. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Polian signed Tony McCoy, a former teammate of  
Johnson's at Florida, to a four-year, $10 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Bill Polian is going to do something good with this  
defense and I want to be part of that,'' said the 6-foot-2, 
292-pound Johnson. ``It's obvious he wants me and Tony to be the 
backbone of this defense and that's fine with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was one of two Colts to start every game last season on  
defense. It was the first time in his four-year career he started 
every game. He's played in 59 games with 39 starts and posted 
career highs in tackles (75) and quarterback sacks (8.0) last 
season. He has compiled 12.5 of his 17 career sacks the past two 
years.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Kingsbury-Smith Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, a former national  
editor and chief foreign correspondent for Hearst Newspapers and a 
one-time publisher of the New York Journal-American, died Wednesday 
at his home in suburban Virginia. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingsbury-Smith started a 60-year career with Hearst in 1924,  
when he joined the International News Service as a copy boy. He

York, London and Washington, including chief diplomatic 
correspondent, and vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1940s, Kingsbury-Smith corresponded with Soviet Premier  
Joseph Stalin. In 1956 he shared the Pulitzer Price for 
international affairs reporting with Hearth colleagues William 
Randolph Hearst Jr. and Frank Conniff for a series of interviews 
the previous year with Nikita Krushchev and other Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He became publisher of the now defunct Journal-American in 1959.  
Seven years later Kingsbury-Smith was named European director of 
the Hearst Corp. and chief foreign writer for its newspapers. In 
1976 he was named national editor of Hearst newspapers. Later he 
headed Hearst's corporate activities in Washington, retiring as a 
vice president and director of the company.

<HEADLINE> Eagles, Phillies Get Stadiums' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sports fans in Philadelphia always seem to  
have a way with words. 
</P>
<P>
	How about these: Later, Vet.  
</P>
<P>
	With General Assembly's passage Wednesday of a funding plan for  
new stadiums for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the Eagles and 
Phillies began planning for a 2002 opening of their new facilities. 
That means the longtime cohabitants of drab, outdated Veterans 
Stadium only have three more seasons in one of the worst facilities 
in pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major step,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said. ``It  
is just the first step, but a major step nonetheless. We are very 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams still have to work out funding arrangements with the  
city, and many important details such as the builders, location and 
cost are still to be decided. But at an evening news conference at 
the Vet, the Eagles already were displaying two paintings of what 
their 66,000 to 68,000-seat, grass, football-only facility might 
look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans will have two brand new stadiums that will be dynamic and  
state-of-the-art,'' Eagles executive vice president Joe Banner 
said. ``This is exciting. We're the first major market in the 
country to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell added his support to the  
Legislature's decision to fund the stadiums. ``No state anywhere 
has produced a bill as good as this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary drawings were done by HOK Sports Facilities  
Group, architect of many new stadiums including those in Cleveland, 
Denver and Baltimore. Banner said the team hasn't hired HOK yet and 
probably wouldn't contract with a firm until the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner had been critical of the state funding plan, which  
proposes that teams pay back the state if tax revenue generated by 
the new ballparks doesn't match the state's contribution. Some $320 
million in state money has been earmarked for the stadiums in each 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as fair a deal as we could have gotten,'' said Banner,  
who predicted that a new facility would be built in time for the 
2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies chairman Bill Giles said a new stadium was the only way  
his team could be competitive under baseball's current economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a Phillies fan, you have hope and faith that you're  
team will be competitive,'' Giles said. ``With the economics of the 
game today, this would have been very, very difficult for us in the 
long-run to be competitive without a new stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Stadium was built in 1971, and the playing surface and  
amenities are far below pro sports standards. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL players have ranked the Vet's artificial turf as the worst  
in the league for three straight years, and the Army-Navy college 
football game in December was marred by a collapsed railing that 
injured several fans who fell to the turf.

<HEADLINE> Icebergs, Cape Horn Await Sailors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They ran into a whale, a sandbar and dozens of monster waves.  
The amount of broken sailing equipment could have filled a small 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	For the solo sailors in the Around Alone yacht race, it's half  
the globe conquered, half still to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The sailors set out again Saturday on the third leg of the  
nine-month, 27,000-mile competition, leaving Auckland, New Zealand, 
to challenge the icy seas and hurricane-strength winds around Cape 
Horn as they race to Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Isabelle Autissier of France has the overall lead -- 24 hours, 10  
minutes, 9 seconds ahead of Giovanni Soldini of Italy, the winner 
of the second leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Just reaching Auckland was a personal victory for Autissier, who  
had to be rescued by helicopter off Australia in 1994 -- the last 
time this race was held -- when her 60-foot yacht demasted and sank 
in a fierce storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably see icebergs this time, but the important  
thing is not to do the slalom between them,'' Soldini said in 
Auckland. ``That is really too dangerous and stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it will be hard to match the sheer roller-coaster ride of  
the of the second leg that began in Cape Town, South Africa: 
</P>
<P>
	--Mike Golding of Britain, who won the first 7,000-mile leg, was  
on track to win the second when his yacht slammed into a sandbar 
just 200 miles from Auckland. He needed a tow, and that 
disqualified him from the leg, ending any chance of winning the 
overall race. 
</P>
<P>
	--Autissier's yacht was knocked down by a huge wave shortly after  
leaving Cape Town. When the boat righted, she could barely raise 
her sail halfway up the mast and fell hundreds of miles behind, 
detouring to Tasmania for repairs. When her competitors became 
entangled in a no-wind zone in the Tasman Sea, she roared back to 
take third in the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.P. Mouligne, a Frenchman who lives in Newport, R.I., closed a  
gap of 1,000 miles by slicing through the light air of the Tasman 
Sea. He won Class II, for boats 40 to 50 feet, and even beat some 
of the 60-footers, an almost unheard-of feat for a boat with a much 
smaller sail. 
</P>
<P>
	--The next two competitors in Class II arrived just 2 minutes, 21  
seconds apart after more than a month of sailing -- the closest 
finish in race history. Mike Garside of Britain beat Brad Van Liew 
of Santa Monica, Calif., in the last five miles into Auckland, 
after Van Liew had made come from behind to make up more than 400 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Several racers barely made the Jan. 30 deadline to reach  
Auckland and stay in the race: Neal Peterson of South Africa, Neil 
Hunter of Australia and Minoru Saito of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	George Striker of Newport, Ky., dropped out of the race after  
returning twice to Cape Town with equipment problems. As of 
Wednesday, Robin Davie of Charleston, S.C., was still 580 miles 
from Auckland with a jury-rigged rudder and hoping against hope for 
an exemption from the cutoff rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedor Konioukhov, a Russian adventurer who conquered both the  
North and South poles and Mount Everest, found the seas much more 
challenging and never did get the hang of sailing upwind. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived Sunday, a day after the cutoff to remain in the  
competition. Undaunted, he plans to continue sailing around the 
world anyway after a stopover for repairs and a meeting Thursday 
with his hero, Sir Edmund Hillary, the man who first conquered 
Mount Everest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even coming in last is winning,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Home Run King Aaron Savors Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Will 755 go the way of 61?  
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron, who 25 years ago this season passed Babe Ruth as the  
career home run leader, said it could happen if last year began a 
trend. Mark McGwire hit 70 and Sammy Sosa 66 to top Roger Maris' 
1961 single-season record of 61. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, if they keep hitting home runs the way they hit  
them last year -- 50, 60, 70 -- you know they could catch the record 
pretty quick,'' said Aaron, who retired with 755 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added Wednesday, he thinks his record is probably safe.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not because I don't think that players have the ability, but I  
think it's the longevity of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron chatted at a luncheon hosted by CNN News Group chief Tom  
Johnson to preview Friday's official tribute. President Clinton and 
a host of other political and sports leaders will celebrate Aaron's 
65th birthday, begin baseball's commemoration of his record's 25th 
anniversary and raise funds for the Chasing the Dream Foundation he 
and wife Billye started to provide grants to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said his highest salary was $225,000, while players making  
millions every season aren't as likely to play so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players today are going to make so much money that they  
don't need to keep playing. It was a long time before I even made 
$50,000,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one in particular with an excellent chance would be  
Ken Griffey Jr. He's young, he's had some great years and in a 
couple years he's probably going to sign one of the biggest 
contracts of all time. Whether he's going to keep focused on how 
high his ability can carry him is something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, has 350 homers.  
</P>
<P>
	Comparing eras, Aaron said today's players work more with  
weights and are generally stronger, but that starting pitching and 
the overall level of competition was higher in his first decades of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wouldn't trade his low-paying days in the Negro  
Leagues or his 1950s-1960s years playing against many future Hall 
of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Aaron, senior vice president of the Atlanta Braves,  
doesn't argue with those who call the 1998 Yankees the best team in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be very honest, that Yankee team last year was very  
scary,'' he said. ``That team is about as good as you're going to 
put together. I think it was good enough to beat anybody, really.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Meet Struggles With Drug Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders tried Wednesday to  
salvage the broad outlines of anti-drug reforms after bitter 
discord at the world doping summit left two of its prime goals in 
shreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and sports federations fought over imposing a mandatory  
two-year minimum ban for major drug abusers, with the IOC moving to 
allow a major loophole when the first-of-its-kind conference 
concludes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it could allow any sports federation to seek  
lesser penalties as protection against legal challenges. But that 
compromise also was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	If sports organizations ``run scared of well-lawyered athletes,  
they are failing the majority of our athletes,'' said Princess 
Anne, a British IOC member and former Olympic competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with pressure from the United States and 15-nation  
European Union, the IOC also prepared for months of negotiations to 
set up a $25 million independent anti-drug agency. And on that 
issue, the committee was battered again, told unequivocally that 
IOC officials would not fill the top spots, a huge step back from 
its proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any control by the IOC would obviate its independence and  
destroy its credibility,'' said Dr. Donald Vereen, the deputy 
director of U.S. National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	British Minister of Sport Tony Banks read an EU statement  
unanimously rejecting the IOC proposal that it lead the proposed 
agency. He urged ``urgent consultations, starting this month, to 
try to get the anti-doping agency in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we can agree on the principle of an agency but at the  
end of the meeting you will not have an agency decided in detail,'' 
IOC drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, in charge of finding ways to pay  
for the agency and its universal drug enforcement, said governments 
and sports bodies could split the leadership roles 50-50. But he 
warned that such involvement would also require more government 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The inability to solve the two key issues and the open dispute  
it caused ripped apart the conference, which the International 
Olympic Committee had hoped would both reassert its anti-drug 
leadership and divert attention from the bribery scandal that had 
led to the expulsions or resignations of nine members. 
</P>
<P>
	If the IOC had hoped the conference would stimulate debate,  
Pound said, ``we have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had hoped to have all Olympic sports adopt one set of  
drug penalties, starting with the mandatory two-year ban. But 
several sports, including the biggest, soccer, said they would 
never accept it because of the threat of civil suits under 
right-to-work laws, and the IOC relented. 
</P>
<P>
	``My response to FIFA is 'yes,''' said Judge Keba Mbaye, who  
headed an IOC group on the sanctions issue. He said FIFA, soccer's 
world governing body, would be allowed to apply suspensions under 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had threatened last year to kick federations out the  
Olympics if they refused to back the proposal of a two-year ban but 
since then has backed off that stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling, under pressure following last year's doping scandal at  
the Tour de France, had also questioned the wisdom of a two-year 
sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as you want to impose a minimum of two years, you are  
going to run from court to court,'' said Hein Verbruggen, head of 
the UCI world cycling federation, echoing widespread criticism such 
a sanction would not hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the two federations made ``a reasonably compelling  
case based on their (legal) experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track chief Primo Nebiolo, representing the 28 Summer Olympic  
federations, offered a compromise proposal under which federations 
would be able to cite ``exceptional circumstances'' in applying 
bans of less than two years. Marc Hodler, leader of the seven 
winter sports federations, backed Nebiolo's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to soften the two-year sanction upset leading athletes,  
including former Olympic champions Johann Olav Koss and Coe, and 
other federation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to hold our nerve, we have to hold the line,'' said  
Coe, a two-time British 1,500-meter Olympic gold medallist.

	Blumenthal Faces House Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors in President Clinton's

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton are confident  
``that they've gotten back on track,'' with their marriage because 
of his problems, his brother, Roger, said today. ``As far as I can 
tell the family unit is getting stronger every day,'' Roger Clinton 
said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The younger brother said he 
met with the president yesterday. ``He sounds very upbeat, very 
positive and he's still as concerned as ever every day with the

The airline will replace them with crackers and cheese, or carrots 
and dip. The bags are offered to coach passengers as they board 
flights at certain times of the day. First-class fliers also will 
be affected. Delta is downgrading full meals to snacks in first

<HEADLINE> Duncan Has High Hopes for 2nd Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan knows a lot more about the NBA now  
than he did as a rookie 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, his opponents are more familiar with him, too, and  
that could be Duncan's biggest new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the people will kind of go after me every night,''  
Duncan said in his typical quiet manner after a San Antonio Spurs 
practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With his outstanding rookie year behind him, Duncan is ready for  
an encore with 7-foot-1 center David Robinson once again his 
partner on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs begin their season Friday night against Sacramento in  
the Alamodome. They play two more home games Saturday and Monday 
before heading off on a four-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the 7-foot top draft choice last season from Wake  
Forest, was the overwhelming selection for NBA Rookie of the Year. 
He started all 82 regular season games and averaged 21.1 points, 
11.9 rebounds and 2.51 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really feel any pressure last year,'' Duncan said.  
``I walked in here behind David Robinson and a bunch of other 
veterans. That took a lot of pressure off of me. I didn't come in 
here and have to save the team. So I played within myself and grew 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year could prove more spectacular for Duncan, particularly  
when it comes to fine-tuning his play with Robinson, a 10-year 
veteran who has never been to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll just keep getting better and better, being able  
to read each other, being able to play with each other,'' Duncan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson also has high expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it'll be a lot better, just Tim's confidence level  
and his consistency level. The challenge will be a little greater 
this year. Obviously, nobody is going to be surprised by Tim,'' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson welcomes the stretch scoring Duncan provides.  
</P>
<P>
	And he admires all that young energy.  
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, 22, spends lots of time on the court and concentrated so  
heavily on improving his game during the offseason that the 
33-year-old Robinson found himself feeling ``like the old guy'' 
trying to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day he's out there. He's working, he's running, he's  
lifting, he's doing the things he needs to do to get better,'' 
Robinson said. ``Tim takes it seriously. He's deciding now that he 
wants to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Robinson and Duncan on the front line -- and at times  
bolstered by another 7-footer, Will Perdue, in the lineup -- the 
Spurs went 56-26 last season and advanced to the Western Conference 
semifinals before being eliminated 4-1 by Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Before training camp, the Spurs added Steve Kerr through a trade  
with Chicago and signed free agents Mario Elie of Houston and 
Jerome Kersey of Seattle. Antonio Daniels was dealt to San Antonio 
by Vancouver last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think management went out and got some great picks,'' Duncan  
said. ``All these guys came in here to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the Spurs roster are Perdue, point guard Avery  
Johnson, shooting guard Jaren Jackson and forward Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich calls Elliott the ``X-factor'' for the  
Spurs, explaining that his health will be a key to San Antonio's 
season. Elliott missed much of the last two seasons with injuries 
to both quadriceps, but says his legs are now in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich believes the Duncan-Robinson duo will be smoother.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were great together in helping each other and learning  
about positions on the court, but this year I think they'll be able 
to find each other passing-wise even more than they did last 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan said he intends to keep learning from Robinson -- and  
striving for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good team,'' Duncan said. ``We have a chance to go  
and do something special.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Complex Resumes Limited Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Using massive, rented generators, Ford  
Motor Co. resumed limited production Wednesday at its River Rouge 
complex two days after a deadly explosion destroyed the site's 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to minimize the ripple effect of Monday's explosion on  
other North American operations, the No. 2 automaker said three 
other plants in the complex that have been idle since the blast may 
return to partial production by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre complex could be at full speed by Monday, site  
manager Art Janes said. ``It's a very optimistic plan, but attitude 
means a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If and when that happens, Ford plans to speed up production at  
the River Rouge plants to make up lost ground, help refill the 
parts pipeline and ease the blast's already visible effects on Ford 
plants elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1,500 workers were back on the job at the roughly  
10,000-employee complex, again making fuel tanks, automotive frames 
and such stamped-out parts as hoods and doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 16 workers injured in the blast remained hospitalized  
as Ford and private engineers assessed when the ruined, 
structurally unfit power station could accommodate investigators in 
search of the explosion's cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has refused to speculate about what caused the explosion  
that killed pipe fitter Donald Harper and left the power station a 
mangled, rubble-filled hulk that Janes said will be torn down after 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Ron Diezel said one of the explosion site's boilers  
``was completely split apart'' and has emerged as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex once was the world's largest auto plant and home of  
the Model T. The power house produced enough electricity to serve a 
city the size of Boston, Ford has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Edison -- once supplying just 20 percent of the complex's  
power -- is being called upon to power it all until a new, $240 
million power plant for the Rouge complex being built is finished, 
perhaps in 1 1/2 to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the complex can be rewired for Detroit Edison power, Ford  
hauled in huge generators Tuesday and labored to bypass the 
once-mighty power station in hopes of having full electricity back 
by this week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The requirements for the entire complex are a little less than  
200 megawatts. Detroit Edison is expected to beat that with 
connections once they're restored,'' utility spokesman Lew Layton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the blast, production was slowed Tuesday at several  
Ford plants nationwide. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Padres Trade Greg Vaughn to Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Caminiti. Steve Finley. Kevin Brown. Joey  
Hamilton. As the list of departed San Diego Padres grew, outfielder 
Greg Vaughn grew a little more curious about what was going on with 
the defending NL champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was shocked when he learned Tuesday he is the latest  
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres traded Vaughn and pinch-hit specialist Mark Sweeney  
to the Cincinnati Reds for often-injured outfielder Reggie Sanders 
and two minor leaguers. Vaughn, who set a club record by hitting 50 
homers last season, can't comprehend the Marlinesque move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came from the dentist. I thought they'd slipped me  
something, that it wasn't real,'' Vaughn said. ``I had to pinch the 
other side of my mouth to make sure I wasn't dreaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade allowed Reds fans to dream a little. General manager  
Jim Bowden has acquired 16-game winner Denny Neagle and now a 
50-home-run hitter in the offseason, filling the biggest holes in a 
rebuilding team geared towards a new stadium for 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows us to compete,'' Bowden said. ``I think that with  
the moves we made, we can compete. I'm not saying we can overtake 
Houston or Atlanta or Los Angeles. But I don't see why we can't 
compete on a daily basis with the next set of clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question in San Diego is whether the Padres will be in shape  
to compete for another World Series. A few weeks after they got 
swept by the New York Yankees, the Padres got voter approval for a 
new baseball stadium that seemed to indicate a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn is wondering about the franchise's direction.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the players were misled,'' Vaughn said. ``Everyone  
I've talked to is a little disappointed in the fact that all we 
were told is if we got the stadium, we could be kept together to 
compete, to be right there. Then all of a sudden now, it's like 
it's a whole new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that sense, it's reminiscent of the Florida Marlins, who won  
the World Series in 1997 and then slashed their payroll. The Padres 
haven't done it to the same extreme and insist there's little 
similarity. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers said the Padres traded Vaughn in  
part because they didn't think they could afford him after this 
season, when he'll make $5.75 million in the final year of his 
contract. Sanders makes $3.7 million this season and has an option 
for the same amount in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``To stay competitive, you've got to distribute the dollars  
around. If you put it all into one guy or two guys, you're going to 
have a hard time staying competitive,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres also got middle infielder Damian Jackson, 25, who has  
spent the last three seasons at Triple-A, and Josh Harris, 21, who 
pitched for Class A Burlington. Jackson batted .261 in 131 games 
for Indianapolis last year, struck out 125 times in 517 at-bats and 
made 44 errors at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds needed a power hitter -- they hit only 138 homers last  
season -- and traded Bret Boone, their leader with 24, to Atlanta. 
But Bowden figured they couldn't afford one until they got closer 
to their new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Padres called last Thursday and offered Vaughn, Bowden  
lobbied managing executive John Allen to increase the payroll to 
more than $30 million and make the deal possible. Allen approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the Reds can afford to keep Vaughn for the entire  
season if fans buy more tickets now that he's here. Otherwise, 
they'll look to trade him in July for prospects who fit into the 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden had repeatedly tried to trade Sanders, 31, who had a  
breakthrough year in 1995, but struggled in the playoffs -- .138 
with 19 strikeouts in 29 at-bats -- and hasn't done much since. He 
played in only 81 games in 1996 and 86 in 1997 because of various 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he hit .268 in 135 games with 14 homers, struck out  
137 times in 481 at-bats and was slowed by injuries to his back, 
ankle, hand, hamstring and ribs. He thinks San Diego provides a 
chance to start over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt it was time for me to go somewhere else, I  
guess,'' Sanders said. ``I just felt it was best for me to move on. 
There's no bad blood or anything. It's just something that I'm glad 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Wednesday as  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin made more statements in 
support of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose against the euro on expectations that the  
European Central Bank might cut interest rates in the near future 
while interest rates in the United States would remain steady. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve declined to change  
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 112.87  
Japanese yen, up from 112.05 late Tuesday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1316, down from $1.1342. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the trigger today was comments from Rubin,'' said  
Allison Montgomery, a currency analyst at IDEA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also noted that U.S. officials seemed to be putting  
more pressure on Japan to revive its economy. Rubin called on 
Japanese officials to focus on monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4153 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4125, and 1.5135 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5143. The British 
pound fell to $1.6364 from $1.6393. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7286 German 
marks, up from 1.7244; 5.7971 French francs, up from 5.7837; and 
1,712.33 Italian lire, up from 1,706.48.

<HEADLINE> Credit Repair Scam Grows Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Solomon Bradford and his wife thought  
they found the answer to their financial problems: a business 
promising to fix their credit record for $250. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the advice of the credit repair company, the Bradfords  
went to the bank and got a loan for a new home -- something they had 
been denied in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also unwittingly committed a federal crime:  
substituting their Social Security number with another number so 
their credit record would come up clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no free lunch,'' says Bradford, a Baptist minister in  
Columbia, S.C., who realized something was wrong when the credit 
repair company gave them a different Social Security number to use. 
``There is no quick fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford, who is blind, said his disability makes him  
particularly wary of people who might take advantage of him. ``One 
thing I don't like is being preyed on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of consumers, eager to believe promises that they  
can ``erase'' their bad credit, have fallen for credit repair scams 
which actually turn them into criminals by advising them to use a 
false identification number to apply for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and National Association of  
Attorneys General announced legal action against 43 such scams 
operations Tuesday, and warned consumers against handing over money 
to businesses that claim to provide ``brand new'' credit files. 
</P>
<P>
	``They prey on people who are plagued by poor credit -- people  
who may be desperate to develop a clean credit history so they can 
get a loan, get a job or buy a car,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradfords didn't get their house. After they realized what  
they had done was illegal, Bradford reported the incident to 
consumer protection authorities. Officials say they are focusing on 
the scams, rather than charging consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who chairs NAAG's  
consumer protection committee, calls these cases ``just the tip of 
the iceberg'' for a fraud being spread far and fast on the Internet 
and in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation works like this: Businesses seek out consumers who  
have been denied loans or credit cards based on poor credit 
histories, sometimes sending letters to people who have filed for 
bankruptcy. For anywhere from $29.95 to $400, the companies promise 
to provide consumers with instructions on how to develop a new 
credit identity, through a process called ``file segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies then sell consumers instructions on how to apply  
to the Internal Revenue Service for an employer or taxpayer 
identification number. These numbers are intended primarily so 
businesses can set up a tax account for their filing purposes. And 
in fact, the IRS on the application form offers this warning: ``An 
EIN is for use in connection with your business activities only. Do 
NOT use your EIN in place of your Social Security number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the scam operations tell consumers to do exactly that -- use  
the numbers instead of their Social Security number in credit 
reports or loan applications, enabling them to start a fresh, new 
credit record. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of the Treasury's inspector general for tax  
administration has already conducted 108 investigations of 
individuals who sold or used the employer identification numbers to 
defraud creditors, resulting in 58 indictments or guilty pleas on 
charges including misrepresenting a Social Security number, mail 
fraud and conspiracy. The office is investigating an additional 205 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The scams are expensive for both businesses and consumers. The  
Treasury's tax administration inspector general estimates that as 
much as $400 million in fraudulent loans and credit has been 
established across the country, a cost that often is absorbed by 
the businesses providing credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from file segregation, other credit repair scam operations  
have managed to defraud consumers by promising to clean up credit 
histories for exorbitant prices. In 1998, consumers on average lost 
$725 to telemarketers promoting fraudulent credit repair services, 
up from $568 in 1997, according to the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, consumers can obtain information about their credit  
history and correct inaccuracies for free. Legitimate companies 
also can counsel consumers on how to fix errors in their report and 
how to rebuild their credit, but they can't simply erase a poor 
credit history, warns Susan Grant, director of the National Fraud 
Information Center, a program of the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not inaccurate, it can't be fixed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Defend Olympic Ideal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic athletes are standing firm  
in their support for a minimum two-year ban for competitors who 
take performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of the world doping summit, the athletes also  
offered support for embattled IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
and said they did not want to see their achievements tarnished by 
the corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes said a minimum two-year ban for serious drug  
offenses was proper, despite concerns in some sports about the 
impact that would have on athletes' livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes are role models,'' said Norwegian speed skater  
Olav Koss, a triple gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are looked upon by kids around the world. Taking two  
years off work is nothing compared to 10 or 15 years out of the 
lives of young people around the world. They have to take the 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If sports that are primarily professional, such as soccer and  
cycling, can't accept the sanctions, then there is no place for 
them in the Olympic Games, German athlete Roland Baar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If football or whoever else cannot accept the rules of the  
IOC, then they shouldn't be a part of the IOC anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be honest. Is football that important at the Olympic  
Games?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes said they are behind a move by the IOC to change  
the Olympic oath to include a statement that they used ethical 
means in their training. 
</P>
<P>
	They also supported the idea of an Olympic `passport' in which  
they would accept the principles of antidoping before they could 
compete in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the light of continuing reports about IOC members taking  
bribes for their votes, members of the IOC athletes' commission 
said they supported Samaranch and the work the IOC is doing to root 
out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support his work, and believe it will lead to the  
re-establishment of the credibility and trust in the International 
Olympic Committee and the entire Olympic Movement,'' they said in a 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ctvrtlik, Olympic gold medalist in volleyball, said the  
scandal should not reflect on the event itself or on the commitment 
of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was training four to six hours a day for 12 years. You leave  
your body on the court half the time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give everything you have and I think that's what the  
Olympics encompasses. Of course, there might be some crooks, you 
have to clean it up, but I don't think it's fair to blame the 
athletes and tarnish their medals and their dedication and their 
sacrifice because some people want to take money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still very proud of our medals,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Said to Influence Non-HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers who thought they could escape the  
impact of managed health care by staying with traditional insurance 
might be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study suggests doctors in regions with fast-growing HMOs  
order fewer tests and cut other costs even for their patients who 
aren't in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managed care seems to have a spillover effect,'' said Uwe  
Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Health expenses for patients in traditional Medicare plans tend  
to fall in regions with growing HMOs, according to a report 
published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford University researcher Laurence Baker, the study's  
author, said the findings suggest doctors used to treating HMO 
patients alter their practice habits in treating all patients 
either out of convenience or because they agree with the more 
conservative HMO treatment style. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether patients with traditional insurance get better care  
because their care is similar to that in an HMO remains open for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's study is one of the first to draw attention to the  
impact managed care has to all patients, not just those in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings raise doubts about suspicions that doctors  
treat patients differently based on their insurance coverage, said 
Reinhardt, who wrote an accompanying editorial in this week's 
edition of JAMA. Economists, he said, have long assumed doctors 
were influenced by how they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This article says the world is more complicated, and doctors  
are not the economic animals that our economic models suggest they 
are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined Medicare costs from 1990 to 1994, a time when  
HMO market share increased nationally from 15 percent to 20 
percent. The study accounted for a number of factors that influence 
health costs, including the age and health status of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker found that as HMO market share increased in a region from  
10 percent to 20 percent, Medicare hospital costs fell by 2 percent 
and Medicare physician and outpatient expenses fell by 1.5 percent. 
Medicare costs fell even more sharply in regions where HMO market 
share was bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the average Medicare expense per beneficiary was about  
$3,270. 
</P>
<P>
	Several reasons could explain how HMO cut costs for patients not  
in HMOs. The presence of health plans in a community tend to spur 
construction of more lower-cost health settings such as outpatient 
surgery centers and HMO doctors influence how non-HMO doctors 
practice, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Baker concludes the most likely cause is that doctors treat  
all of their patients the same way. And if HMOs move doctors to 
limit hospitalizations and expensive tests for their members, 
doctors follow the same approach for all their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of patients think that they can escape the effects of  
managed care by joining some other type of health plan,'' Baker 
said. ``In places with a lot of managed care that is not true.''

<HEADLINE> Threatened Lynx Freed in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH FORK, Colo. (AP) -- High in the aspens and spruce in the  
San Juan Mountains, two female lynx bounded across the snow into 
the wilderness Wednesday as part of an effort to re-introduce 
endangered and threatened animals in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx, whose thick brown-gray coat once lured trappers into  
the Colorado backcountry, was last seen in the state in 1973 near 
Vail. Last fall, an underground environmental group said it set 
damaging fires at the Vail ski resort to protect its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The two females released by wildlife officials were trapped in  
British Columbia and trucked 1,700 miles to southern Colorado. 
Officials chose a broad, open space on private land at 9,200 feet 
near the Rio Grande National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officer Bill Andree, flanked by about two dozen  
journalists and biologists, set a metal cage containing a sleek 
wildcat with tufted ears on a 6-inch layer of snow. Then he 
unlocked the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're free,'' Andree whispered to the 3-year-old cat  
nicknamed No. 7. He stood back and waited in the bright, 
mid-morning sunshine. No. 7, which arrived in Colorado last week, 
remained crouched on a grass bed in the cage for a little more than 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Andree and biologist Gene Byrne tilted the cage forward gently  
and she stepped out on the snow, looked about for another minute or 
so and raced into a canopy of trees. 
</P>
<P>
	When Andree and Byrne opened the cage for the second lynx,  
nicknamed No. 9, she darted quickly toward the trees and the 
13,000-foot snowy peaks towering in the background, as the crowd 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they have to find a place to make a living,'' Byrne said.  
``It's been a long trip ... I'm happy to see them running in the 
woods of Colorado at last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials plan to release two wildcats, one male and one  
female, on Thursday, and phase in the release of the remaining 
seven animals. In all, they hope to release 110 wildcats in high 
mountains over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have hired four people to track the lynx and monitor  
the reintroduction; the lynx will wear radio collars. The project 
is estimated to cost $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials decided to re-establish the 2- to 2 1/2-foot  
wildcat, which weighs about 22 pounds, after the Fish and Wildlife 
Service in June recommended adding the lynx to the list of 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts have been resisted by ranchers, farmers, hunting  
outfitters and residents who live and work in wildlife areas. They 
fear the reintroduction may lead to land-use restrictions in 
national forest areas and the animals may attack livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know as we have any objection against the lynx. It's  
just if the lynx do well there, these people are going to say this 
is good lynx habitat and then maybe close it off for cattle,'' said 
rancher Ed Oliver. He runs cattle on nearby mountain meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of a broader effort by environmentalists and others  
to re-establish species of predators in the West to complete 
ecosystems, said Dan Chu, regional organizer for National Wildlife 
Federation in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife activists say the reintroduction of the wolf into  
Yellowstone National Park has been such a success that it is now a 
bigger attraction for visitors than the grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, ranchers and others have loudly opposed the release  
of Mexican gray wolves. Five of 11 wolves released last year have 
been shot, and authorities say the shootings may have been an 
attempt to sabotage the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx once roamed freely across the West, but like the  
beaver, its numbers were reduced by trappers. The species also was 
harmed by development, from logging to road construction to ski 
area development. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say the lynx once roamed in 16 states, but  
they can only confirm its existence in Washington, Montana and 
Maine, and possibly Minnesota. The cats range up to 100 square 
miles and feed predominantly on snowshoe hare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lynx are extremely elusive,'' Chu said. ``They are very hard  
to spot. ... I think you're going to be lucky to even see one.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- At first glance, he doesn't look like the little  
baldheaded kid in the funny papers, but there's a bit of Charlie 
Brown in Anthony Rapp, late of ``Rent'' and now star of the new 
Broadway version of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk to Rapp for a while and the similarities become more  
apparent, despite the mop of blond hair that covers his head. 
Sitting in an empty rehearsal hall, the 27-year-old actor is 
thoughtful -- but not somber -- talkative and polite. His colleagues 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthony really is an open book -- a sweet, kind and decent  
person whose humanity is very close to the surface,'' says director 
Michael Mayer, who chose Rapp to play the lead in this musical 
adaptation of ``Peanuts,'' the Charles M. Schulz comic strip. ``He 
comes to every relationship with a `positivity' that is very much 
like Charlie Brown's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Rapp's last three years have been filled with a series of  
ups and downs that would have shaken the strongest of souls. In 
1996, Rapp played Mark, the world-weary video artist in the 
original off-Broadway production of ``Rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its young creator, Jonathan Larson, died unexpectedly just  
before performances began. Yet the musical lived on, moving to 
Broadway to become one of the biggest hits of the 1990s. The 
following year, while Rapp was still appearing in ``Rent,'' his 
mother died after a three-year battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	```Rent' became like a lifeline through all that,'' he says now.  
``I never got bored, but the show was exhausting. Anything else 
after that will be a piece of cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp stayed with ``Rent'' until January 1998. Of the original  
principal actors, he was the only one left in the cast. ``What we 
had was so precious, so rare. We had gone through it together,'' he 
recalls. ``Although I loved working with new members of the cast, 
sometimes it got a little lonely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp gave ``Rent'' one more go, appearing in the London  
production for several months before leaving the show for good. He 
started rehearsals for ``Charlie Brown'' last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing the star of ``Rent'' to appear in ``Charlie Brown,''  
was, according to Mayer, an excellent opportunity to demonstrate a 
fresh, contemporary take on ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' 
which was first done off-Broadway more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Brown'' is a homecoming of sorts for Rapp, who grew up  
in Joliet, Ill. He played Snoopy in a summer camp production of the 
show in Pennsylvania when he was 7. ``My mom was a nurse at the 
camp and the three of us kids -- my brother, my sister and I -- were 
there, too,'' he says. ``It was strange, but when we started 
rehearsals for this production, I found that I remembered most of 
the lyrics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the age of 9, Rapp was ready for Broadway, cast in a musical  
version of ``The Little Prince,'' which never opened. Shuttling 
back and forth between Joliet and New York, Rapp eventually got 
cast in one of Yul Brynner's tours of ``The King and I'' and on 
Broadway in ``Precious Sons,'' a family drama that starred Ed 
Harris and Judith Ivey. It didn't run long, but Rapp, at age 14, 
got noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs in the stage and screen versions of ``Six Degrees of  
Separation'' followed as well as roles in such films as 
``Adventures in Babysitting,'' ``School Ties'' and ``Dazed and 
Confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Charlie Brown, Rapp is dealing with a cultural icon  
imbedded in the consciousness of just about everyone. The musical, 
written by Clark Gesner, originally opened in 1967 off-Broadway 
where it ran for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest version incorporates material from the last 30 years  
of comic strips as well as several new songs. Yet the overall tone 
of the piece remains the same, with Charlie Brown still enduring 
the humiliations of that professional dyspeptic, Lucy Van Pelt; a 
recalcitrant kite; a winless baseball team, and the elusive little 
red-haired girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer has opted for a multiracial cast to give the show a more  
contemporary feel. There's an Asian Linus, Lucy's blanket-clutching 
brother, played by B.D. Wong. And a black Schroeder, portrayed by 
Stanley Wayne Mathis, who delivers a new song, ``Beethoven Day,'' 
celebrating his favorite composer. 
</P>
<P>
	The director hired Ilana Levine of ``The Last Night of  
Ballyhoo'' for the pivotal role of Lucy, while song-and-dance man 
Roger Bart gives Snoopy a jazzier beat than in the original. 
Another new addition is the character of Sally, Charlie Brown's 
sister, portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth, who gleefully torments her 
older sibling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp finds the pervasiveness of Charlie Brown's persona a  
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I work, I try to absorb it rather than put my  
thoughts onto it,'' he says. ``I try to let it tell me what it is. 
And in this case, I had such a great chance to observe and read and 
absorb 50 years worth of material. Charlie Brown has changed a lot 
in that time, too. There are a lot of different colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, `Peanuts' was a lot darker. In the earlier  
strips, Charlie Brown called himself `stupid' all the time and was 
really, really tough on himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the actor insists part of Charlie Brown's strength is his  
persistence, his optimism -- his putting faith in someone or 
something even though, as Rapp puts it, ``the only historical 
evidence is failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mayer, the hardest part in portraying these little  
people is to retain their childlike qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much that they are cartoons that make them  
difficult to play,'' the director says. ``I think the difficulty is 
to keep an adult sensibility with a childlike quality. And Anthony 
does that beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in ``Charlie Brown,'' Rapp is working on other things,  
writing a book about his mother's illness and his relationship with 
her as well as the whole ``Rent'' experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was my center,'' he says simply, talking of a  
childhood in which his parents divorced when he was 2. ``She had a 
quiet strength and a deep love for her children. She was the oldest 
of 13 kids in a very hectic family. She always told me that I 
taught her. I always was strong-willed and clear-headed about what 
I wanted -- and she was really supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp's mother was supportive, too, after he openly declared his  
homosexuality in his theater bio for ``The Destiny of Me,'' a Larry 
Kramer play he did off-Broadway in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has become an unofficial spokesman, speaking at high  
schools and colleges about gay issues and the questions of coming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, everyone's private life is their own business. I  
don't think anybody should be forced to do anything, but I also, to 
some degree, think that to the extent when you are not helping, you 
are part of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether his openness has hurt his own career, Rapp isn't sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``People who are smart know it doesn't matter, and I wish there  
were more people out. Maybe it has interfered with some Hollywood 
roles,'' he says, but adds with typical Charlie Brown optimism, 
``There are worse things to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Auto Sales Up 12 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales for cars and light trucks increased by  
12 percent over the start of 1998, as the sales momentum from the 
end of the year carried through to 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, said  
Wednesday its sales were up 4 percent. The increase was mainly due 
to a rise in passenger car sales, as its light truck division saw 
nearly a 4 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	As a group, GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG had a 9  
percent increase in U.S. sales. Foreign automakers did even better: 
Asian companies had an 18 percent increase, while European 
companies were up 21 percent, based on the daily sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry was amazingly strong,'' said analyst Maryann  
Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. ``With all the year-end clearance 
sales, I would have thought people who wanted to buy a car would 
have come in and bought a car last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most automakers that offer pickups, minivans or sport utility  
vehicles reported surging sales on the highly profitable models, 
though GM did not. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials said the company was still working through delays  
from labor strikes last summer that slowed the retooling needed to 
build new versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 
pickups. They said GM would add enough capacity to build 250,000 
more trucks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plants are going full-blast, but inventories aren't where  
we want them to be,'' said Donald DeVeaux, director of North 
American market analysis for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of GM's truck lineup -- such as the Chevy Tahoe,  
Jimmy SUVs and the Chevy Venture minivan -- were also down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat surprising, because the truck market is larger  
than just pickup trucks,'' Keller said. ``While GM has an inventory 
problem in the pickup sector, they have no shortage of SUVs or 
minivans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger car sales were up 11 percent over a slow January last  
year. The Oldsmobile division got the biggest boost, thanks to the 
new Alero. Pontiac and Buick also saw sales increases due to 
midsize sedans, namely the Pontiac Grand Am and Buick Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's decision to sell all its SC coupes with a third door on  
the driver's side appeared to pay off. The model's sales were up 26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Japanese automakers reported wildly different results.  
Mitsubishi Motors Co. said its sales were up 18.7 percent, while 
struggling Mazda Motor Co. said it sales fell 3.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller and GM officials said much of the increases came from  
good economic times -- low interest rates, high employment, cheap 
new car prices -- rather than sales incentives. As long as those 
factors didn't change, they said, the industry would do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people buy a car using some method of financing,'' Keller  
said. ``The actual dollar level of incentives in the market today 
is a few hundred dollars less than it was in summer, but the 
consumer is probably getting that much benefit from lower interest 
rates and low finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dream.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico May Host Baseball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball is looking to expand to another  
international frontier this year: Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-game series between the Chicago White Sox and Texas  
Rangers in May might be moved to San Juan, according to officials 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	No final decision has been made, the officials said, adding  
there is a 50-50 chance the series will be moved. It currently is 
scheduled for May 10-12 at Comiskey Park in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, baseball is opening the season outside the  
United States and Canada. The NL champion San Diego Padres moved 
their home opener on April 4 to Monterrey, Mexico, where the Padres 
met the New York Mets two years ago in the first regular-season 
games ever played outside the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, baseball is considering a proposal to have the  
Seattle Mariners open the 2000 season in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	AL Most Valuable Player Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez, among  
the top Puerto Ricans in the major leagues, make the Rangers the 
focal point for any games in Puerto Rico, the baseball officials 
said, speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Texas had the fourth-highest attendance average in the  
AL last year, 36,141, making the Rangers reluctant to give up any 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had the third-lowest attendance in the AL, averaging  
17,609. As part of any agreement, the White Sox would be 
compensated for the lost home games, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, the executive director of baseball operations in  
the commissioner's officer, said there was a possibility of playing 
in Puerto Rico but declined to identify the teams involved. Others, 
however, confirmed the Rangers-White Sox series was the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't contacted me at all,'' White Sox general manager  
Ron Schueler said. ``We haven't heard anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers general manager Doug Melvin did not return a telephone  
call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Miami Court Overturns Libel Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former U.S. diplomat who accused a Cuban exile  
group of using taxpayer money for political campaigns won a 
reversal Wednesday of a libel verdict against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This represents complete vindication,'' said Wayne Smith, a  
former chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was ordered to pay $40,000 in damages in 1996 after a jury  
found he tried to harm the Cuban American National Foundation by 
lying during a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he based his accusations of misuse of funds primarily  
on a 1988 essay by John Spicer Nichols, a colleague, in The Nation, 
a liberal political magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said that the federally funded National Endowment  
For Democracy, which is headed by U.S. congressmen, gave $390,000 
in grants to the foundation between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period, a political action committee founded by  
foundation directors gave the same amount in campaign donations to 
several congressmen, including some National Endowment board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit foundation maintains that Smith's statement was  
false and defamatory, Dominguez said. The foundation said the 
statement cost it $725,000 in donations and damaged its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he never suggested that the foundation broke the law.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believed that my statement is correct and still believe  
so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the jury found against him, Florida's 3rd District  
Court of Appeal said the judge erred in refusing to show the entire 
television documentary and by not instructing the jury on the 
doctrine of ``substantial truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under that doctrine, a statement does not have to be accurate if  
the ``gist'' of the statement is true, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	G. Luis Dominguez, a director of the foundation and an attorney  
for the group, said the appeals court went too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're taking the jury decision away from the jury,'' he  
said. ``Why have a jury of your peers decide the facts when judges 
can then come in and say, `Well, we don't agree with the jury?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The group likely will appeal the decision, Dominguez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith is a senior fellow and director of the Cuba program at the  
Center for International Policy in Washington. He advocates 
dialogue and engagement with the government of Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and supports an easing of the U.S. trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban American National Foundation takes a harder line  
against the government in Havana and has been a staunch supporter 
of the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Study: Races Find Common TV Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By standard television measurements, ``The Steve  
Harvey Show'' isn't a hit. Last week it ranked 101st on the Nielsen 
Media Research list of 132 prime-time programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among black audiences, though, the WB's Thursday night comedy is  
the most popular show on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one example of how blacks and whites differ in what they  
watch. A new study, however, shows the races may be finding more 
common ground as networks do a better job putting together 
multiethnic casts. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last three months of 1998, six shows ranked among the  
20 most-watched series in both black and white homes, according to 
the study by TN Media, an advertising buying firm. They were 
``ER,'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``Monday Night Football,'' ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The CBS Sunday Movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the two races had only ``Monday Night Football''  
in common as a favorite show. The three entertainment series on the 
recent list have multiethnic casts, which is becoming a more 
frequent practice, said Stacey Lynn, vice president of broadcast 
research at TN Media. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger networks that tried to establish themselves by appealing  
to a black audience -- Fox, the WB and UPN -- have recently broadened 
their appeal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is now the top-rated network among both blacks and whites  
after several years in which Fox had the largest claim on the black 
audience, the study said. CBS's ratings are remarkably similar for 
both races. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be because CBS's shows appeal to an older audience and  
many of the black-oriented programs on other networks are aimed at 
young people, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point there is a lot of common ground and age is one  
of those things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB and UPN still have significantly higher ratings among  
blacks. So far, the WB is doing a much better job than its rival in 
broadening its audience without alienating blacks, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is having the most difficult time attracting a black  
audience. NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa said last month 
the network needed to do a better job reflecting the country's 
diversity instead of concentrating on wealthy, white city-dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Black households watch an average of 70 hours of television each  
week and white households watch 50 hours, the study said. The gap 
has steadily shrunk over the past five years.

	GOP Considers Clinton Finding  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today searched for an exit  
from President Clinton's impeachment trial as Democrats accused 
them of considering ``extralegal devices'' to condemn the president 
without removing him from office. The GOP senators were struggling 
among themselves on a proposal for a formal finding of presidential 
wrongdoing. The latest draft alleged Clinton ``willfully provided 
false and misleading'' grand jury testimony and impeded efforts to 
uncover evidence in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Democrats said they 
were ready with numerous amendments to the GOP proposal, including 
some that would cite Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for 
prosecutorial misconduct. The trial resumes tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	Gephardt Passes On White House Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said today  
he hasn't made any decision who he will support in the 2000 
presidential race but he will not be among the contenders. Gephardt 
formally told fellow Democrats he will forgo a White House bid and 
focus on recapturing the House for his party. Vice President Al 
Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic nod, was campaigning in 
New Hampshire and refused to say whether he requested Gephardt's 
endorsement. On the GOP side, the Committee to Restore American 
Values, a conservative coalition, interviewed Steve Forbes, Gary 
Bauer, Alan Keyes, Rep. John Kasich, Sen. Bob Smith and former Vice 
President Dan Quayle for possible endorsements.

	Kosovo Rebels Agree to Talks  
</P>
<P>
	DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Separatists in Kosovo indicated  
today that they will participate in this weekend's peace talks in 
France, and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist party 
also hinted at attendance, saying it supported a political solution 
for the province. But the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army demanded a 
guarantee that a vote on independence would be part of any peace 
accord with Serbia -- a move that dimmed prospects for the 
negotiations. NATO is threatening to attack if the Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians don't start talking by Saturday and strike a deal by Feb. 
19 to end 11 months of fighting. 

</P>
<P>
	Taliban, U.S. Hold Rare Meeting  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- High-level talks between the United  
States and Afghanistan's Taliban rulers were held today in 
Pakistan's capital, officials said, but details of the discussion 
were kept secret. The talks were the first face-to-face meeting 
since last August, when the United States fired missiles at what it 
suspected were terrorist training camps set up by Osama bin Laden 
in eastern Afghanistan. It appeared likely that bin Laden, who the 
Taliban have repeatedly refused to hand over, would have topped the 
meeting's agenda.

	CAVALESE, Italy (AP) -- On the eve of Capt. Richard Ashby's  
court-martial, relatives of the 20 skiers who died in last year's 
cable car crash held hands in silence to remember those killed by 
the low-flying U.S. Marine jet. They stood in a semicircle around 
the spot where the gondola slammed into the ground. The doomed ski 
lift wasn't marked on the map used by Ashby, but prosecutors say he 
still is responsible because he was flying too fast and too low. 
Ashby faces charges of involuntary manslaughter.

	N.Korea Shortages May Be Easing  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Some North Koreans are getting more  
food, after leader Kim Jong Il ordered an end to distribution 
delays, Seoul's intelligence agency said. Kim issued a special 
directive in December, ordering that food rations should not be 
delayed for more than 12 days and that the usual twice-a-month food 
distribution schedule must be kept, the service said. Three years 
of bad weather, combined with decades of economic mismanagement, 
have caused the collapse of the farming system in North Korea.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Profits Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Profits at Anheuser-Busch Cos. rose in the  
fourth quarter, as domestic beer pricing strategies continue to pay 
off for the world's largest brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light earned $169 million, or 35  
cents per share, in the final quarter of 1998, beating analysts' 
expectations by about two cents. That marked an increase of 17 
percent from $137 million, or 28 cents per share, in the 1997 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth quarter revenues rose to $3.08 billion from $2.92 billion  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based brewery's earnings rose largely as a result  
of improved volumes and pricing for domestic beer sales and 
increased operating profits from manufacturing and theme 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Anheuser-Busch earned $1.23 billion, or $2.53 per  
share, on revenue of $13.21 billion. In 1997, the brewer earned 
$1.17 billion, or $2.34 a share, on revenue of $12.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for 1998 rose to $11.25 billion from $11.07 billion in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch stock was down $1.06 1/4 per share, or 1.5 percent,  
Wednesday to close at $68.93 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Athletes Debut at Millrose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long before pole vaulting became an accepted  
event for women, Chinese coaches were recruiting women and grooming 
them for world competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the pioneers, former world record-holders Sun Caiyun and  
Cai Weiyan, along with half-miler Zhang Jian, will become the first 
Chinese-born athletes to compete in the prestigious Millrose Games 
at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One other Chinese athlete, hurdler Tong Li, who was born in the  
United States and changed his name to Tony Lee, was a Millrose 
competitor during the early 1980s. Another Chinese athlete, high 
jumper Zhu Jianhua, competed in the Garden, but never in the 
Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a privilege we are the first team to participate in this  
meet,'' Sun said Wednesday through a translator, Zhou Xinmin, the 
team manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaulters have impressive credentials.  
</P>
<P>
	Sun, 25, set the world indoor record 11 times and the world  
outdoor record six times, many before the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation, the world governing body, recognized the 
event. She became the first 14-foot vaulter in 1996, the 1994 
Goodwill Games champion, the fourth-place finisher at the 1997 
World Outdoor Championships and won Chinese titles in 1992, 1993 
and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Cai, also 25 and a former gymnast and acrobat, set the world  
outdoor record of 13-4 1/4 in 1995. She since has raised her best to 
14-3 1/4 indoors, won the bronze medal at the 1997 World Indoor 
Championships and took the silver medal at the 1997 World 
University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the women's pole vault will become an Olympic event  
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women, who are from different provinces in China, began  
their vaulting careers in 1987, when each was 14. Both started 
under similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	They were competing in other sports when track and field coaches  
spotted their talents and suggested they try vaulting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before that, I had no idea about pole vaulting,'' Sun said.  
``The coach realized there were only men pole vaulters in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Liu Huiguang, liked her size (she was 5-6 then, she's  
5-7 now) and athleticism, since she participated in many sports, 
most often basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning, I was too thin and lacked strength,'' said  
Sun, whose first clearance was 9-2 1/4. ``The coach then gave me 
special strength training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cai was persuaded to become a vaulter by a coach who noticed her  
talent during an acrobatics competition. Previously, the coach 
discovered a men's vaulter from the acrobatic ranks and he was 
making good progress, so he figured a woman also would do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked if I was afraid,'' Cai said through Zhou. ``I said  
no. I found it exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The height Cai first cleared was 10-4, but not until after  
months of trying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men have gone 6 meters (19-8 1/4), women can go 5 meters  
(16-4 3/4),'' Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's world outdoor record is 15-0 3/4 by Australia's Emma  
George, a former circus performer. Sergei Bubka is the men's world 
record-holder, at 20-1 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese vaulters took some needling when they began their  
new sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friends said it was a men's sport, not fit for women,'' Sun  
said. ``Now, they think I made the right choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started practicing the pole vault, some girls said it  
was a dangerous sport,'' Cai said. ``The coach wanted other girls, 
but they were afraid. I wasn't afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, there are more and more women getting into the event.''  
</P>
<P>
	The two estimate there are about 100 women vaulters in China,  
although Sun and Cai still are the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither is bothered by the flashy outfits many vaulters wore  
last year during competitions, causing some controversy because of 
their skimpiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're easier to run and jump in,'' Sun said. ``We don't  
think about them much during competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, the Chinese, neither of whom is ranked among the  
top 10 now, will face a field that includes the Czech Republic's 
Daniela Bartova, another former world record-holder and ranked No. 
4 in the world, and Russia's Yelena Belyakova, the 1998 Goodwill 
Games champion and No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang will compete in the 800 meters against six-time Millrose  
winner Joetta Clark and Olympian Meredith Rainey. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearances by the Chinese athletes will mark another  
historic night for the Millrose Games, which has been filled with 
them over 92 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, the Chinese will compete in the New Balance Invitational  
at Boston. Meet director Mark Wettmore was responsible for bringing 
them to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Horse Riding Instructor Trial Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The last of the defendants in the  
killing of a horse-riding instructor was sentenced Wednesday to 20 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's husband said he had no sense of finality.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll never be over,'' James Martyn said after Michael  
Fernandez was sentenced. ``I don't have Kathleen and the baby 
doesn't have a mommy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Martyn, 32, was stabbed and shot to death two years ago  
in the kitchen of her Pelham Manor home. Her husband found her dead 
when he came home from work at the stable he operated. Their 
daughter Catherine, then 17 months old, lay in her crib, uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant, Carlos Cajigas, went to trial, was convicted of  
murder and was sentenced to 25 years to life. Another, Malcolm 
James, pleaded guilty to robbery and weapons charges, testified 
against Cajigas and was sentenced to 1 1/2 to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 23, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, admitting  
he had helped plot the botched robbery that led to the killing and 
had driven the getaway car.

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm To Lay Off Nearly 700 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Slow sales of its digital phone technologies  
overseas has caused telecommunications company Qualcomm Inc. to lay 
off nearly 700 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 6 percent of Qualcomm's total work  
force of more than 11,000, which ballooned from 1,000 employees in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will provide severance packages and career  
counseling to 350 full-time employees at the company's headquarters 
in San Diego, 110 full-time employees at the company's 
international offices and 220 temporary employees. Another 250 
employees will be reassigned to other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm spokesman Jeff Felk would not disclose details of  
severance packages, but he said the company estimates it will take 
a $20 million charge in the second quarter as a result of the 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the company reported first-quarter revenues of $941  
million, the highest in its 13-year history and a 20 percent 
increase over the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Welch Defends His Olympic Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tom Welch, the man at the center of the  
Salt Lake Olympic storm, apologized Wednesday for the discomfort 
caused by the scandal, but insisted that other Olympic leaders knew 
more than they now claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is ironic that those who were so supportive of our efforts  
to secure the games now feel the need to distance themselves,'' 
Welch, the man who led the committee seeking the Olympic bid for 
Salt Lake, said in a letter to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he did not name names, his comments clearly referred to  
Gov. Mike Leavitt, Salt Lake Organizing Committee acting president 
Frank Joklik and SLOC board members who had served on the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch insisted that decisions about courting International  
Olympic Committee members during Salt Lake's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games were made cooperatively and not by him and Dave 
Johnson, who helped win the games as a bid executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had our agreed course of action been questioned at the time by  
those to whom we reported, no doubt we would have been pleased to 
pursue other avenues,'' Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wooing of IOC members with some $1 million in cash,  
scholarships and free medical care, travel expenses and gifts is 
being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department, an ethics panel 
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. An initial IOC investigation was completed Jan. 24, and 
Utah's attorney general promises a probe after the other 
investigations are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, who was chairman of the bid committee, has resigned but  
remains on the job until he is replaced. He claims he did not know 
about excessive spending on IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who had been president of SLOC but resigned after being  
charged with spousal abuse in 1997, was stripped Jan. 8 of his 
pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract. Johnson, who 
became senior vice president of SLOC after the bid, also was forced 
to resign that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said in his letter that he is confidant that full  
disclosure by all parties will clear up the allegations of 
pandering for IOC votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, he told CNN that Leavitt was well aware of  
the bid committee's activities, and that he had met sons and 
daughters of IOC members brought to the United States on 
scholarships funded by SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt spokeswoman Vicki Varela said the governor did not know  
about inappropriate activities of the bid committee and that while 
he may have met some students, he did not know they were being 
supported with bid committee money. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch confirmed that the bid committee took $50,000 in cash to  
Budapest in June 1995, when the IOC chose Salt Lake, but said it 
was for paying the expenses of hundreds in the Salt Lake 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed an earlier Associated Press report that the  
son of IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo had 
said he could influence four or five IOC votes for $30,000 to 
$35,000 on the eve of the 1995 vote in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC Chairman Robert Garff has said he expects the ethics report  
due out next week will reveal no new broad categories of misdeeds. 
But it is expected to shed light on how much other bid committee 
members, including prominent business leaders, the mayor and 
governor, knew about the lavish spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, discussions about reorganizing the SLOC  
continued. Leavitt and Garff have been talking with committee 
members about enlarging the board of trustees to broaden community 
representation and to make it advisory in nature. The board's 
executive committee likely would be reconfigured and given more 
power to guide SLOC's hired managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt and Garff also have been trying to recruit a new chief  
executive. Mitt Romney, a venture capitalist and former Republican 
candidate for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, is considered the 
frontrunner. The SLOC board would have to ratify any choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the games turned up the heat Wednesday, saying they  
will not wait after all for the end of the legislative session 
before launching a petition drive aimed at putting the 2002 Winter 
Games on the 2000 general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Utahns for Responsible Public Spending would need around 125,000  
signatures to get the measure on the ballot. The petition is 
phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or reimburse the debt 
or obligations of any organization hosting the Olympic Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Leader Stephen Pace said the group had intended to give the  
Legislature a chance to send the issue to voters, but that now 
appears unlikely. ``The Legislature is pretty much in total 
denial,'' Pace said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Olene Walker approved the petition for circulation, but  
said no to Pace's request to circulate it via the Internet and has 
not yet ruled on whether the group can publish the petition as an 
insert in newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Another Major Facelift for Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The most important change to the New York Knicks  
might not be the addition of Latrell Sprewell. It could be the 
subtraction of Charles Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks enter the lockout-shortened 1999 season with a  
drastically altered roster. The talent seems to be upgraded, but 
the toughness has been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are Oakley, the heart and soul of the team, John Starks,  
the spark plug off the bench, and veterans Chris Mills and Terry 
Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are Sprewell, the three-time All-Star best known  
for choking his coach, and a host of others including Marcus Camby, 
Kurt Thomas, Dennis Scott, David Wingate and Rick Brunson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a whole different team in '99,'' said Herb Williams, who  
along with Patrick Ewing is the only holdover from the Knicks team 
that went to the NBA Finals just five years ago, losing in seven 
games to the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer will opponents fear the wrath of Oakley when they  
drive the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer will they wonder whether Starks will come off the  
bench to quickly sink three 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, opponents will struggle to figure the Knicks out as they  
struggle to figure themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, the trouble with all the newness is we're not going  
to have a chance to work our way through it,'' said Jeff Van Gundy, 
who enters his fourth season as head coach. ``It's a little bit 
scary for a team that's a little bit older and undergoing a lot of 
change to be doing that in this type of year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will certainly be different, and problems could  
develop as New York tries to mix the best of the old with the best 
of the new. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens the first time the Knicks are down by a point with  
10 seconds left? Who gets the last shot? 
</P>
<P>
	Do they give the ball to Ewing, as they've done for more than a  
decade? 
</P>
<P>
	Do they give it to Sprewell, who can create his own shot as well  
as anyone? 
</P>
<P>
	Do they give it to Allan Houston, who was supposed to be the  
team's next superstar until Sprewell came along? 
</P>
<P>
	Only time will tell.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about this team. I think we've grown to  
really like to see each other do well,'' said Houston, who has 
consistently deferred to Ewing during his two seasons in New York. 
``We really seem to pick each other up in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as far as intangibles, you really can't tell if this team  
is better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, the Knicks have been unable to make it  
past the second round of the playoffs despite the additions of 
Houston, Larry Johnson, Chris Childs, Charlie Ward and countless 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	They were eliminated 4-1 by the Indiana Pacers last season after  
Ewing unexpectedly returned from a career-threatening wrist 
fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	So many years of getting older but not advancing further led  
general manager Ernie Grunfeld to trade Oakley, who had been with 
the Knicks for 10 years, to the Toronto Raptors for Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby, whose work ethic and durability have been suspect during  
his first two seasons in the NBA, already has fallen out of favor 
with Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	He will start the season behind Thomas, who was signed away from  
Dallas as a free agent, on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing Oak, that's the question mark,'' backup center Chris  
Dudley said. ``We've got to take care of that. We have to gang 
rebound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means even Sprewell, who never had to hit the boards in  
Golden State, will have to make up for some of what was lost in the 
Oakley trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Same goes for Houston, Ward and the other guards who in the past  
never had to do much of the dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will give the Knicks an explosive scorer, and Scott  
should replace some of the bench scoring that Starks brought to the 
team. But until New York adjusts to life without Oakley, nobody is 
ready to say that this year's team is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten more athletic and given up some size,'' Dudley  
said. ``The key is if we can improve the things that are helped by 
those trades -- scoring and movement -- without getting hurt by the 
rebounding.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Scott Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All things considered, ``Dilbert'' cartoonist  
Scott Adams would rather be home with his cat, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adams knows that you can't escape the demands of work. So  
here he is, some 450 miles from his Northern California house and 
pet, helping create and promote a new animated TV series based on 
his popular comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a temporary state of affairs. Hollywood, it turns out,  
isn't his favorite hangout. Adams does most of his work on UPN's 
``Dilbert'' from afar, relying on e-mail and phone calls to allow 
him to weigh in on scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his paper counterpart, television's Dilbert (the voice of  
actor Daniel Stern) is a victim of corporate idiocy and 
inefficiency. The series also brings to life Dilbert's devious 
companion, Dogbert, fellow workers Alice and Wally and the evil, 
pointy-haired boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams spent enough time in the corporate jungle, working for  
Crocker National Bank and Pacific Bell in various jobs, to accrue 
his own tales of woe. Now that he mostly labors alone in a home 
office, he relies on readers to share their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of ``Dilbert'' -- which includes best-selling books  
and a variety of merchandise as well as the TV show -- hasn't turned 
Adams into a man of leisure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working harder than I ever imagined,'' he said. ``It was  
never my plan that I work harder. ... People wave obscene amounts 
of money in front of you and say 'You're working 14 hours a day. 
Would this make you work 15?' And you just go, 'Yeah. Yeah, it 
would.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Relaxation, Adams said in a recent interview, comes in small  
spurts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the master of the micro-vacation. Several times a day I  
can stop and pet my cat, and I eat out almost every night,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How involved are you in UPN's ``Dilbert''?  
</P>
<P>
	Adams: Very involved. Later this afternoon I'll be with the  
writers, and we're going to be 'breaking stories,' to use the 
Hollywood lingo: taking lots of different story ideas, figuring out 
which ones are best. I'll be integral to that. My special 
contribution is to say a story is or is not Dilbert-like, as 
opposed to whether it's just a good story. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Has working on the TV show given you new grist for the  
cartoon mill? 
</P>
<P>
	Adams: There's no shortage of grist, but unfortunately it's  
Hollywood grist and it does not translate. There are rhythms and 
ways of being around here that you only see in two places: One is 
on a TV show done by people in Hollywood. Two is here. The TV shows 
are the way they are because the people are like this, and I think 
the people are like this because they see it on television. 
</P>
<P>
	3. So what is the entertainment industry's style of doing  
things? 
</P>
<P>
	Adams: The real world is maniacal about process and improving  
things, starting with something that's pretty good and working 
forever to identify the defects and make it better. Here it's try 
once and then kill the baby. Everything is about who's hot and 
who's got the power. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Any specific experiences you could recount?  
</P>
<P>
	Adams: At a meeting, I made the mistake of sitting in a high  
executive's chair once. It was a nice chair and I took it. While 
everybody was good-natured about it, the message was very clear: 
You don't sit in that chair. As bad as corporate America is, you 
rarely find a CEO who cares what chair they sit in. They have their 
own set of problems, which I talk about (in the comic strip), but 
that level of thing I just had never seen before. This was prior to 
my current association (with UPN). 
</P>
<P>
	5. Any concern your Hollywood experience might alter your  
perspective? 
</P>
<P>
	Adams: I make sure that I never come to Hollywood longer than I  
can hold my breath, metaphorically. I'm sure it's gotta be 
airborne. I flew in this morning and I will fly back without 
sleeping here tonight.

<HEADLINE> Sun-Observing Satellite Now Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The SOHO sun-observing satellite has returned  
to service more than a month after the gyroscope that kept it 
stable malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion satellite's controllers returned it to service  
Tuesday using a new computer program to help it keep its 
orientation without the failed gyroscope, Bernhard Fleck, European 
Space Agency project scientist for SOHO, said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview. SOHO stands for Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble first developed on SOHO last June when it began spinning  
out of control. Scientists were able to return it to service in 
September, but it was frozen, and two of its three gyroscopes were 
damaged, said Fleck, who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The third gyro failed Dec. 21.  
</P>
<P>
	Without the gyroscopes to keep track of its position, the  
satellite had to constantly fire onboard jets to keep pointed 
toward the sun, a practice that threatened to rapidly exhaust its 
fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleck said engineers in the Netherlands were able to develop a  
computer program that allowed the satellite to bypass the broken 
gyroscopes and instead use a star tracker to allow the satellite to 
determine its position. 
</P>
<P>
	With that information, three spinning momentum wheels aboard the  
craft can be directed to speed up or slow down to keep it properly 
oriented, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This was done on Saturday, the craft was maneuvered to a new  
position on Monday and, on Tuesday, said Fleck, ``we returned to 
normal where the spacecraft is perfectly pointing toward the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Verdant, SOHO's program manager, described the effort as  
similar to ``instructing an airplane pilot from the ground to 
execute very complex maneuvers and helping him make a successful 
landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time that a spacecraft equipped with  
gyroscopes has carried on working without them, the European Space 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	SOHO was launched in December 1995, and the mission is now  
expected to continue until 2003, allowing it to observe intense 
solar activity when the number of sunspots reaches a maximum around 
mid-2000.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Lakers May Be Courting Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman and the Lakers would be a  
marriage made in, well, Hollywood, and the team is definitely 
interested in the seven-time rebounding champ. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a couple of pressing questions remain. For one, does  
Rodman really want to play for Los Angeles? For another, when will 
he officially hire an agent, or will he represent himself? 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported today that Lakers executive vice  
president Jerry West spoke Tuesday with Rodman's new agent, Steve 
Chasman, and was awaiting word from the 37-year-old forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has played on five of the last 10 NBA champions,  
including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed it, but everyone's putting the cart before the  
horse,'' West told the Times. ``We don't have any idea whether 
there's any interest on his part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, Chasman plans to discuss the  
situation with Rodman, who has said he would like to play for the 
Orlando Magic but also has shown interest in the Lakers. Houston 
and Miami are also interested. 
</P>
<P>
	However, leave it to the zany Rodman to do things differently.  
Chasman is not a certified agent with the players' union, meaning 
he can't negotiate a contract for Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley used to represent Rodman, but ended his  
affiliation with him last week. So from a legal standpoint, Rodman 
is currently without an agent, union spokesman Dan Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players can represent themselves and have counsel or a lawyer  
present during talks. But they cannot have that person sign or 
negotiate for him if he is not certified with the National 
Basketball Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player is entitled to represent himself, and he can seek  
advice from anyone he chooses, but that person can only advise 
him,'' Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasserman said there are a number of players, such as  
Milwaukee's Ray Allen and the recently retired Buck Williams, who 
don't have agents and negotiate their own contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can offer Rodman a veteran minimum starting salary of  
$1 million under the new labor deal. Rodman has earned $18 million 
in the last two seasons with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have reason to pursue Rodman, following a knee  
injury by reserve forward Antoine Carr. Heat coach Pat Riley has 
said Rodman would be an asset provided he follows team rules.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Wants Financial Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing complaints that new rules could turn  
every bank teller into a cop, a Texas lawmaker is proposing 
legislation aimed at protecting the financial privacy of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-reaching legislative package unveiled Wednesday by  
Republican Rep. Ron Paul would, among other things, block proposed 
anti-money laundering rules that would track the habits of bank 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two federal banking agencies are reconsidering the  
proposed ``Know Your Customer'' rules in response to the public 
outcry that started in December. The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp., for example, had received more than 14,000 e-mail messages 
and letters opposing the proposal as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers themselves have complained that the rules would 
transform every bank teller into a cop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We proclaim that American citizens have the right to be free  
of the snooping, spying, prying eyes of government bureaucrats,'' 
Paul told reporters. He said his legislation would ``give Americans 
the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their every 
financial step is not being filed away and viewed as potentially 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said about a dozen lawmakers, including House Republican  
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, had agreed to join him as co-sponsors of 
the bill to stop the ``Know Your Customer'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But the other two measures in his package -- to repeal the Bank  
Secrecy Act and to let people see the files on them created by the 
federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network -- hadn't attracted any 
co-sponsors yet and legislative prospects were clouded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank Secrecy Act of 1974 obligates banks to report  
customers' cash transactions of $10,000 or more to law enforcement 
authorities. Paul said the law has failed to help catch drug 
dealers, who ``are smarter than most bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, a physician who is on the House Banking Committee, once  
ran for president as the Libertarian Party's nominee. His strict 
constitutionalist beliefs routinely put him at odds with his fellow 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul maintains that the ``Know Your Customer'' rules violate the  
Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from, and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Money laundering is a major concern of law enforcement 
officials; it reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Paul's bill regarding files kept by the Financial  
Crimes Enforcement Network would not abolish the Treasury 
Department agency, he said he does not see any need for it. Most 
law enforcement activity should be done by states rather than 
federal ``bureaucrats carrying guns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the agency said they hadn't seen Paul's  
legislation yet and had no immediate comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the office  
of the U.S. comptroller of the currency, which regulates nationally 
chartered banks, told The Associated Press on Friday that they were 
reconsidering the ``Know Your Customer'' rules they had earlier 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association last week urged the federal  
banking regulators to withdraw the proposal, warning it could make 
Americans lose confidence in the banking system and government.

<HEADLINE> Museum To Return 3 Stolen Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The J. Paul Getty Museum is returning three  
ancient works of art to Italy after determining they were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	One sculpture sat in its collection for 17 years. The objects  
will be flown to Italy this week, along with pieces that were 
loaned to the museum for an antiquities exhibit, according to a 
statement issued by the Getty on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stolen items are a terra cotta drinking cup from 480 B.C.,  
found to have been illegally excavated from an archaeological site; 
a torso of the god Mithras from the 2nd century, found to have been 
stolen from a private Italian collection; and the sculpted head of 
a victorious athlete, a 2nd century Roman copy of an earlier Greek 
work, which was apparently taken from the storeroom of a scientific 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
	For security reasons, the museum did not say how much the pieces  
are worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody claimed the works, Getty decided to return them  
based on information supplied by experts in the field and in 
consultation with Italian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	International concern has been growing about rampant thefts of  
priceless art from collections and the looting of archaeological 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The billion-dollar museum, located on a hill in the Brentwood  
area, opened in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 24  
</P>
<P>
	Clovis (N.M.) News Journal, on U.S. and NATO response to Kosovo  
conflict: 
</P>
<P>
	As the grisly details emerge regarding the apparent massacre of  
45 ethnic Albanians whose bodies were found in the Kosovan town of 
Racak, it's almost easy to understand a knee-jerk ``bomb `em back 
to the Stone Age'' response. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Serbian authorities have moved the bodies and are  
limiting access to them, reports suggests that only nine of the 
dead people were involved in the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army, 
while the others were civilians, including three women and a 
12-year-old boy, all executed at short range. William Walker, the 
U.S. citizen who heads the NATO ``peace mission'' in Kosovo, is 
almost certainly correct that the massacre was perpetrated by 
Serbian military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to launch bombs on Serbia under color of NATO  
authority, however, is more likely to do more harm than good to the 
fragile prospects of something resembling peace in the region. The 
fact that bombing seems to be the only recourse available 
highlights just how confused and ill-conceived the NATO and U.S. 
policies toward Kosovo are. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants to prevent anti-Albanian violence in  
Kosovo. The U.S. and NATO would prefer to work their will without 
military action or occupation, but is that possible? A policy of 
hoping people will be nicer to one another on pain of stern 
lectures and occasional desultory bombing is no policy at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Before bombing again we should develop a real policy -- or leave  
the region to those who live there. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 1  
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville, on the Panama Canal:  
</P>
<P>
	Elected officials in the United States should stiffen their  
resolve to let Panama have its canal, no matter how Panamanian 
officials squirm. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 20 years ago, rampaging crowds burned U.S. flags in the  
streets of Panama's cities, and 78 percent of the people wanted 
``their'' canal, which was built by American ingenuity, sweat and 
money after the French tried and failed. 
</P>
<P>
	They got their wish.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of this year, the canal will belong to Panama. ...  
</P>
<P>
	Today ... 70 percent favor the United States staying in Panama  
and some polls find a majority want the Americans to keep the 
canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Too late.  
</P>
<P>
	Panama is a nation today ... because of the United States. The  
canal exists because of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, for nearly a century, Panamanian politics has revolved  
around Yankeebashing. Crooks like Manuel Noreiga made plenty of 
money, but little of it got to the people, or to the 
infrastructure. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Some ... are dubious about whether Panama has the expertise to  
operate the canal. Even more doubtful is its ability to get the 
money together to make badly needed improvements in the big ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's a Panamanian problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Panama's noisy patriots of the '70s, it seems, may not have done  
their country a big favor after all. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 2  
</P>
<P>
	Investor's Business Daily, Los Angeles, on President Clinton's  
budget: 
</P>
<P>
	It took the U.S. 198 years to reach its first trillion in annual  
spending. Budget forecasters foresee less than 20 years to reach 
the second trillion. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's release of President Clinton's $1.766 trillion in  
proposed fiscal year 2000 spending is a grab bag of goodies 
designed to keep the federal money pumps churning. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget also raises taxes -- not by much, to be sure --  
but he wants to take more mney so he can spend more. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, politicians of all kinds usually have been ready  
with excuses to boost spending. They quickly cite wars, recessions, 
inflation, entitlement growth and so forth. Their real motivation, 
though, is more likely vote-buying. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, federal spending has equaled at least one-fifth of  
gross domestic product. Prior to that, except in wartime, the 
federal budget never topped 20 percent of GDP. In short, the era of 
big government is still with us, no matter what the prevailing 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-spending Republicans and Democrats might rationalize that we  
can ``afford'' this much government in this new age of surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers, notably in the GOP camp, are pushing to cut  
taxes while holding the line on spending. 
</P>
<P>
	We prefer the latter option. Let people keep what they earn and  
the government's role in our lives would by definition decrease. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 30  
</P>
<P>
	Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, on government agencies and pizza:  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's pronouncement in 1996 that the era of big  
government was over was another one of his fabrications. Certainly 
the turf battle over who inspects frozen pizzas fails to meet 
anyone's definition of over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture has jurisdiction over frozen meat  
pizzas. The Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over 
frozen cheese pizzas. Heaven help the company that tries to sell a 
half-and-half. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a reasonable mind might wonder who made a federal case out  
of frozen pizzas to begin with. But they are sold across state 
lines and the public's health is a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, why should it take two agencies to inspect frozen pizzas?  
</P>
<P>
	This overlap was one of 30 redundancies cited recently by the  
General Accounting Office. The federal government has grown so 
large that it cannot see that it has two or more agencies involved 
in the same aspects of housing, job training, student aid, child 
care, welfare and food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found that unfocused and uncoordinated crosscutting  
programs waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate taxpayers and 
other program customers, and limit overall program effectiveness,'' 
the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	All those extra inspectors do not necessarily mean more  
inspections. The GAO pointed out that overlapping responsibilities 
often mean no one takes charge -- sort of like outfielders who stop 
and let the ball drop untouched to the field. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This is an issue that requires executive initiative.  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the United States has a president who is more  
interested in taking credit for things than in actually doing the 
job. Thus, the pizza battle rages on. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 3  
</P>
<P>
	Journal Star, Peoria, Ill., on death penalty:  
</P>
<P>
	Looks like triple murderer Darrell Mease of Missouri won the  
lottery by having his scheduled execution coincide with the St. 
Louis visit of Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan initially postpone  
Mease's appointment with eternity, now he has delayed it 
indefinitely, citing the pope's appeal for mercy. Life without 
parole is Mease's burden now. 
</P>
<P>
	If ever there were an indictment of the death penalty, this is  
it. Along with the pope's description of capital punishment in the 
U.S. as ``cruel'' and ``unnecessary,'' he can also add the 
adjective ``arbitrary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly begs the question, if the death penalty can't be  
administered fairly and consistently, then how can we apply it at 
all? If Mease got leniency, why shouldn't every one of the other 87 
prisoners on Missouri's Death Row receive the same merciful 
treatment? 
</P>
<P>
	This newspaper has not been opposed to the death penalty, but  
it's not something to be enthusiastic about either, despite its 
public support. For someone like John Wayne Gacy, whose crimes 
against humanity were indisputable, no tears were shed. Others have 
been a closer call. ... In those cases, we have only asked that 
every benefit of the doubt regarding the convicted murderer's guilt 
be given its due. 
</P>
<P>
	But our recent history in Illinois, where nine inmates sitting  
on Death Row have been freed after evidence later confirmed their 
innocence, has not exactly bolstered anyone's confidence in the 
integrity of capital punishment. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 28  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on Intel chip:  
</P>
<P>
	Pressure from civil-liberties groups forced Intel to alter a  
controversial feature of its new computer chip, but privacy worries 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	There was something creepy about the chip, which, when enabled,  
sent out a unique electronic ``fingerprint'' over the Internet 
based on a serial number embedded in the chip. 
</P>
<P>
	The function has many positive uses. It could improve the  
convenience and security of Web sites where consumers bank, buy 
stocks or purchase airline tickets. That promotes online commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as with ``cookies'' in browsers, however, problems arise  
when consumers lose the ability to control whether such information 
is gathered, who gets it and how it is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a study by the Federal Trade Commission found 85  
percent of surveyed Web sites collected personal information, but 
only 14 percent disclosed the practice. Some unscrupulous Web sites 
have set up cartoon characters to induce children to provide 
marketing data, a practice the Federal Trade Commission wants to 
stop. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Intel for changing course, but what were they thinking?  
Concern about online privacy has been a hot topic for years. The 
industry acknowledges that privacy worries will slow consumer 
acceptance of Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has been looking to industry leaders to voluntarily  
promote standards that protect consumers, a step almost everyone 
prefers to new regulations. Unfortunately, Intel's blunder makes it 
more likely that Congress will act. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 28.  
</P>
<P>
	Morning News, Florence, S.C., on Internet privacy:  
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if Intel, having found itself a new suit of  
clothes, regarded itself as the spiffiest dude in town and then was 
surprised to be told it was not welcome at a super-cool party 
dressed like that. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's initial excitement sprang from its development of a  
computer chip with an ID number that would help in knowing who 
somebody was as the person visited different sites on the Internet. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates were quick to object, even threatening a  
boycott, and Intel was almost as quick to respond, saying it would 
modify the chip. Now it will be up to the consumer to activate it 
instead of to deactivate it, according to press reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise seems a good one as far as purchases made on the  
Internet are concerned, although the security issue is left 
hanging. Members of Congress who spoke up were mainly voicing 
anxiety about privacy invasion, but many in government have 
legitimate worries about an array of illegalities more easily 
committed in what amounts to a vast darkness. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most other questions legislators deal with, past  
experience is little guide on this. Caution is advisable, as is 
erring on the side of respect for individual liberty. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 27  
</P>
<P>
	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on IOC investigation:  
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee isn't going to win any gold  
medals for its handling of the bribery scandal that has tarnished 
the agency and the games themselves. As the investigation into 
corruption in awarding the Winter Games to Salt Lake City 
continues, it is apparent that wholesale changes in the IOC are 
necessary if it is to regain any credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, six members of the IOC have been recommended for  
expulsion, one of them for accepting more than $216,000 in payoffs. 
But no one is buying the idea that the buck stops with those six, 
or that they alone have put the Olympic movement at risk. The 
widespread impression is of an organization, ostensibly dedicated 
to the highest ideals of internationalism and sportsmanship, that 
has put itself up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC president, to  
conduct a more widespread housecleaning ensures that the IOC and 
the games themselves remain under a cloud. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 2  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on the recent AIDS discovery:  
</P>
<P>
	The discovery that the human AIDS virus originated in  
chimpanzees has raised hopes that scientists may be nearer the goal 
that has eluded them for years -- the development of a vaccine. The 
disease has infected 35 million people and still has no cure. 
Anything that illuminates its mysterious origins is a significant 
step in the research needed to understand the structure and 
behavior of the virus. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... Research will continue and new discoveries may result from  
the chimpanzee connection. But for the foreseeable future the fight 
against AIDS must be fought with social weapons: prevention, 
education and responsible personal behavior. 

</P>
<P>

<P>
	Financial Times, London, on the Brazil economic crisis:  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, after agreeing (to) a program with the International  
Monetary Fund, has got itself into a mess. Its defense of the Real 
peg failed. So too its attempt at controlled devaluation. The 
government must now try to rebuild credibility, so that interest 
rates can fall from unsustainable levels. It needs a new plan, and 
soon. This should include additional fiscal measures, a reaffirmed 
commitment to privatization, and a new anti-inflationary anchor. 
With these elements in place, it should also involve continuing IMF 
support. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... To ensure there is no return to the bad old days, Brazil  
needs a monetary anchor. One option is a currency board. The other 
is a transparent inflation target, with the central bank charged 
with its delivery. Whichever the government chooses, there is no 
time to waste.

	The Daily Telegraph, London, Monday, on the Irish peace process:  
</P>
<P>
	Some 81 percent of Irish people, according to a poll in the  
Sunday Independent of Dublin, believe that the continued punishment 
beatings and shootings in Northern Ireland are in breach of the 
Good Friday Agreement. Meanwhile, most of the British press tamely 
follows the government in shutting its eyes and ears to what is 
going on in the province, and hoping against all reason that 
everything will turn out for the best. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... More than 60 percent of the Irish, according to the poll,  
think that early release of prisoners should be stopped because of 
the prevalence of punishment beatings. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that the violence in Northern Ireland is now worse,  
in some repects, that it was before the Good Friday Agreement. 
While the British press and government are in Never-Never Land, it 
is the Irish people who are suffering. As Tony Blair continues to 
let convicted murderers into the fray, the situation is 
deteriorating. The survivors of the generations who have fought and 
died to bring these killers to justice, and peace to Northern 
Ireland, must now be wondering what it was all for.

	The Pioneer, New Delhi, on Indo-U.S. relations:  
</P>
<P>
	There can be no meaningful improvement in Indo-U.S. relations  
without the U.S. accepting India as an equal and a country free to 
develop its nuclear arsenal and an effective global delivery system 
in keeping with its threat perceptions. It is not enough to claim 
that the U.S. now recognizes that there has been a China-aided 
proliferation in the region and India has legitimate security 
concerns. While China is aiding proliferation, Pakistan is the 
beneficiary. The U.S. continues to be brazenly indulgent towards 
Pakistan and to woo China ardently. Surely, there has to be more 
tangible evidence of a better U.S. understanding of this country's 
security concerns.

	Le Monde, Paris, on U.S. economic dominance:  
</P>
<P>
	Americans had reason to be proud at this year's international  
economic conference in Davos. 
</P>
<P>
	In a world where financial crises have claimed multiple victims  
over the past 18 months, particularly in Asia, the Americans have 
done more than just weather the storm -- they have positively 
thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president's men demonstrated a lack of grace and an  
excess of pretension rarely seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecturing first the Japanese and then the Europeans, the  
``masters of the universe'' made clear that if there were any rules 
to be made, they would make them. 
</P>
<P>
	And to those who called for more secure exchange rate methods  
and a restructuring of the global economy, Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin proved himself a master of ``no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such aggressive behavior is not without danger.  
</P>
<P>
	America is doing well now, but its health is fragile.

<P>
	In January 1997, South East Asia saw incredible levels of  
growth. Then on July 2 of the same year, Thailand's bubble 
dramatically burst.

	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. plans to impose stiff trade  
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to issue an executive  
order reinstating the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade 
Act ... and the Buy American Law. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This decision reflects growing protectionist sentiment in the  
United States, where the trade deficit is soaring to historic 
highs. But it is extremely regrettable that the United States, 
which ought to assume a leadership role in world trade, would seek 
to revive trade provisions that conflict with the principles of the 
World Trade Organization (WTO). We strongly urge the U.S. 
government to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the sanctions would likely be ruled to be in violation of  
WTO rules, the intent of the U.S. decision might be to score 
political points at home. But there is a danger that it could fan 
the flames of protectionism in the U.S. Congress and in industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States must put this rusty sword back into its sheath  
and adopt policies that follow the rules of the WTO. We must point 
out that the revival of provisions that permit the United States to 
threaten unilateral sanctions to extract concessions from its 
trading partners deflects attention away from the underlying causes 
of America's massive trade deficits such as excessive consumption 
and negative saving rates.

	The Australian, Sydney, on Olympic scandals and drugs:  
</P>
<P>
	... The Olympic movement's credibility is in tatters because of  
the bribery allegations concerning the selection of Olympic sites. 
It will do much to reinvigorate itself if a strong, comprehensive, 
equitable and transparent and universally applied anti-drugs 
protocol is adopted. Doping can be reduced given greater controls 
and commitment, but realistically we will never be totally rid of 
it, human nature being what it is. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sydney, already reeling under an international belief that  
its success in securing the 2000 Games was tainted by the IOC gravy 
train, it is imperative that the doping conference succeeds. Sydney 
will be the first Olympic host to enforce the new rules. There 
needs to be absolutely no doubt that, unlike Atlanta, all 
performers are competing on a much fairer playing field. Any shades 
of gray would reinforce the view that the Olympics have got out of

<P>
	Tages-Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland on revolution in Iran:  
</P>
<P>
	It was a people's revolution like no other. Students, the poor  
and dispossessed -- and not the mullahs -- toppled the Shah 20 years 
ago.They smashed the well-equipped but morally bankrupt regime with 
their bare hands. They got the necessary strength for this from 
hopes of justice -- justice on earth -- as Islam demands. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The current danger to the Islamic Republic comes from the rulers  
themselves. The majority of the mullahs are conservative. They are 
astoundingly unpopular, especially among the youth who comprise 
two-thirds of the 60 million Iranians. These modern men and women 
are children of the revolution. They don't want another Shah 
because they are republican and religious. But they don't want to 
be watched all the time by moral custodians. 
</P>
<P>
	President Khatami has recognized the danger. With his policies  
of openness, he wants to reform the Islamic Republic and so 
preserve it. 

</P>
<P>
	Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, Germany, on Kurdish leader:  
</P>
<P>
	Where is this man not suspected of being? He is supposed to be  
in North Korea, the Middle East, Albania, Libya, or the Sudan. All 
wrong. Now another suspicion is emerging: PKK leader Oecalan has 
not come down since he left Rome on Jan. 16. Apo, as his followers 
call him, has been circling the globe for fourteen days in a 
private airplane. He is not allowed to land where he wishes; and he 
must keep away from the one country that wants him: Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he tried to land in Rotterdam, but the heartless  
Dutch denied him. Supposedly he is headed to Athens,but even the 
Greeks do not want the Turkish number one public enemy. So, Apo 
will have to fly on until his gasoline runs out. Then, he will 
land, maybe in Germany, something this government rather wants to 
avoid, since then it would have to take him to court for killing 
rebellious PKK members. It does not trust itself to do that; the 
Kurds here might get angry. 
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, (German Chancellor Gerhard) Schroeder suggested  
he go before an international tribunal last year, rather than send 
him to Turkey. Smart decision. Too bad there is no court authorized 
to try him.Thus, the Italians let him fly, and now European 
governments hope he does not land on them.

<HEADLINE> IRS Clears Gingrich Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service has cleared an  
organization of charges that it violated its tax-exempt status when 
it helped fund a college course taught by former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, the organization said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS, concluding a three-year investigation, ruled that The  
Progress and Freedom Foundation's donations to Gingrich were 
``consistent with its stated exempt purposes,'' and Gingrich's 
course and course book ``were educational in content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, which posted the IRS decision on its Web page,  
welcomed what it said was a ``clean bill of health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IRS spokesman said the agency is barred by law from  
commenting on rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes being audited by the IRS,'' said the foundation's  
president, Jeff Eisenach. ``In this case, though, it was important 
for the IRS to resolve the questions raised by the House ethics 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that investigation, special counsel James M. Cole concluded  
that Gingrich, in a class titled ``Renewing American 
Civilization,'' which he taught at two Georgia colleges, was funded 
by tax-exempt charities for activities that were ``substantially 
motivated by partisan, political goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich denied violating tax laws and described his college  
course as nonpartisan. But he agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty for 
his misleading statements to the ethics committee as it 
investigated the financing of the college course and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling, the IRS said the content of Gingrich's course  
``was educational and never favored or opposed a candidate for 
public office.'' It said the foundation ``did not intervene on 
behalf of candidates of the Republican Party merely by promoting'' 
themes in the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., says it is  
dedicated to studying the digital revolution and its implications 
for public policy.

<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Fathi Ghanim, a veteran Egyptian editor and  
author of best-selling novels, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghanim, a state prosecutor before turning to journalism, was the  
author of many renowned novels made into films and TV movies. Among 
his most famous novels are ``The Man Who Lost his Shadow'' and 
``Zeinab and the Throne,'' both turned into TV series. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the journalists who supported the late President  
Gamal Abdel Nasser in his 1952 army coup, which ousted Egypt's 
monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Nasser made him head of the country's Middle East News  
Agency and editor-in-chief of several state newspapers, including 
the daily Al-Gomhuria and the tabloid weekly Rose el-Youssef.

Monday after a long illness. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Heuschele had been the longtime director of the Zoological  
Society of San Diego's Center for Reproduction of Endangered 
Species, or CRES. CRES was founded in 1975 with the goal of using 
scientific advances to help reverse the decline of rare and 
endangered wildlife species.

killed United Mine Workers of America reformer Joseph ``Jock'' 
Yablonski and Yablonski's wife and daughter in 1969, died Sunday of 
brain cancer in prison. He was 55. 
</P>

Yablonskis on orders from United Mine Workers President Tony Boyle 
at the family's 200-year-old brownstone house on Dec. 31, 1969, in 
Clarksville, Washington County. 
</P>

Long March, the yearlong, 6,000-mile retreat by Communist

<HEADLINE> Paramedic Wins Parental Leave Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Kevin Knussman insisted he was denied parental  
leave because he's a man. A jury agreed, awarding him $375,000 and 
making him the first man to win such a verdict under the federal 
family leave act of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In awarding the damages for mental anguish, the U.S. District  
Court jury ruled Tuesday that the state police paramedic was 
illegally denied 12 weeks of leave guaranteed by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This verdict sends a clear message it's illegal to deprive  
fathers of their rights,'' said his attorney, Sara Mandelbaum of 
the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was the nation's first sex discrimination verdict in  
favor of a man under the 6-year-old Family and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we lost, it was a big win because we brought forth the  
treatment that I received in this process and we made those people 
accountable,'' the 41-year-old Knussman said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict was read, Knussman hugged his attorneys and  
his 37-year-old wife, Kimberly, who wept quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing the Maryland State Police said they would  
ask U.S. District Judge Walter Black to examine the verdict to 
ensure the jury followed his instructions, then decide whether to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman, a 22-year state police veteran, sued the agency, three  
superiors and an administrator in 1995, alleging gender 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was his newborn daughter's primary care giver because  
his wife was near death from childbirth complications but was told 
only mothers are considered primary care givers. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman testified that he was told by the state police manager  
of leave and benefits that he couldn't get additional leave unless 
his wife were ``dead or in a coma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman was given 10 days leave in December 1994 after his  
daughter Paige was born. He unsuccessfully sought more time off. 
Knussman said he was given the full 12 weeks when his second 
daughter, Hope, was born in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have equality for one gender only. Men are entitled  
to the same rights to nurture their families,'' Ms. Mandelbaum said 
during closing arguments. ``What does it take to get leave at the 
Maryland State Police?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant state Attorney General Betty Stemley Sconion argued  
that the federal law didn't apply because Knussman wanted only paid 
sick leave while the leave act grants unpaid days off. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman already exhausted his sick leave allotment for the  
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also never mentioned in the documents he submitted to state  
police how seriously ill his wife was or that he was the primary 
care giver, Ms. Sconion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the parties intended to discriminate. ... Each  
defendant acted reasonably based on the information that was 
presented to them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sconion also denied that the benefits manager made the  
statements claimed by Knussman. She said Knussman was the one who 
suggested he would get more time off if his wife were dead or in a 
coma. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no presumption in favor of women against men,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman's attorneys argued that even if he had exhausted his  
sick leave, he was entitled to an additional 12 weeks under the 
federal law and state police never told him so.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Are Now Toni Kukoc's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- For Toni Kukoc, the days of being the  
much-chastised third option are over. 
</P>
<P>
	No more screaming from coach Phil Jackson, no more coming off  
the bench as the Chicago Bulls' sixth man, no more deferring to 
Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	On this remodeled team, Kukoc is the man, the go-to guy in what  
will surely be a season filled with losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc wears a look of relief these days, glad he was part of  
three championship teams but eager to move on in this new role. It 
means more leadership, more scoring and more shots for the 
Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need a reminder of the past, I can just look up here,''  
Kukoc says of the championship banners hanging on the walls at the 
Bulls' practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc scored 32 points in the Bulls' exhibition loss to Indiana  
earlier this week, a mixture of jump shots -- a part of his game 
that can be erratic -- and long-armed, left-handed drives to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc knows the Bulls' triangle offense as well as anyone and  
how to make it work, and is being counted on by rookie coach Tim 
Floyd to convey his knowledge to a host of new teammates who are 
still trying to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been interesting to watch,'' Floyd said Thursday. ``From  
a guy who was silent the first week who now seems more pronounced 
and vocal on the floor, not only with the older guys but with our 
newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc was known as ``The Waiter'' during his playing days in  
Europe for his ability to serve other players with clever, no-look 
passes. He still lists Magic Johnson, perhaps the greatest passer 
in NBA history, as the one player he'd like to face one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toni is one of the most skilled players in the league. And now  
he has to step up and be a leader,'' said new teammate Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been there and been through it, and he's going to be a  
source of strength for a young team learning and growing. He has to 
step into that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, voted the NBA's best sixth man in 1995-96 when the Bulls  
won an NBA-record 72 regular-season games, never fashioned himself 
as anything but a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	When he joined the Bulls, Jordan retired for the first time and  
Kukoc was crushed because it appeared his dream of playing with the 
world's best was over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan returned and the Bulls went on to three  
championships. Kukoc took his verbal beatings from Jordan and 
Jackson. With Floyd, the Bulls may not win as many games, but 
Kukoc's ears won't be ringing as much, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Jackson) wanted us to be better, but I can get it out of  
myself without being yelled at,'' Kukoc said during the Bulls' 
abbreviated training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had plenty of respect for Phil, but I didn't need the  
yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who averaged 13.3 points last season when he started 52  
games, is ready for the added burden, starting with Friday's opener 
in Utah, where the Bulls clinched the title last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be nights when the offense won't click and  
somebody will have to step up,'' he said. ``And most of all, the 
guys will be counting on me. ... I'm ready to take the 
responsibility. I didn't do it much the last five years.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominee Pays Civil Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving to clear an obstacle to his nomination  
as ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke has agreed 
to pay a $5,000 civil settlement of allegations he improperly 
contacted a former government colleague, a friend of Holbrooke's 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran 57-year-old diplomat would not be required to admit  
wrongdoing under the draft settlement -- worked out with the Justice 
Department -- of allegations that Holbrooke violated federal 
lobbying laws, according to the friend, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Justice Department officials are still reviewing the  
agreement, but no changes are anticipated, and it should be filed 
in court soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never asked any U.S. government official to do anything  
other than on behalf of the U.S. government,'' this friend said. 
``He's paying only to settle this and get it behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement should clear the way for President Clinton to  
finally send the nomination to the Senate. Eight months ago, 
Clinton announced that his choice for the high-profile U.N. post 
was Holbrooke, the chief architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord 
and last fall's ceasefire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	When the nature of the allegations against Holbrooke emerged  
last month, the White House reaffirmed that Clinton remains ``lock, 
stock and barrel'' behind the outspoken diplomat, whose ambition 
and forceful personality have won him detractors as well as fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged conflict of interest was uncovered during an FBI  
investigation begun after Clinton picked Holbrooke, Justice 
Department officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Lord, who served as assistant secretary of state for  
East Asia and Pacific affairs from 1993 to 1997, said in an 
interview last month, ``It would have been ridiculous if 
(Holbrooke) hadn't'' contacted U.S. Ambassador James Laney in South 
Korea while he was a government consultant meeting Korean officials 
to explain U.S. policy at Lord's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved Holbrooke's allegedly contacting Laney sooner  
than federal law allowed after he left government in February 1996 
to work for an investment banking firm, Credit Suisse First Boston, 
in New York, another Justice official and a friend of Holbrooke's 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal ethics laws limit the lobbying contacts that former  
officials can have for a period of time after leaving the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said he asked Holbrooke, then a State Department consultant  
and special government employee, to visit foreign officials and 
explain U.S. policy on any trips he made to Asia and to report back 
his impressions. Holbrooke made a trip to Korea in early 1996 to 
speak to an Asia Society meeting, Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of my predecessors as assistant secretary for East  
Asia, so he knew the region, and as former ambassador to Germany he 
could talk to the Koreans about their concerns about reunification 
of their country,'' Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been rude, inappropriate and would have undercut  
the ambassador,'' Lord said. ``I would have called him up and 
yelled at him if he hadn't contacted the ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has not wavered in his support of Holbrooke.  
</P>
<P>
	``The president has enormous respect for Ambassador Holbrooke's  
intellect and judgment and believes he will be a superb ambassador 
to the United Nations,'' White House national security spokesman 
David Leavy said. ``The events of the last couple months with Iraq 
and Kosovo prove that we need someone of Ambassador Holbrooke's 
caliber to advance U.S. interests at the United Nations.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Assailed Over Drugs, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
is scrambling to save its world conference on doping from becoming 
its worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	After the opening day turned into a long session of criticism of  
the IOC's leadership and blunt questioning on whether it still 
represents the Olympic spirit during the worst scandal in its 
history, the IOC faces the task of salvaging its maligned doping 
proposals before Thursday's conclusion of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled on all fronts, the IOC hit back at government  
officials and critics from sporting institutions. Speaker after 
speaker demanded a proposed international antidoping agency be 
totally independent from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout from the Olympic bribery scandals rubbed off  
directly on its credibility at the doping conference, leaving IOC 
drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode puzzled and angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this lack of confidence,'' he said. ``I  
find that a semi-insult,'' especially coming from government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask people in the streets if there is a great confidence in  
politicians. I have some doubts,'' said de Merode, a candidate to 
run the agency's day-to-day affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	British Sports Minister Tony Banks said faith in the Olympic  
movement was ``sour and sullied'' and said Britain expects the IOC 
to clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes that the doping conference would restore some status to  
the IOC were dashed almost as soon as the meeting opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``For complete credibility, it (the agency) must be headed by  
someone other than an IOC member. Credibility is so important,'' 
U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said the IOC must  
institute democratic reforms to have credibility in the antidoping 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't go over well with some IOC officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go on the moralizing tone, the lecturing tone, you must  
be sure that everything is OK in your own country,'' IOC executive 
board member Jacques Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In such an abrasive atmosphere, the conference on Tuesday went  
looking for common ground on the issue of drug sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	While some delegates pressed for fixed minimum two-year bans  
across all sports, de Merode and Rogge proposed more flexible 
penalties that would survive legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The world soccer federation, FIFA, had a strong intervention  
ready, saying it would never accept a two-year minimum ban, even if 
it would mean being kicked out of the Olympics, as was threatened 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimming and cycling federations have also cast doubt on the  
legal workability of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputes came on the same day that the IOC cleared  
Australian officials of any wrongdoing following allegations of 
vote-buying in Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, who oversees the Sydney Games, said he reviewed documents  
provided by Australian Olympics chief John Coates and said Coates 
broke no rules when he offered $70,000 in sports aid to two African 
IOC members the night before Sydney beat Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was legal, legitimate and according to the rules,'' Rogge  
said. ``There is absolutely no problem in the way it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney case emerged as part of a widening scandal that  
started with bribery allegations surrounding the selection of Salt 
Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Games. Nine IOC members have 
resigned or been expelled so far for receiving cash payments, 
scholarships and other favors from Salt Lake.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Decry Story on Chelsea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife said Wednesday  
they were ``profoundly saddened'' by a decision by People 
magazine's editors to feature a story about their daughter, 
Chelsea, on its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``For over six years, the media has understood and respected the  
unique situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spotlight 
focused on her parents,'' the Clintons said in a prepared 
statement. ``We have been very grateful for the media's restraint 
in allowing Chelsea the privacy that any young person needs and 
deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons said People chose to run the story ``despite  
personal appeals with respect to her privacy and her security from 
her parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People magazine spokeswoman Dianne Jones, reached at her home  
late Wednesday, could not immediately comment on the article or on 
the protest from the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said they didn't believe there were any  
startling revelations in the magazine's upcoming issue, but that 
the Clintons were chagrined to see their daughter, who will turn 19 
on Feb. 27, the subject of a cover story. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Clintons found fault  
with ``more the concept than the detail'' of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The media tended to take a hands-off approach towards Chelsea  
while she was a high school student, but her move to Stanford 
University in 1997 generated a spate of news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, administration officials said the upcoming issue  
of People crossed a line: ``There's never been a cover story on 
Chelsea,'' said Marsha Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said the Clinton's statement was not intended to dispute  
any particular facet of the article. ``It's just that it exists at 
all,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their statement, the Clintons said ``we deeply regret and are  
profoundly saddened by the decision of People.'' The also said they 
hoped that ``the media will continue its policy of restraint with 
respect to our daughter.''

<HEADLINE> Texaco Sends Out 750 Layoff Notices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Texaco Inc. has notified 750 U.S. and  
overseas employees involved in petroleum exploration and production 
that their jobs are among 1,000 being eliminated because of low 
crude oil and gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Affected workers were informed Tuesday, Texaco spokesman Pierre  
DeGruy said. The layoffs were among 1,000 positions Texaco said in 
November it would eliminate as part of a worldwide restructuring, 
DeGruy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions, which involved both layoffs and employees taking  
voluntary severance packages, affected Texaco offices in New 
Orleans, Denver, Midland-Odessa, Texas, and Bakersfield, Calif., as 
well as in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said it would save $200 million through the  
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardest hit was the company's Gulf of Mexico region, which lost  
287 workers, mostly in Louisiana. Of those, 161 worked in Texaco's 
administrative office in New Orleans, DeGruy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver lost 126, Bakersfield dropped 72, and Midland-Odessa lost  
115. Texaco is still analyzing its staffing levels in Houston, 
DeGruy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Great Britain, Texaco eliminated 150 workers.

<HEADLINE> Race Beating Case Judge Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge who sentenced a white youth to prison for  
an attack on a 13-year-old black boy has received an apparent death 
threat and now is under round-the-clock police protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Daniel Locallo says he won't be intimidated by the  
threat, which was apparently made last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue to do the job that I was elected to  
do,'' Locallo said Tuesday in a telephone interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He sentenced Frank Caruso, 19, to eight years in prison for the  
March 1997 beating that left Lenard Clark in a coma. The youngster, 
who was bicycling in a white neighborhood at the time of the 
beating, continues to suffer brain damage as a result of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say race was the sole motive. President Clinton  
condemned the beating in a national address. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso was found guilty of aggravated battery after a trial. Two  
others arrested for the attack were placed on probation under plea 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the death threat was reported Monday night by  
Channel 7 News in Chicago and in Tuesday's editions of the Chicago 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said in a statement that ``during January 1999  
information was received... which indicated that a possible threat 
had been made against the life of Cook County Circuit Court Judge 
Daniel Locallo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is continuing to investigate the alleged threat.

<HEADLINE> Astros Reliever Wagner To Earn $2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Billy Wagner is as focused on his role as the  
Houston Astros' closer as his blazing fastball is on the strike 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to close games. It's not to do anything else,''  
Wagner said Wednesday after signing a three-year, $10.3 million 
contract that averted salary arbitration with the NL club and gave 
Wagner one of the largest raises in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit there and make my role any more than it  
is: Go out there in the ninth inning and close the game,'' he said. 
``That's all I'm concerned about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said it was unprecedented  
for Houston to come up with such a deal for a player with only 
minimal major league experience. This season will be Wagner's third 
full year in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're dealing with a very unusual young man,'' Hunsicker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, with just 2 years, 139 days of major league service,  
made $280,000 last year and $185,000 in 1997 after signing for the 
minimum $109,000 in 1996. His new contract calls for salaries of 
$2.1 million this year, $3.2 million in 2000 and $5 million in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, 27, whose fastball routinely reaches 100 mph, was tops  
in the NL last year in strikeouts per nine innings, with 14.6 in 58 
appearances. For his career, the left-hander is averaging 13.6 
strikeouts per nine innings. His 62 saves with Houston puts him 
fourth on the club's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he converted 30 of 35 save opportunities, including a  
stretch of 19 straight. The 30 saves put him seventh in the NL and 
came despite missing nearly a month after he was struck in the head 
July 15 by a line drive off the bat of Kelly Stinnett in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure makes it a lot easier to go out there and take a line  
drive,'' Wagner said Wednesday. ``One minute you're looking at near 
death and the next minute you're looking a three-year deal. I don't 
know how to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about all the money. It's a blessing in  
disguise. I guess it gives me a little extra determination to do my 
job a little bit better so they wouldn't hit it at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner said he's been working during the offseason on perfecting  
a slider to go with his overpowering fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable with it,'' he said. ``I've spent hours,  
days working on it and trying to figure what I can do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to throw a higher number of sliders and changeups.  
But I'm not going to leave my bread and butter. I didn't make it to 
the big leagues on a changeup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said the multiyear agreement was not something the  
club had to do, but was something he's been exploring with 
arbitration-eligible players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult process for both sides,'' he said of  
arbitration. ``By definition, it's a situation where the club has 
to sit in a hearing and he has to listen to his employer accentuate 
the negative and vice versa. I think we all understand the process 
is really designed to prevent hearings, and in most cases, 
fortunately, it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, who asked for $3.3 million in arbitration and was  
offered $2 million, had 97 strikeouts in 60 innings last season 
while compiling a 4-3 record and a 2.70 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win championships without a reliable closer and so  
having someone with a special talent like Billy Wagner and knowing 
he's part of this franchise for the years to come is certainly 
comforting,'' Hunsicker said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Lakers May Be Courting Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers executive vice president  
Jerry West has talked briefly with Dennis Rodman's new agent, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question. We've discussed it, but  
everyone's putting the cart before the horse,'' West told the Los 
Angeles Times. ``We don't have any idea whether there's any 
interest on his (Rodman's) part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had a conversation Tuesday with Rodman's agent,  
Steve Chasman, who said he would discuss the situation with Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Rodman, who has won the last seven NBA  
rebounding titles and been on five of the last 10 NBA championship 
teams, has indicated his signing preferences with either the 
Orlando Magic or the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers could offer Rodman a veteran minimum starting salary  
of $1 million, the Times said. For the past two seasons, Rodman has 
made $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets also were said to be interested in Rodman,  
especially since an injury to reserve forward Antoine Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would definitely help us,'' one anonymous Rocket told the  
Houston Chronicle. ``With Dennis, Charles (Barkley) and Dream 
(Hakeem Olajuwon), we'd get two and three shots every trip down 
court. That's how many offensive boards we'd be getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Heat coach Pat Riley said last week his team would be  
interested in Rodman if the former Bulls would abide by team rules 
of conduct

<HEADLINE>  Mets Fire McCarver, Hire Seaver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eliminating an independent and sometimes  
critical voice from their broadcast booth, the New York Mets on 
Wednesday replaced Tim McCarver with Tom Seaver, who also is 
joining the team's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame pitcher, who has not been to Shea Stadium since  
1988, will be in his retired uniform No. 41 for 10-to-12 days 
during spring training and will broadcast 50 games per season on 
WPIX, the Mets' new station. He also will have a marketing role 
with the team and work with minor leaguers during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcaster for the New York Yankees from 1989-93, Seaver  
admitted he won't be as controversial as McCarver, who had been the 
team's color analyst for 16 seasons and is regarded as the best in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last several years, a lot of commentary has been (made)  
to be critical on page one,'' Seaver said. ``I don't know if I 
would agree with that. I would agree with it when it comes to 
effort and preparation and approach to your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver has 10 Emmy Award nominations but has never won,  
primarily because John Madden has. The move doesn't affect 
McCarver's job with Fox Sports, where he is the network's lead 
analyst for its national telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were fairly blunt, saying, `We're not picking up next  
year as far as your contract is concerned,' '' he said. ``The word 
tradition was mentioned. I think that is why Tom is the guy coming 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors that manager Bobby Valentine was upset with  
McCarver's criticism last June after Mel Rojas blew a game against 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never came up to me and told me he was upset with  
anything,'' McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice president of broadcasting  
and marketing, said he knew some on the team were unhappy with 
McCarver, but didn't have first-hand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I either read about in the papers or heard about it,'' Bingham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said his philosophy won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak what you perceive as the truth,'' he said. ``If that's  
outspokenness, that's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rosen, McCarver's agent, said it may be too close to spring  
training for McCarver to line up a local broadcasting job for this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suspicion is we will over the course of the season field  
about 18 different offers for the season following,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' over-the-air games, which had been broadcast on WWOR  
since the team's inception in 1962, move to WPIX this season, with 
the Yankees moving from WPIX to WNYW, Fox's New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said McCarver would not be a good fit for WNYW because  
many of its Yankees broadcasts are on the same days as Fox network 
telecasts. The Madison Square Garden Network, which televises the 
bulk of Yankees' games on cable, wouldn't comment on McCarver's 
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, 56, won National League Cy Young Awards for the Mets in  
1969, '73 and '75, finished 311-205 with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 
strikeouts and is the most beloved player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been out of baseball the last five seasons and moved to  
California three months ago, intending to plant two or three acres 
of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
	He probably will be partnered with Gary Thorne and sometimes  
Ralph Kiner. The real attraction, however, was his role with 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really want to come back and not be involved in one  
way or another with the pitching,'' Seaver said. ``I don't want to 
be the manager. I don't want to be the general manager. I don't 
want to be the pitching coach. But I would find it somewhat hollow 
if I were not allowed to use my expertise about pitching with the 
younger pitchers. I pretty much insisted that be a part of this 
deal.''

WPIX, the Mets' new station. He also will have a marketing role 
with the team and work with minor leaguers during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcaster for the New York Yankees from 1989-93, Seaver  
admitted he won't be as controversial as McCarver, who had been the 
team's color analyst for 16 seasons and is regarded as the best in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last several years, a lot of commentary has been (made)  
to be critical on page one,'' Seaver said. ``I don't know if I 
would agree with that. I would agree with it when it comes to 
effort and preparation and approach to your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver has 10 Emmy Award nominations but has never won,  
primarily because John Madden has. The move doesn't affect 
McCarver's job with Fox Sports, where he is the network's lead 
analyst for its national telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were fairly blunt, saying, `We're not picking up next  
year as far as your contract is concerned,' '' he said. ``The word 
tradition was mentioned. I think that is why Tom is the guy coming 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors that manager Bobby Valentine was upset with  
McCarver's criticism last June after Mel Rojas blew a game against 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never came up to me and told me he was upset with  
anything,'' McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice president of broadcasting  
and marketing, said he knew some on the team were unhappy with 
McCarver, but didn't have first-hand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I either read about in the papers or heard about it,'' Bingham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said his philosophy won't change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak what you perceive as the truth,'' he said. ``If that's  
outspokenness, that's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rosen, McCarver's agent, said it may be too close to spring  
training for McCarver to line up a local broadcasting job for this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suspicion is we will over the course of the season field  
about 18 different offers for the season following,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' over-the-air games, which had been broadcast on WWOR  
since the team's inception in 1962, move to WPIX this season, with 
the Yankees moving from WPIX to WNYW, Fox's New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said McCarver would not be a good fit for WNYW because  
many of its Yankees broadcasts are on the same days as Fox network 
telecasts. The Madison Square Garden Network, which televises the 
bulk of Yankees' games on cable, wouldn't comment on McCarver's 
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, 56, won National League Cy Young Awards for the Mets in  
1969, '73 and '75, finished 311-205 with a 2.86 ERA and 3,640 
strikeouts and is the most beloved player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been out of baseball the last five seasons and moved to  
California three months ago, intending to plant two or three acres 
of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
	He probably will be partnered with Gary Thorne and sometimes  
Ralph Kiner. The real attraction, however, was his role with 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really want to come back and not be involved in one  
way or another with the pitching,'' Seaver said. ``I don't want to 
be the manager. I don't want to be the general manager. I don't 
want to be the pitching coach. But I would find it somewhat hollow 
if I were not allowed to use my expertise about pitching with the 
younger pitchers. I pretty much insisted that be a part of this 
deal.''

<HEADLINE> Expert: No Immunity for Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is  
not entitled to immunity for crimes he may have ordered outside of 
Chile, an independent law expert told Britain's highest court 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A head of state's immunity extends only to acts committed within  
his own country's jurisdiction, said David Lloyd-Jones, invited by 
the House of Lords to help dissect legal complexities and present 
an independent opinion as to whether Pinochet's arrest for crimes 
against humanity should stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was taken into custody Oct. 16 at the request of a  
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to face charges of 
murder, torture and hostage-taking. The judge says Spaniards were 
among those slain after the general ousted Marxist President 
Salvador Allende in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant also cites allegations of attempts to murder  
Chileans in Spain and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-judge House of Lords tribunal already has heard 10  
days of legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers contend the 83-year-old general's arrest  
violates British and international law, which they say gives 
absolute immunity to former heads of state for all their official 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for Spain and human rights groups say the  
International Convention Against Torture -- signed by Spain, Chile 
and Britain -- supersedes any immunity and makes torture an act 
prosecutable in any court in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Chile concluded their arguments Tuesday, saying that  
only Chilean courts have the right to prosecute the general for any 
abuses committed during his 17-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Lord Chief Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson  
questioned Lloyd-Jones' statement that Pinochet would be liable for 
crimes ordered only outside Chile, citing the case of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it very hard to believe that what took place in the gas  
chambers of Germany was an official act, but what took place in the 
concentration camps of France was not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is expected to conclude Thursday at the latest, and  
the law lords then will have as long as they want to issue a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords already decided to let Pinochet's arrest  
stand once, but a different panel of judges threw out the 3-2 
decision after the discovery that a judge who voted against the 
general had close ties to Amnesty International. The human rights 
group has been heavily involved in the campaign to bring Pinochet 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet again loses, a long extradition battle will begin.  
But if the law lords uphold an Oct. 28 High Court ruling giving him 
immunity, he will be free to leave the rented mansion outside 
London where he remains under police guard. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he 
seized power.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Thurgood Marshall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saluting the man who turned the 14th Amendment  
into ``a living charter of freedom,'' President Clinton introduced 
an exhibit Wednesday night dedicated to Thurgood Marshall's 
struggle for equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the atrium of the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary  
Building, Clinton called the notion that all people are created 
equal ``the simplest, most powerful idea about human beings ever 
articulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president described the ceaseless work by the Marshall, the  
first black Supreme Court justice, to guarantee the protections of 
the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall traveled to towns in the segregated South, to places  
where he could not find food to eat or beds to sleep in, the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did all that to argue that we are all created equal,''  
Clinton said. ``The 14th Amendment, with its promise of equal 
protection under law, was Thurgood Marshall's sword and shield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that even in the darkest days of  
discrimination, the phrase ``Thurgood is coming'' brought hope to 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, at the dawn of the new century, it's up to us to ensure  
that Thurgood is still coming,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall died in 1993. His widow, Cecilia, cut the ribbon to  
unveil the exhibit of photographs, manuscripts, and other 
materials. The three-part display, called ``Marching Toward 
Justice,'' describes the role of abolitionists in the fight for 
equality, the struggle to convince the states to implement the 14th 
Amendment and the legal campaign to uphold the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the event were civil rights legend Rosa Parks and  
Marshall's son, Thurgood Marshall Jr., who is an assistant to the 
president for Cabinet affairs.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 71.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices pressed higher in the early  
afternoon, as investors became more confident that the Federal 
Reserve was unlikely to change interest rates. And the Fed did 
indeed decide to leave rates alone. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 71.58 at 9,345.70. The Dow opened lower, bounced back but then 
retreated a second time, all within the first 40 minutes of 
trading, then continued climbing into the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher amid continued strong  
performance of technology shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 6.24 at 1,268.23, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 
14.83 at 2,478.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues overtook decliners by 1,475 to 1,417 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 566.87 million, off 
slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed governors are set to release a statement at 2:15 this  
afternoon at the conclusion of their regular policy meeting. While 
stock investors do not expect the central bankers to lower or raise 
interest rates, they had little incentive this morning to take big 
positions until they are sure. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a chance that the Fed will respond to recently robust  
economic data by raising rates, which would be bad for stocks 
because it would raise corporate borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our view is that they really have nothing to worry  
about,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward 
Jones of St. Louis. ``This is one of the easiest decisions the Fed 
has had to make. Even if they change the bias toward tightening, we 
just remind people that that happened last year before they lowered 
interest rates twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Cisco Systems shares were down 1 1/16 at 111 1/4. The  
company reported earnings late Tuesday that were one penny above 
analysts' expectations, but Chief Executive John Chambers warned 
this morning that there is some concern about how the Year 2000 
computer issue will affect high-tech spending later in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component IBM was down 3 at 173 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of Dow component Goodyear Tire and Rubber were  
up 1 7/16 at 52 13/16, after the company announced an alliance with 
Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and fourth-quarter earnings 
that matched analysts' expectations. The company also separately 
announced a worldwide cost-cutting effort that will eliminate up to 
2,800 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Duncan Has High Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan is ready for an encore.  
</P>
<P>
	The overwhelming selection for NBA Rookie of the Year last  
season, Duncan is ready to take his game to a higher level in his 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different year. I've been through the league  
one time and gotten a lot more experience under my belt. I'm ready 
to go. I know what to expect,'' Duncan said after a San Antonio 
Spurs practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Duncan's opponents now know more about what to expect  
from him. Therein lies his new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the people will kind of go after me every night,''  
Duncan said in his usual quiet manner that belies his intensity on 
the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, who launches his second season night Friday when the  
Spurs face Sacramento in the Alamodome, started all 82 regular 
season games last year, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds and 
2.51 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	This year could prove more spectacular for Duncan, particularly  
when it comes to fine-tuning his partnership with fellow 7-footer 
David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten a lot more used to each other,'' Duncan said. ``I  
think we'll just keep getting better and better, being able to read 
each other, being able to play with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson welcomes the late-game scoring Duncan provides. And he  
admires all that young energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it'll be a lot better, just Tim's confidence level  
and his consistency level,'' Robinson said. ``The challenge will be 
a little greater this year. Obviously, nobody is going to be 
surprised by Tim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, 22, spends lots of time on the practice court and  
concentrated so heavily on improving his game during the offseason 
that the 33-year-old Robinson found himself feeling ``like the old 
guy'' trying to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyday he's out there. He's working, he's running, he's  
lifting, he's doing the things he needs to do to get better,'' 
Robinson said. ``Tim takes it seriously. He's deciding now that he 
wants to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Robinson and Duncan on the front line -- and at times  
bolstered by another 7-footer, Will Perdue, in the lineup -- the 
Spurs went 56-26 last season and advanced to the Western Conference 
semifinals before being eliminated by Utah in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Before training camp, the Spurs added Steve Kerr in a trade with  
Chicago and signed free agents Mario Elie of Houston and Jerome 
Kersey of Seattle. Antonio Daniels was dealt to San Antonio by 
Vancouver last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think management went out and got some great picks,'' Duncan  
said. ``All these guys came in here to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the Spurs roster are point guard Avery Johnson,  
shooting guard Jaren Jackson and forward Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich calls Elliott the ``X-factor'' for the  
Spurs. Elliott missed much of the last two seasons with injuries to 
both quadriceps but says his legs are now in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Popovich knows the team revolves around the Duncan-Robinson  
duo in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were great together in helping each other and learning  
about positions on the court, but this year I think they'll be able 
to find each other passing-wise even more than they did last 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan said he intends to keep learning from Robinson -- and  
striving for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good team,'' Duncan said. ``We have a chance to go  
and do something special.''

<HEADLINE> London Theater: Martin Guerre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEEDS, England (AP) -- The show the British theater had given up  
for dead has come back to life in northern England, with plans to 
travel to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical ``Martin Guerre'' was thought by many to be history  
when it closed in the West End in February 1998 after a 20-month 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it had won the Olivier Award -- London's equivalent of the  
Tony -- as the 1996-97 season's best musical, it lost nearly $8 
million and never sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Its financial failure, coupled with mixed reviews at best, made  
``Martin Guerre'' a long shot to travel the world-beating path of 
``Les Miserables'' and ``Miss Saigon,'' two earlier smash hits by 
the same composer-lyricist team of Claud-Michel Schonberg and Alain 
Boublil. 
</P>
<P>
	Its difficulties also seemed to confirm the apparent end of the  
British musical boom, a theatrical phenomenon of the 1980s that 
wasn't holding up into the '90s. Indeed, London hasn't had a 
commercially successful homegrown musical since ``Miss Saigon'' 
almost a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a scenario didn't reckon with the tenacity of producer  
Cameron Mackintosh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a firm believer in shows making their own life,'' said  
Mackintosh, who was prepared to resurrect ``Martin Guerre'' in much 
the same way as its title character -- a Frenchman who is presumed 
killed in the religious wars of the Reformation until he returns to 
his village of Artigat. 
</P>
<P>
	Film buffs may recognize the title from both 1982's ``The Return  
of Martin Guerre,'' an art-house blockbuster with Gerard Depardieu 
and Nathalie Baye, and the less admired American version, 1993's 
``Sommersby,'' with Richard Gere and Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a 16th-century saga, with a central issue of mistaken  
identity, as wife Bertrande at first takes the newly arrived Arnaud 
du Thil for her long-absent husband, Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackintosh thought it was ripe for the musical stage. ``If you  
believe in something as a worthwhile piece of writing, which I do 
about `Martin Guerre,' then you keep it going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Accordingly, and working with an entirely fresh creative team,  
Mackintosh opened a scaled-down version of the show in December at 
the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, 2 1/2 hours by train from 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Directed now by Irishman Conall Morrison, the new ``Martin  
Guerre'' was met mostly with raves. The show also has its first 
true leading lady in rising star Joanna Riding as the emotionally 
conflicted Bertrande. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical finishes in Leeds on Feb. 13 before a six-month  
British tour. 
</P>
<P>
	After that: an American premiere (with a separate cast) Sept. 28  
at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, followed by a North American 
tour (if all goes well) to Boston, Washington, Chicago and Toronto, 
before opening on Broadway in March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Its creators say they feel vindicated by the hard-won success of  
a show that has taken more than seven years to fire up the public. 
</P>
<P>
	And though there remains something fundamentally dour and even  
ponderous about its narrative, there's no denying the excellence of 
the production, which places the focus firmly on the anguished love 
triangle of Riding's Bertrande, her newly passionate lover Arnaud 
(played by Matthew Cammelle) and Arnaud's friend-turned-romantic 
rival, Martin (a firm-voiced Stephen Weller). 
</P>
<P>
	``They really have gone back to square one,'' said Riding, whose  
London credits include ``Guys and Dolls'' and her Olivier 
Award-winning performance as Julie Jordan in ``Carousel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I knew that they were doing everything possible to get it  
right, no matter how much reshaping that took, I was convinced it 
was a project for me to do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	This version puts Bertrande front and center, insofar as it is  
she who must decide whether to forsake her feelings for the fake 
``Martin'' -- Arnaud -- in favor of the child-husband whom she barely 
knew (and with whom she had no physical intimacy) before he went 
off to war. 
</P>
<P>
	The story unfolds against a backdrop of the religious hysteria  
of the age, as transmitted by a community whose excess zealotry 
recalls the witch hunt that propels Arthur Miller's classic play, 
``The Crucible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole of it now is so earthy,'' Riding said, ``so gritty.  
There's nothing pretty or fluffy about it; it's just grit -- all the 
blood and the spit and the gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Morrison, 32, said he wanted to heighten the show's  
``rough, peasant angle.'' Assisting him in that goal was 
choreographer David Bolger, who staged the Bacchanalian dances in 
the film version of ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' with Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain respects, the fundamental mistake was to conceive  
`Martin Guerre' on the same lines as `Les Mis' and `Miss Saigon,''' 
Morrison said. ``This is a smaller, more intimate, darker story, so 
we needed to get back to the dark, beating heart of the piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Co-librettist and co-lyricist (with Stephen Clark), Boublil said  
he and Schonberg were simply unable to think ahead until they had 
gotten ``Martin Guerre'' out of their system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to think about our next show, and every time we  
had a new idea, we came back to `Martin Guerre,''' said Boublil, a 
Tunisia-born Frenchman who lives in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to contribute something fresh for a gala tribute last  
summer to honor Mackintosh's prolific career, Boublil said, ``We 
were going to write a song for the event, and before we knew it, 
we'd written something for `Martin Guerre.' Our heads were 
completely into `Martin Guerre.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the show's ever-widening exposure all but guaranteed,  
Boublil said he preferred to quote Mackintosh on this particular 
musical's hoped-for legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in it being a success,'' he said. ``We  
want it to be a classic.''

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Charlie Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At first glance, he doesn't look like the little  
baldheaded kid in the funny papers, but there's a bit of Charlie 
Brown in Anthony Rapp, late of ``Rent'' and now star of the new 
Broadway version of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk to Rapp for a while and the similarities become more  
apparent, despite the mop of blond hair that covers his head. 
Sitting in an empty rehearsal hall, the 27-year-old actor is 
thoughtful -- but not somber -- talkative and polite. His colleagues 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthony really is an open book -- a sweet, kind and decent  
person whose humanity is very close to the surface,'' says director 
Michael Mayer, who chose Rapp to play the lead in this musical 
adaptation of ``Peanuts,'' the Charles M. Schulz comic strip. ``He 
comes to every relationship with a `positivity' that is very much 
like Charlie Brown's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Rapp's last three years have been filled with a series of  
ups and downs that would have shaken the strongest of souls. In 
1996, Rapp played Mark, the world-weary video artist in the 
original off-Broadway production of ``Rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its young creator, Jonathan Larson, died unexpectedly just  
before performances began. Yet the musical lived on, moving to 
Broadway to become one of the biggest hits of the 1990s. The 
following year, while Rapp was still appearing in ``Rent,'' his 
mother died after a three-year battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	```Rent' became like a lifeline through all that,'' he says now.  
``I never got bored, but the show was exhausting. Anything else 
after that will be a piece of cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp stayed with ``Rent'' until January 1998. Of the original  
principal actors, he was the only one left in the cast. ``What we 
had was so precious, so rare. We had gone through it together,'' he 
recalls. ``Although I loved working with new members of the cast, 
sometimes it got a little lonely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp gave ``Rent'' one more go, appearing in the London  
production for several months before leaving the show for good. He 
started rehearsals for ``Charlie Brown'' last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing the star of ``Rent'' to appear in ``Charlie Brown,''  
was, according to Mayer, an excellent opportunity to demonstrate a 
fresh, contemporary take on ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' 
which was first done off-Broadway more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Brown'' is a homecoming of sorts for Rapp, who grew up  
in Joliet, Ill. He played Snoopy in a summer camp production of the 
show in Pennsylvania when he was 7. ``My mom was a nurse at the 
camp and the three of us kids -- my brother, my sister and I -- were 
there, too,'' he says. ``It was strange, but when we started 
rehearsals for this production, I found that I remembered most of 
the lyrics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the age of 9, Rapp was ready for Broadway, cast in a musical  
version of ``The Little Prince,'' which never opened. Shuttling 
back and forth between Joliet and New York, Rapp eventually got 
cast in one of Yul Brynner's tours of ``The King and I'' and on 
Broadway in ``Precious Sons,'' a family drama that starred Ed 
Harris and Judith Ivey. It didn't run long, but Rapp, at age 14, 
got noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs in the stage and screen versions of ``Six Degrees of  
Separation'' followed as well as roles in such films as 
``Adventures in Babysitting,'' ``School Ties'' and ``Dazed and 
Confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Charlie Brown, Rapp is dealing with a cultural icon  
imbedded in the consciousness of just about everyone. The musical, 
written by Clark Gesner, originally opened in 1967 off-Broadway 
where it ran for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest version incorporates material from the last 30 years  
of comic strips as well as several new songs. Yet the overall tone 
of the piece remains the same, with Charlie Brown still enduring 
the humiliations of that professional dyspeptic, Lucy Van Pelt; a 
recalcitrant kite; a winless baseball team, and the elusive little 
red-haired girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer has opted for a multiracial cast to give the show a more  
contemporary feel. There's an Asian Linus, Lucy's blanket-clutching 
brother, played by B.D. Wong. And a black Schroeder, portrayed by 
Stanley Wayne Mathis, who delivers a new song, ``Beethoven Day,'' 
celebrating his favorite composer. 
</P>
<P>
	The director hired Ilana Levine of ``The Last Night of  
Ballyhoo'' for the pivotal role of Lucy, while song-and-dance man 
Roger Bart gives Snoopy a jazzier beat than in the original. 
Another new addition is the character of Sally, Charlie Brown's 
sister, portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth, who gleefully torments her 
older sibling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp finds the pervasiveness of Charlie Brown's persona a  
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I work, I try to absorb it rather than put my  
thoughts onto it,'' he says. ``I try to let it tell me what it is. 
And in this case, I had such a great chance to observe and read and 
absorb 50 years worth of material. Charlie Brown has changed a lot 
in that time, too. There are a lot of different colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, `Peanuts' was a lot darker. In the earlier  
strips, Charlie Brown called himself `stupid' all the time and was 
really, really tough on himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the actor insists part of Charlie Brown's strength is his  
persistence, his optimism -- his putting faith in someone or 
something even though, as Rapp puts it, ``the only historical 
evidence is failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mayer, the hardest part in portraying these little  
people is to retain their childlike qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much that they are cartoons that make them  
difficult to play,'' the director says. ``I think the difficulty is 
to keep an adult sensibility with a childlike quality. And Anthony 
does that beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in ``Charlie Brown,'' Rapp is working on other things,  
writing a book about his mother's illness and his relationship with 
her as well as the whole ``Rent'' experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was my center,'' he says simply, talking of a  
childhood in which his parents divorced when he was 2. ``She had a 
quiet strength and a deep love for her children. She was the oldest 
of 13 kids in a very hectic family. She always told me that I 
taught her. I always was strong-willed and clear-headed about what 
I wanted -- and she was really supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp's mother was supportive, too, after he openly declared his  
homosexuality in his theater bio for ``The Destiny of Me,'' a Larry 
Kramer play he did off-Broadway in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has become an unofficial spokesman, speaking at high  
schools and colleges about gay issues and the questions of coming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, everyone's private life is their own business. I  
don't think anybody should be forced to do anything, but I also, to 
some degree, think that to the extent when you are not helping, you 
are part of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether his openness has hurt his own career, Rapp isn't sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``People who are smart know it doesn't matter, and I wish there  
were more people out. Maybe it has interfered with some Hollywood 
roles,'' he says, but adds with typical Charlie Brown optimism, 
``There are worse things to happen.''

<HEADLINE> SBC, Ameritech Dodge Critics' Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Deliberations over the proposed merger of  
SBC Communications and Ameritech bounced back to state regulators 
Wednesday after the two phone companies broke off private meetings 
with critics of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for SBC and Ameritech -- two Baby Bells created out of  
the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984 -- have been meeting since late January 
with regulators, competitors and other groups trying to block the 
planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reasonable likelihood that we will be able to  
resolve the remaining questions through the negotiating process,'' 
Kevin Sullivan, a lawyer for San Antonio-based SBC, told a hearing 
examiner for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan asked for a resumption of the public hearings  
regulators said they wanted before ruling on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Norris, an Ameritech spokeswoman, declined to discuss  
specific disagreements. ``Right now, we think the best way to 
proceed is through the hearings,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech maintain that their merger would bring  
competition to the industry, leading to lower prices and better 
service. The merger would force other companies to accelerate plans 
to enter the local phone service market, increasing choice for 
consumers, they argue. The companies also say they need to merge to 
compete in growth areas such as Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Consumers Counsel Robert Tongren and other critics worry  
that the marriage of SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech will squelch 
competition in the local telephone business and erode customer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must be approved by the Federal Communications  
Commission, the Justice Department and regulators in Ohio and 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for SBC and Ameritech have been meeting since late  
January with Tongren, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, and 
representatives from AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Communications, the American 
Association of Retired Persons and nearly 20 other competitors and 
groups opposed to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Tongren, who represents residential customers, blamed the  
breakdown in talks on the negotiators' diverse interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost takes a magician ... to bring them together,'' he  
said. ``It just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would make Ameritech a subsidiary of SBC, in a proposed  
stock swap that would create a 13-state system with 57 million 
phone lines, or about one-third of the nation's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech operates in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and  
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC operates Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell, Southern New  
England Telephone Co. and Nevada Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The public hearings will resume on Feb. 17.

<HEADLINE>  Skier Fleischer Building Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Chad Fleischer's snow-leopard haircut  
looks like something straight out of the Dennis Rodman styling 
salon. Fittingly, he also is starting to blend in with the world's 
fastest skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing sixth in the men's super-G at the World Alpine Ski  
Championships, Fleischer made more than just a fashion statement in 
his hometown. He made a mental breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what it's all about now,'' Fleischer said  
Wednesday after his training run for Saturday's downhill, ``and I'm 
just going to concentrate on kicking everyone's (butt). That's an 
awesome feeling to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's super-G, Fleischer's best finish in a World Cup  
event this season was 11th in the downhill at Val d'Isere, France. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing 28-hundredths of a second behind co-champions Lasse  
Kjus of Norway and Hermann Maier of Austria, Fleischer became 
America's latest golden boy without the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to do now is just be solid and aggressive  
instead of absolute balls to the wall when I'm in the starting 
gate,'' Fleischer said. ``It was reckless abandon before, out of 
control almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 27, credits rigorous dry-land training and the snow  
leopard for his progress. After reading several books about the 
elusive cat, he bleached his hair and then painted the dark spots 
onto his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not seen a whole lot in the wild, but when they decide  
to go after their prey, it's quick and furious,'' Fleischer said. 
``That's one thing I say when I'm in the starting gate. I say that 
the snow leopard attacks. He always attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little saying is like a cadence for me. It just puts me  
in the zone, like slow-motion. You're going 80 mph, and it's just 
like you're walking a kid in a stroller through the park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, who moved from Nebraska to Vail when he was 12, will  
take his next stroll Saturday in the men's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the fourth-fastest training time Wednesday, completing  
the daunting Birds of Prey course in 1 minute, 42.73 seconds. The 
training run was delayed about 3 1/2 hours because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Peter Rzehak -- who placed second in the second downhill  
run at Kitzbuhel, Austria, last month -- finished the 1.6-mile 
course in 1:42.22 for the fastest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who ranks second in the overall World Cup  
standings, was second in 1:42.43 and Austria's Stefan Eberharter -- 
fourth in World Cup points -- finished third in 1:42.67. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup downhill leader Kjus was seventh as he fought  
recurring respiratory and sinus problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling OK,'' Kjus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer is in his own kind of comfort zone, saying he is  
seeing every snowflake like Michael Jordan sees the basketball rim. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helps that he's sleeping in his own bed, driving his own  
car, and getting slapped on the back by familiar faces everywhere 
he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of an inner celebration right now for me,''  
Fleischer said. ``I still have a lot of work to do. My goal is to 
be on the podium here and to be the best skier in the world, not 
just perform here in front of the home crowd.''

<HEADLINE> Law Not Lowering Cable, Phone Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lower cable and telephone prices promised  
by a 1996 law haven't materialized for many customers, consumer 
groups reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread competition the telecommunications law was supposed  
to have unleashed hasn't happened, and as a result prices have not 
gone down as Congress and the administration envisioned, the report 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, both  
of which lobbied against the law, said cable television prices have 
jumped 21 percent and prices for instate long-distance calls 10 
percent since the law's enactment Feb. 8, 1996. Local and 
long-distance rates have remained about steady, the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law has been an abysmal failure to date,'' said Gene  
Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker Anstrom, president of the National Cable Television  
Association, disagreed with the report's findings. ``Consumers have 
more choices every day. The last thing we need is a return to 
massive, sweeping federal regulation that would stifle investment 
and innovation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard believes  
that ``generally, for consumers, we're on the right track,'' said 
FCC spokeswoman Liz Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable and telephone companies, the report found, tend to have  
pricing strategies that give price breaks to ``high-volume'' 
customers -- people who buy lots of cable channels, make many phone 
calls, have two phone lines and buy Internet and cellular services. 
</P>
<P>
	These heavy users spend an estimated $200 a month on cable,  
phone and other communications services, have a median annual 
income of about $54,000 and account for 24 percent of U.S. 
households, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, low-volume or, as the report calls them,  
``modest'' users of cable and telephone service aren't offered the 
same price breaks, which have the potential to offset increasing 
prices, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	These modest users spend an estimated $60 a month on cable and  
phone services. They don't have second phone lines and don't buy 
Internet and cellular services. They have a median annual income of 
about $23,000 and account for 45 percent of U.S. households, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups want federal regulators and Congress to take  
steps to spur more competition among phone companies and cable 
systems. They also renewed recommendations that Congress keep cable 
TV rates regulated. Price controls are to be lifted March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups also want federal policy-makers to adopt pricing  
protections for consumers who make few long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said one of the unintended consequences of the 1996  
telecommunications law is the growth of ``a costly division'' 
between heavy-volume and low-volume customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., a primary architect of the law,  
believes it is working, competition is developing and that 
consumers are benefiting, said spokesman Eric Wohlschlegel. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth spokesman Bill McCloskey said the competitive  
situation will improve once the regional Bell telephone companies 
win federal permission to provide long-distance service to local 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a small group of premier, intensive telecom users enjoy  
price breaks and competitive options,'' the report added. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on information from sources including the  
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, FCC reports and a 1998 
survey of 1,600 Florida consumers commissioned by that state's 
telecommunications regulators.

<HEADLINE> Self-Help Legal Software Faces Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A software company plans to send its attorney into  
court to fight a federal judge's move to ban ``do-it-yourself'' 
lawyering in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court fight that has national implications for the practice  
of law and software authorship, U.S. District Judge Barefoot 
Sanders has said he plans to bar Parsons Technology Inc. from 
distributing future copies of Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken 
Family Lawyer '99 in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said the software programs -- which sell for under $30 --  
amount to ``the unauthorized practice of law.'' He rejected the 
Iowa company's arguments of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texas is the only state that has taken a position that a book  
or a software program can constitute the practice of law,'' Parsons 
lawyer Darrell Jordan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said the Iowa-based company will seek a rehearing once  
Sanders' opinion is final and will, if necessary, appeal his 
judgment to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have considered action against publishers of  
self-help legal manuals that provide assistance with wills, 
prenuptial agreements and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texas apparently is the first state to aggressively pursue  
action against do-it-yourself law materials, said Bruce Dorner, a 
Londonderry, N.H., lawyer who is a member of the American Bar 
Association Governing Council of the Law Practice Management 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Warner, publisher of Berkeley, Calif.-based Nolo Press,  
said he would consider a ban on his company's manuals ``taking a 
step back 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the people in Texas can't afford all the legal help they  
need and one-quarter can't afford it at all,'' said Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolo lawyer Peter Kennedy in Austin said it hasn't been shown  
that anyone has been harmed by using legal software. ``Long before 
Texas was a republic, settlers came to this state carrying their 
lawbooks with them -- not lawyers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Test GOP Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative leaders privately auditioned GOP  
presidential hopefuls Wednesday and asked them to complete a 
10-page questionnaire on issues ranging from abortion to religious 
displays on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition of 20-25 conservatives, calling itself the  
Committee to Restore American Values, interviewed six potential 
candidates and asked them to answer the questions by the end of the 
week. Among those interviewed were publisher Steve Forbes, former 
Vice President Dan Quayle and activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential candidates George Bush, Lamar Alexander, John McCain  
and Elizabeth Dole declined to take part in the interviews. An 
organizer said the group plans to reissue invitations to those four 
as well as to broadcaster Pat Buchanan should he decide to run. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaire, a copy of which was obtained by The  
Associated Press, asked candidates detailed questions about 
abortion and education policy, as well as whether they would put a 
Nativity scene on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked a lot of questions on there, and if (a candidate has)  
a consistent pattern of being against the things we're for, I'll 
guarantee you they won't be endorsed,'' said Tim Teepell, the 
committee's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a litmus test in the sense that we want to see where  
their heart is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teepell said his group probably will take some time to evaluate  
the candidates and their responses before deciding on an 
endorsement for the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miller, a spokesman for the Republican Leadership Council,  
a centrist fund-raising group, criticized the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they seem to be trying to do is paint our candidates --  
all Republican candidates -- into a corner,'' he said. ``A winning 
presidential campaign platform is not one where you have all these 
litmus tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teepell's group, which includes conservative activists Paul  
Weyrich, Phyllis Schlafly and Randy Tate, asked potential 
candidates whether the words ``In God We Trust'' should remain on 
U.S. currency and whether states should be allowed to set their own 
policies on prayer and Bibles in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Following up the question about a Nativity scene, or creche, the  
survey asked: ``Would you place a creche on the White House lawn if 
ordered to refrain from doing so by the Supreme Court?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the questionnaire, potential candidates were asked  
to sign a pledge that their ``voting patterns'' would reflect the 
same views expressed in the survey answers. Presidents do not vote, 
but they can veto legislation passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Farris, who moderated Wednesday's question-and-answer  
sessions, said candidates run no risk of being marginalized if they 
answer social conservatives' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not asking questions that they will not be asked 10,000  
times by a reporter,'' said Farris, head of of the Home School 
Defense Association. ``They're all grown-ups and they better get 
used to answering these questions because we are not the only ones 
who will be asking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee to Restore American Values is a branch of a  
Virginia-based conservative fund-raising group called the Madison 
Project. It includes many who formed a loose network to help 
promote Sen. John Ashcroft as a presidential candidate. The 
Missouri Republican recently decided not to run, leaving an opening 
for a social conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good event. We covered a wide range of issues,''  
Forbes said as he left his interview. ``I thought it was very 
worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was up first, followed by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,  
broadcaster Alan Keyes, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Quayle and 
Bauer. Quayle was interviewed by telephone; the others appeared in 
person.	   The closed-door auditions were simple -- one candidate and about 
20 conservative activists seated around a conference table at a 
Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, said afterwards  
that Forbes came across as humble and candid and ``helped himself 
to some extent.'' But he said Kasich appeared to some as ``somewhat 
arrogant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad these leaders have decided to do this,'' Keyes  
said as he left. ``I think it's terribly important to forge some 
unity within the moral conservative movement.... The issues they 
are talking about are the most important ones facing America.''

	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- The locals call them PIBs: People in  
Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year they arrive, clad in black and armed with cell  
phones, pagers and attitude, ready to do battle, Hollywood style, 
in this mountain ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sundance Film Festival ended last weekend, and PIBs went  
home, some with movie deals, some without. Some moments in the 
snow:

	 *THE OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AWARD   	
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't among the honors handed out last Saturday night, but  
one just couldn't ignore what the makers of ``American Movie'' had 
to go through to get their documentary sold. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Jan. 26 screening, pieces of the movie theater's  
ventilation system broke loose and fell onto the audience, which 
included many studio executives looking to possibly buy the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were hurt, none seriously.  
</P>
<P>
	True to the show business ethic, the screening went on. In the  
end, Sony Pictures Classics paid $800,000 for the movie, the 
true-life comedic story of a man obsessed with making independent 
films. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIGGEST DEAL THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THAT BIG   	
</P>
<P>
	Depending on whom you talk to, Miramax either did or didn't  
spend $2.5 million for ``Happy, Texas,'' a hilarious tale of two 
escaped convicts who wander into a small Texas town, only to be 
confused with being a gay couple hired to help train the town's 
little girls for a beauty pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the acquisition deal insisted that Miramax  
spent only $2.5 million in cash, plus agreed to a generous cut of 
the box office if the movie does well. Some of Miramax's rivals 
said the studio couldn't have gotten off that cheaply and suggested 
Miramax -- burned before with big Sundance acquisitions that didn't 
meet expectations -- was playing loose with the facts to save face. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax denied that. And all the filmmakers would say was that  
Miramax didn't have the top cash offer, but they were impressed 
with the studio's commitment to market and distribute the movie. 
It's expected to arrive at theaters later this year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	 *COMING TO THEATERS ...   	
</P>
<P>
	Other deals struck in the snowy ski resort above Salt Lake City  
didn't generate any controversy -- nor that much money. All were in 
the $1 million range or below, peanuts compared with the $6 million 
to $10 million transactions the festival has seen in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deals: Artisan Entertainment picked up the creepy  
horror film ``The Blair Witch Project'' for a little over $1 
million. Fine Line Features paid $1 million for one of the best 
movies at the festival, the mother-daughter road picture 
``Tumbleweeds,'' and $400,000 for one of the funniest, the 
boy-meets-boy gay sex comedy ``Trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting ``American Movie,'' Sony Pictures  
Classics paid what sources said was the ``low six figures'' for 
``Twin Falls, Idaho'' about Siamese twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogue Pictures, a division of October Films, picked up ``Kill  
the Man'' with Luke Wilson (price unknown), while October got the 
festival's Centerpiece Premiere movie, ``Sugar Town'' with Rosanna 
Arquette and Ally Sheedy, for $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FACES TO WATCH   	
</P>
<P>
	The best performances at Sundance came from a young Canadian  
actress, Sarah Polley, in two films. She played the awkward young 
woman living with a much older photographer in ``Guinevere'' and 
the teen-ager having a truly bad night in the Gen-X actioner 
``Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another standout, though in much different fare, was Steve Zahn  
as the none-too-bright escaped convict who finds himself teaching a 
bunch of 5-year-old girls how to prepare for a beauty pageant in 
``Happy, Texas.'' Zahn won a special prize at Sundance for his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Other performances offered new looks at familiar TV faces  
including: Jean Smart of ``Designing Women'' as the steely mother 
in ``Guinevere,'' Tori Spelling of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' as the 
high-strung actress in ``Trick,'' and Barbara Barrie of ``Suddenly 
Susan'' as the brittle middle-aged teacher in ``Judy Berlin.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOW 'BOUT THAT STEVEN SPIELBERG, INDIE GUY   	
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the independent film scene is associated with your  
outlaw directors with fashionably hip goatees, overextended credit 
cards and lots of that independent vision thing. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't normally think Steven Spielberg.  
</P>
<P>
	But actress Laura Dern, who was honored at the festival, singled  
out the box-office king as being as indie-minded as the next PIB on 
the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? It's simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steven Spielberg makes what he wants to make,'' said Dern, who  
appeared in Spielberg's blockbuster ``Jurassic Park'' between indie 
jobs. ``I think that is absolutely what we all want to support.''

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers decided to leave  
short-term interest rates unchanged today. They are confronting 
possibly inflationary economic growth in the United States but 
continued risk of spillover from fragile financial conditions 
overseas. The central bank's monetary policy panel -- the Federal 
Open Market Committee -- ended a two-day, closed-door meeting by 
signaling it had left the benchmark rate on overnight loans between 
banks at 4.75 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors Question Blumenthal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors today wrapped up private  
questioning of witnesses with a short deposition of White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal. Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats 
battled over a proposal to formally accuse President Clinton of 
wrongdoing before ending the trial. Blumenthal's deposition, which 
lasted less than four hours with breaks, marked the last of three 
videotaped sessions conducted by Republican prosecutors hoping to 
bolster their case that witnesses should be called to the Senate 
floor. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Trial Boosting Fund-Raising  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public reaction to the Congress' handling of  
President Clinton's impeachment has the cash register ringing at 
the Democratic National Committee, party officials say. Steve 
Grossman, serving as the party's co-chairman for the last time at a 
$1 million fund-raiser last night in New York City, said the DNC 
had hoped to raise $1 million from small donors. ``There are 
hundreds of thousands of citizens all over the country who are 
angry, who are outraged,'' Grossman said. ``They are voting with 
their wallets.''

	Bias Crimes Bill Nixed in Wyoming  
</P>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Two bills that would have increased  
penalties for crimes if they were motivated by bias were killed 
today by a Wyoming legislative committee. Wyoming is one of the few 
states without bias crimes legislation. Calls for passage of bias 
crimes bills increased after the beating death of University of 
Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in October; police said his death 
was motivated in part because he was gay.

	Law Not Lowering Cable, Phone Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many consumers aren't seeing the lower cable  
and telephone prices promised by a 1996 law that overhauled the 
nation's telecommunications policies, a report concluded today. The 
Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America -- which had 
lobbied against the law, said that since its enactment Feb. 8, 
1996, cable TV prices have jumped 21 percent and prices for instate 
long-distance calls increased 10 percent.

	UN Workers Ordered Out of Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. security chief ordered the last  
remaining American and British nationals working for the United 
Nations to leave Iraq because the Iraqi government says it cannot 
guarantee their safety, officials said today. U.N. spokesman Fred 
Eckhard said the order only involves two Americans because all 
other Americans and all Britons working for the United Nations have 
already left Iraq.

	US Troops Might Be Sent to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress  
today that the administration might end up committing a 
``relatively small'' U.S. ground force to Kosovo. Cohen said that 
would happen only if a firm peace agreement is reached between 
warring factions. Other NATO members should make up the majority of 
such a force, he said.

	Mets Fire Broadcaster Tim McCarver  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim McCarver, a New York Mets broadcaster for  
the past 16 seasons, was fired today by the team and replaced by 
Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver. McCarver said he was notified by 
the Mets this morning that his contract was not being renewed. The 
move doesn't affect his job with Fox Sports, where he is the 
network's lead analyst for its national broadcasts.

<HEADLINE> DuPont, Teijin Plan Polyester Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Teijin Ltd. and U.S. chemicals giant DuPont  
&AMP; Co. announced Wednesday they will set up a joint venture to make 
polyester film, a material used to produce audiovisual magnetic 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Teijin, a major textiles maker, and DuPont said their combined  
operations will form the world's largest polyester film 
manufacturer, with around $1.4 billion in expected annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said negotiations were continuing on some  
details of the deal, but that they plan to apply for approval from 
their respective governments to proceed with the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Teijin and Du Pont will each contribute about 50 percent to the  
joint venture, Teijin's president, Shosaku Yasui, told a news 
conference in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasui would not disclose the amount invested by each company in  
the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture will combine the polyester film development,  
production, sales and technology operations for Teijin and Du Pont 
in key areas around the world, Teijin and Du Pont said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main production areas for the new company will be Teijin's  
wholly owned subsidiary in Indonesia and Du Pont's factories in the 
United States, Britain, Luxembourg, Japan, and China, the companies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teijin Du Pont Films factories in the United States and  
Luxembourg, set up by the companies under a prior joint venture 
agreement, will also be main production sites for the new venture.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Girls Sports Escorts Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- On college football signing day, Audra Towson  
scans the list of Georgia Bulldogs signees looking for familiar 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few years, she'll watch with pride the progress of  
the players Georgia signed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Towson has never scored a touchdown or made a tackle, but what  
she does on Friday nights in January has a lot to do with how the 
Bulldogs fare on Saturday afternoons each fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Towson, 22, is president of the Georgia Girls, a group of about  
70 female students who spend their winter weekends going to dinner 
with high school football stars and showing them around town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like hostesses,'' said Dominique Holloman, a sophomore.  
``You could think of it as a tour guide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools, mostly in the South, have similar organizations --  
the Bama Belles (Alabama), Vol Hostesses (Tennessee), Gator Guides 
(Florida) and Tiger PAWS (Clemson). 
</P>
<P>
	Some people say such groups amount to a university-sponsored  
escort service. Tennessee fans taunted Georgia Girls at a game last 
season, insinuating that they used sex to sign players. And some 
Georgia professors also have been critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that these hospitality teams are all female and  
the football players are all male sets up the expectation that what 
is being given out is sex appeal,'' said Victoria Davion, who 
teaches a feminist philosophy class. ``They're selling sex appeal 
as an enticement to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recruits sometimes compare which school has the prettiest  
hostesses, Bulldogs linebacker Adrian Hollingshed says, but the 
players don't expect relationships with the women. And the Georgia 
Girls know a pretty smile isn't going to persuade a player to 
commit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the people that we recruit are intelligent. They're  
coming for the coaches, the facilities and the football team,'' 
sophomore Sanshia Patrick said. ``We're just there to make sure 
they don't have a terrible visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls say while some mild flirting may go on, it  
never goes beyond that. Many of them are in their 20s and wouldn't 
consider dating teen-agers, no matter how good they are at 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls know there's a fine line that they cannot cross,''  
Towson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools stay away from escort groups altogether, or make  
them coed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that, and we won't,'' said Bob Chamiel,  
coordinator of football operations at Notre Dame. ``I think 
everybody has their own way of recruiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Michigan, a group of male and female volunteers do office  
work for the program and pass out name tags to recruits on game 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls stay busy in January, when recruits make  
official campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fridays, they dress up for dinner with the players. Each  
woman takes basic football lessons and studies up on her recruit -- 
where he's from, his parents' names and his position -- to keep the 
conversation flowing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Girls accompany the recruits, players and coaches to  
dinner again on Saturday nights, sometimes followed by a tour of 
Athens' nightlife. Because the players are underage, bars are 
rarely on the itinerary, with the usual destinations being 
basketball games or bowling alleys. 
</P>
<P>
	During the unofficial visits in the fall, the women sit with the  
recruits at games, show them around campus and answer questions 
about student life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play a part in making them feel more comfortable at the  
school,'' says Haley Cagle, a vice president. ``Sometimes they'll 
confide stuff in us that they don't tell the coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some current players say the Georgia Girls made their tense  
recruiting visits easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls we got here are real informative,'' freshman  
linebacker William Witherspoon said. ``They come up to you and ask 
if you have any questions so you don't just sit there wondering 
when you should ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The application process to become a Georgia Girl is competitive.  
Last year, more than 200 girls applied for about 80 spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look for girls that are vivacious, outgoing and  
informative,'' Towson said.	   There aren't a lot of rules regarding behavior, with the Georgia 
Girls being trusted to use their best judgment. One thing that is 
strictly forbidden is wearing anything other than the school colors 
on game days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even get picky if it is not the color red we want,'' Towson  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Georgia Girls say they joined the group to become  
part of the football program -- perhaps the most dominant aspect of 
campus life in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like more than just a person in the stands,'' Holloman  
said. ``I'm actually part of something, not just an onlooker. It's 
kind of like being the ultimate fan.''

<HEADLINE> Seattle Times Switching to Mornings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Times, long a flourishing afternoon  
newspaper, will become a morning paper and compete head-to-head 
against rival Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, announced Tuesday, will occur within two years as  
part of a restructured joint operating agreement between the 
Seattle Times Co. and the Hearst Corp., which owns the 
Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see some of the fiercest newspaper  
competition that you'll see in any city anywhere,'' said Mason 
Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The P-I's editor and publisher, J.D. Alexander, said he believes  
the Seattle market can support two morning newspapers. ``There's no 
reason that we can't do it successfully,'' he said. ``Good 
journalism draws readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring gives the Post-Intelligencer a larger share of  
profits and allows for expansion of its Web site, which the P-I 
updated with the day's top news stories Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both papers have had trouble making significant  
circulation gains in recent years, the Times has been a rare bird 
in an era of increasingly popular morning papers, dominating with a 
daily circulation of about 230,000 and a Sunday circulation of 
about 504,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The P-I has a daily circulation of about 200,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been successful in bucking the trends with an evening  
newspaper because of the quality of our product, but we now are at 
a point where we must respond to the community's clear preference 
for a morning paper,'' said Sizemore. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions to change the newspapers' 15-year-old joint  
operating agreement and to allow the Times to publish in the 
morning began in 1990 and intensified as the Post-Intelligencer 
sought a way to post news to its Web site, a move the Times 
believed was barred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to talk about it and see if we could solve it  
rather than sue each other,'' said Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised agreement extends until Dec. 31, 2083, and gives  
Hearst Corp. right-of-first-purchase should Times owners decide to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blethen family, which owns 50.5 percent of the Times, has no  
plans to sell, Sizemore said. Knight Ridder owns the remaining 49.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint operating agreements, in which newspapers of different  
ownership compete editorially but share advertising, circulation 
and production resources, exist in 16 cities.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear, Sumitomo To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a complex deal that will shake up the global  
tire industry, Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. plans to acquire 10 
percent of Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and gain control 
of the Japanese manufacturer's U.S. and Western European 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, which is expected to be announced today,  
Goodyear will form six joint ventures with Sumitomo around the 
world, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. 
Goodyear will pay the highly leveraged Sumitomo $1 billion for its 
contribution to the joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear, the world's third-largest  
automobile tire maker, will acquire about 10 percent of Sumitomo's 
outstanding shares while Sumitomo, the fifth-largest tire maker, 
will get a smaller stake in Goodyear. The stock swap is worth about 
$88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry,  
will control about 22 percent of the market once the deal is 
completed. That will make Goodyear the largest tire maker in North 
America and second-largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA, the top two  
respectively, have dominated the tire industry for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo spokeswoman Michiko Ichimiya said that while the two  
companies still are ironing out a final accord, simultaneous press 
conferences are planned today in Tokyo and New York. She did not 
offer additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	Naoto Saito, the president of Sumitomo, is in New York for the  
last-minute negotiations and was expected to attend the press 
conference there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at Goodyear, which will release its earnings  
report today, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, based in Kobe, Japan, is Japan's third-largest tire  
company. It has annual sales of about $4 billion but is saddled 
with about $2.8 billion in debt. Goodyear has annual sales of about 
$13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear and Sumitomo already have a manufacturing agreement,  
through which Sumitomo makes Goodyear-brand tires for Nippon 
Goodyear, and Goodyear supplies Dunlop-brand tires to Sumitomo's 
U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six joint ventures, the largest will combine 14 factories  
operated by the two companies in Western Europe, the source said. 
Goodyear will have 75 percent control of the venture, which 
generates about $4 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-largest alliance will take place in the United  
States, where Goodyear will take 75 percent control of Sumitomo's 
factories in Buffalo, N.Y., and Huntsville, Ala. The facilities 
have about $800 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other joint ventures will take place in Japan, where  
Goodyear has been striving to expand its presence. Both of these 
alliances will be controlled by Sumitomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also plan to combine research and purchasing  
activities in separate joint ventures. The purchasing joint venture 
and other restructuring could save a combined total of $300 million 
a year by the third year of the deal.

<HEADLINE> Wyoming Defeats Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Four months after gay college student  
Matthew Shepard was beaten to death, a move to pass a hate crimes 
bill in Wyoming was scuttled Wednesday by a legislative committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee killed two bills, and supporters said that ended  
their hopes for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers have rejected similar measures four times since  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After Shepard's death in October, calls for a law increased.  
Republican Gov. Jim Geringer for the first time supported the 
passage of a bias crimes law. Wyoming is one of nine states without 
bias crimes legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. John Schiffer, the committee chairman, said he hoped  
supporters of bias crime legislation would come back in future 
sessions with legislation that would have broader support. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation as written does not fit with what this state  
wishes to have in a bias crimes bill,'' said Schiffer, one of three 
people who voted against the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents of the bills objected to listing motivating  
factors, such as race, religion and sexual orientation, saying they 
offered special protection to certain groups. Others said no new 
laws are needed, just strict enforcement of existing measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures that died in the Senate Judiciary Committee would  
have increased the maximum fine for a felony by up to $5,000 and 
the maximum prison sentence by up to five years if prosecutors 
could prove the crime was bias-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Wende Barker, state coordinator for the Wyoming Bias Crimes  
Coalation, said she was disappointed but not surprised. ``We'll 
move on from here. The coalition is going to stay together and work 
on some public education and try to come back next year,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other bias crime-related bill before the Legislature is  
one that would set up a task force to examine how many bias crimes 
are being committed in Wyoming. It has passed the House and is 
pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts AARP on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With cracks about failing eyesight and memory,  
President Clinton courted the most powerful lobby for older 
Americans to side with him against the Republicans' broad tax cut 
in the coming Social Security and Medicare debates. 
</P>
<P>
	One pronouncement Wednesday was music to AARP ears: A caution  
about so-called ``premium support'' proposals being explored by the 
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare that would 
turn Medicare into a voucher-type program giving beneficiaries a 
subsidy to cover enrollment in their chosen health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans on Medicare -- especially Americans with lower  
incomes -- should be able to count on a defined set of benefits and 
protections without having to worry about excessive new costs they 
can't begin to afford,'' Clinton told a legislative council meeting 
of the American Association of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Corry, AARP's director of federal affairs, said the  
president's statement ``still leaves open a lot of room for debate, 
but it does begin to anchor the debate, and that is very helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Medicare commission, who still have almost a  
month to go before making final recommendations, are exploring 
whether the government could still guarantee health benefits under 
a premium support system -- a major AARP worry. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took pains to point out that he is a card-carrying  
member of the 32-million-strong organization. He opened the 
afternoon speech with a ``Good morning,'' then rolled his eyes at 
the mistake. ``Don't tell anybody I didn't know what time it was,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton turned to pull an easel closer, its oversized  
charts fell forward and bopped him on the head. ``Now, you may be 
able to see it just fine,'' he said, ``but I could see better from 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has always appreciated the power of the senior vote,  
AARP president Joe Perkins said. He recalled Clinton's astonishment 
-- ``Can't they count?!'' -- when shortly after his election he 
learned that no president ever had invited the group's council to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated on Wednesday his position that the long-term  
solvency of both Medicare and Social Security must be secured 
before any of the federal budget surplus is spent on broad-based 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to treat this as real serious or solemn,'' said Ari  
Fleischer, majority spokesman for the House Ways and Means 
Committee. He pointed to a recent Congressional Budget Office 
report that found Clinton-supported spending last year shrank the 
projected surplus by $51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for the president to say these words. It's  
another to judge his actions,'' Fleischer said. He added that 
Republicans don't see tax cuts and Social Security and Medicare 
reform as an either-or choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to work together across party lines to make these  
decisions. We have to work together across generational lines to 
make these decisions,'' Clinton told the seniors' group. ``I ask 
you to join with me to make sure that our country meets that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His condemnation of the GOP-proposed income tax cut echoed of  
the poll-tested rhetoric he used in the 1996 campaign to slam the 
tax plan of his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called this year's plan ``the wrong choice, ... the  
latest in a rather long series of large and risky tax proposals 
that we have heard over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton said, the GOP plan would ``benefit clearly the  
wealthiest Americans -- who have, I might add, done quite well as 
the stock market has virtually tripled in the last six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, partisan-edged rhetoric was unfortunate, AARP's  
Corry said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group has been careful not to alienate the Republican  
majority in Congress by choosing sides in the debate that is 
unfolding just as the 2000 campaign grinds into gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do Social Security and Medicare legislation from one  
side of the aisle,'' Corry said. ``We hope people aren't just 
trying to stake out positions to sharpen differences for the 
election campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Strickland Signs With Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland agreed to a contract with the  
Washington Wizards on Wednesday, ending the latest round of nasty 
negotiations between the team and agent David Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	The free agent point guard, who led the league in assists last  
season, is to report for his first practice Thursday, just one day 
before the Wizards open their season at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	A Wizards spokeswoman confirmed the agreement, with details not  
immediately available. General manager Wes Unseld, usually a 
regular at practice, was conspicuously absent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes after a face-to-face meeting Tuesday night  
between Falk and Unseld, breaking a stalemate that had lasted more 
than a week and produced terse public comments from both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk had been asking for a five-year deal worth $55 million --  
$10 million less than his original offer. The Wizards are offering 
a three-year worth $27 million guaranteed, plus two more years 
worth $23 million if Strickland meets certain performance 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk contended that any player of Strickland's caliber would  
have his entire contract guaranteed. The Wizards balked at 
committing five years of salary cap money to a 32-year-old player 
who has had his share of off-court problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland averaged 17.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 10.5 assists  
last season, but he also was convicted of drunken driving, missed 
team functions and regularly was late for practices and games. He 
would sometimes get sick on the bench after gulping a quick junk 
food supper before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Falk said Strickland had ``completely changed  
his lifestyle.'' Unseld was not impressed, and said if a deal 
wasn't reached by the first game, the negotiations would cease and 
he would bear the responsibility if the team played poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland joined Juwan Howard (twice) and Rex Chapman as Falk  
clients who have held difficult, sometimes bitter, and very public 
negotiations with the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Falk released a statement from Strickland in which  
the player asked: ``Is this any way to treat a productive employee 
because he exhibits loyalty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An angry Unseld said he hoped the atmosphere wasn't ``too  
poisoned.'' Each said it was the other's turn to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
	With Strickland and Mitch Richmond, acquired in a trade before  
the lockout, the Wizards have one of the best backcourts in the 
league. Without Strickland, the starter would have been Chris 
Whitney, mostly a reserve during his five years in the league.

<HEADLINE> Italy Marks Cable-Car Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAVALESE, Italy (AP) -- Shops closed and townspeople filled the  
church in this Alpine ski resort today, joining relatives of 20 
Europeans who plunged to their deaths a year ago when a U.S. Marine 
jet sliced a gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain that one year ago visited the lives of so many people  
is our pain,'' said the Rev. Renzo Caserotti. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a natural death, it is a death against nature. It is  
a death that could have been avoided, caused by an airplane that 
flew very low, outside all rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 300 people jammed the Roman Catholic church, many  
carrying bouquets of red roses. Relatives were red-eyed, holding 
back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats from Milan and Rome and Marine Maj. Gen. Ronald G.  
Richard represented the U.S. government and the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine jet, an EA-6B Prowler flying low during a training  
mission from a nearby base, snapped the cable over the slopes of 
Mount Cermis in the accident that briefly strained U.S.-Italian 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how painful it was, Sindy Renkewilz said she wanted to  
come to see the spot where her father and sister died. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time here and it really hurts,'' said  
Renkewilz, 20. ``But I think I need to do this, to lay some flowers 
where they died and think about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town declared today a day of mourning, ordering shops closed  
in memory of the dead: two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, 
three Italians, two Austrians and one Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, the mayor of Cavalese, Mauro Gilmozzi,  
unveiled a memorial stone in the town cemetery bearing the names of 
the 20 victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``These names will remain sculpted in our memory and in our  
hearts,'' Gilmozzi said. ``This memorial stone should warn against 
the evil man can cause when he acts without respect for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives planned a rendezvous at the precise spot and at  
the precise minute when the gondola came smashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the families demanded the United States quickly  
resolve wrongful death claims so they could receive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group complained that Congress had allocated funds to help  
the town, which suffered after the resort's ski season was ruined, 
but set aside hardly anything for them. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, relatives have received $5,000 each from the United  
States to cover immediate expenses plus $62,000 from the Italian 
government, 75 percent of which was reimbursed by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer representing the German and Polish families, John  
Arthur Eaves, said he wanted $5 million in losses for each of his 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed U.S. legislation to compensate the victims' families  
died in the last session of Congress. A Pentagon spokesman said the 
funds were available and payment would be made as soon as Italian 
courts rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Relatives of victims have also suffered some material  
losses,'' Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said at 
today's unveiling ceremony. ``I want to thank our friend and ally 
the United States for promptly coming to our aid to help find a 
fair solution to the problem of compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new gondola began running in January after the local province  
paid most of the $11 million bill. The funds allocated by the 
United States will eventually reimburse the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense and prosecution lawyers agree that the ski lift wasn't  
marked on the map given to the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, but 
prosecutors claim he was flying too fast and too low when the jet 
struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-martial on charges of involuntary manslaughter begins  
Thursday. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., faces a possible 
200-year sentence if convicted of the 20 counts. He also is charged 
with destroying government and private property and dereliction of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., faces court-martial Feb. 22 on 20 counts each of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligent homicide.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Makes Fox Ratings Champ / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another lopsided Super Bowl kept the television  
ratings down, but the Fox network wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 127.5 million people watched at least one minute of  
Sunday's contest between Denver and Atlanta, Nielsen Media Research 
said Tuesday. As expected, the huge audience enabled Fox to easily 
capture the week's ratings crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The average audience for the full game of 83.7 million made it  
the second lowest-rated Super Bowl game since 1971. Only San 
Francisco's rout of Denver in 1990 had lower ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But one number was most important to Fox: more than $150 million  
in advertising revenue it earned during the game and its pre- and 
post-game shows. The network said it was the largest single day of 
revenue in television history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also convinced an estimated 22 million viewers to stay  
around after the game to watch a preview of its new animated 
series, ``Family Guy.'' The series begins airing regularly in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, Fox had a 13.2 rating and 21 audience share. CBS  
was second with an 8.0 rating and 13 share, NBC had a 7.5 rating 
and 12 share and ABC was fourth with a 6.8 and 11. The WB had a 3.2 
rating and 5 share among the developing networks, UPN had a 2.1 and 
3 and Pax TV had a 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB's Monday night family drama, ``7th Heaven,'' scored the  
highest rating of any program in the network's history last week. 
It beat its own record set last Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners for the week were CBS' initial airing of ``The  
Shawshank Redemption'' and NBC's new drama ``Providence,'' leading 
the network to its fourth straight win on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the losers: the movies ``Mr. Wrong'' on ABC and  
``Clueless'' on NBC. Critics' favorite ``Cupid,'' just canceled by 
ABC, was again the network's lowest rated program for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program with an 8.7 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' had 
an 8.5 rating and 16 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 7.9 
and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 25-31, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``Super Bowl XXXIII,'' Fox, 40.2; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' Fox,  
33.0; ``Super Bowl Pre Game,'' Fox, 32.5; ``Super Bowl Post Game,'' 
Fox, 22.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 13.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.2; ``Family 
Guy,'' Fox, 12.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 12.5; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 11.8; 
``Simpsons,'' Fox, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Intel, Mattel Unveil High-Tech Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- When the leading computer chip maker  
teamed up with the top toy manufacturer, their brainstorming 
session produced a unique new product that could change the way 
kids have fun. It's also handy for looking up your nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. and Mattel Inc. are showing off the results of their  
collaboration -- call it an 18-month private play date -- with the 
first two products of the Intel Play line of toys, which they plan 
to unveil Monday at the Toy Fair in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the toys is a little electronic microscope that hooks up  
to a home PC, allowing kids to see blown-up images of anything they 
hold up to the lens. Since it's got its own light source, kids can 
use it to see close-ups of their ears, eyes, or even the inside of 
their nostrils. The second product is a camera connected to the 
computer that throws the moving image of a child onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're converting the magic of technology into the magic of  
playthings,'' said Doug Glen, Mattel's chief strategy officer. 
``Together we're offering much more play value than any stand-alone 
toy could have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel Play X3 Microscope, selling for about $99 and designed  
for kids 6 and older, plugs into a computer and magnifies up to 300 
times. It can sit in a stand so kids can hold things up to it, or 
it can be taken out and be held up to things. 
</P>
<P>
	The image is captured in a video format and can be colored, cut  
and moved around by aspiring young film editors. The time-lapse 
feature allows kids to make a movie of a germinating seed or a 
butterfly emerging from a cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect kids are going to start looking at everything.  
Coins, sewing threads, making discoveries all around them,'' said 
Michael Bruck, Intel's director of joint project. 
</P>
<P>
	The second toy, the Intel Play Me2Cam, $99, is a camera that  
sits on top of or next to a computer. It comes with Fun Fair 
software that allows children to be projected into the virtual 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	To play, a child stands in front of the computer and interacts  
by jumping around. In one game, bubbles slip across the screen. 
They can pop ``good'' bubbles with a poke of their finger, but 
``bad'' bubbles capture the player, who watches their trapped image 
struggle helplessly inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tapping the powers of the personal computer that people  
have already invested in and delivering a toy product that is so 
much more magical and amazing than anything we've seen before,'' 
said Mary Ann Norris, Mattel's director of the collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	The new line is being developed at a facility called the Smart  
Toy Lab in Portland, Ore., where a dozen handpicked toy designers 
and high-tech mavens play and create all day long. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts from both the toy and technical worlds said  
they see happy times ahead for the new alliance. ``It sounds like 
an interesting marriage of high tech and toys,'' said Gene 
Gilligan, executive editor of the toy industry magazine Playthings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilligan said toy companies have struggled in recent years as  
children spend more time on their computers and less time with 
their train sets and teddy bears. ``Certainly a company like Mattel 
is looking for a way to make toys to go with a computer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toys are expected to hit stores this fall, just in time for  
the Christmas shopping season.

<HEADLINE> Challenger Slams Chicago's Daley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As a Black Panther leader three decades ago,  
Bobby Rush thundered against City Hall. Now that he's a congressman 
and wants to run City Hall, he's lashing out at Mayor Richard M. 
Daley more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He slams Daley's nationally praised better-schools program as  
``a heart-wrenching failure'' and snaps that Daley is running the 
city as ``a personal fiefdom.'' But Rush is learning a time-honored 
political lesson: People named Daley are hard to beat in Chicago 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago Tribune poll conducted Jan. 14-19 showed Daley with 63  
percent of the vote to just 15 percent for Rush and the rest 
undecided. The black community, Rush's base, was split down the 
middle, while Daley's support topped 80 percent among both white 
ethnics and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley strategists say the poll is encouraging as the mayor runs  
for a third term in the Feb. 23 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush contends his supporters were undercounted.  
</P>
<P>
	``That poll has no soul,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Riding a crest of popularity, Daley smugly refuses to debate and  
mainly shrugs off Rush's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor is running a positive campaign,'' says spokeswoman  
Angelynne Amores. ``For 10 years, he has worked to bring Chicago 
together, to build schools and police stations. You don't do that 
by splitting people apart. You do that by working with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush, 51, however, says Daley ``has done a remarkable job of  
dividing this city along class lines and to a lesser extent along 
racial lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, the black community swept another congressman, Harold  
Washington, into City Hall as Chicago's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	This election, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White and Cook  
County Board President John Stroger, the city's most powerful black 
politicians, both back Daley, whose father ran the long-defunct 
Chicago Machine for more than 20 years. Rush dismisses them as 
``Machine-oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush does have support among respected community leaders. U.S.  
Rep. Danny Davis, a Chicago Democrat, says Rush has ``an in-depth 
understanding of social needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley has blanketed television with ads touting the schools  
program, which President Clinton praised as a model for how to 
raise children's test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scores, scores, scores,'' dismisses Rush. ``Their whole focus  
is to teach children to pass these doggone tests. You can teach a 
chimpanzee to score amazingly high on a test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of the popular schools program may have opened a  
credibility gap for Rush. And then there is his seeming eagerness 
to find something -- anything -- sinister about Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	When a South Side minister claimed fire inspectors closed his  
church school merely because he didn't endorse Daley, Rush hurried 
to the scene with camera crews in tow. Fire officials countered by 
releasing a long history of building code violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush hadn't checked first.

<HEADLINE> Skiing: Maier, Kjus Tie for Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Lasse Kjus' health appears to have  
lasted just long enough -- down to a hundredth of a second, as a 
matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 World Cup overall champion from Norway has long had  
respiratory trouble, and even surgery two years ago to correct a 
sinus problem didn't cure his ills. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recurring bouts of flu, colds and sore throats, Kjus has  
remained one of the best ski racers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he added another entry on his long list of  
accomplishments by tying Austria's Hermann Maier for the men's 
super-G gold medal in the first event of the World Alpine Ski 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, Kjus said during the postrace press conference that  
he hadn't felt too well Wednesday morning and that he had a sore 
throat by the afternoon. He headed for bed -- and some insiders 
among the Norwegian delegation said he would head home without 
competing in another event. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does go home, Kjus will do so with the first shared gold  
in the history of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Maier each tripped the timer in 1 minute, 14.53 seconds  
after markedly different trips down the Birds of Prey course. 
Maier, winner of three of four races this season in defense of the 
super-G title he won a year ago, dominated at the top of the 
course, leading Kjus by .19 seconds at the first intermediate and 
by .18 after the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really hit any of the turns on the top of the steep,  
but halfway down I got it together and managed to ski well from 
there on down,'' Kjus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier could only wonder how he'd have done if his tricky back  
hadn't been acting up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to forget about my back problem,'' he said. ``But I  
wasn't always able to push at 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze medal went to Austrian Hans Knauss, who was lucky to  
even make the field and then unlucky enough to miss out on the 
first-place tie by a hundredth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three days ago, the coaches made the decision that I would ski  
in this event, so this (bronze medal) is also good for the 
coaches,'' Knauss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier and Kjus were more than willing to accept being linked in  
the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world championship is the world championship whether you  
win alone or together,'' Maier said. ``Lasse skied well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to share with Hermann,'' Kjus said. ``He's a great  
skier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first medal in a World Championships, so I'm very  
happy,'' Knauss said. ``It's hard at the moment, a hundredth of a 
second behind the gold medal, but I'm happy with my bronze medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-place ties have occurred seven times in the history of  
World Cup ski racing, and there have been other races in which the 
top three were separated by a hundredth of a second. But neither 
had ever occurred before in a World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In a race in which medals go only to the top three, Austria's  
Stephan Eberharter, the 1991 super-G world champion, was a 
hard-luck fourth, .22 seconds back. Switzerland's Paul Accola, fast 
on the top before fading a bit at the bottom, was fifth in 1:14.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail native Chad Fleischer earned a roaring ovation from the  
crowd with the fastest early time. Although it wasn't enough for a 
medal, he did claim sixth, only .28 back of the co-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bonus to do this in America, in Vail, in front of a  
hometown crowd,'' Fleischer said. ``I made just a couple little 
mistakes and that's the three-tenths I'm out by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race more than made up for Monday's snowstorm that wiped out  
what was to have been the opening event of these championships, the 
women's super-G. That race was rescheduled for today.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Looking for Early Success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Phil Mickelson is no stranger to  
being a defending champion, having won 13 times on the PGA Tour. 
This year is a little different. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Mickelson is defending an AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach  
Pro-Am that he won just five months ago because of the longest rain 
delay -- seven months -- in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a pretty good accomplishment to wait seven  
months and keep thinking about this tournament and come back ready 
for it and actually win it,'' he said. ``That's not easy to do from 
Saturday night to Sunday, let alone seven months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even more peculiar is that Mickelson is not exactly at the top  
of his game for this time of the year. All but four of his 13 
victories have come before the end of March, and he has been voted 
PGA Tour player of the month for January four of the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mickelson decided to take more time off in November and  
December, hardly touching a club except for the Presidents Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire is back,'' he said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, if he can only find his game.  
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, whose streak of at least one victory for the past six  
years is the longest on tour, was 22nd in the 30-man field in the 
season-opening Mercedes Championship, then wound up 61st at the 
Phoenix Open last week, when he closed with an 80. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't scored well, but I feel like I've been playing  
well,'' Mickelson said. ``I don't feel my game is that far off. I 
feel I'm just mentally a little soft, and that's something I'll 
work on this week. I'm just not focused on posting a number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this rate, the focus could be entirely off Mickelson, who not  
long ago was considered the hottest young prospect in golf 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that was before Tiger Woods made his splash in late  
1996 and then won the Masters by 12 strokes. That was before Ernie 
Els won his second U.S. Open, before Justin Leonard won the British 
Open, before David Duval won nine times in 29 tournaments and 
posted the first final-round 59 in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil who?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we tend to focus on the fact that David and Tiger are  
so young, which they are,'' Mickelson said. ``But what's really 
caused them to be the center of attention is their great play. I 
don't think it's so much their age. I think it's just they are 
playing exceptional golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only 28, and I feel like there is a lot of time left.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duval is 27 and playing like the PGA Tour will be his own domain  
for years to come. If it wasn't clear when he closed out the 1997 
season by winning the last three events, or when he won a 
tournament in the winter, spring, summer and fall a year ago, 
Mickelson got a measure of confirmation during the Presidents Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	He was paired with Duval in three of the four team matches at  
Royal Melbourne and played three other practice rounds with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never missed a putt from 6 feet in,'' Mickelson said. ``His  
ball striking is exceptional. I don't think I've seen him miss a 
shot hard left; every shot he hits is a soft cut. And those two 
areas means that he is never in a lot of trouble, and he is getting 
the ball in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``So he is bound to shoot low numbers.''  
</P>
<P>
	The lowest of all is a 59, which Duval posted two weeks ago in  
the final round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic to make up seven 
strokes and win by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval still can't explain the significance of hitting golf's  
magic number, although he admits the hype made it difficult for him 
to concentrate last week in Phoenix, where he opened and closed 
with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way I've come to understand it is ... I can't  
understand it,'' he said. ``Do you understand what I'm saying? I 
don't appreciate what happened, and that's how I have gotten a 
little bit of appreciation for what did happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His golf has been a little less complicated. Booming drives that  
usually find the short grass, irons that don't stray too far from 
the pin and deadly putting -- a combination that has added up to two 
victories and the odds-on favorite to win every time he tees it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``What David Duval has done this year is beyond belief,'' Mark  
O'Meara said. ``We all know how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week might be an exception, because O'Meara is the  
undisputed king of Pebble Beach. He has won this tournament five 
times, and also won the U.S. Amateur in 1979 when it was played at 
Pebble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could ever be too depressed coming here,''  
O'Meara said. ``This place doesn't owe me anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week without rain, and a tournament that ends on Sunday  
instead of in the summer, would be nice.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Romanowski Living It Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Bill Romanowski is one happy camper, although  
it's quite a stretch to consider the Pro Bowl players' 
flower-bedecked, marble- and brass-finished luxury hotel a camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Back for his second NFL all-star game, Denver's teeth-rattling  
tackler was still a bit giddy over the Broncos' second consecutive 
Super Bowl title, giving him four championship rings in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great year, we won it all, and now I'm here at the  
Pro Bowl,'' Romanowski said. ``This is what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should feel right at home since the AFC squad resembles a  
Broncos' branch office. The linebacker is one of 10 Denver players 
in the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After stopping over in Denver for a victory celebration,  
Romanowski and several of his Broncos teammates attended their 
first AFC practice on Wednesday. However, three of Denver's 
all-stars -- John Elway, Terrell Davis and Steve Atwater -- had not 
yet arrived in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski is an 11-year NFL veteran who was on Super Bowl  
championship teams at San Francisco in 1988-89, the '89 team 
humbling Denver 55-10 in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of just 13 players to win a Super Bowl in each conference,  
Romanowski said he's honored to be back at the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a few years when I felt like maybe I deserved it  
but didn't get it,'' he said. ``So it feels really good to be voted 
into the game by the guys you play against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next season, when the Broncos will be aiming  
for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl victory, Romanowski 
said he will join a chorus of those trying to talk Elway into one 
more year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody will talk to him about coming back,''  
Romanowski said. ``But I just hope he does what's best for him and 
his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, dark circles under his eyes,  
said he had managed a total of about 10 hours sleep over the past 
four days, which included the Super Bowl, a victory parade in 
Denver, a TV appearance trading quips with Jay Leno, and the flight 
to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to let it all soak in,'' McCaffrey said,  
shaking his head at the blur of the past four days. ``I do know 
I've had an awful lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he was a little starry-eyed, being in his first  
Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched some of these guys play on TV for years,'' he  
said. ``Some of them, I've played against, but all these great 
players here, I'm awed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Minnesota Vikings running back Robert Smith was  
named as a replacement for Detroit's Barry Sanders, who has injured 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who will be making his first appearance in the Pro Bowl,  
finished the 1998 season fifth in the NFC in rushing with 1,187 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl is Sunday at Aloha Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Soars on Russia Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures soared Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid concern that Russian delays in shipping the metal 
will lead to a scramble among Western manufacturers of automobiles 
and electronics. Silver futures also jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybean futures slumped, while meat  
and livestock rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures have been on the rise as Russian exports of  
the industrial metal all but dry up, in what has been a predictable 
situation at this time of the year that nevertheless leaves 
manufacturers in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia accounts for nearly two-thirds of the world's production,  
but now for the third year running, exports have dried up in late 
December and not resumed for months because of bureaucratic delays. 
The metal is used heavily in Japan for automobile emissions-control 
devices and in electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for March delivery jumped $10.25 to $351 an ounce, the  
fourth increase in five sessions and highest price in nearly eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver also jumped amid signs supplies may be tightening, such  
as falling U.S. inventories and higher rates charged for borrowing 
the metal. March silver rose 7.5 cents to $5.54 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants on the Chicago Board of Trade dumped wheat  
futures in droves on news that Pakistan, one of the largest 
purchasers of American wheat, had been unable to make purchases 
overnight because it was arrears in its credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem led Pakistan to buy 200,000 metric tons of competing  
Australian wheat and renewed concern that U.S. producers have 
months more to suffer before export business bounces back from 
world economic woes. That has been reinforced further with concern 
that the U.S. winter wheat crop, which accounts for 75 percent of 
total production, so far has seen no adverse weather to reduce its 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell on the weakness in wheat and as an early rally  
prompted farmer selling of stores crops. Soybeans fell on grains' 
troubles and amid continued concern about the possibility of bumper 
crops in Brazil, the world's second-largest grower that also has 
enjoyed beneficial weather. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 1 3/4  
cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 3/4 cents to $5.07 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rose sharply on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange after Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
announced the United States, months after its initial announcement, 
will begin buying pork and other products for shipment to 
economically beleaguered Russia. The news prompted a flurry of 
buying from meatpackers and other users. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose 1.37 cent to 64.37 cents a pound,  
while more-active April rose 1.32 cents to 66.97 cents a pound; 
March feeder cattle rose 1.28 cents to 73.80 cents a pound; 
February lean hogs fell .82 cent to 40.65 cents a pound, while 
April lean hogs rose .40 cent to 43.92 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose .98 cent 56.65 cents a pound, while March rose 1.32 
cents to 57.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> FAA Bill Would Help Rural Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers in rural communities would  
have increased protection during major airline strikes under a new 
Transportation Department proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's plan would create a five-year program to help  
small and rural communities attract better air service and require 
major airlines to support their feeder services during a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the department wants to require large carriers to  
provide baggage and fare arrangements at major hub airports to 
passengers flying on small, independent carriers. Finally, they 
also want to improve about 1,500 smaller airports by starting 
satellite-based instrument approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the hub system has developed over the years, rural areas  
have found it tougher and tougher to obtain adequate air 
services,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said Wednesday 
during a speech to the Wings Club in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's airline strike helped expose how vulnerable many  
rural areas are to service disruptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary was referring to a pilots strike involving  
Northwest Airlines. Two of its feeder carriers, Minneapolis-based 
Mesaba and Memphis-based Express Airlines I, discontinued Northwest 
Airlink service when the strike began Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	That left 17 towns with no other scheduled service.  
</P>
<P>
	Mesaba and Express were ordered to resume service, but they said  
it would be impossible to comply. The department ended up filing 
suit against Mesaba. It also sued Northwest, seeking a court order 
to ensure ground services for the smaller airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The rural components will be included in a bill that seeks to  
renew the Federal Aviation Administration. That legislation is 
considered the vehicle for a host of aviation-related issues this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Burrell Joins Nets in One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Free agent Scott Burrell, who won a  
title with the Chicago Bulls last season, began practicing 
Wednesday with the New Jersey Nets after signing a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, entering his seventh NBA season after playing college  
ball at Connecticut, is seen as a backup to small forward Kendall 
Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	``His addition provides us with more options and flexibility  
with regards to the lineups we can put on the floor,'' Nets coach 
John Calipari said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, Miami, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Portland and Vancouver also  
were interested in Burrell, said his agent, Sean Holley. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell chose the Nets because he likes the team's direction and  
Calipari's style, Holley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking for a team that really took care of their  
players. He was looking for a setting where he could step in and 
make a major contribution,'' Holley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Burrell played in 80 games for the world champions,  
averaging 5.2 points and 2.5 rebounds, shooting 42 percent from the 
field and 35 percent from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20th pick of the 1993 draft, Burrell played four seasons at  
Charlotte before being traded to Golden State during the 1996-97 
season. Chicago got him in a trade prior to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was 1995-96, when he averaged 13.2 points a  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets released forward Harold Ellis on Tuesday to make room  
for Burrell. The team now has 13 players on the roster. Opening day 
rosters must be set by 6 p.m. Thursday, with teams allowed to carry 
14 players until Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets open the lockout-shortened season Saturday in Atlanta,

<HEADLINE> Geldof Launches Romania TV Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Atomic Media Group, led by Irish rock  
singer Bob Geldof, launched a music TV channel Wednesday which 
started broadcasting into 750,000 homes throughout Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not aiming at those youngsters who stood in bread lines  
during communism, but for those who grew up surfing the Internet,'' 
said Tudor Giurgiu, Atomic's creative director. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of communist rule in late 1989, cable television  
stations have flourished in this country of 23 million. In 
Bucharest, there are nine television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Atomic is being distributed in Romania by 70 relay stations. Its  
programs comprise western and local music as well as news on music 
and cinema performers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based Atomic has 140 employees and plans to hire more  
people soon, said British Executive Manager David Williams. Most of 
the VJs, or video jockeys, are around 20 and are students. 
</P>
<P>
	Atomic Media Group has already launched a similar TV channel in  
Poland, and the company has plans to expand in three western 
countries, including a chain of cafes and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Geldof, 43, was not at the launch. He was awarded an honorary  
knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for setting up the charity Band 
Aid, which raised millions of dollars for Ethiopian famine victims.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Racial Divide in AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Blacks donating blood for the first time are 25  
times more likely than whites to have recently acquired HIV 
infections, according to research which seems to document a growing 
racial divide in AIDS cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The research announced Tuesday examined blood donors, who are  
among the least likely of all people to be infected. Those who do 
risky things, such as inject drugs, are discouraged from giving. 
And since most donors do so repeatedly, they have already passed 
earlier screening tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, scientists developed a method of testing blood that  
reveals whether the infection is new or long-standing. They used it 
to look for fresh infections among people across the country who 
were giving blood for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael P. Busch and others from the Blood Centers of the  
Pacific in San Francisco used the new method to analyze the samples 
of 1.7 million first-time donors. Of the total, 427 were 
HIV-infected. The new test revealed that 58 of them had been 
infected within the previous few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis showed that about 2 of every 100,000 white donors  
annually are newly infected, compared with 51 per 100,000 among 
blacks and less than four among Hispanics and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the results indicate that AIDS is evolving from  
being largely an illness of white homosexuals to one of poor blacks 
who catch it through drug abuse and heterosexual encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, more than half of all HIV infections are among  
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martha Rogers of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention said the latest data reflect ``the well-recognized shift 
in the epidemic to people of color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other findings of the study:  
</P>
<P>
	--The number of new infections among first-time donors remained  
steady between 1993 and 1996, the years sampled. 
</P>
<P>
	--Men were twice as likely as women to be infected.  
</P>
<P>
	--Infections among new donors were highest in the South, where  
there were 25 infections per 100,000, and lowest in the central and 
western parts of the country, where there were less than 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The data were presented Tuesday at the 6th Conference on  
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reports at the meeting, researchers from the Federal  
University of Rio de Janiero, Brazil, showed that about 15 percent 
of men on powerful AIDS medicines still have measurable amounts of 
the virus in their semen. Doctors have hoped that the drugs would 
reduce virus levels so low that infected people will be less likely 
to spread HIV.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Be Sentenced Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two men Mike Tyson attacked at a fender  
bender think the former heavyweight champ shouldn't go to jail. The 
prosecutor feels otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion that counts is that of Judge Stephen Johnson, who on  
Friday will determine whether Tyson's latest comeback is done after 
just one fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will sentence the fighter on two counts of second-degree  
assault, prompting a decision in Indiana on whether Tyson violated 
his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to jail here, it's much, much more likely he'll go  
to jail there,'' said Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson must determine whether Tyson is ``nothing less than a  
time bomb buried in our back yard'' -- as argued by Montgomery 
County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler -- or a ``different Mike'' 
who has taken well to therapy and has become a more caring person -- 
as put forth by his adviser Shelley Finkel and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after  
a minor three-car accident in the Washington suburb of 
Gaithersburg, Md. On Dec. 1, Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he 
neither protests the assault charges nor admits guilt -- and could 
receive up to 20 years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He acted inappropriately that day,'' Tyson's wife, Monica, who  
was driving when the accident occurred, told The Washington Post. 
``But he never intentionally struck anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, were paid  
an undisclosed amount to avoid a civil suit shortly before Tyson's 
plea. Both will be present Friday, ready to testify on Tyson's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any inference that we've been purchased or bribed is off the  
wall,'' said Saucedo's lawyer, Glenn Culpepper. ``From the very 
beginning, my client said he didn't want him to convicted, he 
wanted him to be helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyer, who will ask for probation, plans to call  
character witnesses, including one from a Washington homeless 
shelter where Tyson has been doing volunteer work. He will also 
point out Tyson's goodwill acts while training in Arizona -- he 
visited teen-age inmates and paid for the funeral of a 2-year-old 
girl shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who lives in Bethesda, Md., is undergoing therapy at  
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that his actions speak for themselves. You're seeing a  
different Mike,'' Finkel said. ``This was a minor accident. The two 
defendants settled with him and said they wanted him to get help, 
and that's what happened. What more could you ask?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution sees things differently. Gansler called Tyson a  
``bully'' who committed ``road rage.'' The prosecutor quoted the 
November Playboy interview in which Tyson called himself a 
``hateful individual'' and said, ``I know I'm going to blow one 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The state need go no further than the defendant's own  
statements to arrive at the conclusion that (he) is not only 
volatile, but dangerous,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also details Tyson's rape conviction in Indiana, seven  
brushes with the law as a juvenile, as well as the infamous fight 
in which Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in June 
1997. Tyson subsequently had his boxing license revoked for a year 
before returning to knock out Francois Botha in a comeback bout 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	What Gansler cannot do is ask the judge to put Tyson in jail.  
The no-contest plea agreement negotiated by Gansler's predecessor 
forbids that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler doesn't like that agreement. So he's been publicly  
saying Tyson should go to jail while telling the judge that Tyson 
should be sentenced to a ``period of executed incarceration,'' 
which technically could mean home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyer calls that a ``violation of the rules of  
professional conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the judge a dunce, that he doesn't read The Washington Post  
or the AP wire? ... I'm asking for straight probation. I really 
think he deserves it,'' Kemp said.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Baldur's Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dungeon Master is out of a job.  
</P>
<P>
	The computer has taken over and the legions of Dungeons and  
Dragons diehards who made that cerebral table game a cult classic 
are ecstatic, their excitement due to ``Baldur's Gate,'' an 
ambitious undertaking that delivers on nearly every front. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a hit before it ever got to store shelves, selling fast  
in pre-orders over the Internet as word of mouth spread. Even those 
who've never played Dungeons and Dragons are getting hooked. It's a 
slam dunk for anybody with a taste for the kind of fantasy, myth 
and legend popularized in ``The Hobbit'' and ``Lord of the Rings'' 
trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baldur's Gate'' (Interplay, five CD-ROMs for Windows, $49.95)  
faithfully follows the complex rules set down a decade ago in the 
second edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, a hugely popular 
role-playing game that uses special dice, along with pen-and-paper, 
to compute conflict outcomes and keep individual statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the game successfully into cyberspace -- something tried  
before with mediocre results -- required a monumental two-year 
effort to build its vast, detailed graphic landscapes, extensive 
variety of inhabitants, animals and monsters, as well as the 
astounding artificial intelligence system that governs play. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no human Dungeon Master anymore to make often arbitrary  
judgment calls, which is a good thing, since you can't get on the 
bad side of the impartial artificial intelligence in ``Baldur's 
Gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end result is a lush world of ancient good and evil, where  
hand-to-hand combat and spell-casting are as common as hunger, 
thirst and tired feet, where friend and foe can be hard to tell 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Players find themselves sucked into a complex story of intrigue  
seemingly destined to bring all-out war in the land known as the 
Sword Coast, where the largest city is Baldur's Gate, named for the 
great explorer Baldurian, whose disappearance is one of many 
mysteries ripe for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing to take the form of one of the several races living  
together in the mythic realm, players can be human, elf, dwarf, 
gnome or a mixed breed half-elf or halfling. Callings include 
warrior, priest, sneak thief and sorcerer. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling between towns is complicated by an array of mythical  
monsters including ogres, tree sprites and nymphs, giant spiders, 
ghouls, gibberlings, hobgoblins, skeleton swordsmen and the pesky 
Xvart (evil creatures the size of a Smurf), along with more 
recognizable wild critters like wolves, bears and ferocious dogs of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety is far from assured in a town because there are  
assassins, thieves and spies roaming among relatively benign 
citizens who may have valuable information to share or needed 
commodities for sale. Players must gain knowledge, learn magic, 
build strong reputations and recruit allies to form groups of up to 
six members, which increase the odds for survival in the fiercely 
hostile environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weapons come from a medieval arsenal, ranging from spiked clubs,  
swords, daggers and battle axes to slings, bows and war hammers. 
There are also magic rings and amulets, along with potions and 
enchanted weapons that deal out greatly magnified damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The graphics, viewed from an overhead perspective, are stunning,  
especially on high-end computers with topflight video cards. 
Characters are sometimes a bit small to be fully appreciated, but 
the bird's-eye-view, which allows players to see a wide area, makes 
that minor fault a necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's artificial intelligence is a wonder, building player  
profiles based on gained experience as the quest proceeds, among 
many other things. So many variables enter the equations that even 
the brainiest players will be forever challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	The multiplayer option in ``Baldur's Gate'' will be  
disappointing to some because the group leader remains the only 
player who can make many decisions, with other five players taking 
the parts of group members controlled by the computer in 
single-player mode. The supporting players can do certain things on 
their own in battle, but most other moves require approval from the 
group leader. 
</P>
<P>
	A true online version, with dozens of players involved all  
having individual autonomy and full decision powers, isn't 
available yet, but is something developers say they are looking 
into. It would be tough to come up with, considering the server 
logistics of handling dozens of players at once and the immense 
number of calculations and tabulations that would require, but it's 
a nice dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baldur's Gate'' is a rarity in computer games, a harmonious  
blend of strategy and adventure with plenty of hack-and-slash, 
enough variety to please almost any taste.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Lynx Freed in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH FORK, Colo. (AP) -- Two female Canadian lynx bounded into  
the Colorado wilderness today, marking the return of a species that 
had not been seen in the state for a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to see them back running in the woods of Colorado,''  
said Gene Byrne, a Colorado Division of Wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The reintroduction came about three months after an  
environmental group said it set damaging fires at the Vail ski area 
to protect potential habitat areas for the lynx, a tuft-eared 
species of cat that weighs about 22 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
	In an open space blanketed with about 6 inches of snow, the  
biologists first opened the cage to free a wildcat called No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	She was hesitant at first, sitting inside for about five  
minutes. Byrne and wildlife officer Bill Andree then lifted the 
cage up gently and the 3-year-old lynx stepped out, sat in snow for 
another minute or so and finally ran into stands of aspen and 
spruce trees. 
</P>
<P>
	When the second cage was opened, No. 9, a 2-year-old female,  
wasted little time, dashing into the woods after only 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The two wildcats are among a group of 11 that arrived in the  
state last week after a 1,700-mile truck ride from British 
Columbia. A male and a female were to be released Thursday and the 
rest of the 11 lynx will follow later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been eating well. You couldn't expect them to be any  
more calm,'' said veterinarian Margaret Wild, who has been 
monitoring the mountain cats. 
</P>
<P>
	The release site, on private land near the Rio Grande National  
Forest northwest of here, had been kept secret, though there have 
been no threats to the animals. Ranchers and farmers fought the 
release in court and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx, which federal officials last year recommended for  
placement on the list of threatened species, a less restrictive 
category of protection than the national Endangered Species List, 
was last seen in Colorado in 1973 near Vail. It has become a cause 
celebre for environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretive environmental group Earth Liberation Front said it  
set fires that caused $12 million damage at the Vail resort in 
October to protest a ski expansion the group claims would destroy 
lynx habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to restore wildlife populations also have met  
resistance. Ranchers, farmers and residents of subdivisions built 
in former wildlife habitats have opposed the reintroduction or 
preservation of species ranging from the grizzly bear to the 
prairie dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Rancher Ed Oliver, who runs cattle near here, said he isn't  
worried about the lynx killing livestock but he is concerned that 
they will lead the federal government to take away grazing permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know as we have any objection against the lynx; it's  
just if the lynx do well there, these people are going to say this 
is good lynx habitat and then maybe close it off for cattle,'' said 
Oliver, in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne said he does not expect any threats against the lynx.  
</P>
<P>
	``The lynx is very secretive,'' he said. ``It's a nocturnal  
animal. It's not a species that is going to interact with people, 
so they probably will end up in some strange places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife activists say the reintroduction of the wolf into  
Yellowstone National Park has been such a success that it is now a 
bigger attraction for visitors than the grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, five of 11 Mexican gray wolves released last year  
have been shot. Officials plan to release more, but in more remote 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, where the lynx was  
released, are about as remote an area as any in the Western states. 
Often buried by heavy snow, the area is more than 100 miles from 
the nearest interstate highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx thrives in areas above 8,000 feet, living off the  
snowshoe hare. The lynx itself has large, snowshoe-like paws, good 
for marching through the snow or as a base for leaping to grab its 
prey. 
</P>
<P>
	The cats remain plentiful in Canada and Alaska but fewer than  
200 are believed to remain in the Lower 48 states, mostly in Maine, 
Montana, Washington and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials hope to release at least 50 in southwestern  
Colorado by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics wonder whether the wild cats can survive. Officials said  
the animals will wear radio collars and planes will fly over the 
area to monitor their progress.

<HEADLINE> Republican governors want Clinton trial ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Among the many Americans who hope the Senate brings the  
impeachment process to a quick close are some Republican governors, 
who fear their party is bearing the brunt of public disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to vote Thursday on whether to call witnesses  
to testify on the floor -- a move that could prolong President 
Clinton's trial. A vote against testimony could mean the beginning 
of the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said he hopes the trial ends as  
soon as possible. He pointed to GOP losses in last fall's 
congressional elections as proof that many Americans already blamed 
Republicans for what they consider partisanship and foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There appeared to be, here and in the rest of the country,  
support for Democrats and dissatisfaction with Republicans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster has been banging that drum for  
months, saying Republicans should end the trial speedily because 
they don't have the votes to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner this is wound up the better off the country is  
going to be, and for sure, the Republican Party,'' he said. 
``People just don't like what's happening in Washington. They don't 
like the way it's been drawn out on totally partisan lines. You 
cannot impeach a president on partisan lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the Republican  
Governor's Association, said the GOP is shouldering the blame for 
the public's frustration and that there should be ``a heads-up 
vote, yes or no'' immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Keating thinks the GOP will benefit in the long run.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton is fatally wounded and will limp  
through the rest of his presidency,'' he said. That outcome, 
Keating said, might help the GOP win the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP governors, including Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Cecil  
Underwood of West Virginia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska, said 
voters will judge Republicans more by what they accomplish in the 
way of programs than by the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are so wrapped up and consumed by this,  
but when you get out in the heartland, people aren't paying that 
much attention,'' said John Truscott, spokesman for Michigan Gov. 
John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the wrath of a disgusted public may cross party  
lines and leave people mad at politicians in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this process has hurt everybody. It's hurt Bill  
Clinton, it's certainly hurt his family. It's hurt the House of 
Representatives, it's hurt the Senate. In the eyes of the average 
citizen, it's a mess.''

<HEADLINE> Politics Cited in DeLay Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aides to the third-ranking House Republican,  
Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, are blaming ``political enemies'' for 
reports questioning the truthfulness of statements he made under 
oath in a 1994 civil deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan is among President Clinton's harshest critics in  
Congress and was the first high-ranking Republican to call for the 
president's resignation. DeLay, the House majority whip, has been 
particularly critical of Clinton's statements under oath about the 
Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition stemming from a lawsuit filed against him by a  
former business partner, DeLay testified that he had not been an 
officer of Albo Pest Control Co. for two or three years. But three 
months after the deposition, DeLay listed himself on congressional 
financial disclosure forms as Albo's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	And he identified himself as chairman of the company on  
financial disclosure forms covering 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. It 
was only in 1996, for disclosure forms covering the previous year, 
that he no longer listed himself as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was first reported by The New Republic.  
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's aides initially dismissed the allegations as politically  
motivated and said he would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, DeLay's communications director, Michael Scanlon,  
issued a statement saying: ``We were approached by news 
organizations 72 hours ago and asked to respond to inquiries dating 
back over a decade. Our political enemies have been digging into 
Mr. DeLay's past for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's deposition came in a lawsuit by ex-partner Robert  
Blankenship, who alleged that DeLay and another partner unjustly 
cut him out of the business. The lawsuit ended in a confidential 
settlement in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	During the deposition, portions of which appeared in The New  
Republic article, DeLay backtracked after being pressed by 
Blankenship's attorney, Gerald DeNisco. The congressman said he was 
uncertain whether he had ever formally resigned as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	DeNisco said he believed DeLay was attempting to limit his  
financial liability by denying he was still an officer of the 
company. ``It would seem to me Mr. DeLay was attempting to position 
himself out of harm's way,'' DeNisco said in an interview with The 
Associated Press last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, it's my opinion he lied to me under oath,'' DeNisco  
said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Japan's Economy Still Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy remains in a severe condition, with  
corporate earnings and the labor market continuing to deteriorate 
nationwide, said a government survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry's report on regional economic disparities  
also showed that industrial activity remained sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions along the industrial corridor linking Tokyo and Osaka  
are ``severe,'' while those in southern Japan are generally 
stagnant, according to the report, which cited regional ministry 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that increased public works spending in most regions was  
not leading to a recovery in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations continued to slash capital spending and payrolls as  
they struggled to restructure their operations amid Japan's worst 
economic downturn since the end of World War II, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment was still being hurt by near record high  
unemployment levels, but there were some signs of improvement in 
personal consumption, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of large electrical appliances have been strong in Tokyo  
and Osaka, while supermarkets in some areas have benefited from 
winter bargain sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall outlook for the economy remains dark, the report  
said.

<HEADLINE> Limits on World Bank Checkups Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brazil, India and other major developing  
countries want to limit the ability of a World Bank inspection 
panel to make in-country investigations. The group's inspections 
deal with protests from those who say bank-financed bridges, roads 
or dams may harm them or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, complaints to the watchdog panel have come from  
rubber tappers in Brazil, rural residents forced to resettle in 
India, even shareholders in a jute mill in Bangladesh who said bank 
practices hurt their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's 24 executive directors are seeking public comment on  
operating procedures for the group, known simply as the Inspection 
Panel, and a formerly secret paper outlining its procedures will be 
posted on the World Bank's Web site, the bank's spokesman said 
Wednesday. Directors also decided to delay until March 16 a meeting 
to discuss the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is a recognition that consultation is the best  
way to go,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, the vice president for 
external relations 
</P>
<P>
	During the next five weeks, directors and bank officials will  
continue talks with representatives of environmental, human rights 
and other nongovernmental organizations to see if they can agree on 
how the three-member panel should operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The directors were scheduled to meet Feb. 9 to discuss changing  
panel procedures. In the past there have been sharp disagreements, 
even deadlock, between directors from countries that borrow from 
the bank and those from donor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The donors include the United States and other wealthy nations,  
who view the panel as a way of making the 182-nation World Bank 
more accountable. The borrowing nations said the panel often 
intrudes into their domestic affairs by extending investigations 
beyond World Bank projects to practices of the host government. 
</P>
<P>
	Surendra Singh, India's representative at the bank, told a  
reporter investigations should be carried out ``in such a way that 
the borrowers don't get the feeling they are being put under a 
microscope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to open up consultations on panel procedures  
``means the board is moving forward with the participatory 
process,'' said a U.S. Treasury official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. ``The United States strongly supports this process, and 
an independent, effective inspection panel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also has strong support from Bank President James  
Wolfensohn. But critics say his managers and staff sometimes draw 
up remedial action plans to avert inspection panel visits to 
countries and draw attention away from those who make complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Inspection Panel was established in 1993 at the insistence  
of nongovernmental organizations and the U.S. Congress. Of the 12 
complaints its has looked into since 1994, it has recommended 
full-scale investigations in five cases. But because of 
disagreements, bank directors have rejected or limited all five 
probes.

<HEADLINE> Skier Fleischer Building Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Chad Fleischer's snow-leopard haircut  
looks like something straight out of the Dennis Rodman styling 
salon. Fittingly, he also is starting to blend in with the world's 
fastest skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing sixth in the men's super-G at the World Alpine Ski  
Championships, Fleischer made more than just a fashion statement in 
his hometown. He made a mental breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what it's all about now,'' Fleischer said  
Wednesday after his training run for Saturday's downhill, ``and I'm 
just going to concentrate on kicking everyone's (butt). That's an 
awesome feeling to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's super-G, Fleischer's best finish in a World Cup  
event this season was 11th in the downhill at Val d'Isere, France. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing 28-hundredths of a second behind co-champions Lasse  
Kjus of Norway and Hermann Maier of Austria, Fleischer became 
America's latest golden boy without the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to do now is just be solid and aggressive  
instead of absolute balls to the wall when I'm in the starting 
gate,'' Fleischer said. ``It was reckless abandon before, out of 
control almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 27, credits rigorous dry-land training and the snow  
leopard for his progress. After reading several books about the 
elusive cat, he bleached his hair and then painted the dark spots 
onto his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not seen a whole lot in the wild, but when they decide  
to go after their prey, it's quick and furious,'' Fleischer said. 
``That's one thing I say when I'm in the starting gate. I say that 
the snow leopard attacks. He always attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That little saying is like a cadence for me. It just puts me  
in the zone, like slow-motion. You're going 80 mph, and it's just 
like you're walking a kid in a stroller through the park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, who moved from Nebraska to Vail when he was 12, will  
take his next stroll Saturday in the men's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the fourth-fastest training time Wednesday, completing  
the daunting Birds of Prey course in 1 minute, 42.73 seconds. The 
training run was delayed about 3 1/2 hours because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Peter Rzehak -- who placed second in the second downhill  
run at Kitzbuhel, Austria, last month -- finished the 1.6-mile 
course in 1:42.22 for the fastest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who ranks second in the overall World Cup  
standings, was second in 1:42.43 and Austria's Stefan Eberharter -- 
fourth in World Cup points -- finished third in 1:42.67. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup downhill leader Kjus was seventh as he fought  
recurring respiratory and sinus problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling OK,'' Kjus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer is in his own kind of comfort zone, saying he is  
seeing every snowflake like Michael Jordan sees the basketball rim. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helps that he's sleeping in his own bed, driving his own  
car, and getting slapped on the back by familiar faces everywhere 
he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of an inner celebration right now for me,''  
Fleischer said. ``I still have a lot of work to do. My goal is to 
be on the podium here and to be the best skier in the world, not 
just perform here in front of the home crowd.''

<HEADLINE> Harpia Wins Shirley Jones Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Harpia won her fifth race in a row  
Wednesday with a 2 1/4-length victory in the $100,000 Grade 3 Shirley 
Jones Handicap for fillies and mares at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotzanna was second, followed by Memories of Gold, U Can Do It  
and Delta Music. 
</P>
<P>
	Harpia was unable to win her two starts in France in 1997 but is  
unbeatable since returning to the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming favorite, Harpia ran seven furlongs in 1:22 with  
Richard Migliore up, and paid $3.00, $2.40 and $2.10. Scotzanna 
paid $2.80 and $2.10. Memories of Gold paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shirley Jones was the first stakes race for Harpia, a  
Kentucky-bred 5-year-old daughter of Danzig. Bred and owned by 
Judmonte Farms Inc., Harpia finished third and 10th in her first 
two races, at Deauville. 
</P>
<P>
	She was shipped to the United States the following year and  
broke her maiden by 11 lengths at Gulfstream on March 5, 1998. Her 
first four victories were by an average margin of 7- 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	She was pressed a bit in the Shirley Jones but was in control  
all the way. Migliore shook the stick at her in the final sixteenth 
and put her to a drive but never did hit her. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's purse of $60,000 raised Harpia's earnings to  
$146,049.

<HEADLINE> Lauder To Head U.S. Jewish Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Billionaire Ronald S. Lauder was elected  
Wednesday to head the largest umbrella organization of American 
Jewish groups -- despite questions over whether he contributed to 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauder -- a philanthropist and son of cosmetics magnate Estee  
Lauder -- was voted chairman of the Conference of Presidents of 
Major American Jewish Organizations by a show-of-hands vote at a 
meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference of Presidents is a nonpartisan group that  
addresses issues relating to Israel and Jews around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman is generally not identified with any particular  
camp during his two-year tenure. Lauder told the organization's 
nomination committee that he had not given money to Netanyahu's 
1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But articles published last week by The Jewish Week in New York  
and Haaretz, a daily newspaper in Israel, raised questions about 
whether Lauder had told the truth. The articles cited tax records 
and anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the chairmanship Wednesday, Lauder, 54, said his  
experience during ``these recent days has only heightened my 
respect and admiration for all of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must look as to what unifies us,'' he said. But ``unity  
does not require uniformity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lauder was ambassador to Austria under President Reagan. He also  
ran for mayor of New York City as a Republican in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Neuheisel's Coaches Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel vowed to make things happen for  
the Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the new coach finds himself in trouble with the Pac-10 and  
perhaps the NCAA less than a month after leaving Colorado to come 
to Seattle for $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Neuheisel acknowledged that five Washington  
assistant coaches were in four prospects' homes last Sunday during 
a cooling-off period for recruits. That was a violation of NCAA 
recruiting rules because the Sunday before letter-of-intent day is 
considered a quiet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies turned themselves in to the Pac-10 on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was illegal to be off campus,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'm  
embarrassed by it. Unfortunately, this was an error. I take full 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, both a UW official and new Colorado  
coach Gary Barnett contended Neuheisel violated another NCAA rule 
when he telephoned some of his former Colorado players. Barnett 
calls that tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know coach Neuheisel has called some of them in their homes  
and has tampered a little bit,'' Barnett told the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, categorically false,'' Neuheisel responded. ``What  
I did was say good-bye to some of my former athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called them, wished them well, told them to stick together  
and I enjoyed my time with them. It was something I'd hoped to do 
to every one of the kids at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never, ever did I ever mention anything with respect to  
transferring or the University of Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had attempted to call Barnett on Tuesday, but Barnett  
did not return his call. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado wrote a letter of protest to the Huskies last Thursday  
and sent copies of it to the NCAA, the Pac-10 and the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	UW compliance director Ralph Bayard said Neuheisel needed  
Colorado's permission to talk to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayard said Colorado accused Neuheisel of trying to get  
Buffaloes players to transfer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskies athletic director Barbara Hedges, who hired Neuheisel on  
Jan. 9, ``was upset, obviously,'' Bayard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bayard: ``They'll (the NCAA) probably contact the athletes  
at Colorado to find out exactly what was said. But it would be kind 
of ridiculous to get on the phone and to actually talk about coming 
to this institution knowing full well that if you're talking to 
somebody there's another party who knows what you said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he had not been aware that the Sunday visits were  
a rules violation. When a high school coach mentioned the problem 
Monday, Neuheisel said he talked to Hedges and Bayard, then called 
the Pac-10 headquarters to report the violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rule against the Sunday visits has been on the  
books since 1995, Neuheisel said he wasn't aware of it and it 
didn't come up before because he'd always finished his recruiting 
visits earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, we arrived late,'' Neuheisel said. ``Normally,  
our recruiting efforts are way done by this time and there isn't 
any need to be in anybody's home on that Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said the Huskies visited kicker John Anderson, of  
Boyton Beach, Fla.; cornerback Chris Massey, of Moreno Valley, 
Calif.; cornerback Domynic Shaw, of Oakland, Calif., and safety 
Clayton Hawthorne, of Victoria, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel expects a light slap on the wrist for the violation.  
The four players in question were immediately declared ineligible 
by UW officials, but the Huskies expect to get their eligibility 
back in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no official sanction other than maybe a letter  
of reprimand (from the Pac-10) for myself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> For Meissnitzer, Pressure Is Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- It was a hug that said everything.  
</P>
<P>
	Picabo Street, who came back from oblivion to win an Olympic  
gold medal, threw her arms around Alexandra Meissnitzer to mark the 
occasion of the Austrian's return from her own trek through the 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	After an off year in 1997, Meissnitzer began to regain form in  
1998, and this year is on the verge of becoming the sport's 
dominant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a huge step Wednesday by winning the super-G, the first  
women's event of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	There in the finish area to congratulate her was Street, who  
overcame a year of inactivity to win the super-G in the 1998 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't talk, because she knew what was going on,''  
Meissnitzer said. ``Yesterday we spent the day together and she was 
trying to make me more relaxed. When she's trying to concentrate, 
she likes to be alone in her room. But I'm the opposite. I want to 
talk. If you're talking to someone who knows, it's such a help, 
someone who can know what's going on in your head. And it's nice to 
have someone on the circuit whose not jealous of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer earned her first medal in three World Championships  
by negotiating Vail's International course in 1 minute, 20.53 
seconds to pace an Austrian sweep. It was just .03 seconds back to 
Renate Goetschl and .21 to Michaela Dorfmeister. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep gave Austria five of the six medals awarded so far in  
the championships. Hermann Maier shared the gold with Norway's 
Lasse Kjus in the men's super-G on Tuesday, with Hans Knauss 
claiming third. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Living Together-Divorce Link Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing body of research has found that  
contrary to popular belief, people who live together before 
marriage are more likely than other couples to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report released this week from the National  
Marriage Project at Rutgers University, studies done over the past 
decade found the same connection between living together before 
marriage and splitting up after. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot question for marriage and family sociologists these days  
is why. 
</P>
<P>
	Many researchers believe the reason is partly that people who  
live together are more unconventional to begin with and are less 
committed to the institution of marriage and more open to the 
possibility of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the latest report suspect something more  
insidious -- that living together slowly erodes people's ability to 
commit and their faith in the institution of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get into a pattern that works against having a long-term,  
committed relationship,'' said Barbara Whitehead, co-director of 
the National Marriage Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is nonpartisan but is funded by mainly conservative,  
traditional family foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the recent studies on cohabitation and marriage was one  
released in 1997 by the National Center for Health Statistics. It 
showed that 27 percent of women who lived with someone before 
getting married ended up divorced within five years. Ten percent of 
women who never lived with a boyfriend saw their marriages dissolve 
in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Another study, which was done in 1992 and based on figures from  
the National Survey of Families and Households, found that couples 
who lived together before marriage are 46 percent more likely to 
see their marriages dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sociologists say the increase in unmarried people living  
together is only part of a much larger phenomenon -- the decreasing 
centrality of marriage. They say living together may in fact help 
root out poor relationships that would otherwise have become 
unhappy marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bumpass, director of the National Survey, which is based  
at the University of Wisconsin, noted that the divorce rate has 
stabilized since 1980, while the rate of cohabitation has shot up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If cohabitation was causing an increase in divorce, you would  
have expected the divorce rate to accelerate, but it's not,'' he 
said. ``To lay everything on the doorstep of cohabitation is to 
fail to recognize the dramatic change that is occurring in the way 
marriage is viewed.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Troubled by Microsoft Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all its software genius, Microsoft Corp.  
found itself outwitted in a humiliating computer demonstration at 
its antitrust trial by two young men barely out of college and a 
government lawyer so unaccustomed to techno-jargon that he once 
pronounced ``log in'' as ``lojun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a second day of high courtroom drama, the government exposed  
new, embarrassing problems Wednesday with a digital video 
demonstration prepared by Microsoft to buttress one of its bedrock 
legal defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a four-minute segment, Justice Department lawyer David  
Boies pointed out software icons that appeared -- then disappeared 
and reappeared -- on the screen of a computer purported to have been 
tested by Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson grabbed his brow and  
shook his head in exasperation to admonish James Allchin, a 
Microsoft executive on the witness stand, about the video. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a top scientist and a senior vice president, was forced  
to explain that Microsoft had tested several computers with 
different software packages, but edited together video segments so 
it appeared a single computer was being tested during the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't in our lab trying to be incredibly precise,''  
Allchin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can I rely on it if you can't tell me whether it's the  
same machine or whether any changes have been made to it?'' the 
judge demanded. ``It's very troubling, Mr. Allchin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in a private meeting with lawyers, the judge said he did  
``not believe that (Allchin) deliberately falsified this, but it 
does cast serious doubt on reliability of that exhibit 
altogether,'' according to a court transcript. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added that Boies ``has done a very professional job of  
discrediting those tapes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling to recover its credibility following the courtroom  
fiasco, Microsoft promised to re-create the demonstration overnight 
Wednesday in downtown Washington with government experts watching. 
They planned to play the new video for the judge today. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had believed its demonstration would be an effective  
rebuttal of the government's claims that its Internet browser 
software could be easily removed from Windows 98. The video shows 
its browser running dramatically slower after the government tried 
to disable most Internet functions in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is central because the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its browser to newer versions of 
Windows, forcing consumers who use its popular computer operating 
system also to use its Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitting its technical expertise against Microsoft -- with its  
legions of brilliant programmers -- the government hired as 
consultants Christian Hicks and Peter Creath, both in their early 
20s, and their former computer professor, Edward Felten of 
Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
	The three studied Microsoft's demonstration video ever since the  
company handed over a preview copy to government lawyers just over 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	They noticed a subtle flaw in the video that Boies used to  
confront Allchin about on Tuesday with Perry Mason-style fanfare, 
then they discovered new problems when they reviewed the 
demonstration again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies gave credit to his young computer experts. While he's  
nationally known for his legal skills, Boies has proved less than 
adept tackling technical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He once mispronounced ``log in'' as ``lojun,'' and frequently  
calls the world's largest Internet provider ``American Online'' 
instead of ``America Online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin had testified he was assured by his ``total trust in my  
team'' that Microsoft's tests had been performed using clean 
computers containing only Windows software with the government's 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies pointed out telltale remnants of other programs, such  
as parts of Microsoft's Office business software. In one segment, 
nine icons were visible in the background on the computer's screen; 
in another, one was missing. Later, it reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the impression given is, this is the same machine,''  
Boies charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make very good software. We didn't make a very good tape,''  
said the company's lead in-house lawyer, William Neukom. ``It's 
frankly our fault. We've got to do a better job.''

<HEADLINE> Principal Beating Called Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white elementary school principal whose  
policies have given rise to anger among some Hispanic parents was 
attacked in what police described as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Bernstein, 65, principal of Burton Elementary, told  
police he was beaten by two Hispanic men outside the school Monday. 
Bernstein said the men held a sharp object to his throat and 
punched him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	One attacker told Bernstein, ``We don't want you here, white  
principal,'' Detective David Escoto said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault happened as the nation's second-largest school  
district is implementing a statewide effort to reduce bilingual 
education and switch to a year-round schedule, which many parents 
find disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parents really felt the district was not listening to  
their concerns,'' said Maria Wale, an operations administrator for 
the district. ``That's what we've heard from parents. But there was 
nothing to give us any indication this would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will vote next week  
on posting a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers said some parents are upset that Bernstein is not  
Hispanic and does not speak Spanish. Others said the attack was 
simply a matter of disaffected individuals using the white-Hispanic 
issue to spread hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents at all schools say they want to change principals  
sometimes,'' said teacher's aide Pedro Mendoza. ``But they wouldn't 
go to the extent of hurting an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton Elementary has 750 pupils, and 90 percent are Hispanic.  
</P>
<P>
	While all schools in California are being forced to replace  
bilingual education with English-only classes under Proposition 
227, which was passed by voters last June, pupils are eligible for 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	All 200 parents who requested waivers at Burton to put their  
children back in bilingual education received them, said Gene 
McCallum, a regional administrator for the Los Angeles Unified 
School District.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Profit Off; NY Times Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit dropped  
58 percent on a big loss from its investment in a satellite 
broadcasting business, but the returns from the company's 
operations rose on the strength of its magazines, cable networks 
and music division. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reporting Wednesday, The New York Times Co. posted a 2  
percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, aided by rising 
advertising and circulation revenue. 

</P>
<P>
 *Time Warner Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest media and entertainment company earned $90  
million in the last three months of 1998. But that represented a 
loss of 17 cents a common share after making required dividend 
payouts on its preferred stock. Time Warner earned $216 million, or 
11 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7 percent to $7.46 billion from $6.97 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The results include Time Warner Entertainment Co., a partnership  
with MediaOne Group Inc., which holds most of Time Warner's cable 
systems, Warner Bros. and HBO. Time Warner owns about 75 percent of 
the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were dragged down by a $210 million loss on its  
investment in Primestar Inc., a satellite broadcaster co-owned by 
major cable companies that is being sold to the owner of rival 
DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline, Time Warner's results were better than  
analysts' projections for a loss of 19 cents a share. Time Warner 
shares rose $2.81 1/2 to close at $64.06 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding any special charges or gains, Time Warner's operating  
profits rose 37 percent to $627 million on gains across most of its 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishing division was boosted by advertising and  
circulation gains at People and InStyle magazines. Music profits 
were aided by fourth-quarter releases from Alanis Morissette, Jewel 
and R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
	At Warner Bros., syndication revenue from the hit TV shows  
``ER'' and ``Friends'' offset a weak quarter at the box office. The 
company's cable networks -- including HBO, TBS, TNT and CNN -- 
continued to post profit gains. And the teen-friendly WB television 
network, which has enjoyed strong ratings, pared its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	But profit from cable systems fell in comparison with a year  
ago, when there were big gains from selling or swapping some 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros.' box-office performance has been a recent sore  
spot, but Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin predicted a turnaround 
in 1999. The studio's releases this year include Will Smith in 
``The Wild Wild West'' and Stanley Kubrick's long-awaited ``Eyes 
Wide Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit report came two days after Time Warner announced AT&AMP;T  
Corp. will use its cable lines to provide local phone service, a 
deal that gives Time Warner new revenue without requiring the 
company to make significant cash investments. Levin said the 
company will pursue more deals under a similar strategy this year, 
trying to take advantage of additional uses for its existing 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Time Warner earned $168 million, which equaled  
a loss of 31 cents a share. The results were down from 1997 
earnings of $246 million, which equaled a loss of 6 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $26.84 billion from $24.62 billion.  

</P>
<P>
 *The New York Times Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $84.3 million, or 45 cents a share, in the  
fourth quarter, up from $79.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 6 percent to $782.2 million from $768.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Costs related to staff reductions reduced pretax earnings by  
$5.4 million, or 2 cents a share, in the latest quarter. Excluding 
those costs, the results matched analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times Co. shares fell $1.50 to $32.50 on the NYSE.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit in the company's newspaper group rose 11  
percent to $145.7 million as overall advertising gains offset 
slower growth in help-wanted ads at The Boston Globe and higher 
newsprint costs. The newspaper group, which accounts for 91 percent 
of the company's revenue, includes its flagship The New York Times, 
The Boston Globe and 21 regional papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasting group's operating profit rose 20 percent to  
$14.6 million on strong political advertising and improved cost 
controls. The company operates eight network-affiliated TV stations 
and two radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine group, made up of three golf magazines, reported a  
$2.7 million operating loss, reversing a profit from the 1997 
quarter. The division was hurt by consolidation in the golf 
equipment business, severance costs and the sale of six tennis, 
skiing and sailing magazines last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the Times Co. earned $278.9 million, or $1.45 a  
share, up from $262.3 million, or $1.33 a share, in 1997. Revenue 
grew to $2.94 billion from $2.87 billion.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Pulls in Solid Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bob Davie says Notre Dame still has that magic. Especially after  
signing 15 recruits Wednesday who made the USA Today All-American 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest news may have been the one that got away. C.J.  
Leak, a highly-touted quarterback from Charlotte, N.C., chose Wake 
Forest over Notre Dame, which for months had expected the 6-foot-4, 
210-pounder in the mold of Randall Cunningham to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to be the biggest surprise of the recruiting  
season,'' Bobby Burton of the Austin, Texas-based The National 
Recruiting Adviser said of Leak. ``That kid was penciled in at 
Notre Dame for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, who did not sign a quarterback, were still rated  
third in the nation for their recruiting class by Burton and Tom 
Lemming of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Prep Football Report, but eighth 
by Allen Wallace, publisher of Laguna Beach, Calif.-based SuperPrep 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie's third recruiting class since he took over as head coach  
for the Irish features five offensive lineman, four defensive backs 
and three defensive lineman -- but no quarterback -- and has at least 
seven players that Davie said could play right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's always the question you're asked,'' Davie said. ``Can  
you do it at Notre Dame with the high academic requirement we have 
and how hard academics are once you get here on campus. Can you do 
it? 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on last year's class and this year's class, I don't have  
any question that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the class are players like Gerome Sapp, rated one  
of the top two recruits out of Texas. The 6-foot, 210-pound 
defensive back had 58 solo tackles as a senior at Lamar High School 
in Houston to go along with six forced fumbles, three recoveries, 
five interceptions and two picks returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish also picked up defensive lineman Cedric Hilliard (6-3,  
295) from Texas, and offensive lineman Jeff Faine (6-3, 310) from 
Florida, both of whom are expected to compete for starting slots as 
freshman, David said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some things to sell that no one else in the country  
has to sell, and I really mean that,'' Davie said. ``But certain 
kids don't understand what that is, so it's to find those kids and 
those families that Notre Dame is the right fit and when we find 
them, we can compete against anyone in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leak completed 154 of 285 passes for 2,420 yards with 28  
touchdowns and just six interceptions at Charlotte Independence. He 
also rushed 74 times for 695 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Leak brought jerseys of his three college finalists to his news  
conference. He picked up the black and gold of Wake Forest, 
stressing academic and social reasons for choosing the private 
school in Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	Leak also said the Demon Deacons told him he would be their  
quarterback next fall as a freshman, and that they wouldn't recruit 
at his position for two years.

	Democrats Threaten Trial Battle  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats threatened today to turn  
President Clinton's impeachment trial into a party battle if the 
Republicans go through with plans to vote on a declaration of 
wrongdoing before deciding his fate. As House GOP prosecutors 
questioned Sidney Blumenthal, the third of three witnesses in the 
case, Democratic leader Tom Daschle said his party's lawmakers were 
solidly opposed to any live trial testimony. He also raised 
objections to the immediate public release of Monica Lewinsky's 
videotaped deposition. But what sparked the Democrats' sharpest 
criticism was a GOP proposal for a formal finding of wrongdoing, a 
measure that would require a simple majority for passage rather 
than the two-thirds needed for conviction on impeachment. 

</P>
<P>
	Poll: Americans Sick of Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are worn out with President  
Clinton's impeachment trial and they're mostly blaming Republicans, 
according to a new poll. Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way 
the Senate is handling the trial, while 37 percent approved, the 
CBS News/New York Times Poll found. Two-thirds of those questioned 
said the way House and Senate Republicans have handled impeachment 
has hurt the image of the GOP.

	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- The Democratic presidential field for 2000,  
once expected to be a crowded free-for-all, is shaping up to be a 
small field led by Vice President Al Gore. As Gore traveled today 
to New Hampshire for the 14th time in five years, House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt announced that he will bypass the White House 
race and try instead to become speaker of the House in 2000. Sen. 
John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson

	DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Separatists in Kosovo, in  
accepting the U.S.-European summons to weekend peace talks in 
France, demanded a guarantee that a vote on independence for their 
province would be part of any peace accord with Serbia. In 
Belgrade, the government gave its strongest signals yet that it 
will also join the negotiations. NATO has threatened to attack if 
the Serbs and ethnic Albanians don't start talking by Saturday and 
strike a deal by Feb. 19 to end 11 months of fighting.

to the United States and NATO to help fix computers that control 
Russia's nuclear weapons. Computer snags brought on by an internal 
clock failure could sabotage radar and telecommunications networks 
that are the backbone for Russia's system to detect foreign

<HEADLINE> Robinson Not Hiding at Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Eugene Robinson waded into the group of  
autograph seekers, chatting and signing the caps, footballs and 
assorted pieces of paper thrust at him. 
</P>
<P>
	A little later, he yelled at his son, ``Good try, Brandon, atta  
boy,'' as the 9-year-old futilely tried to chase down a much bigger 
boy running with the ball on the Pro Bowl practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after a nightmarish weekend that included being  
charged with soliciting an undercover officer for sex and then 
getting burned for a key touchdown in Atlanta's Super Bowl loss to 
Denver, Robinson was trying to get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I don't intend to do is cower and hide,'' the  
Falcons' safety said Wednesday after working out with the NFC 
all-star squad. ``That's not my personality. God made me a person 
who really likes and cares about people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very encouraged by the support I've received. My  
teammates and my friends, everybody has been very supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's wife, Gia, their 11-year-old daughter and son Brandon  
are with him in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how everything is going with his family, Robinson replied,  
``It's good. I think everything is going very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, on the advice of his attorney, he would not answer  
questions about his arrest last Saturday night for allegedly 
offering an undercover police officer $40 for oral sex in a seamy 
area of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	After the mostly sleepless night that followed, he started for  
the Falcons the next day and let the Broncos' Rod Smith get behind 
him for an 80-yard TD reception. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest around 9 p.m. EST Saturday came just 12 hours after  
Robinson, nicknamed ``The Prophet'' for his religious beliefs, 
received the 1999 Bart Starr Award from the Christian group 
Athletes In Action, annually honoring an athlete of high moral 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declared his innocence after the arrest, but he still  
apologized publicly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His Falcons teammates at the Pro Bowl said they still consider  
Robinson an outstanding man. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever been around Eugene for 15 minutes, you'd  
realize what a great person he is,'' running back Jamal Anderson 
said. ``We still think about him, respect him, the same way we 
always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jesse Tuggle went to Robinson's room to speak with  
him Saturday night after he heard of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with him, looked him in the eyes and told him, `I  
still believe in you. You've got to go on like it never happened.' 
We talked about everything we had done to get where we were (in the 
Super Bowl), and what we had to do in the game,''' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle and Anderson said they don't think Robinson's arrest, and  
the possible distraction, played any part in the Falcons' 34-19 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into the game absolutely the same as we would have  
anyway,'' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Anderson: ``I'd love to be able to use that as an excuse,  
but it sure didn't affect anything in terms of my running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, is expected to be arraigned on the misdemeanor  
count within the next 30 days. He could have charges dropped 
through a diversion program commonly offered in such cases. If he 
is not offered pretrial intervention, Robinson could face a maximum 
penalty of about 60 days if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, in his third Pro Bowl, has 53 career interceptions,  
tops among active players. The Super Bowl with the Falcons was his 
third; he played in two for Green Bay.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Marcos To Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine Supreme Court today  
ordered a lower court to try the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos 
on 24 counts of illegally maintaining overseas bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court also castigated Judge David Nitafan of the  
Manila Regional Trial Court for dismissing the charges, filed by 
the government in 1992, even though former first lady Imelda Marcos 
had not sought to quash them. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemmed from the discovery of deposits belonging to  
the couple in Swiss banks shortly after Marcos was ousted by a 
popular revolt in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss accounts, which have been claimed by succeeding  
administrations as part of Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth, have 
gathered interest over the years and are valued at about $570 
million. The money has been transferred to an escrow account in a 
Philippine bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charged Mrs. Marcos with ``dollar salting'' in  
violation of a central bank regulation prohibiting Filipinos from 
maintaining foreign currency accounts abroad without the bank's 
permission. The Swiss accounts were opened as early as 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a five-year jail term, for a maximum of 120  
years in prison for Mrs. Marcos if she is convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Nitafan cited in throwing out the charges in 1992 was  
that they allegedly were ``part of a sustained political vendetta'' 
against the Marcos family by officials in the administration of his 
successor, former President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court, however, ruled that Mrs. Marcos, not the  
judge, could seek dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise, if the judge initiates a motion to quash, then he  
is not only prejudging the case of the prosecution but also takes 
side with the accused,'' the Supreme Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal said the central bank regulation was presumed  
constitutional ``until otherwise declared by this court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada said he prefers an out-of-court  
settlement to recover the Marcos wealth, including the Swiss 
deposits, because more than 12 years of legal battles have yielded 
little.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Climate Watcher Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current systems for observing the planet's  
climate change are inadequate and raise questions about the 
accuracy of some findings, a government advisory panel reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council study found that ``deficiencies in  
the accuracy, quality and continuity of the records ... place 
serious limitations on the confidence'' of the research results. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be a shock to many people who assume that we do know  
adequately what's going on with the climate, but we don't,'' said 
Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo., who independently reviewed the report. 
</P>
<P>
	What scientists primarily have is a system to observe weather  
changes, ``and the big swings in weather from day to day are easy 
to catch,'' Trenberth said. ``But for climate, we are interested in 
more subtle changes from year to year, especially trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Climate change has become a hot topic in recent years, with the  
growing fear that rising levels of certain chemicals in the 
atmosphere could trap additional heat from the sun and cause 
Earth's temperature to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of collecting accurate data was illustrated just  
last month: Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration announced that last year was the hottest on record. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two groups came up with different numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	Data provided by NASA researchers indicated an average 1998  
worldwide temperature of about 58.5 degrees Fahrenheit, topping 
1995 as the record year. 
</P>
<P>
	But NOAA said 1998's global average was 58.1 degrees, topping  
1997, which it calculated as the previous record year. 
</P>
<P>
	Climate studies are based on information collected for  
day-to-day weather reporting and forecasting, a system not always 
adequate for long-term analysis, the new report warns. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other sciences where strict laboratory controls are the  
rule, climate scientists have to rely on observations collected in 
different countries and using different instruments, said Thomas R. 
Karl, chairman of the committee that prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Adequate weather and climate records go back just over a century  
in the United States and not much longer elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	During that period, instruments for measuring temperature,  
humidity and wind have changed constantly. While each new 
generation of tools is hailed as an improvement, readings may not 
be consistent with the items they replace. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems even occur with the most modern observing machines,  
satellites, Trenberth said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the NOAA-11 satellite collected temperature data  
for more than five years, but during that time its orbit shifted 
slightly. The result was that at the beginning NOAA-11 passed over 
a certain area at 1 p.m., for example, but by the end was looking 
at that spot at 5 p.m., local time. Temperature readings thus would 
not be consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the problem is international, the research council, an arm  
of the independent National Academy of Sciences, which advises the 
government, faults the U.S. government for not coordinating climate 
studies nor having one agency organize the data and make sure 
information is consistent for this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, changes would mean being more careful in collecting  
information and making sure that when instrument changes are made, 
both systems are used together for a time to measure differences in 
their readings.

<HEADLINE> Akron Back on Top for Goodyear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Rubber City has bounced back on top -- at  
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Akron, once known as the ``Rubber Capital of the World,''  
welcomed Wednesday's announcement that Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. 
is forming an alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries 
Ltd., making it once again the leader in the tire industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'd be nice to be known as the headquarters of the largest  
tire manufacturer again,'' said Donald Williams, 48, while waiting 
for a cup of coffee Wednesday at his East Side Cafe near Goodyear's 
world headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Akron grew because of the tire companies. We've lost some of  
that nostalgia and I don't think the announcement will bring it 
back, but I think it'll be an asset,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams reminisced about life in Akron decades ago when the  
city was home to all four of the world's largest tire 
manufacturers: Goodyear, BFGoodrich, Firestone and General Tire. 
</P>
<P>
	During its heyday in the 1940s, the companies employed nearly  
82,000 workers in their plants and the Goodyear Aircraft Corp. The 
factories belched out black smoke and soot and caused the city to 
reek of rubber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever we'd go somewhere, we could tell we were getting near  
home because of the smell. It smelled like rotten eggs 
everywhere,'' said John Smith, 37, general manager of the 
146-year-old East Akron Cemetery. The cemetery, across the street 
from Goodyear, is filled with headstones that were darkened by 
lampblack, the dirt from carbon black that gives tires their color. 
</P>
<P>
	Akron's rubber empire started to crumble in the 1970s and '80s  
when the tire companies started moving their plants to the South 
where labor was cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Goodrich became the first company to stop making tires  
in Akron, and Goodyear and Firestone quickly followed. The city 
lost its last tire plant in 1982 when General Tire shut down 
operations, leaving 1,200 employees without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Goodyear closed down its last Akron tire plant in  
1978, it kept its world headquarters there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else moved out. At least Goodyear is still here,''  
said Richard Johnson, 64, who worked for Goodyear Aerospace for 31 
years and still gets a thrill out of seeing the Goodyear blimp fly 
around town. He grew up in Goodyear Heights, the community created 
by Goodyear co-founder F.A. Seiberling so his workers could have 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear is currently the third-largest tire manufacturer and  
will become the largest when its $1 billion alliance with Sumitomo 
takes effect Sept. 1. It's a title the company hasn't held for more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts cautioned that the No. 1 honor might be temporary  
as Goodyear's rivals -- such as Japan's Bridgestone Corp. and 
Michelin SA of France -- consider their own alliances with smaller 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Bryne, an economist at the University of Akron who has  
tracked the rubber industry since the 1980s, said being at the top 
of the $70 billion tire industry will do little to enhance Akron's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it means anything,'' he said. ``This is just  
their way of puffing up their chests. It will give the city a great 
sense of security and bragging rights, but that's about all.''

<HEADLINE> Hyde's District Split on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMHURST, Ill. (AP) -- This is Henry Hyde territory. The  
affluent, overwhelmingly white, heavily Republican suburb of 
Chicago has helped make Hyde's seat in Congress a permanent fixture 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	So it comes as something of a shock to hear some locals offer  
critical comments about the way their congressman has handled 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think the process is taking too long. Nobody really  
cares anymore,'' said Matt Earls, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs that Hyde's role as chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee and leader of the impeachment trial is not 
sitting well with the voters back home in DuPage County, where most 
of Hyde's district is located. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Chicago Tribune poll showed 52 percent of registered  
voters in the county approved of the way Hyde has handled the 
impeachment process. While many politicians might consider that a 
ringing endorsement, DuPage is almost as solidly Republican as 
Chicago is Democratic -- the county regularly produces one of the 
nation's largest GOP pluralities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole won DuPage in the 1996 election, and George Bush won it  
in 1992. In fact, the only Democrat to win the county in this 
decade was former Sen. Paul Simon, who accomplished the feat in 
1990 -- by a scant 1,052 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage  
points, also showed many DuPage voters -- nearly 60 percent -- 
approve of the job Clinton has done as president and 89 percent 
believe Democrats and Republicans should work together to resolve 
the issue. The telephone poll of 450 registered voters was 
conducted Jan. 26-28 by Market Shares Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As Martin Blackwell waited for a train on York Road, he said he  
believed Hyde was ``doing what his job is to do, which is to be 
partisan. I don't hold it against him personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said Hyde's response to the revelation that he had  
an extramarital affair had lowered his opinion of the congressman. 
Hyde chalked it up to ``youthful indiscretions'' when an Internet 
magazine reported details of the affair, which took place when he 
was a 41-year-old state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I think he's a tad bit hypocritical. I'm 30. Does  
that give me another 12 years to cheat on my wife?'' Blackwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, Joan Hogan was effusive in her praise of Hyde,  
DuPage County and Elmhurst, a neatly groomed middle-class bedroom 
community about 16 miles from Chicago's Loop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best politicians,'' Ms. Hogan, owner of Let's Have  
a Party, said. ``Why would we want to change that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant, said Hyde's district  
is so heavily Republican that he is likely to coast to re-election 
again, as he did last fall, if he chooses to run in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it represents a significant danger for him. A  
lot of people are disagreeing with him on this, but they're not 
likely to vote Democratic next time,'' Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans with less lopsided districts should be worried,  
however, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means there are people with a lot smaller bases than  
Henry's who are in danger,'' Rose said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite exuberant U.S. economic growth that  
showed no sign of slowing as the year began, Federal Reserve 
policy-makers decided against raising short-term interest rates on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with the continuing spread of world financial turmoil  
and the renewed risk it could spillover into the United States, 
they concluded a two-day, closed-door meeting by leaving the 
benchmark rate on overnight loans unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been at that level -- a four-year low -- since Nov. 17. The  
Fed lowered it from 5.5 percent in three quarter-point moves over a 
seven-week span to insulate the U.S. economy from the turmoil then 
rocking financial markets following the collapse of the Russian 
ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase would have produced higher rates on a variety of  
business and consumer loans ranging from credit-card balances to 
car loans. The decision to forgo one was widely expected, and the 
stock market showed little reaction. The Dow Jones industrial 
average, up about 70 points before the Fed announcement, closed up 
93 points at 9,367. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are divided about the future course of interest rate  
policy. Some, including Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, 
anticipate no change in rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth is certainly too strong to justify any easing,'' he  
said. ``At the same time, the complete lack of inflation, not to 
mention the ongoing global crisis, make a tightening both 
unnecessary and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others believe the inflationary threat posed to wages and  
eventually prices by shortages of skilled workers will prompt the 
Fed to raise rates later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Tim O'Neill, of the Bank of Montreal, said the spread  
of financial turmoil to Brazil last month, forcing the sharp 
devaluation of its currency, has only delayed Fed action. He 
predicted the central bank would increase the benchmark rate to 6 
percent by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed will tighten ... once price pressures mount and the  
global economy recovers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slowing, as anticipated, the economy accelerated  
during the final three months of last year. It grew at a 5.6 
percent annual rate, the most in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the Fed has little reason to rein in growth because  
inflation shows no sign of worsening appreciably. Consumer prices 
rose just 1.6 percent last year, the smallest rise in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In congressional testimony last month, Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan said the economy ``has continued to grow more rapidly 
than can be accommodated on an ongoing basis.'' He said the growth 
continued to shrink the pool of available workers and, under those 
conditions, labor costs cannot be expected to remain in check 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But one problem for policy-makers is that an increase in rates  
could touch off a sharp drop in the U.S. stock market. That, in 
turn, could quickly depress consumer spending, which accounts for 
two-thirds of economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Fresno State Player Gets Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Avondre Jones is getting yet another  
chance to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	After being sentenced Wednesday to six months in jail for  
threatening a man with a Samurai sword, a judge granted the former 
Fresno State player's request for time to work out a new basketball 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has until March 7 to turn himself in, allowing him a  
chance to possibly get in the lineup for the Fort Wayne Fury of the 
Continental Basketball Association before he begins his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, last year's starting center for the Bulldogs, has a  
contract through the end of the season with the team, according to 
an agent who testified in Fresno County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He indicated that (the team) is very high on him and want the  
best for him, and they're prepared to act as a caretaker through 
the period of probation,'' said Public Defender Ralph Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Jones begin playing, Public Defender Ralph Torres also  
said he may even seek a type of alternative work-furlough sentence. 
Under such a program, defendants can be credited for jail time as 
long as they go to work each day and comply with other conditions 
of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he starts playing and has a job, we're going to ask the  
court if he can remain out and continue playing basketball,'' 
Torres said. ``But I'm not sure if it's available to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, even Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian -- who  
testified on behalf of Jones during trial and is all for second and 
even third chances -- has his doubts whether Jones can stay the 
course this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's dug a real hole for himself. Now we just have to see if  
he's man enough to crawl out of that hole. It's not going to be 
easy,'' Tarkanian said. ``It's always been up to him. He's always 
had God-given talent. When you get to that level, you have to be 
totally focused on doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and recruit Kenny Brunner were arrested in March, accused  
of threatening Colin DeForrest with a gun, beating him with Samurai 
swords and stealing his camera and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred just hours after the Bulldogs beat Memphis  
in the NIT and a day after Fresno State officials slammed CBS' ``60 
Minutes'' for focusing on the legal and drug troubles of the 
school's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	A different judge dropped the case against Brunner, dismissing  
charges of assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, grand theft and 
making terrorist threats. Brunner attends Santa Monica, Calif., 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted in December of one felony count of  
possessing a firearm while on probation, two misdemeanor counts of 
brandishing a deadly weapon in a rude and offensive manner and a 
single misdemeanor count of marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted on six of the charges, including theft,  
extortion and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresno County Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Kane focused  
mainly on Jones' probation violations in sentencing him to the 
six-month term, to be followed by three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also was ordered to pay a $200 restitution fine and a $100  
fine for marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Doug Treisman said the sentence was fair, given the  
fact that the Jones had been acquitted of an assault charge.
