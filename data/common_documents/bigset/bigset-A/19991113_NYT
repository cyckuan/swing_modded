WHEN THE CHARISMA OF THE CITY STEALS THE LIMELIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)

 Graham Fuller is the executive editor of Interview magazine and
editor of ``Loach on Loach,'' about the director Ken Loach.   Faber

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's home sweet home this movie season for some, but not all,
directors who have their eyes fixed on city life. In ``Bringing Out
the Dead,'' Martin Scorsese depicts Manhattan as an update on
Pandaemonium _ the capital of hell in Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' _
as he did in ``Taxi Driver.''
</P>
<P>
   In one bravura nighttime shot, filmed from the perspective of an
ambulance driver (Nicolas Cage) losing his grip on reality,
Scorsese turned the camera over to give the impression of what it's
like to career sideways down Ninth Avenue, ``unbalanced'' being the
requisite point of view.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Liberty Heights,'' Barry Levinson peers back with
bittersweet nostalgia at the Baltimore of the 1950s, as he did in
his first feature, ``Diner.'' Even as it says good riddance to
racial segregation, the new film laments the passing of a world in
which burlesque shows were havens for lonely men and a Jewish
paterfamilias might slip out of the synagogue on Rosh Hashana for a
private showing of the latest Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   These directors are on safe territory, even if Scorsese's
Manhattan is more luridly dystopic than ever. Woody Allen, until
recently that least movable of Manhattanites, has meanwhile taken a
road trip. Having allowed himself to be filmed touring Europe with
his jazz combo in the 1998 documentary ``Wild Man Blues,'' Allen
has now made the shaggy-dog story ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' which gads
about America in the company of a self-deluding jazz guitarist
(Sean Penn).
</P>
<P>
   The movie visits New York briefly, but the city is not the
centripetal force it has been in a majority of . Allen's pictures
since ``Annie Hall'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   The directorial profession is wide enough to encompass wanderers
and regionalists, pastoralists and city rats. ``We're all
gypsies,'' the nomadic David Lean said in a 1985 interview, but
some directors repeatedly gravitate toward their old metropolitan
haunts, even if most eventually range beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee, Hal Hartley and Abel Ferrara are other directors
proffering radically opposed visions of New York. John Waters
presents a camp alternative to Levinson's Baltimore and Gus Van
Sant a poetic Portland, Ore., Further afield, there is Pedro
Almodovar's melodramatic Madrid, Terence Davies' working-class
Liverpool and Wong-kar Wai's kinetic Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there was Rene Clair's studio-rendered Paris;
Marcel Pagnol's Marseilles of boule, pastis and the waterfront;
Federico Fellini's circuslike Rome and Yasujiro Ozu's middle-class
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Some film cities are best represented by one or two indelible
visions: Carol Reed's labyrinthine postwar Vienna in ``The Third
Man''; Alfred Hitchcock's dreamy, deceptively manicured San
Francisco in ``Vertigo''; Francis Ford Coppola's illusory Las Vegas
in ``One From the Heart'' and Mike Figgis' Stygian equivalent in
``Leaving Las Vegas''; Volker Schlondorff's Beirut of political and
sexual treachery in ``Circle of Deceit'' and Ziad Doueri's version
of the same wartorn city in the recent ``West Beirut''; Goran
Paskaljevic's necropolitan Belgrade in ``The Powder Keg,'' and Wim
Wenders' celestial Berlin in ``Wings of Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wenders is modern cinema's ultimate global citizen, as
promiscuously cosmopolitan as Woody Allen is supposedly a one-city
guy. Defying the conventional wisdom that a film should be set in a
single arena, Wenders originally planned to shoot his 1991
science-fiction road movie ``Until the End of the World'' in 28
cities in 17 countries. (He eventually settled for seven cities and
the Australian outback.)
</P>
<P>
   His films consistently grapple with how the here-and-now of
cities like Berlin, Tokyo, Lisbon and Los Angeles interact with
their pasts, and how that confluence affects their denizens. ``In
many respects, cities have their own character,'' he said in 1989,
``so for me they become like having another star actor in a film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wings of Desire'' (1988), which represented a spiritual
homecoming for Wenders after seven years of voluntary exile in
America, is his quest for the soul of Berlin and, by extension,
what remained of the German soul four decades after the war. It
follows the fortunes of two unemployed guardian angels as they
glide down to Berlin's autobahns and subways, its apartments and
the wastelands by the wall, where they tune in to the innermost
anxieties of the city's fretting populace.
</P>
<P>
   As bound up as we are in the angels' desire to become mortal,
they are primarily conduits for a metaphysical meditation on the
film's mutating central character: Berlin itself. There is the
sense that the city is itself telling the story and, as Wenders has
suggested, that the citizens observed by the angels do not live in
Berlin as much as Berlin lives in them. By the end of this
remarkable film and its weaker 1993 sequel, ``Faraway, So Close,''
even the angels have been absorbed into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders has spoken tenderly of the stretches of wasteland shown
in ``Wings of Desire,'' some of which the film memorialized before
they were turned into formal gardens. He was expressing that a
city's history is told as much by the gaps between buildings as by
its architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leigh has also made significant use of forgotten tracts of
land, as well as the gaps between buildings, to staggering effect.
Although Leigh is celebrated for his anthropologically based
satires with their acid and compassionate observations of British
manners, the visual fabric of his films is frequently neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one else has done as much to put contemporary London and
its class divisions on the screen in the last 20 years, and
certainly not with his deep understanding of how its physical and
emotional topography are one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   A grandchild of Jules Dassin's ``Night and the City'' (1950), .
Leigh's ``Naked'' follows the rake's progress of Johnny (David
Thewlis), an overly articulate 30-ish Northerner burdened with
existential angst, who rambles nocturnally through London's
labyrinths in a doomed attempt to penetrate his own addled psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Like film noir heroes, he is guided by women, the usual crop of
deadly Circes and benevolent Beatrices. He treats them cruelly or
kindly, according to his whim. He buys one of them, a homeless
Scottish lass separated from her boyfriend, a consoling cup of tea.
But then the boyfriend turns up and begins kicking her.

STARS' NIEUWENDYK REGAINS HIS FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The average human brain weighs 46 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Joe Nieuwendyk felt like his weighed 46 pounds as
thoughts of a lackluster power play, a .500 record and his scoring
struggles were heaped on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the problems that are going on I got affected
by,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Then, you start to lose some things that
are good in your game, not just confidence, but perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said what was once lost has been found, and with that
perspective has come his Conn Smythe Trophy-winning form of a
couple of months ago. He has a goal and three assists in the past
two games after having a goal and five assists in his first 12.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, however, said the much-needed perspective wasn't
found on the fourth line, where he was demoted by Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No, perspective was found by having a quiet conversation with
himself and a few close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some things to sort out in my own mind and in my own
game that only I could deal with,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I feel
really focused and really energized now. I think I just had to
focus on a lot of positive things because I think a lot of the
things around here have been negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The negative thoughts were what had been filling his brain and
what demanded the dose of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 8-8-1 start to this season is hard to swallow for a
team that has won the Presidents' Trophy in back-to-back seasons
and didn't lose its eighth game last season until Jan. 18. Yes, a
single goal in the first 12 games is hard to stomach for
Nieuwendyk, who scored 11 in the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Nieuwendyk couldn't solve it all by himself and he
certainly wasn't going to do it by worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the last couple of games, we talked about just really
concentrating on his game and that's all he can do,'' Stars forward
Mike Keane said. ``He worries about a lot of things that he doesn't
have to worry about. That's just him. He's a sensitive, caring
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the rare athlete who is quiet and shy, who thinks rather
than speaks and takes just about everything to heart.
</P>
<P>
   So nobody really knew what Nieuwendyk's reaction would be when
Hitchcock bumped him down to his fourth line between young winger
Keith Aldridge and resident enforcer Chris Murray with a pointed
remark _ ``He's not playing that well. Other people are'' _ before
Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' Hitchcock admitted, when asked if he had been
concerned about how Nieuwendyk might react. ``But at the end of
day, if those two guys \RNieuwendyk and Mike Modano\S aren't going
well, we struggle. We need both of them to be effective every game
rather than have them be in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the shock of being switched around has an effect.
... All I know is Joe has been a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said all it took was taking some things off his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts cleared, Nieuwendyk has gotten back to playing a
style of game that helped him win a Conn Smythe Trophy. He
practiced with Modano and Brett Hull on the Stars' first line
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we have a lot of work to do as a team, but those
are some of the things that I can't worry about,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``I have to concentrate on what I have to do right now and,
hopefully, it will make the team better as well. I think,
regardless of what happens, I understand what I have to do now and
that's to play the game the way I know how.''  &LR; subheds:Christie
sent down The Stars sent forward Ryan Christie back to their
International Hockey League affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings,
yesterday. He was called up Nov. 4 and played in three games for
the Stars without recording a point.

COWBOYS' DEFENSE NEEDS STRONG SHOWING AGAINST PACKERS
</HEADLINE>
 For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' defense, with injury problems of
its own, suddenly finds itself on the hot seat tomorrow against
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a Cowboys offense _ without Troy Aikman
(concussion), Emmitt Smith (broken hand) or Michael Irvin (bruised
spinal cord) _ is not expected to put up many points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely is in the back of everybody's mind,'' Cowboys
defensive lineman Alonzo Spellman said. ``These are guys who have
led this team to \Rthree Super Bowl\S championships, but we need to
go and get it done without them. I think they'd even say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett will make his eighth NFL career start at
quarterback. His backup is Mike Quinn, whose NFL dossier includes
four brief regular-season appearances in three NFL seasons. The No.
3 quarterback tomorrow is tight end Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren will be making his first NFL start since 1997 with
Seattle, replacing Smith as the featured runner, as well as keeping
his own third-down back responsibilities. Fullback Robert Thomas
and Bjornson could be used in third-down situations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is a lot of pressure on our defense and
special teams in this game,'' owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Because even though the Packers aren't the Super Bowl Packers of
two and three years ago, they still have three-time league MVP
Brett Favre at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Favre will be starting in his 118th consecutive game, an NFL
record for quarterbacks he established last weekend. It's a bad
time to be needy in the secondary, but that's the case for the
Cowboys going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Out is nickel safety Izell Reese, whose magnetic resonance
imaging results came back, and he has a herniated disk in his neck.
Probably out is cornerback Kevin Mathis (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at least doubtful now,'' coach Chan Gailey said after
Mathis failed to practice all week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders managed a limited workout
yesterday, but is still listed as questionable. Without him, the
Cowboys would be faced with a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked very similar to last week \Rin practice\S, although
that's not necessarily a good thing,'' Gailey said. ``Is the glass
half empty or half full? It's good that he's out here moving around
at all. Now if he's out one game totally, how appreciably better
does he get? At the same time, if it doesn't make an appreciable
difference, then do you play him and let him slowly get better?''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith (bruised knee/questionable) is expected
to start, which leaves Duane Hawthorne as the only healthy
cornerback on the team. Singor Mobley will be elevated to nickel
back in Reese's absence and newcomer Chris Akins may see some time
in nickel packages. CHAN'S CHAGRIN
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey spoke out on the
``light'' fine of $7,500 assessed to Minnesota defensive end Duane
Clemons for punching Cowboys offensive tackle Flozell Adams in the
groin Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey plans to notify the NFL office of his objection, although
that won't be necessary after what he said yesterday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed. I thought that merited a much
tougher penalty. I don't think we can condone that in any way,
shape or form in the league. And if we go that light on \Rthe
fine\S, then we're not condemning it. I thought it was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also was critical of how ``arbitrary'' NFL fines can be,
suggesting that the league office decided this week, ``We like
Minnesota,'' then adding, ``I don't think it's right. And if it's
not right, I'll say what I feel.'' nn

TRENT-LESS MAVERICKS LACK INSIDE PUNCH (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Just six games into the NBA season it is already clear
to Don Nelson that his team won't be winning many games as long as
power forward Gary Trent is in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Without Trent, the Mavericks' low-post scoring attack has become
as endangered as the whooping crane.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for the jump-shooting Mavericks to twice beat
Golden State with Trent out nursing a slightly strained left
hamstring. But the difficulty increases when the Mavericks are
going up against talent-laden teams such as Seattle, the Los
Angeles Lakers (twice) and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the Mavericks coach and general manager, said the
Mavericks have become basically a jump-shooting team without Trent
working in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't forget that we've got basically no inside game
without Gary Trent in the lineup,'' Nelson said. ``He was our most
valuable player last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really as simple as we need to establish a low game
somewhere, and we just can't seem to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent was injured Oct. 21 in a preseason game against Toronto.
The earliest Trent is expected to return is Nov. 23 at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While the players admit they miss Trent, they are growing tired
of his absence being used as an excuse for the team's performance.
After all, the Mavericks did win a pair of games without Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had time to prepare without him,'' Finley said. ``It
wouldn't hurt to have a low-post threat, but we've got to go with
what you're dealt. It was cool when we were winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Centers Sean Rooks (3.2 points per game) and Shawn Bradley (5.5
ppg) have not been effective inside. But in the Mavericks' up-tempo
offense, the centers don't get a lot of looks at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   FINLEY IN PAIN?
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson said it was ``painful'' to watch Michael Finley
struggle with a 2-of-8 shooting, four-point showing in Thursday's
loss to the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Finley said it was painful to sit on the bench in the second
half for all but the first three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still anxious to play, but it was a coach's decision,''
Finley said. ``I only took eight shots. But life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley has had a sore right heel for the past month. Nelson said
the logical thing to do would be to rest Finley for a while, but
the team medical staff told him it's not going to hurt the heel if
he continues to play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson, ``We're getting down to the nitty-gritty here as
far as talent goes. Without him being very good, and without Gary,
our talent base is very low right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley insists he was slightly hobbling on the court at times
against Miami just like he was slightly hobbling on the court when
the Mavericks defeated Golden State on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my shot's not falling and the team's not doing well, it
might stand out even more,'' Finley said. ``But when we were
winning and I was rolling offensively, my mannerisms were the
same.'' nn

 UNDATED: kicking her.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of protecting her, Johnny wheels away in a single
forlorn movement on the piece of empty ground on which he is
standing. Where is he? Surely there are no bomb sites left in
London. The empty space Johnny is occupying is, of course, the void
between people, their failure to connect.
</P>
<P>
   In Leigh's latest film, ``Topsy- Turvy,'' set in London in 1884
and shot mostly in interiors, the librettist W.S. Gilbert (Jim
Broadbent) leaves the theater where his and Arthur Sullivan's
``Mikado'' is about to open. Lurching down an alley, he is clawed
at and propositioned by several wretched women.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this nightmarish interlude tells us about Gilbert's
inner turmoil, this dab of Dickens puts into a social context the
rarefied world of theatrical artifice in which the film is
unfolding; it is Leigh's reminder to the audience that there is a
grim reality beyond the world of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence mirrors the opening of ``Naked,'' in which Johnny
angrily copulates with a woman in a Manchester alleyway. But the
film remains there only for the time it takes him to abandon her
and head for London. Leigh, who has not made an entire film outside
London since he went to Belfast for ``Four Days in July'' (1984),
exults in London's places _ dark and light _ and its people, and he
relishes probing (and sometimes filling) the gaps between them. It
is hard to imagine London, dour and sluggish as it is beyond its
center, getting to him in the same way Manhattan's supercaffeinated
energy appears to have done recently _ superficially, at least _ to
its cinematic champion.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen has been escaping New York a lot lately. ``Mighty
Aphrodite'' took flights of fancy to ancient Greece and ``Everyone
Says I Love You'' to Venice and Paris. ``Deconstructing Harry''
culminated in a desperate flight upstate, making a quick detour to
hell en route. Allen's ``Celebrity'' sent its main character on a
humiliating side trip to Atlantic City, and the Manhattan it showed
was a treacherous black-and-white film noir city, its slick,
shimmering streets redolent of those in Alexander Mackendrick's
``Sweet Smell of Success,'' the most baleful image of Manhattan on
film.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years before ``Celebrity,'' Allen filmed ``Manhattan,''
in black and white. Its evocative opening sequence is a montage of
lambently photographed vistas, galvanizingly scored to ``Rhapsody
in Blue'' with Allen contributing a voice-over paean to the city.
Although that film, like ``Celebrity,'' was the story of a
self-deceiving writer led astray by the wrong woman , it revealed
Allen's inviolable love of New York at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're not sure what the artist in him thinks of the city.
But New York is a habit he can't break. Not one scene of ``Sweet
and Lowdown'' was shot more than an hour outside Manhattan. And
when he learned I was writing this article, he passed on the
message that he one day hopes to shoot an out-and-out Western
without leaving Manhattan at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a relief to find Allen exploring what passes for
Chicago, Los Angeles and the American hinterland in ``Sweet and
Lowdown,'' which has delightful scenes in provincial speak-easies,
at a rural gas station, on a Hollywood set, and on a New Jersey
boardwalk where you can feel the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The film is more relaxed than anything else Allen has made in
the 90s. He should get out of New York more often _ maybe go on a
safari to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese exhibits a less ambiguous relationship with New York.
Ever since he recreated Lower East Side street life in ``Who's That
Knocking at My Door?'' (1968), he has reveled in depicting the most
depraved, squalid and dehumanizing aspects of the city. Scorsese's
city of earthly degradations embraces the infested 42nd Street of
``Taxi Driver,'' the fetid animal pen that is the Bronx of ``Raging
Bull,'' the claustrophobic SoHo loft world of ``After Hours,'' the
nouveau riche Mafia enclaves of East Brooklyn in ``Goodfellas,''
the mansions of malice in the 19th-century Upper East Side of ``The
Age of Innocence'' and now Hell's Kitchen in ``Bringing Out the
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a New York that throbs with physical and emotional
violence yet is never less than beautiful _ in the same way that
nightmares can be beautiful, and Goya's paintings and Edgar Allan
Poe's short stories. In the most startling image in ``Bringing Out
the Dead,'' a drug dealer impaled on a railing hangs off a balcony
hundreds of feet above the city.
</P>
<P>
   It's an atrocity, but we cannot help admiring the view, a field
of black velvet studded with jewels. The shot grows intrinsically
out of the story, just one image in a phantasmagoria that provokes
Cage's character to rescue a comatose patient's daughter as he
travels through the bloody, garbage-heaped canyons.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' that other recent fable of
a medical man seeking women to save or seduce on the island of lost
souls, was, by contrast, passive. Stanley Kubrick's direction never
transcended the distinct Old Europeanness of the source novella, as
was evident in the film's sets of a Greenwich Village that
resembles the real place but lacks its Eurotrashy bohemianism.
Irrespective of its flora and fauna, the dramatic milieu Kubrick
created was tangential to the film's forward action.
</P>
<P>
   In all these movies, the city is more than mere backdrop; it is
the hero's adversary, of which the siren, the damsel in distress,
the opponent (pimp, crime lord, drug dealer, socialite), even the
mother who appears as a hectoring giantess on the Manhattan skyline
in Woody Allen's segment of ``New York Stories,'' are mere
operatives.
</P>
<P>
   They _ the people, whether flesh or fantasy _ embody the cities
that issue them like genies. And perhaps the most authentic film
city of all is the most genielike: the mirage of Las Vegas in ``One
From the Heart,'' which in its sublime studio artifice replicates
the real Vegas better than any documentary could.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, all film cities, made not of concrete and
steel and blood and bone but of moments of time that have already
passed, are phantoms _ projections of those fears and desires that
each of us carries onto the real mean streets every day.

DUVAL-COUPLES TEAM LEADS BY FIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ They say you can't win a golf tournament on the
first day, but Fred Couples and David Duval gave it their best try
in Friday's opening round of the Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout
at Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in alternate stroke _ supposedly the most difficult of
the three formats in this annual two-man team event _ Couples and
Duval eagled their second hole, stood 6-under par after seven holes
and cruised home at 11-under 61, good for a five-stroke lead that
is the biggest first-round advantage in Shootout history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just our day,'' said Couples after he and Duval
threatened the Shootout first-round record of 59 and finished well
ahead of the runner-up teams of Jay Haas/Andrew Magee, Scott
Hoch/Scott McCarron and Peter Jacobsen/John Cook, all at 66.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon/Jeff Sluman shot 67, and defending champs Greg Norman
and Steve Elkington finished 69 on a day dominated by Couples and
Duval, who finished with nine birdies, an eagle and no bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone six or seven stokes back can catch them _ which
looks like everybody,'' McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   At that, team Couples/Duval might have done better.
</P>
<P>
   Their 7-under-par total on the front nine followed a missed
birdie putt on No. 8 from eight feet _ relatively short considering
they rolled in five longer attempts, including two 20-foot birdies
putts and Duval's 15-footer for eagle on No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Couples said one early putt may have ignited their record start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best putt was (Duval's near-seven-footer for birdie) on
No. 5,'' Couples said. ``If he lipped it out it could have gone
eight feet past... that just kept our round going.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples gave most of the credit to Duval: ``Basically, he did
all the putting and when I was in trouble he hit some very good
drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Their round was four strokes off the tournament alternate-stroke
record of 57, set by Couples and Ray Floyd in 1990, when alternate
stroke was played in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Couples felt he and Duval had a chance to press that
14-under-par record when they got to 8-under after 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on our way,'' he said. ``We were holing shots out of
traps and he was chipping in.''
</P>
<P>
   They settled for the biggest first-round lead since eventual
champions Curtis Strange and Mark O'Meara opened 4-under in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough for Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we won the golf tournament today,'' he said,
``but we took a nice step toward doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Their strong showing did not surprise their closest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Haas, who suspected Couples/Duval might be
the team to beat as soon as he saw the pairings. ``We're just
trying to stay within range of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Magee remained close thanks to a 4-under back nine that
included a 40-foot birdie putt by Haas. But Magee said a
more-important putt may have been a 15-footer to save bogey on No.
2, preventing a 2-over start.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron and Hoch stayed within five strokes despite a bogey in
their seven-birdie round.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen and Cook, who combined to tie the tournament
single-round record of 55 in scramble play last year, had six
birdies and no bogeys Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams were Duffy Waldorf/Glen Day (70), Chip Beck/John
Daly and Corey Pavin/Steve Pate (both 71), Carlos Franco/Olin
Browne (72), Craig Stadler/Tom Kite (74) and Ben Crenshaw/Bruce
Lietzke (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot 6 under and that's a good score,'' McCarron said. ``If
you get to 8 under, you feel you're up on the game. Eleven under in
this format is really good _ (begin ital)really(end ital) good.''

<P>
   Everyone knew that the trial of Microsoft initiated by America's
Justice Department had gone badly for the software giant. But the
language of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ``findings of fact''
was still amazing in its severity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that Microsoft had used its prodigious
market power and immense profits to stifle innovation and to harm
both consumers and any companies that dared to compete with it.
</P>
<P>
   But, devastating though this picture of Microsoft is, there is
still a long way to go. The judge has yet to assess whether the
firm breached antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   If he thinks it did, a separate hearing will decide remedies,
with the Justice Department proposing and Judge Jackson disposing.
After that, Microsoft can appeal, all the way to the Supreme Court
if need be.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken two years to get this far. Allowing for normal
legal delays, it could take another two before anything horrid is
done to Bill Gates's company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Joel Klein, the department's antitrust boss, now knows
is that the judge's findings will form an unshakeable framework for
the conclusion of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals courts cannot question Judge Jackson's assessment of the
credibility of testimony. So powerful is his portrayal of Microsoft
as a relentless and predatory monopolist that his verdict, when it
comes, will be very hard to overturn.
</P>
<P>
   As one antitrust expert put it this week: ``Judge Jackson has
poured a lot of concrete here.''
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the even harder part. Showing that Microsoft is a
monopoly with a baleful influence over the computer industry is one
thing; deciding what to do about it is something else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the findings mean that nothing in the way of
remedies is off the table, including a breakup of the company. That
gives Klein great scope, but it does not solve three big problems
he faces.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the pace of change in the industry is so
rapid. Even after the judge's findings, some commentators still
argue that no remedial action is necessary; the future, they say,
is with the Internet and the Internet is fundamentally hostile to
vendor monopolies of critical infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its egregious business practices, they note, Microsoft
has been unable to extend its dominance to the web.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has indeed fostered the growth of server-based
computing, which reduces the importance of the client (PC)
operating system; as well as open-source software, such as Linux,
that is nibbling at Windows's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Judge Jackson points out, ``the fact that these new
paradigms exist in embryonic form does not prevent Microsoft from
enjoying monopoly power today,'' or, he maintains, for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's huge profits (more than those of the world's next
500 software firms combined) and its lofty share price hardly point
to a firm about to be knocked off its pedestal by technological
change. Rather, they suggest that Microsoft has exploited its
monopoly to slow down innovation by rivals, thereby causing real
economic damage. So remedial action is called for.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein's second problem is that Microsoft has shown itself to
be adept at circumventing past attempts to curb its excesses. To
devise ``conduct remedies'' to restrain a firm as clever and as
aggressive as Microsoft, without the need for constant and
intrusive policing, may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be said, for example, for preventing Microsoft
from entering into the kind of exclusive contracts that curtailed
Netscape's access to its market, and for making its pricing
policies public and nondiscriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is now insufficient for the Justice Department simply to
have yet another go at modifying Microsoft's behavior. That points
to structural remedies, which are anyway preferable as a matter of
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Standard Oil case in 1911, the Supreme Court has
held that conduct measures are inadequate when dealing with a
durable and pervasive monopoly. But _ and this is Klein's third big
problem _ some breakup ideas could do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   For example, splitting Microsoft into competing, vertically
integrated firms (the so-called Baby Bills solution) could result
in a balkanization of the software industry and an erosion of the
standards and easy compatibility that consumers want.
</P>
<P>
   So what should Klein suggest? His starting-point must be that
any action should provide consumers with choices they do not have
today, and also stimulate innovation that would have otherwise been
chilled.
</P>
<P>
   One potentially elegant structural solution that stops short of
breaking the firm up would be to force it to publish the full
specifications of the Windows ``application program interfaces''
(APIs), the codes that software firms who want their products to
run on Windows must follow.
</P>
<P>
   IBM spent a fortune in the early 1990s in an attempt to reverse
engineer or ``clone'' these for a rival operating system. But it
could not persuade its customers that it had done enough to run a
critical mass of Windows's applications; and Microsoft, as the
incumbent, was always able to stay one jump ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Were such expense and uncertainty to be removed, IBM might be
tempted back into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Going further, Microsoft could be required to license the source
code for Windows itself to the highest bidders. If that encouraged
the entry of powerful companies such as Sun Microsystems and
Oracle, a main objective of the Justice Department would have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a drawback of both approaches is that they rely on other
firms' appetite for risk-taking. So if after a year, say, no new
entrant had appeared to challenge Microsoft's monopoly, the breakup
option would need to be revived.
</P>
<P>
   There is one version of the Baby Bills that would carry less
risk of perverse unintended consequences: to divide Microsoft into
two or three competing operating-system companies and an
applications company. (The firm's expanding investments in web
services could simply be sold _ the Internet can do very well
without Microsoft's attentions.)
</P>
<P>
   If there were two or three Windows companies, they would have no
incentive to create different APIs, as they would all have a strong
interest in supporting the greatest possible number of Windows
applications.
</P>
<P>
   They would instead compete on price, ease of use, features and
the trade-off between stability and backwards compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining applications firm would, for its part, have an
equal interest in ensuring smooth integration with differing
versions of Windows; and it would want to make both Office and
BackOffice (which includes Microsoft's database product) available
on Linux, the fledgling open-source Windows rival, and on every
flavor of commercial Unix operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The discipline of real competition would thus trigger innovation
and give consumers more choice _ but without jeopardizing the Holy
Grail of interoperability. And without having the government trying
to run a technology industry. &QL;

CAMBY SUSTAINS INJURY AS TIRED KNICKS TUMBLE   TO CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By the grueling end, their blue jerseys were untucked,
their mental edge was rumpled and Marcus Camby was as sedentary as
Patrick Ewing while he watched the misery unfold with his knee
packed in ice.
</P>
<P>
   They were still the New York Knicks in theory, but the same team
that began the season as crisp and fresh as a dry-cleaned shirt
have allowed a miserable string of back-to-back games to alter
their once flawless appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they lost for the third time in their last four
games after shaking the cobwebs from their heads. Only 15 hours
before the Knicks tipped off against the Boston Celtics at the
Fleet Center, their team plane arrived in town with a load of
bone-tired players still feeling the weight of their last-minute
loss in Minnesota. So here it was, a built-in excuse for them to
show up with a droop to their step.
</P>
<P>
   Out of pride, the Knicks were able to minimize the embarrassment
in their 80-74 defeat to the Celtics and even had a chance to win
the game after trailing by 16 points in the third quarter. But
after Latrell Sprewell missed two free throws that would have
pulled the Knicks to one point of the Celtics with 14.4 seconds
left, and after botching five possessions in the final three
minutes, the suspense was over as the Knicks ended their third set
of back-to-back games in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the point where even if you're physically fine to
play, you don't realize it, but mentally you make more mistakes,''
said Allan Houston, who began the night 1-for-7 but finished
6-for-16 with 16 points. ``It's not a conscious thing. But unlike a
regular game, you're not automatically sharp and a step ahead. What
great teams do is they don't let the situation we've been in creep
into their mindset. They fight through it. And that's what we have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks ability to combat their mental fatigue was
severely hampered when Camby, who had flashed some brilliant
moments while filling in for the injured Ewing in the starting
lineup this season, left the game midway through the first quarter
after playing only six minutes. After trainer Mike Saunders worked
on his left knee and iced it through halftime, Camby was not able
to come back. The team is labeling Camby's injury tendinitis, but
Camby isn't so sure. The pain is in the same knee that he had
arthroscopic surgery on when he was at UMass. He will undergo an
MRI on Saturday to determine if there is any damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little pain at the end of the last game,'' said
Camby, who guarded Kevin Garnett in the final moments of the
Knicks' loss in Minnesota on Thursday. ``I went up for a shot, like
the second to last play, the one Garnett blocked, and my knee felt
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to give it a go tonight. But I just couldn't do it.
We're going to look at it again, but I think I'll be OK. I don't
want to miss that game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Camby is not ready, Kurt Thomas or Chris Dudley will likely
start in Camby's place against Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're 4-3,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy reciting a record that
was once 3-0 at the start of the season. ``It's not going to get
any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost like last year. In some ways, these are the
retro-Knicks, the team that stumbled through last year's bevy of
aches and pain and fourth-quarter collapses, barely breaking .500,
before snapping to for the playoffs. The same pattern unfolded
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too good of a team to fall back behind other teams by 10
and 12 points,'' said the point guard Chris Childs, referring to
the deficits that faced the Knicks for three quarters. ``We can't
go back to last year. We know we're better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was proof. There was a last gasp and a desperate push by
players like Thomas, Larry Johnson and Houston to put some drama in
what had been a blowout. But after cutting the Celtics' lead to
77-74 on a jumper by Thomas with 1:59 left in the game, the Knicks
failed to score again.
</P>
<P>
   In those last two minutes, Sprewell had his shot blocked by Paul
Pierce, and Houston was stripped by the Celtics' secret weapon from
the Continental Basketball Association, Adrian Griffin. While the
Celtics were inexplicably missing free throws, Sprewell had a
chance to slice their lead to one point with 14.4 seconds left. As
a part of the Knicks' sluggish 64 percent shooting from the free
throw line, Sprewell missed both of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Sprewell said. ``I hadn't been missing
them. I don't know, the first one went long. And then I think I was
thinking too much on the second one. You have to make those,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Little fell right Friday night. The Knicks ended Friday night
shooting 39.7 percent, with Sprewell making 7-of-20 shots for 14
points and Johnson finishing 4-for-11 and scoring 16 points.
Thomas, whose burst of energy late reinvigorated the Knicks, came
off the bench to replace Camby and scored eight of his 10 points in
the fourth quarter. Perhaps a sign of just how out of it the Knicks
were, the Celtics out-rebounded them Knicks, 49-38.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Camby had been on the floor, things would have been
different. The energy level, the loose balls, everything might have
been given a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Two centers are down now _ Camby and Ewing _ and a team that
began so well is facing some adversity.

tempted back into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Going further, Microsoft could be required to license the source
code for Windows itself to the highest bidders. If that encouraged
the entry of powerful companies such as Sun Microsystems and
Oracle, a main objective of the Justice Department would have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a drawback of both approaches is that they rely on other
firms' appetite for risk-taking. So if after a year, say, no new
entrant had appeared to challenge Microsoft's monopoly, the breakup
option would need to be revived.
</P>
<P>
   There is one version of the Baby Bills that would carry less
risk of perverse unintended consequences: to divide Microsoft into
two or three competing operating-system companies and an
applications company. (The firm's expanding investments in web
services could simply be sold _ the Internet can do very well
without Microsoft's attentions.)
</P>
<P>
   If there were two or three Windows companies, they would have no
incentive to create different APIs, as they would all have a strong
interest in supporting the greatest possible number of Windows
applications.
</P>
<P>
   They would instead compete on price, ease of use, features and
the trade-off between stability and backwards compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining applications firm would, for its part, have an
equal interest in ensuring smooth integration with differing
versions of Windows; and it would want to make both Office and
BackOffice (which includes Microsoft's database product) available
on Linux, the fledgling open-source Windows rival, and on every
flavor of commercial Unix operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The discipline of real competition would thus trigger innovation
and give consumers more choice _ but without jeopardizing the Holy
Grail of interoperability. And without having the government trying
to run a technology industry. &QL;

<P>
   Mexico's political system has long operated under unique rules.
Every six years, in an exercise known as the dedazo _ literally,
``the big finger'' _ the country's president would select one of
his colleagues to be the presidential candidate of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   The chosen one would duly win _ by consent when possible, by
fraud when necessary _ the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   So the PRI's first national primary election, in which 8 million
Mexicans voted last Sunday, marks an innovation, and another
welcome step in Mexico's tortuous evolution to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The primary had a clear winner: with over half the votes,
Francisco Labastida, a former interior minister, was well ahead of
his chief rival, Roberto Madrazo, a maverick former state governor.
Such was the margin of victory that it has been accepted by all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   For the winner, that may prove almost as important as the result
itself. The chances that Madrazo might engineer an electorally
damaging split in the PRI appear to have receded. And since
Mexico's opposition parties have failed to clinch a mooted
alliance, Labastida now looks likely to win the presidential
election next July.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Labastida was the choice of President Ernesto
Zedillo, or so it was said, so skeptics have argued that the
primary was simply a dedazo in democratic disguise.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that Labastida's victory owed much to the party
machine; it may also have been helped, as critics allege, by the
distribution of favors from government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such skepticism misses a wider point. The PRI owes its
position as the world's longest-ruling party to its uncanny ability
to reinvent itself according to Mexico's changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the transition to a politically competitive democracy
with an independent electoral authority has demanded a basic
change: from being the electoral arm of a ruling government
bureaucracy, the PRI has had to turn itself into something much
closer to a conventional political party.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was one product of that change. Labastida himself is
another. He won because many of the stars of Zedillo's government
were barred from seeking the nomination after an unprecedented
rebellion, in 1996, by the party's grass-roots activists, who
imposed the requirement that the presidential candidate should have
held elective office (not just appointed, even ministerial, posts).
</P>
<P>
   Behind this rule lay, too, a backlash against the
market-friendly technocrats who have dominated Mexico's recent
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In Labastida, the PRI appears to have found a candidate well
placed to patch together its technocratic and traditionalist wings.
An economist, though not an American-educated ``neo-liberal'' one,
he is also an experienced politician. He calls himself a
nationalist, but he stands for the continuation of Zedillo's
fiscally responsible economics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the PRI's undoubted success at changing with the times still
leaves Mexico's democratic transition unfinished _ and ironically,
may even make completing it harder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent changes, the boundaries between nation, state
and ruling party remain blurred. And until power starts
alternating, Mexico will not get some of the changes it most
urgently needs.
</P>
<P>
   These include the radical cleansing of its institutions, from
the police force to the body that supervises banking, and the
dismantling of its pervasive networks of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Unless and until it experiences a spell in opposition, the PRI
is likely to remain an unnaturally broad church, a potentially
combustible mix of liberals and national-populists.
</P>
<P>
   It might well be in Mexico's interests for the party to split
into its component parts. But that can hardly be demanded of an
organization which has every reason to imagine that its unity will
guarantee it yet another six years in power _ albeit partly because
of the shortcomings of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Labastida, the PRI appears to have opted for
continued evolutionary change, though probably at a slower pace
than in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   And in the manner of its choice, it has probably ensured that
this is what awaits Mexicans, however much many of them might
justifiably prefer something more speedy and more radical. &QL;

PHILIP MORRIS TO PAY FINE FOR VIOLATING LOBBY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Philip Morris has agreed to pay a $75,000 fine,
the largest ever imposed by state lobbying regulators, for
underreporting the amount of money it spent to lobby New York
lawmakers on tobacco legislation, officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the company's chief lobbyists in the Capitol
has been barred from lobbying on any issue before state government
for three years, as part of a settlement with the Temporary State
Commission on Lobbying. The lobbyist, Sharon Portnoy, a Philip
Morris employee, also agreed to pay $15,000 in fines for her role
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the company is required to disclose all of its
spending on meals and other gifts it gives to lawmakers in an
effort to beat back antismoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties stemmed from 15 instances in which the company
misrepresented its lobbying expenses from 1996 to 1998. As part of
the settlement, the company also agreed to allow the lobbying
commission to audit its disclosure statements periodically over the
next three years, a step the commission cannot generally take under
current law.
</P>
<P>
   While Philip Morris's expenditures were not fully disclosed to
state regulators, they were listed in thousands of pages of company
documents that were released as part of the litigation between the
states and the tobacco industry. A review of the documents
published in The New York Times showed that at least 115 current
and former members of the Legislature accepted gifts including
meals at expensive restaurants and tickets for the United States
Open tennis tournament and other cultural and sports events.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Legislature was considering proposals that
would have weakened or overturned various municipal antismoking
laws. None of the bills passed.
</P>
<P>
   David Grandeau, the commission's executive director, said the
fines were by far the largest the panel had ever imposed on a
lobbyist or its client.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials would not comment on the specifics of their
findings, including the amount by which Philip Morris underreported
its spending. But state records indicate that Ms. Portnoy
underreported the amount she had spent by hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Portnoy stated in her original filings with the commission
that she spent $190,188 on dinners and other gifts for lawmakers
from 1996 to 1998. But in an amended report recently filed with the
lobbying commission as a result of the inquiry, Ms. Portnoy said
her lobbying expenses during the period totaled $522,817.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Friday afternoon, Philip Morris said,
``We are sorry that our reports were false and inaccurate, and we
are examining our internal process to ensure this will not happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Portnoy could not be reached for comment. Peggy Roberts, a
spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said Ms. Portnoy had been placed on
paid leave indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's action was praised by good-government groups.
But they said the fines amounted to little more than a slap on the
wrist to a company as vast and profitable as Philip Morris, and
they renewed their call for stiffer penalties for such violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobbying commission hit Philip Morris as hard as it could
under the current law with one arm tied behind its back,'' said
Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's inquiry into Philip Morris's activities is its
second concerning the tobacco industry in less than a year. Last
December, the Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group, settled a
commission complaint by acknowledging that it had underreported its
lobbying expenses by nearly $450,000 in 1995. The group was not
punished, because lobbyists or clients who admit violating the
disclosure requirements and amend their reports within 15 days are
not fined.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Portnoy's new filings show that she paid for meals worth $75
or more each for 71 legislators; for Robert King, Gov. George
Pataki's budget director; for Peter Delaney, who was the Republican
governor's general services commissioner; and for dozens of
legislative aides, including Patricia Lynch, an adviser to Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest criticism of the Philip Morris settlement came from
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who called it ``horrendous.'' He
said he had called on the commission to refer the matter to him for
a possible criminal investigation. Spitzer could presumably
consider charges involving the filing of false statements or
attempts to cover up the company's violations.

   POINT REYES STATION, CALIF. _ How daring should people be
allowed to be on public land?
</P>
<P>
   A debate has been going on ever since, at the end of October,
Jan Davis jumped to her death from El Capitan, one of the sheer
cliffs of Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis had been trying to prove that parachuting from the
cliffs, which has been banned for years, was safe and should be
allowed. Her husband was filming her as the rip cord on her
parachute failed to open.
</P>
<P>
   She was a grandmother; she was also an experienced practitioner
of so-called BASE (building, antenna, span and earth) jumping, or
parachuting from stationary landmarks, with 3,000 jumps to her
name.
</P>
<P>
   But she had used a borrowed parachute, an older model sometimes
called a ``trash bag,'' so that her own expensive gear would not be
confiscated when park rangers met her at the bottom of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis's death was the second related to BASE jumping in
Yosemite this year, and the sixth in the park since rangers began
counting. Last June, Frank Gambalie successfully jumped from El
Capitan but drowned in the raging Merced River while trying to
escape the rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, the familiar mountain and wilderness
activities such as backpacking and rock-climbing have been joined
by hang gliding, whitewater kayaking, mountain biking,
bungee-jumping and off-road skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   All are dangerous to some degree, and deaths in the national
parks have been attributed to all of them save skateboarding. Yet
all are increasingly shown on television cable channels in programs
such as ESPN's ``X Games,'' and enthusiasm for them is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials are having a hard job deciding which of them
should be banned and which not. The 370 parks in the federal system
can more or less make up their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   At present, BASE jumping is banned in all parks except one: the
New River Gorge National River in West Virginia, where, on the
third Saturday of each October, jumpers can leap the 870 feet from
New River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than 300 jumps were made on ``Bridge Day.''
Adventurers are also allowed, on the same day, to rappel from the
span.
</P>
<P>
   These exceptions are the result of history, bureaucracy and
politics. Parachuting from New River Gorge Bridge, which is
technically not the property of the National Park Service, began
shortly after the bridge opened in 1977, several years before there
was a park.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service took possession of the river below the
bridge, it grandfathered permission for this sort of jumping on one
day of the year after appeals from the local chamber of commerce,
which enjoyed the money of tourists attracted by the
bridge-jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis's leap from El Capitan was made partly to encourage a
similar one-day festival for Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Another adventure sport, hang gliding, has always been allowed
in Yosemite's jagged mountains, as it has been in certain areas of
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in and around San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Yosemite a hang glider ``pilot'' must show an expert's
certificate from the United States Hang Gliding Association in
order to be cleared for a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain biking is allowed on unpaved roads in Canyonlands
National Park in Utah, but not on any trail in Kings Canyon
National Park in California or in Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-country skiing is allowed in most parks in winter, but
this does not necessarily sanction snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   Although jumping off El Capitan with a parachute is illegal,
going up it with ropes and climbing equipment does not even need a
permit _ though climbing accounts for one or two deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite is one of the birthplaces of American rock-climbing,
and as such the activity, like wilderness backpacking, is allowed
in the park by ``historical precedent,'' according to Scott
Gediman, a local spokesman for the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gediman says the service tries to evaluate every sport,
especially new ones, ``on its impact on a park and on other
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite's back country is off-limits to bicycles because no
mechanized equipment of any kind is allowed there. (On Nov. 8, the
three BASE jumpers who preceded Jan Davis were charged under an old
law forbidding ``air deliveries'' in national parks.)
</P>
<P>
   Rock-climbers are expected to use established routes and not
leave equipment behind.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion the Park Service has taken climbers to court to
recover its costs, especially in Alaska, where Denali National Park
seems to be a magnet for inexperienced mountain-climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the one-day-a-year exception of New River Gorge,
Gediman thinks BASE jumping will never be legal in any American
park. Mrs. Davis's bid to prove it safe had, of course, just the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not appropriate,'' says Gediman. ``The parks just

NIXON WANTED TO REFUSE A PARDON AND FIGHT CHARGES, LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to close ter Horst to terHorst. Toward end, inserts graf on

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Herbert Miller, Richard Nixon's criminal defense
lawyer, said Friday that the former president had at first spurned
a pardon from President Ford in 1974, saying he wanted to fight any
charges that might be brought against him by the Watergate special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, speaking publicly for the first time about the pardon at
a forum held here at Duquesne University Law School, said that in
late August 1974 Nixon's ``initial reaction was that he did not
want a pardon.'' He said the ex-president, a proud man, ``felt that
if he had done something wrong, let him be indicted and go to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington lawyer, who has represented Nixon and his heirs
for 25 years in their efforts to assert ownership of the Nixon
White House tapes and to keep them from being made public, said he
persuaded Nixon that there was no possibility that he could get a
fair trial after the publicity about the case, making it likely
that the issue would drag on for years. After those discussions, he
said, Nixon agreed to take a pardon, even with its implications of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed after the forum, Miller said he could not reconcile
the reluctance he saw in Nixon with efforts by White House aides _
made with Nixon's knowledge _ to raise the idea of a pardon with
Ford, then the vice president, before Nixon's resignation on Aug.
9, 1974. ``I don't know anything about that,'' said Miller, who was
retained by Nixon after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Woodward's book ``Shadow'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), citing but
not directly quoting an interview with Miller, said: ``Nixon was
opposed to accepting the pardon. He felt it would imply some kind
of guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also said Friday that Leon Jaworski, the Watergate
special prosecutor, had told him that he agreed with Miller that
public opinion in Washington made a fair trial impossible without a
long delay. Miller said he had met with Jaworski at the Jefferson
Hotel to sound him out about a pardon, because he feared that one
would not be issued if the prosecutor was against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated he would not challenge a pardon and was in favor
of it,'' Miller said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jaworski died in 1982 and never acknowledged favoring a pardon.
James Doyle, who was his press spokesman in 1974, said Friday night
that while he had no direct knowledge, he doubted that Jaworski
would have stated his support of a pardon to Nixon's lawyer. ``Leon
was a poker player, and he kept his cards close to his vest,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that when the pardon was issued, Jaworski told him,
``I'm relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that he had been authorized by Julie Nixon
Eisenhower, the late president's daughter, to discuss the pardon on
Friday. But when a reporter at a news conference earlier asked if
Nixon had ever acknowledged his guilt in Watergate to him, Miller
demurred. He indicated that attorney-client privilege might bar a
direct answer, saying, ``If he ever said it to his attorney, the
attorney would not be able to discuss it.'' Nixon died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gormley, the law professor who organized Friday's forum,
recounted a conversation with Ronald Ziegler, Nixon's press
secretary, who had been scheduled to take part in the forum but did
not because of a recent injury.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ziegler had told him that after the ex-president had
agreed to accept a pardon, he became greatly agitated over his fear
that Ford would not issue one. Miller said Ziegler had told him the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants in the forum insisted that there had been
no ``deal'' to issue a pardon before Nixon's resignation. Besides
Miller, the others who said so included Jerald terHorst, Ford's
press secretary, who resigned in protest over the pardon; Benton
Becker, the White House lawyer who negotiated the terms of Nixon's
statement accepting the pardon, and Robert Hartmann, Ford's adviser
and chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said the ``problem that created the specter of a deal
was that Ford was inarticulate.'' He said ``the more Ford tried to
explain what he meant the worse it got.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ford had told a news conference on Aug. 28, 1974,
that he would make no commitment on the pardon issue ``until the
legal process has been undertaken'' and ``until it gets to me.''
That led people to believe that he planned to wait at least until
an indictment had been handed up, probably for participation in the
Watergate coverup _ before considering a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ford pardoned Nixon on Sept. 8, 1974, for any federal
crimes he might have committed as president.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants also agreed that Ford issued the pardon
because he found that questions about Nixon were overwhelming his
time and getting in the way of efforts to deal with other national
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The former president's son, Steve Ford, said that his father
knew that the pardon ``was a decision that cost him any further
political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that was how Ford felt when he issued it, he lost very
narrowly to Jimmy Carter in 1976.

   POINT REYES STATION, CALIF. _ How daring should people be
allowed to be on public land?
</P>
<P>
   A debate has been going on ever since, at the end of October,
Jan Davis jumped to her death from El Capitan, one of the sheer
cliffs of Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis had been trying to prove that parachuting from the
cliffs, which has been banned for years, was safe and should be
allowed. Her husband was filming her as the rip cord on her
parachute failed to open.
</P>
<P>
   She was a grandmother; she was also an experienced practitioner
of so-called BASE (building, antenna, span and earth) jumping, or
parachuting from stationary landmarks, with 3,000 jumps to her
name.
</P>
<P>
   But she had used a borrowed parachute, an older model sometimes
called a ``trash bag,'' so that her own expensive gear would not be
confiscated when park rangers met her at the bottom of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis's death was the second related to BASE jumping in
Yosemite this year, and the sixth in the park since rangers began
counting. Last June, Frank Gambalie successfully jumped from El
Capitan but drowned in the raging Merced River while trying to
escape the rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, the familiar mountain and wilderness
activities such as backpacking and rock-climbing have been joined
by hang gliding, whitewater kayaking, mountain biking,
bungee-jumping and off-road skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   All are dangerous to some degree, and deaths in the national
parks have been attributed to all of them save skateboarding. Yet
all are increasingly shown on television cable channels in programs
such as ESPN's ``X Games,'' and enthusiasm for them is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials are having a hard job deciding which of them
should be banned and which not. The 370 parks in the federal system
can more or less make up their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   At present, BASE jumping is banned in all parks except one: the
New River Gorge National River in West Virginia, where, on the
third Saturday of each October, jumpers can leap the 870 feet from
New River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than 300 jumps were made on ``Bridge Day.''
Adventurers are also allowed, on the same day, to rappel from the
span.
</P>
<P>
   These exceptions are the result of history, bureaucracy and
politics. Parachuting from New River Gorge Bridge, which is
technically not the property of the National Park Service, began
shortly after the bridge opened in 1977, several years before there
was a park.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service took possession of the river below the
bridge, it grandfathered permission for this sort of jumping on one
day of the year after appeals from the local chamber of commerce,
which enjoyed the money of tourists attracted by the
bridge-jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis's leap from El Capitan was made partly to encourage a
similar one-day festival for Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Another adventure sport, hang gliding, has always been allowed
in Yosemite's jagged mountains, as it has been in certain areas of
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in and around San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Yosemite a hang glider ``pilot'' must show an expert's
certificate from the United States Hang Gliding Association in
order to be cleared for a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain biking is allowed on unpaved roads in Canyonlands
National Park in Utah, but not on any trail in Kings Canyon
National Park in California or in Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-country skiing is allowed in most parks in winter, but
this does not necessarily sanction snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   Although jumping off El Capitan with a parachute is illegal,
going up it with ropes and climbing equipment does not even need a
permit _ though climbing accounts for one or two deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite is one of the birthplaces of American rock-climbing,
and as such the activity, like wilderness backpacking, is allowed
in the park by ``historical precedent,'' according to Scott
Gediman, a local spokesman for the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gediman says the service tries to evaluate every sport,
especially new ones, ``on its impact on a park and on other
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite's back country is off-limits to bicycles because no
mechanized equipment of any kind is allowed there. (On Nov. 8, the
three BASE jumpers who preceded Jan Davis were charged under an old
law forbidding ``air deliveries'' in national parks.)
</P>
<P>
   Rock-climbers are expected to use established routes and not
leave equipment behind.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion the Park Service has taken climbers to court to
recover its costs, especially in Alaska, where Denali National Park
seems to be a magnet for inexperienced mountain-climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the one-day-a-year exception of New River Gorge,
Gediman thinks BASE jumping will never be legal in any American
park. Mrs. Davis's bid to prove it safe had, of course, just the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not appropriate,'' says Gediman. ``The parks just
aren't conducive to it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With time running out before the primaries, Steve
Forbes has gone on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   He has recently assumed the role of chief accuser of the
front-runner for the Republicans' presidential nomination, George
W. Bush, and has prepared reams of documents designed to show that,
when it comes to fiscal conservatism, Bush is, in Texas-speak,
``All hat, no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   It started when Bush began airing television ads in Iowa and New
Hampshire claiming that he had reduced state spending to its
``lowest in 40 years,'' and had signed ``the two largest tax cuts
in Texas history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign dismisses these claims as ``bogus spending
blather,'' and Forbes demanded that they be pulled from the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Forbes has been painting his opponent as a
tax-and-spend liberal, arguing that the Texas budget has in fact
increased 36 percent during Bush's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Who is right? It seems that both men may be.
</P>
<P>
   As John Kennedy, an economist at the Texas Taxpayers and
Research Association, puts it, ``If you torture numbers enough,
they will confess to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas budget has indeed increased considerably in nominal
terms since
</P>
<P>
   Bush took office, yet this fails to allow either for inflation
or for the substantial population growth Texas has experienced over
the decade. When these factors are taken into account, the budget
expansion (in real terms) is far less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Austin-based Center for Public Policy
Priorities, the average annual growth rate in state spending under
Governor Bush has been 1.8 percent _ the lowest for any governor
since 1960, except for the extraordinary time when declining oil
revenues crippled the state under Bill Clements in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It is curious, however, that Bush should be defending his record
in this way. During his first campaign for governor in 1994,
against Ann Richards, he criticized the incumbent for an
``explosive'' growth in state spending during her tenure,
contending that the budget had increased by 47 percent in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush based his attacks on unadjusted budget figures, just as his
opponent is doing today. Naturally, Richards used
inflation-adjusted figures, which indicated a much slower rate of
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush no doubt had a crash course in Texas budget policy once he
took over the governor's mansion, during which he would have
realized that much of the process is actually tinkering at the
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Texas budget is tiny (the smallest in the country in
spending per head), and because the state constitution requires a
balanced budget, dramatic proposals either for taxing or for
spending are usually cast aside early on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dale Craymer, who worked on the budget teams of
both Governors Bush and Richards, it is therefore futile to compare
Bush's fiscal record with that of his Republican counterparts in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christine Whitman in New Jersey and George Pataki in
New York have been praised as budget-slashers by conservatives, in
Texas there is very little budget to slash in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another iron law of Texas politics is that the governor has only
a loose hold on the state's purse-strings. The budget process is
almost entirely driven by the state legislature, with the governor
reduced to the role of a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   According to George Christian, a political consultant in Austin,
``The governor pretty much has to beg, borrow or steal any
influence over the budget process.''
</P>
<P>
   By this token, Bush was in fact quite successful in dealing with
the legislature, much more so than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   During both the 1997 and 1999 legislative sessions he built
bipartisan support for his most prized budget initiatives, ensuring
that most of them became law.
</P>
<P>
   In both sessions, the initiatives Bush pushed hardest for were
plans to cut property taxes, securing $2.3 billion of state money
since 1997 to relieve the school property tax in local districts.
</P>
<P>
   This tax cut was in essence a spending plan, since it increased
the state's allocation to each district for school funding, with
the intended result of allowing these districts in turn to lower
the local tax rate. It is this tax cut that Bush is currently
advertising as the largest in Texas's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sheer size of the cut makes Bush's claim accurate,
in reality very few Texas families experienced a lightening of the
local tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the influx of state dollars, rising property values in
the state obliged many local school districts either to raise or to
hold steady the school tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, only 378 of 1,035
school districts in Texas are considering a property tax cut for
the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these phantom maneuvers, Bush can wave a banner of
fiscal conservatism as he seeks the Republican nomination. He would
be wise, however, not to get dragged into a street brawl over
budget policy with Steve Forbes, who can make almost anyone look
like a profligate. &QL;

FACING CRISIS, DODGERS ACQUIRE ORIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the real possibility of losing third baseman
Adrian Beltre, one of the top young talents in the game, the
Dodgers attempted to add something of a safety net Friday by
acquiring infielder Kevin Orie from the Florida Marlins for a
minor-league player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers brass said the move was made to add depth to the
corner positions, but with Beltre's status suddenly uncertain, Orie
could wind up being the Dodgers' opening-day third baseman if
Beltre is granted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Marlins were working on the deal for weeks, but
sources said the move was accelerated because of the Beltre
development. If Major League Baseball's office of the commissioner
denies Beltre's request to become a free agent, Orie provides
corner depth.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the issue is whether Beltre will be with the
Dodgers next season. Several industry officials said they thought
Beltre would be granted free agency based on the recent revelation
that Dodgers might have signed Beltre when he was 15. Major League
Baseball rules state a player can't sign until the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's agent, Scott Boras, said Beltre's birth certificate is
dated April 7, 1979. The Dodgers list Beltre's birth year as 1978.
He was signed July 7, 1994, meaning he was 15 when the contract was
signed. Several officials said the onus of knowing a player's age
is on the club.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wouldn't comment on the issue but did release a
statement saying they would abide by baseball's ruling. Given the
importance of the matter, both sides are hoping the conclusion is
reached in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt complicating the process is the Dodgers' inauspicious
mishaps with foreign-born players. In May, the Dodgers were charged
with illegally scouting and signing two Cuban baseball players. The
pair _ minor-leaguers Juan Carlos Diaz and Jose Perez _ were
granted free agency, the Dodgers were fined $200,000, not allowed
to re-sign the players and also were kept from being able to sign
foreign players for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and Perez were signed by Pablo Peguero, who now heads the
Dodgers' Campo Las Palmas training complex in the Dominican
Republic. Peguero also signed Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Perez and Diaz issue, this had nothing to do with the
current Fox regime or with second-year general manager Kevin Malone
or recently anointed Dodgers chairman and CEO Robert Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody called me about it, but I know nothing about it,''
Peguero said. ``I don't know about it. I have no comment about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season, Beltre batted .275 with 15 homers and
67 RBI. If Beltre, whose signing bonus was $23,000, is declared a
free agent, the Dodgers could be withheld from the bidding process
as a penalty. However, Boras said he's hoping that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we would request,'' Boras said. ``We
would want a full marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Dodgers are allowed to remain in a bidding war for
Beltre, they might not be able to afford him. Beltre made $220,000
last season. If he's granted free agency, the soft-handed
20-year-old could sign a long-term deal worth $6 million to $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Orie, 27, batted .254 with six homers and 29 RBI in 77 games
with the Marlins last season. He made his major-league debut in
1997. Malone said Orie could play third, first or outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed the depth,'' Malone said. ``To me, it's common
sense. We didn't have many corner infielders.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making offers to free agents to bolster the bench and
bullpen, Malone made the Orie deal early and spent much of the day
discussing the Beltre situation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lefty Arthur Rhodes, who has a good relationship with
Malone and Johnson from their Baltimore Orioles days, remains the
Dodgers' top target of a less than stellar free-agent class. If the
Dodgers want Rhodes, the premier power lefty reliever in the
free-agent group, it's believed they'll have to pay nearly $4
million a year for him because of the demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also continue to work on a trade with the St. Louis
Cardinals involving second baseman Eric Young. The Dodgers would
get back either Manny Aybar or Jose Jimenez, both right-handed
pitchers, but sources said the snag is financial. Young is owed
$4.5 million in each of the next two seasons, and the sides can't
agree on how much of that should be paid by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Cardinals need a second baseman and leadoff
hitter, both of which Young would fill, sources said the contract

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With time running out before the primaries, Steve
Forbes has gone on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   He has recently assumed the role of chief accuser of the
front-runner for the Republicans' presidential nomination, George
W. Bush, and has prepared reams of documents designed to show that,
when it comes to fiscal conservatism, Bush is, in Texas-speak,
``All hat, no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   It started when Bush began airing television ads in Iowa and New
Hampshire claiming that he had reduced state spending to its
``lowest in 40 years,'' and had signed ``the two largest tax cuts
in Texas history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign dismisses these claims as ``bogus spending
blather,'' and Forbes demanded that they be pulled from the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Forbes has been painting his opponent as a
tax-and-spend liberal, arguing that the Texas budget has in fact
increased 36 percent during Bush's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Who is right? It seems that both men may be.
</P>
<P>
   As John Kennedy, an economist at the Texas Taxpayers and
Research Association, puts it, ``If you torture numbers enough,
they will confess to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas budget has indeed increased considerably in nominal
terms since
</P>
<P>
   Bush took office, yet this fails to allow either for inflation
or for the substantial population growth Texas has experienced over
the decade. When these factors are taken into account, the budget
expansion (in real terms) is far less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Austin-based Center for Public Policy
Priorities, the average annual growth rate in state spending under
Governor Bush has been 1.8 percent _ the lowest for any governor
since 1960, except for the extraordinary time when declining oil
revenues crippled the state under Bill Clements in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It is curious, however, that Bush should be defending his record
in this way. During his first campaign for governor in 1994,
against Ann Richards, he criticized the incumbent for an
``explosive'' growth in state spending during her tenure,
contending that the budget had increased by 47 percent in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush based his attacks on unadjusted budget figures, just as his
opponent is doing today. Naturally, Richards used
inflation-adjusted figures, which indicated a much slower rate of
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush no doubt had a crash course in Texas budget policy once he
took over the governor's mansion, during which he would have
realized that much of the process is actually tinkering at the
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Texas budget is tiny (the smallest in the country in
spending per head), and because the state constitution requires a
balanced budget, dramatic proposals either for taxing or for
spending are usually cast aside early on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dale Craymer, who worked on the budget teams of
both Governors Bush and Richards, it is therefore futile to compare
Bush's fiscal record with that of his Republican counterparts in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christine Whitman in New Jersey and George Pataki in
New York have been praised as budget-slashers by conservatives, in
Texas there is very little budget to slash in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another iron law of Texas politics is that the governor has only
a loose hold on the state's purse-strings. The budget process is
almost entirely driven by the state legislature, with the governor
reduced to the role of a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   According to George Christian, a political consultant in Austin,
``The governor pretty much has to beg, borrow or steal any
influence over the budget process.''
</P>
<P>
   By this token, Bush was in fact quite successful in dealing with
the legislature, much more so than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   During both the 1997 and 1999 legislative sessions he built
bipartisan support for his most prized budget initiatives, ensuring
that most of them became law.
</P>
<P>
   In both sessions, the initiatives Bush pushed hardest for were
plans to cut property taxes, securing $2.3 billion of state money
since 1997 to relieve the school property tax in local districts.
</P>
<P>
   This tax cut was in essence a spending plan, since it increased
the state's allocation to each district for school funding, with
the intended result of allowing these districts in turn to lower
the local tax rate. It is this tax cut that Bush is currently
advertising as the largest in Texas's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sheer size of the cut makes Bush's claim accurate,
in reality very few Texas families experienced a lightening of the
local tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the influx of state dollars, rising property values in
the state obliged many local school districts either to raise or to
hold steady the school tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, only 378 of 1,035
school districts in Texas are considering a property tax cut for
the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these phantom maneuvers, Bush can wave a banner of
fiscal conservatism as he seeks the Republican nomination. He would
be wise, however, not to get dragged into a street brawl over
budget policy with Steve Forbes, who can make almost anyone look
like a profligate. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON_ The good news for medical managed-care companies is
that they are not as unpopular as racists.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll in Business Week revealed that 32 percent of
Americans thought they would not be able to deliver an impartial
verdict in court cases involving white supremacists. The percentage
saying the same thing about HMOs was a mere 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9 the country's second-biggest managed-care company,
United Health Group, made a bold attempt to escape from this moral
lepers' colony when it announced that it was returning medical
decision-making power from bureaucrats to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, doctors have had to get authorization from the
company's ``utilization review'' division before making medical
decisions, leading to needless hassles and endless delays.
</P>
<P>
   Now the division will be closed, and doctors will be able to
rely on their own judgment instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis-based company, which serves 14.5 million clients
around the country, has not got rid of cost controls entirely, of
course. It will still review medical decisions retrospectively,
urging doctors not to exceed certain averages. But such reviews are
standard practice in most health-care systems, including the
``socialized'' systems of Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision undoubtedly represents a significant retreat
from a key part of the managed-care industry's strategy for
containing medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues that there are good commercial reasons for
its move. The ``utilization review'' division cost the company $128
million to run last year, and yet ended up approving more than nine
out of every ten medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price went up in the light of the
announcement. But the decision also reflects an attempt to deal
with a backlash against managed care that is becoming one of the
most powerful forces in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   A patients' bill of rights, which sailed through both houses of
Congress last month and which would, among other things, allow
patients to sue erring HMOs, is just the latest manifestation of a
tidal wave of anti-HMO activity.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Peterson, of the University of California at Los Angeles,
points out that state legislatures have already passed more than
1,000 pieces of legislation designed to discipline the
managed-health care industry. There are also plenty of class-action
lawsuits in the works.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth's announcement is one of a number of attempts to
make the managed-care industry a little more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the American Association of Health Plans, the
industry's trade group, show that many plans have already cancelled
the requirement for doctors to get permission for most tests and
treatments _ and that 97 percent of all medical decisions are
approved by health bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente has devolved more and more decision-making to
doctors. United, Aetna and several Blue Cross plans also offer
their patients the right to appeal against denials of care to an
independent panel (though the value of this is reduced by the fact
that 30 states require independent panels by law).
</P>
<P>
   Just possibly, UnitedHealth's move could do something to break
up the present intimidating alliance of patients and doctors
against the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   American doctors have always fought for two things above all
else: professional and business autonomy. United's climbdown goes a
long way towards delivering at least one of these goals. But the
average American will be much more difficult to win over.
</P>
<P>
   The point of managed care was to introduce a degree of rationing
into a health-care system that, by the late 1980s, was suffering
from inflation of 15 percent a year or even more.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of privately insured Americans receiving health
care from managed health-care organizations has risen from 13
percent in 1987 to 75 percent today, thanks largely to the
insistence of employers.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are notoriously bad at dealing with rationing of
any sort, let alone rationing of private health care. And they
continue to measure health care against the golden age of
fee-for-service medicine, when they could see specialists without
the bother of getting a referral from their primary physicians, and
when their hapless employers simply picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth will no doubt try to control costs by other means _
by reducing still further the amount of time that patients can
spend in hospital, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's backdown also raises another possibility:
that, battered by its rising unpopularity and nervous about hostile
legislation, the managed-care industry is fast retreating from the
task it was put into place to perform: to control health-care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years in which health-care inflation has been all
but nonexistent, costs are beginning to edge up once again, with
several health-care companies planning to increase their premiums
by as much as 10 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   This will not only make it more difficult to extend health-care
coverage to the 44.3 million Americans who currently lack it; it
will also force those politicians who are making such a noise about
patients' rights to start complaining about escalating costs
instead.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs were put into place to do many difficult things, but making
themselves popular was not one of them. &QL;

industry's trade group, show that many plans have already cancelled
the requirement for doctors to get permission for most tests and
treatments _ and that 97 percent of all medical decisions are
approved by health bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente has devolved more and more decision-making to
doctors. United, Aetna and several Blue Cross plans also offer
their patients the right to appeal against denials of care to an
independent panel (though the value of this is reduced by the fact
that 30 states require independent panels by law).
</P>
<P>
   Just possibly, UnitedHealth's move could do something to break
up the present intimidating alliance of patients and doctors
against the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   American doctors have always fought for two things above all
else: professional and business autonomy. United's climbdown goes a
long way towards delivering at least one of these goals. But the
average American will be much more difficult to win over.
</P>
<P>
   The point of managed care was to introduce a degree of rationing
into a health-care system that, by the late 1980s, was suffering
from inflation of 15 percent a year or even more.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of privately insured Americans receiving health
care from managed health-care organizations has risen from 13
percent in 1987 to 75 percent today, thanks largely to the
insistence of employers.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are notoriously bad at dealing with rationing of
any sort, let alone rationing of private health care. And they
continue to measure health care against the golden age of
fee-for-service medicine, when they could see specialists without
the bother of getting a referral from their primary physicians, and
when their hapless employers simply picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth will no doubt try to control costs by other means _
by reducing still further the amount of time that patients can
spend in hospital, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's backdown also raises another possibility:
that, battered by its rising unpopularity and nervous about hostile
legislation, the managed-care industry is fast retreating from the
task it was put into place to perform: to control health-care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years in which health-care inflation has been all
but nonexistent, costs are beginning to edge up once again, with
several health-care companies planning to increase their premiums
by as much as 10 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   This will not only make it more difficult to extend health-care
coverage to the 44.3 million Americans who currently lack it; it
will also force those politicians who are making such a noise about
patients' rights to start complaining about escalating costs
instead.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs were put into place to do many difficult things, but making
themselves popular was not one of them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of election campaigns are about winning or
losing that particular contest. But just occasionally a campaign
comes along that changes the electoral landscape for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential race may be one such campaign. And what
seems like an incomprehensibly arcane piece of historical analysis
reveals what this entails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the Bush campaign,'' says Marshall Wittman of the
Heritage Foundation, ``is interested in the parallels with the '96
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the 1996 one. He means the 1896 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan
by 7.1 million votes to 6.5 million. For most of this century, this
has been seen as one in a long line of dull contests with
undistinguished winners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 1896 contest was in some ways the first modern campaign.
McKinley's bid for the presidency was run by a blunt, friendly
pig-iron magnate called Marcus Alonzo Hanna, who turned out to be
the first great campaign manager of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna raised an unheard-of $3.5 million in campaign
contributions. And while the candidate, who was governor of Ohio,
stood on his front porch promising ``a full dinner pail'' to the
trainloads of voters who were ferried to hear him, Hanna sent the
Republican establishment out across the country on a relentless
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Roosevelt, who became McKinley's vice-president, said
disgustedly that Hanna ``has advertised McKinley like a patent
medicine.'' Newspapers caricatured McKinley as a floppy doll
hanging from ``Nursie'' Hanna's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   All the odder, then, that Bill Bradley _ a hater of money and
handlers in politics _ called Hanna an early hero of his in his
1996 memoir ``Time Present, Time Past.''
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign was a triumph. James MacGregor Burns, an
historian, wrote that ``an air of predestination hung about his
apparent victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the apparently predestined George W. Bush is successful,
he will be the first sitting governor to become president since
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons that excite the Bush campaign go deep. In
winning the election, McKinley and Hanna redefined their party to
ensure Republican dominance for much of the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They did so by expanding its links with the new industrial and
financial entrepreneurs (hence all that money) and by reaching out
to the millions of immigrants then flooding into America.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley, a lawyer who had once represented striking miners,
blanketed the booming cities with millions of election pamphlets in
German, Czech, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish and every other language
the immigrants spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, he and Hanna suppressed the influence of
their party's old guard, who were still fighting the battles over
Civil War reconstruction that had dominated Republican politics
since the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why Bush and his campaign manager, Karl
Rove, should look to McKinley and Hanna as models. Bush too has
raised unprecedented amounts of money _ $57 million to the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   He has been busy persuading the new entrepreneurs of Silicon
Valley that his Republican Party is their natural home _ fiscally
conservative, skeptical of government intervention, opposed to
trial lawyers and socially libertarian. (This last is a tricky
stretch, requiring Bush to distance himself from the religious
right, rather as McKinley did from his old guard.)
</P>
<P>
   And, just as McKinley wooed the European immigrants of the late
19th century, so Bush is wooing the Latino ones of the late 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Sosa, the head of the biggest Spanish-language
advertising agency, praises Bush for designing his campaign around
Latinos from the start, rather than tacking a Latino bit on at the
end of a basically Anglophone effort.
</P>
<P>
   By making the Republicans the party of America's new industrial
economy, McKinley and Hanna ushered in three decades of ascendancy.
The party won seven of the next nine presidential elections, and
its dominance was not ended until the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, Bush and Rove hope to turn their party into
the representative organization of the ``new economy'' and come to
dominate American politics for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady prospect, and has a color of plausibility about
it. America is going through a period of economic change, from an
industrial to an information economy, comparable to that
experienced a century ago when the farmers flocked to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   The country is also experiencing the largest wave of immigration
since the turn of the century. In absolute terms, as many
immigrants are now coming to America as in the peak years before
1914.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 9.3 percent of the population were foreign-born,
compared with 13.6 percent in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, it is unclear whether the country, or even the
Bush campaign itself, is really prepared for the sort of political
transformation wrought by McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   There is none of the atmosphere of crisis that surrounded the
1896 election. That was held at a time of deep recession, and on
the eve of the vote Roosevelt said a victory for Bryan (one of
America's greatest populist leaders) would plunge the country into
``the greatest crisis in our national fate, save only the Civil
War.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Al Gore or Bill Bradley provoking quite
such hysteria. Nor are America's big parties, despite their
weakening hold on voters' loyalties, on their last legs, as they
seemed to be in 1896, when the Mexican Herald wrote that both
Republicans and Democrats ``have no more vitality than a desiccated
codfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it is not certain how far Bush is really prepared to
go to attract new voters. Conventional wisdom holds that he will
grab the presidency if he can win back the floating voters who
supported Ronald Reagan, but who abandoned the party when Newt
Gingrich emerged.
</P>
<P>
   That requires sounding reassuring, rather than seeking to
harness some great new electoral force. And soothing words may not
be enough to attract droves of Latino voters who, for all Bush's
success with them, remain largely Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, his campaign is beginning to have a feeling of
unrealizable potential about it. A grand electoral realignment may
be in the making. But for sound tactical reasons, the candidate who
would benefit most from it is reluctant to take full advantage. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Given that three-quarters of the earth's population does not
have a telephone, let alone access to the World Wide Web, talk of
extending the Internet to the moon, Mars and possibly an asteroid
or two might sound rather premature.
</P>
<P>
   But plans for an interplanetary Internet (IPN) are already being
drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   According to the scheme's proponents, extending the network into
space will reduce the cost of future space missions by, for
example, making it easy for several Mars landers to share a single
relay satellite to send data back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it could also benefit terrestrial users by
encouraging research into ways of making wireless connections more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that outer space is likely to be as hostile to
the networking protocols that underpin the Internet as it is to
air-breathing humanoids.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, TCP/IP, the common language spoken by every device
on the network, is a very ``chatty'' protocol. A constant buzz of
greetings, acknowledgments and farewells flits between computers as
they locate each other, exchange information and then disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   In space, however, such chattiness is a bad way of conversing.
Radio signals take a second to reach the moon, and several minutes
to reach Mars. So a new, terser protocol will be needed, to save
both time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty is that TCP/IP was designed to work over
networks in which transmission errors are rare, but congestion is
common.
</P>
<P>
   On earth, when one device sends a packet of data to another and
fails to receive an acknowledgment, it assumes that the link has
become congested. It therefore reduces the rate at which it sends
subsequent packets, only ramping that rate up again when the
congestion has eased.
</P>
<P>
   In space, however, different rules apply. If a packet of data
sent to a distant spacecraft in a hostile environment fails to get
through, the cause is more likely to be a transmission error _ in
which case the correct response is to retransmit the packet as
quickly as possible, rather than assuming that the link is
congested and backing off.
</P>
<P>
   File transfer is another area where new approaches will be
required.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, sending a file (an image, for example) from one
computer to another using the Internet's File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) involves establishing a connection between the source and
destination machines, and then passing the file across in chunks.
</P>
<P>
   But if a rover on the Martian surface wants to send a file back
to earth, this is an inefficient way of doing it. It would make
more sense for the rover to hand the whole file over to a lander,
which could pass it in chunks to orbiting relay satellites for
transmission home.
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of such matters sounds whimsical. But similar
problems arise, in less drastic form, with wireless Internet
devices on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld computers and wireless net-phones would also benefit
from a less chatty protocol, more efficient use of their limited
battery power, the ability to cope in noisy environments, and an
easier way to send files while on the move (from, say, digital
cameras).
</P>
<P>
   So rather than reinventing the wheel, the scientists working on
IPN _ a consortium that includes researchers from America's space
agency, NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the
British National Space Center and Britain's Defense Evaluation and
Research Agency _ hope to collaborate with researchers in the
terrestrial telecoms industry to establish new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The IPN working group has already drawn up a list of problems
that need to be solved. A few weeks ago it began the process of
presenting them to other researchers at a series of seminars, the
second of which was held on Nov. 12 at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the plans include the development of File Delivery
Protocol (FDP), a modified form of FTP, and a new idea based around
``bundles'' of data in which multiple packets, requests, files and
messages can be sent in one go.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Hooke of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., who is in charge of the scheme, hopes that devising new
protocols in conjunction with the telecoms industry will enable
NASA to use existing (and therefore cheaper) hardware in future
IPN-capable spacecraft, the first of which could be flying by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, eventually, is that separate Internets should exist on
earth, the moon, Mars and so on, connected by gateways that
communicate over an ``interplanetary backbone'' using new
spacefaring protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Probes landing on asteroids and comets would also connect to the
IPN.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that different bodies in the solar system change their
relative positions as they orbit the sun will, Dr. Hooke concedes,
complicate routing a bit: when the earth and Mars are on opposite
sides of the sun, for example, it might be best to send e-mail via
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of names and addresses. The IPN plans
call for an extension to the domain naming system to cover
different planets and solar systems. The Economist's website would,
for example, then be found at www.economist.com.earth.sol.
</P>
<P>
   But establishing these new domains (even for experimental
purposes) could prove rather difficult. When Dr. Hooke asked the
International Standards Organization committee that assigns country
codes about establishing codes for the moon and Mars, he was told
that he would need to provide a letter from the relevant sovereign
representative.
</P>
<P>
   What planet did they think he was on? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of election campaigns are about winning or
losing that particular contest. But just occasionally a campaign
comes along that changes the electoral landscape for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential race may be one such campaign. And what
seems like an incomprehensibly arcane piece of historical analysis
reveals what this entails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the Bush campaign,'' says Marshall Wittman of the
Heritage Foundation, ``is interested in the parallels with the '96
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the 1996 one. He means the 1896 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan
by 7.1 million votes to 6.5 million. For most of this century, this
has been seen as one in a long line of dull contests with
undistinguished winners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 1896 contest was in some ways the first modern campaign.
McKinley's bid for the presidency was run by a blunt, friendly
pig-iron magnate called Marcus Alonzo Hanna, who turned out to be
the first great campaign manager of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna raised an unheard-of $3.5 million in campaign
contributions. And while the candidate, who was governor of Ohio,
stood on his front porch promising ``a full dinner pail'' to the
trainloads of voters who were ferried to hear him, Hanna sent the
Republican establishment out across the country on a relentless
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Roosevelt, who became McKinley's vice-president, said
disgustedly that Hanna ``has advertised McKinley like a patent
medicine.'' Newspapers caricatured McKinley as a floppy doll
hanging from ``Nursie'' Hanna's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   All the odder, then, that Bill Bradley _ a hater of money and
handlers in politics _ called Hanna an early hero of his in his
1996 memoir ``Time Present, Time Past.''
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign was a triumph. James MacGregor Burns, an
historian, wrote that ``an air of predestination hung about his
apparent victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the apparently predestined George W. Bush is successful,
he will be the first sitting governor to become president since
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons that excite the Bush campaign go deep. In
winning the election, McKinley and Hanna redefined their party to
ensure Republican dominance for much of the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They did so by expanding its links with the new industrial and
financial entrepreneurs (hence all that money) and by reaching out
to the millions of immigrants then flooding into America.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley, a lawyer who had once represented striking miners,
blanketed the booming cities with millions of election pamphlets in
German, Czech, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish and every other language
the immigrants spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, he and Hanna suppressed the influence of
their party's old guard, who were still fighting the battles over
Civil War reconstruction that had dominated Republican politics
since the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why Bush and his campaign manager, Karl
Rove, should look to McKinley and Hanna as models. Bush too has
raised unprecedented amounts of money _ $57 million to the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   He has been busy persuading the new entrepreneurs of Silicon
Valley that his Republican Party is their natural home _ fiscally
conservative, skeptical of government intervention, opposed to
trial lawyers and socially libertarian. (This last is a tricky
stretch, requiring Bush to distance himself from the religious
right, rather as McKinley did from his old guard.)
</P>
<P>
   And, just as McKinley wooed the European immigrants of the late
19th century, so Bush is wooing the Latino ones of the late 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Sosa, the head of the biggest Spanish-language
advertising agency, praises Bush for designing his campaign around
Latinos from the start, rather than tacking a Latino bit on at the
end of a basically Anglophone effort.
</P>
<P>
   By making the Republicans the party of America's new industrial
economy, McKinley and Hanna ushered in three decades of ascendancy.
The party won seven of the next nine presidential elections, and
its dominance was not ended until the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, Bush and Rove hope to turn their party into
the representative organization of the ``new economy'' and come to
dominate American politics for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady prospect, and has a color of plausibility about
it. America is going through a period of economic change, from an
industrial to an information economy, comparable to that
experienced a century ago when the farmers flocked to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   The country is also experiencing the largest wave of immigration
since the turn of the century. In absolute terms, as many
immigrants are now coming to America as in the peak years before
1914.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 9.3 percent of the population were foreign-born,
compared with 13.6 percent in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, it is unclear whether the country, or even the
Bush campaign itself, is really prepared for the sort of political
transformation wrought by McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   There is none of the atmosphere of crisis that surrounded the
1896 election. That was held at a time of deep recession, and on
the eve of the vote Roosevelt said a victory for Bryan (one of
America's greatest populist leaders) would plunge the country into
``the greatest crisis in our national fate, save only the Civil
War.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Al Gore or Bill Bradley provoking quite
such hysteria. Nor are America's big parties, despite their
weakening hold on voters' loyalties, on their last legs, as they
seemed to be in 1896, when the Mexican Herald wrote that both
Republicans and Democrats ``have no more vitality than a desiccated
codfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it is not certain how far Bush is really prepared to
go to attract new voters. Conventional wisdom holds that he will
grab the presidency if he can win back the floating voters who
supported Ronald Reagan, but who abandoned the party when Newt
Gingrich emerged.
</P>
<P>
   That requires sounding reassuring, rather than seeking to
harness some great new electoral force. And soothing words may not
be enough to attract droves of Latino voters who, for all Bush's
success with them, remain largely Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, his campaign is beginning to have a feeling of
unrealizable potential about it. A grand electoral realignment may
be in the making. But for sound tactical reasons, the candidate who
would benefit most from it is reluctant to take full advantage. &QL;

KIDS SWARM BURGER KING AS POKEMON_MANIA STRIKES

<P>
   Mercedes Villegas and her husband, Arthur, drove around the San
Fernando Valley on Thursday night trying to score Pokemon for their
kids at Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   They went to a Burger King in Van Nuys, but they were out. They
went to another one in Panorama City: no luck. Their next stop
failed too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have any here either,'' Mercedes moaned at her
final stop at a Burger King on Roscoe and Sepulveda boulevards in
Panorama City. ``I don't know what I'm going to tell my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Wednesday's record-breaking debut of ``Pokemon:
The First Movie,'' parents and children on Thursday stormed Burger
Kings all over the Los Angeles region where Pokemon promotional
toys were being sold with a children's meal for $2.70.
</P>
<P>
   And at the fast-food restaurants across Los Angeles they were
exhausting supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 10-15 kids crying and screaming here,'' said
Carlos Morelli, 42, the manager of the Burger King on Roscoe at
Sepulveda. ``Today was overwhelming. They get upset when they can't
get the toy. I think I'm supposed to get a big shipment in
tomorrow. I sure hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debut of ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' grossed more
than $10 million, the biggest Wednesday opening ever for a Warner
Bros. movie and the biggest Wednesday opening for any animated film
in history. The film outpaced its nearest competition, ``The Lion
King'' by nearly $4million.
</P>
<P>
   Young Park, 8, of Sylmar has seen the movie twice already. She
and her 3-year-old brother, Andrew, with mother, Grace, in tow came
to the Burger King Thursday night anticipating a Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care much if they're out,'' Young said. ``But
I'm still upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in Japan, Pokemon, or little pocket monsters, are
brightly colored creatures that sometimes look sort of like
something you'd see in nature and sometimes are out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   In the original pair of games created for role-playing
adventures on Nintendo's hand-held video game machine, you can
collect 151 kinds of Pokemon creatures that are further broken into
about 15 almost elemental types, such as fire and water. The
pikachu is one species of Pokemon, of the electric phylum, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu was on the minds of many children Thursday night, as
Burger Kings all over the place, after selling hundreds of the toys
throughout the day, were out of stock by dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Ruben Rodriguez, 5, of Van Nuys, who
gasped when he heard that there weren't any more Pokemon toys at
the Burger King on Roscoe Boulevard in Panorama City. ``I'm sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans of the Pokemon phenomena have taken it to darker
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   In Rancho Palos Verdes, the fever has landed two youngsters in
hot water with the law. The two students from Dodson Middle School
were arrested for allegedly stealing more than 150 Pokemon trading
cards from the backpacks of students at nearby elementary schools,
said sheriff's Deputy Brenda Parker.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodson vice principal called the sheriff's department Monday
to report what he believed was a ``burglary ring.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the hype, many schools have banned the cards from
campuses because they have led to thefts and fights.
</P>
<P>
   Another promotional hit, Pokemon trading cards offered to
moviegoers, are also so hot they are moving faster than anyone
anticipated. Movie executives are stepping up supplies by creating
a program to mail cards to qualifying ticket purchasers,
redistribute existing supplies and possibly releasing additional
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to see that our value-added marketing campaign
has been so appealing,'' said Brad Ball, head of Pokemon's
promotional team.

U.N. AIRPLANE CRASHES IN KOSOVO

  (ADDS grafs 3-6 with details of bodies being recovered)

<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ A U.N. airplane with 24 people on board
crashed Friday in northern Kosovo during a flight headed here from
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage of the plane was found on a steep mountainside about 12
miles northeast of Kosovska Mitrovica, late Friday night, about 12
hours after the plane went missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the people on board were believed to have survived,''
Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for the Unit- ed Nations, said in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not known.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeeping troops on duty in Kosovo and U.N. officials
have begun to recover bod- ies from the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of corpses could be seen from the helicopter, and also
the aircraft is badly damaged,'' Capt. Tony Mouchet, the NATO press
spokesman for the battalion that lo- cated the plane, told The
Associated Press.
 &UR;  &LR; A helicopter pilot who spotted the plane said that its front was
virtually disintegrated and that there were no immediate signs of
survivors, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping forces told
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a daily charter flight by the World Food Program,
a U.N. agency, and normally carries U.N. officials, aid workers and
sometimes journalists from Rome to the newly reopened Slatina
airport here. On Friday, the flight carried 21 passengers and three
crewmembers, but officials would not release the names or
nationalities of the people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was no sign that the twin-engine, turbo
propeller aircraft, a French-Italian ATR-42, had been attacked. It
disappeared from radar at about noon near Vucitrn, some 12 miles
northwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the manufacturer said that the plane, 13 years
old, had 25,000 hours of flying time in July, when it was delivered
to an Italian charter company, Si Fly.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program currently provides food aid to about
900,000 people a day in Kosovo _ more than half the current
population of the province. During the war in Kosovo from March
through June, some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were driven or fled
from Kosovo, and many of them returned to destroyed houses and
contaminated wells.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more were forced from their homes inside Kosovo but
never left the province, living as best they could in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is feeding about 1.5 million people throughout the
Balkans, as well as some 500,000 people in Yugoslavia who were
affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the agency fed some 75 million people, including most
of the world's refugees. It operates in 80 countries. According to
the agency, it has lost more employees than any other U.N. agency _
51 since 1988 _ in work-related accidents, illnesses or attacks.

<P>
   The stock-market joke about January is that it just keeps coming
earlier. This year it probably won't. It may even wait until
January.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger news is that when January does arrive it won't be
just small-company investors who are toasting their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to unusually extensive end-of-the-year selling, worries
about rising interest rates, and concerns about Y2K glitches, the
stock market is likely to get an even bigger and broader seasonal
bounce than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will you portfolio be ready?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the famed January effect, of course. Every
January _ well, to be precise, 60 out of the past 73 _
small-company stocks outperform large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly why, although most experts believe the
phenomenon has something to do with the tax-related selling of
losing stocks that begins in October and with the end-of-the-year
portfolio-dressing money managers employ as they get ready to
defend their stock picks to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, betting on small-company stocks pays off
year in and year out. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, to take full advantage of the January effect,
investors have had to jump the gun. In fact, there hasn't been any
January effect at all in the past six Januarys.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, for example, the small-company Russell 2000
index climbed 1 percent while the large-company Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index scored a 4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say there wasn't a January effect last year.
It's just that the thing came early, as it generally has in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Russell 2000 soared 6 percent, matching the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1996, the Russell beat the S&AMP;P by five
percentage points, and in 1994, it beat the S&AMP;P by two. (Like 1998,
1997 and 1995 were ties.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outperformance in December is especially impressive
when you consider that over the past 50 years December has been the
Standard &AMP; Poor's best month, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Wall Street gurus are predicting a
bigger-than-usual January effect. Their logic is pretty compelling.
Most stocks have taken a beating in 1999 _ although the performance
of a relative handful of big winners has made the indexes look
deceptively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20 about 62 percent of stocks on the
New York Stock Exchange were down for the calendar year. That's
2,561 losers versus just 1,498 winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, about 50 percent of stocks were down for the year
_ even though the Nasdaq Composite index was up by almost 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All those losers mean lots of end-of-the-year selling to lock in
losses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with big gains in Cisco Systems (up 47 percent
from Jan. 1 through Sept. 24), Sun Microsystems (up 111 percent),
or Red Hat (up 629 percent since it went public in August) will be
looking to sell Coca-Cola (down 23 percent in 1999), Philip Morris
(down 34 percent), or Just for Feet (down 91 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You might think those stocks are ready for a rebound, since
they're so cheap now _ and in normal circumstances that might be
the case. But they face more selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The selling will start as early as October _ since many mutual
funds operate on a fiscal year that ends on Oct. 31 _ and will
stretch into December as individual investors take a turn.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-year portfolio dressing will hurt many of this year's
downtrodden, too.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers don't want to have to defend a big position in
Family Golf Centers (down 89 percent for 1999 as of Sept. 24) or
uBid (down 78 percent) or Rite Aid (also down 78 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Better to dump those turkeys before the end of the year and hope
no one notices the way they dogged up the portfolio in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about additional interest-rate increases from the
Federal Reserve Board and about the effects of Y2K are also likely
to weigh on the market in the last quarter of the year _ and keep
depressed stocks from bouncing back too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of another 25-basis-point (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) hike from Alan Greenspan and company is
a great excuse to stay on the sidelines. After all, if rates
ratchet up further from here, then many stocks that have dipped $10
or $20 a share aren't as cheap as they look.
</P>
<P>
   And Y2K? It's a complete wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Could a computer glitch at midnight on Dec. 31 shut down the
world banking system or flight-control computers at the world's
airports? How about a supply-chain failure at a major automaker or
a collapse in sales at a computer-software company?
</P>
<P>
   All possible _ if unlikely _ and more reason to sit on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, when it comes, should be even more robust than
usual. The pressure on stocks from tax-selling and
portfolio-dressing will ease with the end of the fiscal and
calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve either will have raised interest rates or
will have held off for several months _ in either case, the worry
will diminish. Y2K will start to get less scary well before Jan. 1,
as companies announce that they're seeing little or no effect on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Jan. 1, happen what may, the market will be able
to put all this behind it. And because in 1999, for the first time
in a number of years, many large-company stocks have been hammered
along with small-company stocks, the January effect should take in
a very broad swath of the market.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors make it likely that the January effect will be
a very profitable seasonal trend to ride at the end of 1999, but
they also make timing the effect a little more uncertain than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the low in the market has come during
the first couple weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who wanted to take full advantage of the
end-of-the-year gain sold into the fall rally (a dependable
phenomenon all decade) and then used that cash to build new
positions by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to Y2K, the effect may play out a few weeks
later than that _ some investors will wait to see how the world's
computers seem to be reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic strategy remains the same _ sell into the fall
rally (weak as it has been this year) and then redeploy cash in
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then trust that history will repeat itself. &QL;

   Last December, the Russell 2000 soared 6 percent, matching the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1996, the Russell beat the S&AMP;P by five
percentage points, and in 1994, it beat the S&AMP;P by two. (Like 1998,
1997 and 1995 were ties.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outperformance in December is especially impressive
when you consider that over the past 50 years December has been the
Standard &AMP; Poor's best month, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Wall Street gurus are predicting a
bigger-than-usual January effect. Their logic is pretty compelling.
Most stocks have taken a beating in 1999 _ although the performance
of a relative handful of big winners has made the indexes look
deceptively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20 about 62 percent of stocks on the
New York Stock Exchange were down for the calendar year. That's
2,561 losers versus just 1,498 winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, about 50 percent of stocks were down for the year
_ even though the Nasdaq Composite index was up by almost 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All those losers mean lots of end-of-the-year selling to lock in
losses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with big gains in Cisco Systems (up 47 percent
from Jan. 1 through Sept. 24), Sun Microsystems (up 111 percent),
or Red Hat (up 629 percent since it went public in August) will be
looking to sell Coca-Cola (down 23 percent in 1999), Philip Morris
(down 34 percent), or Just for Feet (down 91 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You might think those stocks are ready for a rebound, since
they're so cheap now _ and in normal circumstances that might be
the case. But they face more selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The selling will start as early as October _ since many mutual
funds operate on a fiscal year that ends on Oct. 31 _ and will
stretch into December as individual investors take a turn.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-year portfolio dressing will hurt many of this year's
downtrodden, too.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers don't want to have to defend a big position in
Family Golf Centers (down 89 percent for 1999 as of Sept. 24) or
uBid (down 78 percent) or Rite Aid (also down 78 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Better to dump those turkeys before the end of the year and hope
no one notices the way they dogged up the portfolio in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about additional interest-rate increases from the
Federal Reserve Board and about the effects of Y2K are also likely
to weigh on the market in the last quarter of the year _ and keep
depressed stocks from bouncing back too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of another 25-basis-point (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) hike from Alan Greenspan and company is
a great excuse to stay on the sidelines. After all, if rates
ratchet up further from here, then many stocks that have dipped $10
or $20 a share aren't as cheap as they look.
</P>
<P>
   And Y2K? It's a complete wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Could a computer glitch at midnight on Dec. 31 shut down the
world banking system or flight-control computers at the world's
airports? How about a supply-chain failure at a major automaker or
a collapse in sales at a computer-software company?
</P>
<P>
   All possible _ if unlikely _ and more reason to sit on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, when it comes, should be even more robust than
usual. The pressure on stocks from tax-selling and
portfolio-dressing will ease with the end of the fiscal and
calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve either will have raised interest rates or
will have held off for several months _ in either case, the worry
will diminish. Y2K will start to get less scary well before Jan. 1,
as companies announce that they're seeing little or no effect on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Jan. 1, happen what may, the market will be able
to put all this behind it. And because in 1999, for the first time
in a number of years, many large-company stocks have been hammered
along with small-company stocks, the January effect should take in
a very broad swath of the market.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors make it likely that the January effect will be
a very profitable seasonal trend to ride at the end of 1999, but
they also make timing the effect a little more uncertain than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the low in the market has come during
the first couple weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who wanted to take full advantage of the
end-of-the-year gain sold into the fall rally (a dependable
phenomenon all decade) and then used that cash to build new
positions by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to Y2K, the effect may play out a few weeks
later than that _ some investors will wait to see how the world's
computers seem to be reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic strategy remains the same _ sell into the fall
rally (weak as it has been this year) and then redeploy cash in
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then trust that history will repeat itself. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, investment returns had two components: capital
gains and income. But after years of declining interest rates and
rocketing stock prices, the idea of investing to capture a stream
of interest and dividend payments seems frightfully old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for investors whose goals have changed from
accumulating wealth to spending it. We should all live so long.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who rely on their portfolios to spin off enough cash
to pay the bills soon discover how much has changed since the days
when electric utilities paid fat dividends and even Uncle Sam had
to pay double-digit interest rates to borrow money in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, utilities retain their cash to compete in a newly
deregulated environment, and the U.S. Treasury, with a lighter
financing burden, pays about 6.08 percent for 30-year money.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is the high cost of assembling a
diversified income-producing portfolio out of individual debt and
equity securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 or
even $1 million, so mutual funds are the income investment of
choice for most people. But which funds?
</P>
<P>
   The income-fund universe has shrunk drastically in recent years,
but the database of Morningstar, the Chicago mutual-fund research
house, still lists more than 1,000 intermediate- to long-term bond
funds and about 200 funds composed primarily of income-producing
equity securities such as preferred stock and real-estate
investment trusts, or REITs.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the selection process, WORTH sought out funds that
consistently delivered above-average returns at reasonable risk. Of
course, risk tolerance varies from one investor to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors can tolerate wide swings in the value of their
principal as long as the income keeps flowing, while others give up
some yield for the assurance of stable principal.
</P>
<P>
   We found high-quality debt and equity funds at both extremes of
the risk/return spectrum, as well as those that fall somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   For the absolutely risk-averse, there is the money-market mutual
fund. Investing in the very shortest term borrowings of governments
and corporations, these funds usually yield much less than
longer-term bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the highest-yielding generally available money-market
fund is Strong Investors Money Fund (800-359-3379), managed by Jay
Meuller. It yielded 5.29 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   To top the money-fund rankings, as it does regularly, Strong
charges a loss-leader 0.05 percent management fee. The firm can
raise the fee at any time, though it says it would do so only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Further out on both the risk and reward axes are
government-securities funds, which invest primarily or exclusively
in one- to ten-year securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and
various federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These securities carry little or no credit risk, but fluctuate
in price.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how volatile a fund might be, look at its
average duration. Although expressed in years, duration actually
measures how much the price of an investment must vary to produce a
one-percentage-point change in yield (remember, bond prices and
yields move in opposite directions).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bond fund with a duration of five years must vary
in price by 5 percent for its yield to move up or down by one
percentage point. Generally speaking, the longer the duration, the
more volatile the security.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Government Obligations Fund (800-225-6265) charges a
4.75 percent load for its A shares but throws off a high yield _
7.36 percent as of Sept. 7 _ while keeping its duration to a slim
3.84 years, far less than lower-yielding funds that invest in
longer-term Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Susan Schiff concentrates the portfolio in the
obligations of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, two quasi-federal
agencies whose bonds yield more than Treasury bonds, as the
agencies are viewed as slightly more risky credits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can stomach more volatility should consider
high-yield corporate-bond funds. The managers of these funds spread
risk by mixing safer, higher-rated bonds with higher-yielding, more
speculative debt.
</P>
<P>
   With a payout of 10.72 percent as of Sept. 7, Scudder High Yield
Bond Fund (800-225-2470) is near the top of its category, and its
holdings have a below-average duration of 4.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a portion of the portfolio in investment-grade bonds,
manager Kelly Babson maintains a fairly high average credit rating
of B.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should expect some fluctuation in the value of their
principal. The fund's standard deviation _ that is, its widest
likely variance from its average price _ is 7.66, compared with
7.87 for the average high-yield fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two funds that rely on equity for their income merit a mention.
Flaherty &AMP; Crumrine's Preferred Income Fund (626-795-7300), managed
by Peter Stimes, Robert Ettinger, Donald Crumrine, and Robert
Flaherty, invests in preferred stock _ shares whose dividend must
be paid before the issuer can pay a dividend on its common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred-share prices, like all share prices, will vary, but
they tend to follow the movements of bonds, not stocks. As of Sept.
7, Preferred Income yielded 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For good old-fashioned plump dividends, REITs are the investment
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   By law, these companies, which invest in or manage real-estate
properties ranging from apartment buildings to office complexes to
prisons, must pay out 95 percent of their income as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-end Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Income Fund (800-330-7348),
managed by Martin Cohen, yielded 8.2 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: The value of REIT shares mirrors the health of the
real-estate market. Last year was a bad year for real estate and
REITs, whose composite price fell 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The picks in this story aren't right for every investor, but
they should convince skeptics that ``investing for income'' isn't a
contradiction in terms. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   While the U.S. economy has been booming, averaging growth of a
little over 3 percent annually since 1991, our friends in the
United Kingdom have been doing nearly as well: Their economy has
grown an average of 2.8 percent a year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes and home values have risen, unemployment is low (4.2
percent), and inflation is weak (1.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found
that optimism among manufacturers is at a two-year high. By the
start of autumn, the pound sterling had climbed 7 percent against
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even British culture is hot again: Reservations for good London
restaurants are now hard to get (they were hard to get five years
ago, too, but that's because there weren't any good restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in ``Cool Britannia'' is up. And Prince William _ ``His
Royal Hunk'' on Web sites _ is suddenly a teen heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Prime Minister Tony Blair want to fix what ain't
broken and ditch the pound for the floundering euro? Certainly not
for the sake of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Federation of Small Businesses,
nearly 60 percent of small British firms oppose monetary union. To
them it sounds like taxation without representation (I can just see
it: Londoners staging their own Boston Tea Party by pouring French
wine into the Thames).
</P>
<P>
   At a private dinner with former prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, I was struck by her ruthless comments: ``We British and
you Americans believe in equity and fairness _ traits not shared in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reminded us, ``We saved Europe, defeated half _ with

   Thatcher may be more of a national monument than a viable
political power these days, but her views reflect more than the
Tory right wing.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers routinely report the latest efforts from
Brussels to ``harmonize'' regulations and create industry standards
for almost every product. Many such edicts lend themselves to
mockery, including an alleged ban on curved bananas, restrictions
on transporting scotch whisky, and design requirements for coffins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most publicized ``standardization'' has involved
establishing uniform characteristics for the ``euro-condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is drawn toward the continent for two main reasons.
Philosophically, he believes in a ``greater'' Europe. In this view,
the U.K. is more vulnerable in isolation than as part of European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.K. currently enjoys robust growth and low inflation,
those good times might not last; capital could flee across the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In a practical sense, Blair knows that large British businesses
like British Airways tend to support monetary union. Big
multinationals like General Motors and Toyota have made it known
they could be forced to cut back on their U.K.-based investments if
the U.K. stays outside EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal popularity and the near collapse of the
opposition Conservative Party, Blair faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether big business gets its way and triumphs over the little
firm will depend on how well EMU works for the continent. Blair has
pledged to hold a referendum before committing to the euro, and
that's not likely to happen before he could be reelected, probably
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tory government shrewdly negotiated the possibility
of joining EMU after its 1999 launch, the U.K. can now stand back
and watch EMU sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, Blair and his followers can start preparing to
cross the chilly waters of the English Channel by donning their
euro-standardized swimsuits. But don't bet on it. &QL;

   While the U.S. economy has been booming, averaging growth of a
little over 3 percent annually since 1991, our friends in the
United Kingdom have been doing nearly as well: Their economy has
grown an average of 2.8 percent a year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes and home values have risen, unemployment is low (4.2
percent), and inflation is weak (1.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found
that optimism among manufacturers is at a two-year high. By the
start of autumn, the pound sterling had climbed 7 percent against
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even British culture is hot again: Reservations for good London
restaurants are now hard to get (they were hard to get five years
ago, too, but that's because there weren't any good restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in ``Cool Britannia'' is up. And Prince William _ ``His
Royal Hunk'' on Web sites _ is suddenly a teen heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Prime Minister Tony Blair want to fix what ain't
broken and ditch the pound for the floundering euro? Certainly not
for the sake of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Federation of Small Businesses,
nearly 60 percent of small British firms oppose monetary union. To
them it sounds like taxation without representation (I can just see
it: Londoners staging their own Boston Tea Party by pouring French
wine into the Thames).
</P>
<P>
   At a private dinner with former prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, I was struck by her ruthless comments: ``We British and
you Americans believe in equity and fairness _ traits not shared in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reminded us, ``We saved Europe, defeated half _ with
America _ and rescued the other half. We won't get absorbed into
Europe now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ ``Boxing,'' Evander Holyfield mused this week, ``is
a replica of what life is _ up and down. It's been going up and
down since they invented it. It goes down, then something gives it
a boost and it comes up. It's not going to fade away. But right now
it definitely needs something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of preparation for his rematch with
Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas Saturday night, a contest intended to
produce an undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that the two fighters agreed on during this
week's pre-fight publicity blitz was that sport itself is in
serious danger of ending the century on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour draws near, Holyfield-Lewis II has come to seem less
of a mere title decider than boxing's last best hope for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield implied, prizefighting has never been without its
shadows. But this year has been spent in a gathering gloom,
starting with the attempt by Mike Tyson to break Axel Schulz's arm
in a clinch last January and running all the way through to the
ludicrous finish of Tyson's most recent encounter, when he was
disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the bell ended the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the fiasco of the first Holyfield-Lewis fight,
in March, when a poor contest ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the much anticipated but similarly
disappointing world welterweight championship fight between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, when De La Hoya tried to win the
fight in reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last month, came Naseem Hamed's unseemly display of
body-slamming against Cesar Soto in a fight more suited to a WWF
bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they pay their money, boxing fans know that they lay
themselves open to the risk of sudden and sometimes mystifying
disappointment. Such sensations go back to Sonny Liston quitting on
his stool against Cassius Clay, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the sport, nothing can be guaranteed. But this
year's procession of embarrassments resembles a systematic cheating
of the public, and the public has begun to show its resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's fights have left the fans in a very bad state of
mind,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis's highly respected trainer, said
Thursday. ``They have a lot of questions. Right now they're on the
brink of deserting boxing, and I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would not have been reassured by the last week's news
of the criminal indictments naming the IBF president, Bob Lee, and
three other officials, who are accused by the U.S. Attorney and the
FBI of taking bribes to rig the rankings in order to produce the
match-ups desired by certain top promoters over a 13-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This week a New York State Senate committee recommended the
creation of a national body to regulate the sport and prevent it,
in the words of its chairman, Senator Roy Goodman, from
``degenerating into a meaningless and violent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously the Attorney General of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del
Papa, announced that her office will be working with the state's
Athletic Commission, the sanctioning body for Saturday's fight, on
an investigation into the way the sport is organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it is that's wrong,'' Holyfield said in his
last pre-fight interview, knowing that the Miami offices of his
promoter, Don King, had been searched as part of the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a lot of different components. People should come
together and decide what's best for the sport. The boxers, the TV
people, the managers, the promoters, the writers. It needs a
collective effort to make it a better sport for everybody,
including the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lennox Lewis's view, the unification of the three
championships _ Holyfield's World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts and his own World Boxing
Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800 IF NEEDED, OR CONTINUE TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

   LAS VEGAS _ ``Boxing,'' Evander Holyfield mused this week, ``is
a replica of what life is _ up and down. It's been going up and
down since they invented it. It goes down, then something gives it
a boost and it comes up. It's not going to fade away. But right now
it definitely needs something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of preparation for his rematch with
Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas Saturday night, a contest intended to
produce an undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that the two fighters agreed on during this
week's pre-fight publicity blitz was that sport itself is in
serious danger of ending the century on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour draws near, Holyfield-Lewis II has come to seem less
of a mere title decider than boxing's last best hope for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield implied, prizefighting has never been without its
shadows. But this year has been spent in a gathering gloom,
starting with the attempt by Mike Tyson to break Axel Schulz's arm
in a clinch last January and running all the way through to the
ludicrous finish of Tyson's most recent encounter, when he was
disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the bell ended the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the fiasco of the first Holyfield-Lewis fight,
in March, when a poor contest ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the much anticipated but similarly
disappointing world welterweight championship fight between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, when De La Hoya tried to win the
fight in reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last month, came Naseem Hamed's unseemly display of
body-slamming against Cesar Soto in a fight more suited to a WWF
bill.
</P>
<P>
   When they pay their money, boxing fans know that they lay
themselves open to the risk of sudden and sometimes mystifying
disappointment. Such sensations go back to Sonny Liston quitting on
his stool against Cassius Clay, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the sport, nothing can be guaranteed. But this
year's procession of embarrassments resembles a systematic cheating
of the public, and the public has begun to show its resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's fights have left the fans in a very bad state of
mind,'' Emanuel Steward, Lewis's highly respected trainer, said
Thursday. ``They have a lot of questions. Right now they're on the
brink of deserting boxing, and I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would not have been reassured by the last week's news
of the criminal indictments naming the IBF president, Bob Lee, and
three other officials, who are accused by the U.S. Attorney and the
FBI of taking bribes to rig the rankings in order to produce the
match-ups desired by certain top promoters over a 13-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This week a New York State Senate committee recommended the
creation of a national body to regulate the sport and prevent it,
in the words of its chairman, Senator Roy Goodman, from
``degenerating into a meaningless and violent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously the Attorney General of Nevada, Frankie Sue Del
Papa, announced that her office will be working with the state's
Athletic Commission, the sanctioning body for Saturday's fight, on
an investigation into the way the sport is organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it is that's wrong,'' Holyfield said in his
last pre-fight interview, knowing that the Miami offices of his
promoter, Don King, had been searched as part of the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a lot of different components. People should come
together and decide what's best for the sport. The boxers, the TV
people, the managers, the promoters, the writers. It needs a
collective effort to make it a better sport for everybody,
including the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lennox Lewis's view, the unification of the three
championships _ Holyfield's World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation belts and his own World Boxing
Council title _ would be a first step, providing a single
figurehead behind which the sport could regroup and reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the governing bodies has its own agenda,'' he said.
``The sport needs to be cleaned up so that it's not as dodgy as it
is now. My hope is to be a good ambassador for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a good ambassador would not produce, by himself, the sort of
root-and-branch reform that boxing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will one great fight be enough to refurbish boxing's image.
``But at least it would give a little hope,'' Manny Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the bad decision over the Lewis fight, and the De La
Hoya-Trinidad fight not being a damn thing but a foot race, and
then to come back with Tyson, people feel they've been wasting
their money. So this fight really could help push them one way or
another.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800 IF NEEDED, OR CONTINUE TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sport's image needs Holyfield and Lewis to produce a contest
worthy of inclusion in the all-time highlights reel. When Marc
Ratner, the serious-minded head of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
called it ``a pivotal fight for boxing as we head into the new
millennium'' at Wednesday's press conference, he was not merely
indulging in the usual hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are clearly aware of their wider responsibility,
and have the capacity to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they find, when they are alone together in the ring, that
self-interest once more overcomes the urge to create a spectacle,
then the arena's cleaning staff can sweep up what remains of the
sport's integrity and throw it out along with the rest of the
trash. &QL;

SHIFTING PRIORITIES, GORE CONTINUES DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES with Gore and Microsoft agreeing on ground rules for visit
in 8th graf) 
 (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly eight years of touting himself as the
most influential vice president in history, Al Gore has apparently
had enough: He now thinks that his elected position as
second-in-command is secondary to his run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for president of this country is far more important
than being the best vice president I can possibly be,'' Gore told
reporters Thursday in response to a question about what accounted
for the dramatic overhaul of his campaign in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of thinking like a vice president, which means, `How
am I going to advance the administration's goals and help the
current administration?', I started thinking like someone who was
asking the people for their ideas on how to make this a better
country and then responding spontaneously from the heart,'' Gore
said. ``And once that happened, then I said, `Hey, I gotta move my
campaign out of Washington.'''
</P>
<P>
   The comments seemed striking, given that Gore has always cast
his role as far more vital than mere standby equipment, and
reflects how difficult the job can be, trying to be his own man
while representing the Clinton administration. He is also attached
to the only modern president who has ever been impeached (in fact,
he is the only vice president ever to serve under an impeached
president). And so Gore seemed in his comments to go beyond
distancing himself to nearly severing himself, not just from Bill
Clinton but from his own job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the job carries certain benefits, and Gore has not shied
from them. Just this week, during a three-day campaign swing, he
made two ``official'' appearances, including a Veterans Day speech
in Iowa, that gave him a platform to extol his views of America's
role in the world and allowed him to charge taxpayers for the trip.
Although the speech was deemed government business, Gore used the
occasion to chastise Republicans as isolationists. And the speech
took place at one of the sites where Iowans will caucus in little
more than two months to cast their votes for president.
</P>
<P>
   But even on overtly political occasions, he cannot always escape
the fact that he represents the administration. On Monday, he plans
to visit the Seattle headquarters of Microsoft, as a candidate who
is courting Washington state's largest employer, just as his rivals
have done.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the Justice Department is pursuing a
antitrust suit against the computer giant, Gore, who is the
administration's point man on technology, is likely to be seen as
an emissary whose visit might assuage some of the bitterness
between the government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   (The visit was temporarily in doubt Friday night when Gore
learned belatedly that Microsoft intended to close the event to
reporters, as it had closed previous sessions with presidential
candidates. But Chris Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, said that
Microsoft had agreed to have reporters present and Mr. Gore would
attend..)
</P>
<P>
   Critics are pouncing on Gore's tough balancing act, which they
say is his attempt to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said: ``To say that I'm giving up my job but I'm certainly going to
take the benefits of the job to campaign _ it's nice having Air
Force II, taxpayer-funded advance people to help me against this
insurgent who has to spend twice as much as I do just to stay even
_ it's hypocrisy pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just an elected official who is using the powers
of incumbency to aid his campaign,'' Pascoe added ``but he has now
said publicly he is not going to be vice president anymore. That's
what's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what is different about two Republican officeholders,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush of and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
are seeking to become president. ``They are still doing their
jobs,'' Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, being vice president and running for president is no
longer a conflict; he says he has reset his priorities so that his
campaign for president comes first.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he is not shirking his duties, the primary one being
to serve as president pro tem of the Senate and break tie votes.
But his campaign schedule no longer allows for his weekly luncheons
with President Clinton or for him to be on hand every time a
foreign leader visits Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who know both men say that the vice president believes
Clinton does not need Gore's tutelage on the ways of Washington as
much as he did early in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But they also say the relationship between Clinton and Gore has
become much colder as the vice president seeks to assert his
independence. Clinton has yet to make a public campaign appearance
with Gore, but aides say he intends to do so and that the president
has raised money for him, most notably in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   As he searches for his footing, Gore has been undergoing a
painfully public coming-out process, with regular reports now about
everything from what is ``in his heart'' to his wardrobe to the
inner workings of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are intended to be transformational,'' Gore said,
saying that the process of connecting to an audience and listening
to people's concerns led him to overhaul his style, his message and
his operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started connecting in a new way, I started going
through some changes,'' he said. ``Six months ago if I told you I
was enjoying it, I'm not sure that I really was that much,'' he
said. ``When I tell you I'm enjoying it now, you believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that earlier, when he was asked a question, he would
think about whether he was advancing the administration's goals.
``The shift in priorities that I'm talking about in personal terms
has to do with eliminating that step,'' he said. ``And instead,
when you ask me a question, without hesitation, I tell you exactly
what's in my heart on it, spontaneously, here's what I feel about
it. And if that conflicts with what the administration's priorities
are _ I don't want it to, but if it does _ so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore has distanced himself very little on substantive
policy issues from the Clinton administration. But the political
bind he is in because of his position was evident when he was
talking about Microsoft. He was asked what kind of signal his visit
would send. ``None,'' he declared. ``I strongly support vigorous
enforcement of the antitrust law.'' But he added that Microsoft was
the largest employer in Washington and that his rivals had all
visited its campus outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't comment on individual cases,'' he added, ``I
want you to know that I think the trend toward concentration in
some areas _ and I have agriculture especially in mind _ has been
very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wears his administration hat when he is asked about his
``official'' Veterans Day speech in Iowa. Even though he lambasted
the Republicans for what he said were isolationist views and for
not paying America's dues to the United Nations, as well as for
cutting the foreign policy budget and failing to pass the nuclear
test-ban treaty, he insisted his was an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a speech on Veterans Day to veterans at a VA facility
ought to be official,'' he said, ``and in the process to talk about
how we can honor our veterans by helping to make future wars less
likely is not only appropriate but necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He made another appearance this week that was cast as official,
this one in Memphis, Tenn., on Tuesday night to address the 92nd
annual convention of the Church of God in Christ. The setting was
the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
``Mountaintop'' speech just before his assassination. The audience
was extremely friendly to Gore, who spoke in a sermonlike manner
for nearly an hour about his views on family, health care,
education and included a few potshots at Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said this was an official visit because the invitation
was extended to him as vice president, not as a candidate. But the
audience had little doubt. ``I think this was very political,''
said Lee Shirley, 59, a worshiper from Los Angeles who found Gore
an ``excellent'' speaker. ``No. 1, he's interested in running for
office,'' she said, ``and naturally he wants to win as many votes
from our community as he can.''

VODAFONE MAY SEEK MANNESMAN AG IN BIGGEST HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID
EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS attribution in lede) 
(bl) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the world's leading mobile phone
operator, is expected to announce as early as Monday a hostile bid
that could be worth more than $117 billion for Mannesmann AG, the
German telecommunications conglomerate, and Orange PLC, the British
phone company that Mannesmann has committed to buy, executives
close to the the talks said in London on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Such an effort would easily be the biggest hostile takeover of
all time, surpassing the record $80 billion unfriendly bid by
Pfizer Inc. for its pharmaceutical rival Warner-Lambert, made only
last week. It also would mark the start of a bruising battle
between Vodafone and Mannesmann, two of Europe's most successful
and aggressive telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials spent Friday in marathon meetings in London
with advisers, working out details of a plan rooted in internal
company discussions that began a month ago, when Mannesmann
announced a deal to acquire Orange for $33 billion. That event
began what amounts to a turf war over Europe's wireless
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vodafone had yet to settle Friday evening on an exact
price to bid, executives close to the talks said that the company
was mulling an offer of 200 to 210 euros a share, or $206.26 to
$216.57, for Mannesmann, which has about 389.9 million shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether a Vodafone bid would be entirely in stock
or a mixture of stock and cash, but the high end of the price range
under consideration would value the German company at $84.4
billion. That price is a 13 percent premium to Mannesmann's closing
price Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear Friday night how much Vodafone would pay for
Orange. But if it paid the same amount Mannesmann has committed to
pay, that would make the total value of a Vodafone bid as high as
$117.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials planned to continue working on their bidding
strategy through the weekend, but the executives stressed that as
with any major hostile bid, the company could still decide to
abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vodafone declined to comment on whether a
hostile bid for Mannesmann was imminent or even under
consideration. But the company did issue a statement that
acknowledged the possibility of a tie-up with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vodafone Airtouch continues to evaluate a broad range of
opportunities to participate in the further consolidation of the
global wireless market including possible ways to develop Vodafone
Airtouch's existing longstanding relationship with Mannesmann,''
the statement said, referring to partnerships with Mannesmann in
Germany, France and Italy. The statement added: ``No decisions have
yet been taken with regard to any specific options.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone shares dropped 6.6 percent, to 296.25 pence, or
$4.8105, in heavy trading here in London as investors reacted to
speculation that Vodafone might overpay for Mannesmann. Shares of
Mannesmann continued to rise Friday, up 3.9 percent, to a record
185.20 euros, or $192.923. Mannesmann shares have risen 25 percent
in the last week on speculation that it might be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann is a scrappy and fast-growing company that has become
a major competitor to Germany's former phone monopoly, Deutsche
Telekom AG. It is no stranger to adversity and has made clear that
a Vodafone bid would be unwelcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser said in a conference call
with analysts that he felt Mannesmann's relationship had always
been with Airtouch, the wireless phone company that Vodafone bought
for $60 billion last June. Esser said that deal just complicated
matters for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who last week said he was skeptical that Vodafone would
make a bid, added: ``It would be a tremendous mistake for
Mannesmann or Vodafone to do anything value-destroying rather than
value-enhancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if Vodafone proceeded with a bid, it would be
paying a considerable premium that some considered wildly
excessive. They pointed out, however, that a tie-up of the two
companies makes strategic sense because their mobile phone
networks, now scattered over several different countries, would
create the first truly pan-European wireless operator if they were
combined. That is a huge advantage, because such a network could
offer customers lower prices, better service and greater geographic
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Vodafone might want to acquire Mannesmann as a
defensive response to Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange, which
greatly strengthens Mannesmann and makes it a formidable rival to
Vodafone on the company's home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mannesmann has really forced Vodafone's hand by becoming a
direct competitor,'' one analyst said. ``Vodafone has to buy them
almost by default to save itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone would almost certainly be forced to sell Orange to
placate regulators because it would have a stranglehold on the
British mobile phone market. Executives close to Vodafone said the
company was already lining up potential bidders who would not
represent a strategic threat if they were to buy Orange. It has
held discussions with France Telecom, the executives said, about
buying Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone officials are also debating whether to sell
Mannesmann's extensive land line network, the executives said,
though they added that Mannesmann's land lines would benefit a
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone would also try to sell off Mannesmann's engineering
division, which Esser had already pledged to sell. Still, the
executives said, such a sale by Vodafone could take as long as a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible obstacle is a Mannesmann shareholder resolution
dating from the 1970s that forbids any single holder from owning
more than 5 percent of the company's voting rights, although that
restriction is to expire next June. If Vodafone pursues a bid for
Mannesmann, the executives said, it might take more than six months
to complete, which would make the voting rights issue moot. In
addition, the executives said, if Vodafone could acquire enough
shares of Mannesmann it could overturn the voting rule.

 NETS LOSE TO HORNETS, 96-92, BUT KEEP THEIR FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Who could blame onetime believers if they
abandoned the current collection of Nets in flocks, questioning
their talent and their heart while entertaining ideas of trades and
firings that might energize this often drab ballclub. But the
atmosphere of gloom has not shaken the Nets' faith in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their optimistic comments and predictions of revival after
losing four of their first five games are not just talk. They
really believe they are a playoff contender in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear from their reaction to Friday night's 96-92 loss
to the powerful Hornets before 16,668 fans at the Charlotte
Coliseum. Instead of being even slightly pleased with their
performance, one in which they outshot the Hornets, bottled them up
like soda on defense and outrebounded them, 39-34, the Nets were
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was the response of a winner, not of a team with a 1-5
record and hardly a proud moment to date. And for those who have
not yet lost faith in the Nets, that is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to feel disappointed when you lose and just go
back to the table and find out what you could have done to win,''
said Keith Van Horn, who supported Stephon Marbury's game-high 31
points with 18 points and seven rebounds. ``This isn't a moral
victory for us. This is a loss, another loss, and we're going to
try to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   They have already improved greatly over Wednesday's humiliation
at home against the Phoenix Suns. In Charlotte, the Nets faced
perhaps the most gifted team in the Eastern Conference, a team as
talented as the Suns. But by curbing nearly every bad habit that
has foiled their start to the season, the Nets played like the
Hornets' equals.
</P>
<P>
   And with 1 minute 19 seconds left in the game, that's what the
teams were _ tied at 92 after a 3-pointer by Van Horn. Though
Charlotte (4-2) went ahead for good 24 seconds later on a free
throw by Bobby Phills, the Nets had golden opportunities to win, or
at least force overtime. But Kendall Gill, who played the first
three seasons of his career in Charlotte, had a nightmarish final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   With 46 seconds left, Gill was called for a charging foul. With
18 seconds left, and the Nets still trailing by a point, he missed
a wide-open 17-footer from the left wing. Then, with 11.4 seconds
remaining and the Nets down, 95-92, he had a 3-point attempt partly
blocked by Phills. His Nets teammate Scott Burrell wound up with
the long carom, but his 3-pointer from the top of the key bounced
high off the rim and out with six seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have knocked down those shots,'' said Gill, who
scored 11 points on 5-of-14 shooting. ``I feel terrible. I feel
like I let the team down.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their frustration, the Nets were not too upset to
recognize that this was their best performance of the season. They
shot a season-high 48.6 percent from the floor, while limiting the
Hornets, who entered shooting 46 percent, to 43 percent. The Nets
played excellent half-court defense, never allowing the Hornets to
exploit them inside, and their execution on offense was nifty.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the Nets was Marbury. Displaying the
outstanding floor leadership that makes him one of the game's best
point guards, he made correct decisions all night. His 31 points
came on just 15 attempts (he made 10 of them). He attempted only
nine shots through the first three quarters, then in the fourth,
when the game was to be decided, he scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was so brilliant in the final period that the Hornets
put 6-foot-7-inch shooting guard Eddie Jones, who led five
double-figure scorers for the Hornets with 24 points, on him in the
final two minutes. Still, Marbury, who had eight assists, was able
to get to the hole, draw multiple defenders and get Gill open looks
at the critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   The box score shows that Marbury had eight turnovers, but at
least half of them should be credited to teammates who mishandled
dazzling no-look feeds within inches of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Stephon played the perfect game tonight,'' coach Don
Casey said. ``He took high-quality shots, penetrated and passed
well and some of his turnovers weren't his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marbury, who scored nine of his team's 11 points to help the
Nets turn an 86-78 deficit into an 89-88 lead with 2:24 to play,
would not praise himself. ``I don't care if I had 50 points, 20
assists and no turnovers,'' he said. ``I feel just as bad if we
lose. I feel horrible. I hate losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a good sign for those still interested in the Nets.

READY OR NOT, HORRY ACTIVATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Horry was back in uniform Friday night,
despite lingering doubts over his both ailing left knee and his
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers activated the 6-foot-10 forward before tipping off
against the Houston Rockets. To make room on the roster, they
waived second-year guard Sam Jacobson, their first-round pick in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson, who hesitated to activate Horry earlier in
the week, said the Lakers' desperate need for big bodies _ even
before Shaquille O'Neal was suspended _ outweighed any concerns
over Horry's readiness. Jackson had expressed a lack of confidence
in Horry's mindset in the wake of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not any more confident, but what I realized is that Robert
is kind of resigned to what he is dealing with,'' Jackson said.
``That resignation causes him a little bit of... he's got his toe
in the water. He hasn't jumped in all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He had less concern over Horry's health after watching him
practice the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's in good condition,'' Jackson said. ``What Robert
has is a knee that can lock up on him or tweak him and cause him
some pain. He could play for five games without ever having that
occur. But if he would have said, `I'm not ready, I can't do it,'
we wouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said the extra week of rest helped the knee though it's
not 100 percent healthy. He ran hard sprints with conditioning
coach Jim Cotta in Houston and said the knee held up to the
constant starting and stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in it,'' he said. ``It felt pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the knee could hold up under the strain of trying
to guard the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon, Horry joked: ``His (knees)
are just as bad as anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Pink slipped: Jacobson had slipped to 12th man (14th if you
count Horry and injured Kobe Bryant), but the decision to waive him
was not an easy one. The Lakers were high on the Minnesota product
after drafting him last year, and he had two guaranteed years left
on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   If no one claims Jacobson off waivers, the Lakers will be
responsible for the remaining $1.4 million, and it will count
against their salary cap. But with Bryant due back in less than two
weeks, Jacobson had no chance of finding playing time _ he only
played in three of the first six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``To benefit him, and in preference to some of the wishes that
he and his people had, they would rather have him waived and move
on to another situation that might be better for him,'' Jackson
said. ``We like Sam. He wasn't growing very fast in our system.''

BRADLEY CRITICIZES REJECTION OF MISSOURI JUDGE FOR FEDERAL BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley on Friday said he was
embarrassed by the Senate's decision to reject Missouri Supreme
Court Judge Ronnie White for a federal judgeship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a visit to Kansas City, the former senator from New Jersey
said he was ``appalled'' by the actions of Missouri's two
Republican senators, John Ashcroft and Kit Bond, who teamed up to
defeat White. And Bradley did not rule out the possibility that
race was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that he was deserving of a federal judgeship,''
Bradley said of White, the first black to sit on the state's
highest court. ``I feel it was a dark day in the Senate's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ashcroft, who is engaged in his own hot race for
re-election next year against Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan,
rejected the notion that race was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that Bill Bradley is so far behind on his
propaganda,'' said spokesman Steve Hilton. ``Even Mel Carnahan
isn't saying any longer that the defeat was a matter of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nomination was rejected by the Senate because of Ronnie
White's soft-on-crime opinions....Not 10 members of the Senate even
knew the nominee's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said recently he did not think Ashcroft was a racist.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected White's nomination Oct. 5 on a strict
party-line vote, 54 to 45. The lack of support from White's two
home-state senators was considered pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Ashcroft's actions were racially motivated,
Bradley said he could not analyze Ashcroft's mind. He then told
reporters at the Jackson County Courthouse: ``I can tell you that
when a person as qualified as Ronnie White is not supported on
grounds as flimsy as the grounds that he was not supported on, then
you have to ask yourself, `What is the reason?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's something every voter has to ask themselves as
they look at this in more depth over the course of the campaign. So
was it a motivation? It could very well have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Dividing people through race is ``cheap politics,'' Bradley
said. ``And quite frankly, it is often counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Bradley spoke to about 400 people at a
$100-a-person fund-raiser at the Downtown Airport. The $75,000 the
gathering raised combined with a June event at the Westin Crown
Center brought Bradley's Kansas City-area fund-raising total to
about $500,000, an aide said. Fund-raising experts consider that to
be a robust total for Kansas City, not known as a major player when
it comes to political donations.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Bradley stood alongside about two dozen
public officials who have endorsed him. Among them were Missouri
Secretary of State Rebecca Cook; state Sens. Ronnie DePasco of
Kansas City, Jim Mathewson of Sedalia and Sidney Johnson of Agency;
state Rep. Tim Van Zandt of Kansas City; and Jackson County
legislators Lisa White Hardwick and Scott Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continued to press his agenda of spending about $75
billion a year on new health and anti-poverty programs. Bradley
said his health-care plan is a ``big solution'' to a big problem,
while Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the nomination,
is offering a smaller solution.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has enough money with its upcoming $1 trillion
surplus to finance the programs, reduce the national debt and shore
up Social Security, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some budget experts, though, have questioned whether the surplus
will amount to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's well within our reach as a country given our
prosperity now to be able to do this,'' Bradley said. ``If not now,
when?''

BRUINS' FARMER FINALLY FIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He came back for (begin ital)this(end ital)? For a
nightmare of a senior season? For a sprained ankle and a strained
groin? For defeats, pain and frustration?
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my last few games,'' said UCLA receiver Danny
Farmer, who briefly considered bolting for the NFL after an
All-American junior season. ``I want to go out playing well. It's
all I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he'll depart at full speed. The Bruins' Nov. 6 bye gave
Farmer's injuries a chance to heal, and he spent this week darting
around Spaulding Field with renewed quickness and spirit. That's
good news for UCLA's struggling offense, which has scored 14 points
in its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I feel great, because I don't want to
jinx myself,'' Farmer said. ``But I feel strong and comfortable. I
guess the three days off really helped. This is the best I've felt
since I hurt the ankle (in training camp).''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hope to take advantage. They will play Farmer at both
split end and flanker this afternoon against Washington _ an
attempt to consistently deliver the ball to their top playmaker for
the first time in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer caught seven passes for 196 yards against Oregon before
the strained groin, and he has just five catches in the three games
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep him in the game as much as we can,''
Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Feelin' good II: Tailback DeShaun Foster, who carried the ball
five times in October because of a sprained ankle, is healthier
than he's been since suffering the injury Sept. 25 at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Foster and Farmer need to make plays _ big plays, not 10-yard
plays _ for the Bruins to win. But will the injury-depleted
offensive line provide the time and space to create? The Bruins
lost two starting linemen, center Troy Danoff and guard Mike
Saffer, during the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have them both, but you've got to have the
horses,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping quiet: Asked if anyone had uttered the letters U-S-C
around Spaulding Field this week, Toledo said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even talked about USC. We've got to beat
Washington. They're talking about Washington, Washington,
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster stuff: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher, a key to UCLA's run
defense, will not play because of a sprained left ankle. Pete
Holland, Anthony Fletcher and Steve Morgan will rotate at the two
tackle positions.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Bryan Fletcher is doubtful because of a sprained left
ankle. If he can't play, Randy Hakes, Gabe Crecion and Mike Seidman
will rotate at tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Blake Worley will start at right tackle, true
freshman Bryce Bohlander will start at left tackle, and junior
Micah Webb will be used in relief.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of: UCLA will host its third annual Veterans and Armed
Forces Appreciation Day with ceremonies before and during the game.
Special ticket prices are set for all military personnel, veterans
and their families.

PRINCIPALS SAY STUDENT PROGRESS SHOULD AFFECT ACCREDITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Nobody may be angrier
about the state's decision to unaccredit the Kansas City School
District than its principals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost a dozen contacted this week by The Kansas City Star said
the accreditation process is unfair, badly timed and unrealistic
about the difficulty of quickly raising test scores of urban
children.
</P>
<P>
   Principals said the state Board of Education's decision last
month to strip the district of accreditation for failing to meet
performance standards is demoralizing teachers who in many cases
have performed near-heroic feats with some of Missouri's most
academically challenged students.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all agreed that many district schools are making
significant progress and that the state action will damage efforts
to improve academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people don't have any idea how to truly effect change in
an urban district like Kansas City,'' said Southeast Academy
Principal Linda Lollis. ``They don't have a plan. They don't have
one idea how to do things better.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple is expected to rule this month
on whether to block the state board's action.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman acknowledged the
recent progress of some Kansas City schools in moving students out
of the lowest scoring categories on state assessment tests. But he
said that improvement wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the youngsters can't read at the end of the third grade,
even though they may have made heroic gains, you've still got
youngsters not reading at the end of third grade,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard is the standard,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   But others question whether the state should take such drastic
action largely based on scores on a relatively new state
standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   Some district officials and others say the new state standards
are biased against urban systems in which the vast majority of
students enter school testing at the lowest levels.
</P>
<P>
   They also contend the state failed to give the district enough
credit for making tremendous gains with many of those
low-performing students. Foreign Language Academy Principal Phyllis
Budesheim challenged any district in the state to match the
progress her school is making with its worst-performing students in
the lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complaining. We need to get the scores up,'' Budesheim
said. ``But I think if we're making great strides then we need to
get some credit for progressing. I'm saying let's be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire McCown, a St. Louis University education professor and
former state education supervisor for the St. Louis area, considers
the state's accreditation process biased against districts with
large percentages of low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Under state standards, a district can be accredited with
distinction, accredited, provisionally accredited or unaccredited.
</P>
<P>
   She recently completed research that she said shows the process
is predisposed to give provisional accreditation to districts with
larger percentages of low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the districts reviewed in the most recent
accreditation cycle, McCown found that the 12 poorest districts _
based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price
lunches _ all received provisional accreditation. The 12 richest
districts were granted full accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the state has moved to unaccredit Kansas City and
St. Louis, its two poorest districts, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an economic label,'' said McCown, who also worked as a
consultant for St. Louis during that district's accreditation
review. ``It's like, `Why don't you just look at my free and
reduced-price lunch numbers and give me a label?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCown said a recent survey she conducted found that Texas,
Vermont and Indiana are the only states to consider a district's
socioeconomic status when making state accreditation decisions.
</P>
<P>
   McCown agreed with district officials who say Missouri's
accreditation process fails to account for significant learning
gains in the earliest grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a flawed system that doesn't show academic growth,''
McCown said. ``What it does is says all children should be at a
certain level at third grade regardless of where they start. You
need to look at where you start, not where you're at at a certain
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartman acknowledged a performance gap between poor and affluent
districts and agreed that more affluent students enter school
better prepared to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done over time is allow that to become an excuse
for kids not performing well,'' Bartman said. ``What we're trying
to do with our accreditation program is change that paradigm
because all children can learn and learn well if they're provided
with the kind of support they need and they're taught well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lollis said her school has shown growth, but may never meet the
state's goals. Only six of the district's 75 schools showed enough
progress on the math, science and communication arts tests to meet
state standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many outside forces on us,'' Lollis said.
``Bartman needs to come in and walk a mile in our shoes.''  &LR; 
brk:Lack of home support
</P>
<P>
   Lollis said many of the problems start in the home. She said
teachers do the best they can with the limited time they spend with
students. But that work needs to be supported at home, and too
often it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They place more value on things _ what the children have on
their backs rather than what they have in their heads,'' Lollis
said. ``I see $150 shoes on their feet and no books in their
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers too often are forced to spend class time teaching
social skills rather than educating children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these children are not so nice,'' Lollis said. ``Some
of their parents aren't so nice. These babies come with a heavy
burden on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lollis said the loss of accreditation makes it more unlikely her
school will ever meet the state standards because she expects her
best students to flee the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves us with the best of the medium,'' Lollis said.
``Can they grow? Yes, they can grow. But can they grow at the
progress the state wants? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Holliday Montessori Principal Doug Becker is still waiting for
answers about why his school did not meet the state standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scores are pretty high,'' Becker said. ``We made a lot of
growth from last year. That's the frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth-grade math test, Holliday exceeded the state
average in the percentage of students scoring at the proficient and
advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the principals are feeling frustrated in the fact
that we're working really hard to bring up the achievement and here
we have the accreditation pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the state action also causes unnecessary concern for
some parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know children are learning at Holliday and that Holliday is
a quality school,'' Becker said. ``Now I have to get the word out
to parents...''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone Elementary Principal Debbie Kelly wasn't surprised by
her school's failure to meet the standards on last year's tests,
partly because of a dramatic turnover in her student body. Eighty
percent of Gladstone's students were new to the building. About 20
percent spoke English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those challenges, Kelly expects to see improvement this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know on a day-to-day basis the work my teachers are doing is
terrific,'' Kelly said. ``You have to wait for test results. I
believe the gains are going to be there over time. We just have to
be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly said her staff was discouraged by the loss of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he understands the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also understand that unless we educate the poor that go
to our schools then we are going to have a bifurcated society in
the not-too-distant future,'' Bartman said. ``One class of people
will have high skills and high competencies and compete for
high-wage jobs, and another group of people are going to be
condemned to low-wage jobs because they have low skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't set a standard for poor kids that's different than
the standard for wealthy kids. We're just perpetuating something
that's unacceptable in our society and state if we do.''

NFL GRANT WILL HELP BUILD FOOTBALL FIELD AT KANSAS KITY PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHANI A. BROWN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--A $75,000 grant from
the NFL and the Local Initiatives Support Corp. will help the Boys
&AMP; Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City build a flag football field in
Cleveland Park to serve the club's 24-team league.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grant is part of the NFL Community Football Fields
Initiative, a joint venture between NFL Charities and the Local
Initiatives Support Corp., a community development support
organization. The purpose is to provide nonprofit,
neighborhood-based organizations with money to improve the quality
of local football fields at schools and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Peterson, president and general manager of the Kansas City
Chiefs, said he was excited about the opportunity to provide fields
for young players in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to promote and expand youth football in
America,'' he said. ``It is important for boys and girls to get
enjoyment out of playing football and have a clean and safe field
to play on.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Local Initiatives Support Corp. is often involved
with rebuilding homes, officials there say they realize that
``community-building is more than just housing,'' said Jim White,
senior program director. ``It also has to do with providing
opportunities and chances for people in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than $1.2 million was committed to rebuild 16
fields. The Boys &AMP; Girls Club, in partnership with the Kansas City
Parks and Recreation Department, will use the grant to construct
the field at 43rd Street and Cleveland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made Friday in Cleveland Park as many of
the club's team members, both boys and girls dressed in ``Chiefs''
red-and-white flag-football jerseys, listened and later asked
questions.
</P>
<P>
   They vied for the attention of Kimble Anders and Tony Gonzalez
of the Chiefs, who attended the news conference and have been
active with the local clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Though still on crutches because of a torn Achilles tendon and
unable to play football with the kids, Anders said that it ``brings
joy to my heart to see the kids with smiles on their faces. I do
things for the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs because I want to, not because I
have to.''

NORTHRIDGE'S MESSAGE: HAVE TEAM, NEED MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Looking to fill its 2000 football schedule and its
bank account, Cal State Northridge turned to advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. An ad in The NCAA News quickly led to the filling of
both CSUN needs. The Matadors announced this week they will play at
Air Force on Sept.2, 2000 in the Falcons' home opener and receive
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a guaranteed-revenue football game on the road against a
Division I-A opponent is a trend at Northridge. The Matadors
received $200,000 for showing up for Kansas' home opener in
September and will get $100,000 for today's game against Southern
Methodist in the Mustangs' last game at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems these games are about money, they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to do is look at the national statistics,'' said
Dick Dull, CSUN's athletic director, ``and you'll find that almost
universally (college football programs) do not realize a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   A Sports Illustrated study a few years ago found only a handful
of Division I-A and I-AA football programs are in the black. Most
of the money the football program makes for a university is gobbled
up in expenses accumulated by _ surprise _ the football program.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened at CSUN. The athletic department was deep
in debt earlier this year, and Dull sought six-figure football
games when he started at CSUN in July.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has played Division I-A teams before, but Boise State (1998
and '97), Utah State ('96) and New Mexico State ('96) didn't
exactly set the alumni abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, a former A.D. at Maryland, sets higher goals. When he
found out the Matadors had three open dates next season, he
immediately worked the phones.
</P>
<P>
   He called Washington's Barbara Hedges, who politely declined
because the Huskies don't have an open date for years. Dull also
spoke with Nebraska's Bill Byrne, but chances of a game against the
Cornhuskers quickly dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Dull says he must have a clear conscience when pursuing these
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anybody hurt,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
money there with Nebraska, but we're ill-advised to continue
discussing it with Nebraska. Playing the likes of Florida State,
Penn State and Nebraska simply isn't appropriate for I-AA
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Most I-AA schools still look for big-money games, but the days
of I-A programs loading up with games against weaker programs are
apparently over, thanks to NCAA legislation requiring six wins
against fellow I-A opponents for a team to go to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Several upsets this season, including Troy State over Cincinnati
and Furman over North Carolina, may cause I-A athletic directors to
shy away from games against I-AA even more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to pay somebody $400,000 who will come and beat
you,'' said Johnny Williams, Troy State's athletic director. ``The
team you beat will not want to play you again.We have tried to get
games with schools and been turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy State is I-AA's top-ranked team, moving up to I-A next
year. Plans to move up are not on the horizon at CSUN, so snaring a
game against Air Force of the mid-major Mountain West Conference is
ideal for the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at schools in the major conferences that don't
compete for national honors,'' Dull said. ``We could certainly play
schools in the ACC... I made a call to Clemson, but they are
scheduled through the next four to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, who seems to be a
front-runner to receive the job full-time after the season ends,
said he doesn't mind playing revenue games. He relishes Dull's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we should always do,'' Kearin said. ``These
games are huge for our program for a lot of reasons. They're great
for recruiting. Kids want to hear you're going to go play these
teams.''

ACCUSED SHOPLIFTER WHO DIED AFTER DETENTION HAD CHECKERED PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED FLETCHER and CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Demetrius Davis' life
of ups and downs ended Tuesday at age 38, just minutes after a
struggle with employees at a midtown drug store.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police are investigating the incident, in which Davis died after
an alleged shoplifting attempt ended with four Osco Drug store
employees restraining him on a city street.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Davis had 31 municipal convictions,
including 18 counts of petty theft. He also had two counts of
felony stealing, to which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
two years in state prison in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Store employees said they were restraining Davis after he tried
to shoplift from the store, police said. Onlookers said they asked
the employees to let the man breathe. One employee held his knee to
Davis' neck, even as Davis was being held face-down in the street
by the three other male employees, onlookers said.
</P>
<P>
   Osco officials called the situation ``very tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this very seriously,'' company spokeswoman Karen
Ramos said Friday. ``We are fully cooperating with the police and
conducting our own investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said she could not discuss details of the incident, and
police offered no new information Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' father, Gerald Davis, said his son had been struggling to
find his way in life. Other members of the family knew of some of
Demetrius' legal problems, he said, but not the full extent of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demetrius was a typical young man; he had his ups and downs,''
the elder Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he tried to teach his son to be a good citizen. After
leaving the home, Demetrius Davis began having financial trouble
and fell behind on child-support payments for his three sons. Davis
was never married. Despite his son's trouble keeping a job and
trouble with the law, Gerald Davis said, Demetrius didn't deserve
to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deplore and despise the method used to restrain him,'' Davis
said, adding that the men responsible for his son's death should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know my son's ins and outs. When he is not here, I
don't know what he is doing. But if he is wrong, he needs to be
righted in a proper manner,'' said the 74-year-old pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' death stirred outrage from some in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just showed a lack of regard for the guy as a human
being,'' said D. Andre Brown, who witnessed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Others are taking their outrage one step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go to (Jackson County Prosecutor) Robert Beaird
and ask that he file criminal charges,'' community activist Ron
Hunt said. Hunt and religious leaders plan to rally in front of the
Osco Drug store at 11 a.m. Monday to voice the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took that man's life, and they should be liable,'' Hunt
said. ``Whatever that man stole was not worth his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said he had worked as a stock clerk at that Osco store in
1996 and 1997. ``When I was there, they trained employees to use
force to restrain (shoplifters) for the police,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Manley, who owns Phyllis' Barber Shop across the street
from the Main and Westport Road Osco, said she had seen employees
chase suspected shoplifters out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was not the first time that Osco employees had been
accused of excessive force in response to suspected shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   In July attorney Catherine A. Donnelly filed a lawsuit in
Jackson County Circuit Court claiming that Osco employees had
falsely detained her client in July 1997, thrown him to the ground
and put a knee in his back, causing him to lose consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   She said her client had a receipt and was trying to exchange an
elbow support bandage when he became confused and was arrested. The
case is pending; it was unclear which Osco store was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stores struggle with ways to deter shoplifting, said
David Overfelt, executive assistant for the Missouri Retailers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is training employees to detain suspected
shoplifters and have them prosecuted without opening the door for
lawsuits from victims of an overzealous employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a very strong suspicion, we try to detain them
with reasonable force. Sometimes it gets out of hand,'' Overfelt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stores must ``train employees to not be overzealous in dealing
with a crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demetrius Davis' death, Overfelt said, could prompt stores to
modify their responses to suspected shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unfortunate incident that will have an impact on
shoplifting deterrence throughout the region,'' Overfelt said.

IN HOLCOMB, KAN., 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLUTTER KILLINGS ISN'T BIG
NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   HOLCOMB, Kan.--Taped inside Gary
Jarmer's tattered first edition of In Cold Blood is a
black-and-white photo of Jarmer standing next to Nancy Clutter, the
youngest daughter of a wealthy and popular Finney County farmer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teen-agers proudly display the 4-H Who's Who Key Awards they
won in the fall of 1958 for outstanding leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on Nov. 15, 1959, the bound bodies of Nancy; her
father, Herb; her mother, Bonnie; and her younger brother, Kenyon,
were discovered in their rural Holcomb, Kan., home. The four had
been shot to death at close range.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmer would never again see or talk with the girl he had
respected and admired, the energetic 16-year-old he had danced with
on occasion, who one time told him, ``Gary, you're a really good
dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others who lived in this rural community 40 years
ago, Jarmer felt the raw pain and shock of losing a friend. He and
the community felt the fear of wondering why anyone (a neighbor? a
stranger?) would want to kill such nice people. He felt the panic
that drove many to buy new locks and some to put their loaded
shotguns under their beds.
</P>
<P>
   For Jarmer, the deaths of the Clutters and feelings of loss were
personal. They had not yet become part of the larger-than-life
legend that this small Kansas farming community could have easily
lived without. That would come later, in 1966, with the publication
of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. Only then would the community's
story be filtered through the eyes of a celebrated author who came
across the Clutter name in a one-column article buried inside The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring hordes of reporters, after having their pain
splashed on the front pages of papers ranging from The Denver Post
to The Kansas City Star, many Finney Countians thought their story
reached a fitting conclusion on April 14, 1965. That is when the
convicted killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, climbed the
gallows of the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight, they assumed, would go away, and those who knew
the Clutters could choose their own way to grieve and remember,
live and forget.
</P>
<P>
   Capote's so-called nonfiction novel wouldn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to friends or acquaintances of the Clutters, and many are
likely to tell you they have not read the book or seen the film.
Too close to home. Who, after all, wants to witness or imagine the
violent deaths of people they knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who among them needs to hear again that Hickock and Smith went
to Holcomb on an erroneous tip about piles of cash inside the
Clutter home, and that they planned all along to leave no
witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   But talk to the guardians of the area's two unofficial tourist
destinations _ the old Clutter home and Valley View Cemetery in
Garden City, where the Clutters are buried _ and you will discover
that Capote's work has a firm purchase on America's collective
imagination. Over the years, thousands have visited these two
sites, neither of which appears on the historic walking or driving
tours included in the Garden City and Holcomb Visitors Guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the only reason why people do come out here is
because they've seen the movie or read the book,'' said Valley
View's caretaker, Jim Hahn, standing just yards from the Clutters'
headstones. ``But In Cold Blood just makes it really, really hard
for those who are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   A cemetery employee for 24 years, Hahn said the curiosity
seekers were less abundant this year. ``That's good,'' Hahn said,
motioning to the headstones. ``These people need to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel a few minutes west to Holcomb, and just about anyone in
this town of 1,950 can direct you to the old River Valley Farm, 420
acres that Herb Clutter and his farmhands once tilled and
harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Donna Mader, both natives of the area, have owned
the farm since 1990. Apart from a satellite dish perched above a
window and the dusty rose aluminum siding around the second floor,
the house looks much as it did 40 years ago, complete with neatly
tuck-pointed tan bricks, and a large, flat yard of Bermuda grass in
front. The property looks nothing like a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But, Donna Mader said, ``there's always people calling me,
`Would you show us your home? Would you show us your home?' To me,
it's just unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mader said it was not uncommon on a summer weekend for as many
as 10 cars to drive down the half-mile, elm-lined gravel drive just
to stare at the house. Those numbers increased a few years ago
after CBS broadcast a miniseries based on the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very nice people,'' she said. ``From all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do the Maders invite the curious in. But for a brief time
they did give $5 tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Maders stopped the tours after receiving letters they
believed came from friends of the Clutters' two surviving
daughters. How, Mader said the letter writers wanted to know, could
they make money off the tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Drive from the Mader house east to Main Street, turn left, cross
the railroad tracks, and you will be staring down the closest thing
resembling a downtown in Holcomb. But no one calls it that. There
are no retail businesses on Main, just Holcomb Elementary School,
the old vacant post office, a house that's for sale, a large field
used by the school and the nondescript white building that houses
El Rancho Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's lunch at El Rancho, the talk at rancher Bob
Jones' table was sports. The eight men, including Jones, said they
had not realized the anniversary of the murders was approaching.
Jones, 56, who knew Nancy Clutter, said, ``I'm not too keen on
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane West, the man who helped prosecute Hickock and Smith, is
not quite as reticent. He will reflect on the tragedy of having
lost ``the productive intellect and capacity'' of the victims, with
whom West attended church. But he did not see the newsworthiness in
the 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   So many people, he said, have moved to the area since the
killings, several thousand attracted by jobs at two large
slaughterhouses built in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's basically a nonevent for the community....We've
got a lot who never even heard of the murders. Many probably don't
even know who Truman Capote was,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmer, grayer and heavier than he appears in the snapshot with
Nancy Clutter, stood outside the Finney County Courthouse on
Wednesday. It's the same building he twice entered as an
18-year-old farm boy to attend Hickock's and Smith's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his copy of In Cold Blood, Jarmer recalled the crisp
fall morning when he and a friend, just back from pheasant hunting,
sat stunned in a pickup truck as the news broke on radio station
KIUL. He talked about Nancy and Kenyon. A rueful look came over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were cut down way, way too early,'' said Jarmer, who
retired as a dean at Garden City Community College in 1998. ``I got
to live my life, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he lived through the events 40 years ago, Jarmer
believes Capote's work serves as a valuable document for those who
were not there at the time. His 32-year-old son, Mark, a history
instructor at the college who studied the murders two years ago to
prepare for a course on Kansas literature, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the course, Mark Jarmer took students to the Mader
house. He showed them the seven blue, loose-leaf notebooks in the
Finney County Sheriff's Department _ notebooks with documents from
the case, newspaper clippings and crime scene photos.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmer's course and the notebooks, assembled in the last two
years, are signs that some in the community are beginning to accept
their place in history. So is the Garden City Police Department's
glass-enclosed case that displays, among other things, Perry
Smith's black leather boot, some of the rope the killers used, a
copy of In Cold Blood and a Life magazine article about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that the likes of Bob Jones will ever view these
artifacts. But the years to come will leave fewer who lived through
that crisp November morning, and more who will experience it only
through Capote's literary lens or the movies it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   Those people will be curious.

CELTICS BEAT KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This one went from blowout-in-waiting to seat-squirmer in a
hurry. For three quarters, the Celtics looked and played the part
of Knick conqueror, moving the ball, making the shots, taking
control.
</P>
<P>
   And they very nearly gave it all away in one hideous, 12-minute
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find many teams going 3 for 18 from the field in the
fourth, scoring 11 points, missing four free throws in the final 78
seconds, turning it over five times, and living to tell about it.
The Celtics did all of that, surviving Friday night on the strength
of three good quarters, 80-74, not to mention the grace of the NBA
schedule and some truly abysmal play by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game right out of the trashbin of lockout ball. Neither
team shot 40 percent. One team _ barely _ reached 80 points. Each
team had more turnoversthan assists. The Knicks scored 13 points in
the second quarter, 33 in the first half, 16 in the fourth quarter,
and still almost won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be pretty, does it? It still counts,'' said
the Celtics' Paul Pierce, speaking for all concerned in his locker
room. He had 6 of the Celtics' 11 points down the stretch,
including their last field goal with 4:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to learn from our mistakes and go on,'' Pierce
said.
</P>
<P>
   They're going to Chicago, which in current basketball terms is
like going from Bergdorf's (the Knicks) to Wal-Mart (the Bulls).
They're going knowing they were lucky to escape with a victory, a
victory again owed in large part to the ever-valuable,
ever-versatile Adrian Griffin, who had 8 points, 15 rebounds, and 2
steals, including the game's biggest with 25.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Celtics were in Clinging Fingernail mode.
They had seen a 14-point lead shaved to 3. Allan Houston had the
ball on the left side, just as Eddie Jones did in similar
circumstances the previous Friday night. Griffin stripped Houston,
just as he had stripped Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the play, the classy Houston said, ``On a play like
that, it has to be pretty obvious for a call to be made, especially
late in the game.'' He said he was nicked. Latrell Sprewell,
eavesdropping, said, ``It was all wrist. I had a good view. It was
all wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were still not out of the woods. Vitaly Potapenko
bricked two free throws, giving the Knicks another chance. New
York, which previously had botched three possessions to get closer
than 3, caught a break when Sprewell was fouled with 14.2 seconds
left. Naturally, he missed them both. The Celtics closed it out
with three free throws, two makeups for Potapenko and a third from
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   So ended a game that had many twists and turns. It saw a first
half right off Rick Pitino's chalkboard, with great ball movement,
good shooting, domination of the boards, and a negligible effort
from New York. It didn't help that the Knicks had to play the night
before in Minneapolis, as tough a turnaround as there is in the
Eastern Conference. Add to that an injury (left knee tendinitis) to
Marcus Camby and, well, you could see where this was going.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led by 6 after one, by 13 at the half (New York had
33 points at the break), and by 14 early in the fourth. The Celtics
were having problems with turnovers and missed free throws, but it
didn't seem to matter. The Knicks, who never led, looked utterly
incapable of making a comeback. But they did, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought back,'' said Sprewell, who had 14. ``We made it a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was what in the NFL would be called a ball-control comeback.
An 8-0 Knicks run to pull within 72-66 took 3 1/2 minutes. A 6-0
run took 2:17. But the two spurts, combined with Boston's inability
to score, left the Knicks in a position to steal one after a Kurt
Thomas jumper made it 77-74 with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino called time and said he told his troops to buckle down,
that they'd been there before only a week earlier against
Charlotte. They'd survived that one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling our guys that we were up 3,'' Pitino said.
``It's a lot tougher when you're down 3. And I think these guys
believe in their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   They had better have because their offense was nonexistent.
Luckily for them, so was the Knicks'. New York's first chance to
get closer resulted in a Sprewell airball. The second (after
Antoine Walker missed two free throws) resulted in a Houston
in-and-outer. The third (after a Kenny Anderson travel) was
Griffin's theft. The fourth (after the two Potapenko misses) was
Sprewell's missed free throws. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good defense always has something to do with bad shooting,''
said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose team shot 39 percent. ``But
bad shooting always has something to do with bad shooting as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   That says it about as eloquently as it could be said.

80-YEAR-OLD SENTENCED TO LIFE IN SLAYING WITH BASEBALL BAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--He got no breaks
because of his age. The savagery of his crime ensured that.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis Patrick Doyle, who at 80 may be the oldest man ever
convicted of murder in Kansas, was sentenced Friday to life in
prison for the baseball bat killing of a Leawood man.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Judge William Cleaver handed down an
additional four-year sentence for the attempted murder of the
victim's wife. She survived but lost her ability to live
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a person is 18 or 80, they need to be held responsible
for their crimes,'' Scott Toth, an assistant district attorney,
said Friday in asking for consecutive sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kubik died last February, two days after an intruder
fractured Kubik's skull and left him twisted up in blood-drenched
blankets at the foot of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Bacher-Kubik was beaten bloody and unconscious and
spent months in the hospital. Only now is she beginning to recover
some recollection of what happened that night, Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's confused about why this happened to her, and she's very,
very scared,'' Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that Lawrence Kubik did not suffer very long,
but he knew that Marguerite Bacher-Kubik had. The horror of the
attack was recorded when she called 911 as it was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can forget her horrible pleas for help? Who can forget the
horrible `thud' sounds? Who can forget the scene when police
arrived, with blood covering virtually every square inch of the
crime scene?'' Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   Leawood, Kan., officers smashed through the front door and found
Doyle trying to hide behind a piece of furniture. He was holding a
blood-stained bat.
</P>
<P>
   The story he gave detectives that night is the only one he has
ever given. He did not testify at trial and did not speak Friday
during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doyle, Bacher-Kubik called him that night and asked
him to come over. When he arrived, the couple, both 77, had already
been beaten. Doyle said Kubik told him to ``go get him.'' But when
Doyle picked up the bat, police arrived. Realizing that it would
look bad because he was holding the bat, Doyle said, he tried to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   At Doyle's Johnson County District Court trial in August, his
attorney argued that Doyle suffered severe mental deterioration
that made him incapable of planning a murder.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney James R. Anderson said Friday that he still
believed that.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors disagreed and found Doyle guilty of first-degree
murder, attempted second-degree murder and aggravated burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors portrayed him as a jealous ex-suitor who became
enraged when the Kubiks married. Both were widowed and had been
high school sweethearts 60 years before. They married after
attending a high school reunion last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Friday that Doyle had no criminal record and was a
productive citizen and loving father and husband.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was described in the trial as an affable man who would do
anything to help a friend. Neighbors often saw him working around
Marguerite Bacher's house, and he escorted her to social functions
before she married Lawrence Kubik.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the case had left him with more questions than
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not seem to be a man who would do something like
this,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle will not be eligible for parole until he serves about 29
years of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But he will not be the oldest man in the Kansas prison system.
</P>
<P>
   An inmate from Phillips County is about six months older than
Doyle, according to Kansas Department of Corrections spokesman Bill
Miskell. The man, Bob James, is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence
for child solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 40 persons in Kansas prisons who are 70 or older,
Miskell said.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not have a specific geriatric unit but holds
older inmates according to their health conditions.

NBC'S Y2K MOVIE LACKS A LOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--There are many reasons
to dislike NBC's sweeps-week offering, ``Y2K: The Movie,'' which
airs on Nov. 21. The potential that it will cause Y2K-inspired
panic in the streets is not one of them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This movie is just plain bad.
</P>
<P>
   Star TV writer Aaron Barnhart must have sensed it, otherwise he
wouldn't have dished it off to us to preview. We did a screening at
the palatial Bullers estate Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Roger Ebert, this one gets two Bugs down
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a bad episode of `Murder, She Wrote,' '' said
Finn's wife, before finding a convenient
I've-got-to-take-a-call-from-my-mom distraction to occupy the rest
of her evening. We weren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a cheesy souffle of fact and fantasy. Name a Y2K
disaster cliche and it's here.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most notable star is Ken Olin, best known for
playing whiny husband and dad Michael Steadman in ABC TV's
long-defunct ``thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   Olin this time plays a whiny husband and dad _ and, oh yeah,
whiny Y2K genius.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong. We (Dave especially) like action movies. As
long as something ``gets blown up real good,'' we're happy couch
campers. But ``Y2K'' is a bigger waste of videotape than recording
old Jerry Springer reruns.
</P>
<P>
   A quick plot synopsis:
</P>
<P>
   Early on, a radio broadcast says cars have been reclassified as
``horseless carriages.'' (Fact: This really happened in Maine this
fall.) Later, broadcasters prepare to air live footage of a prison
riot when computer-controlled doors swing wide. (Fallacy: An urban
legend in the making.)
</P>
<P>
   An F-18 falls out of the sky at 12:01:40 somewhere in the South
Seas. Is it Y2K-related? No one is saying. ATM glitches limit angry
customers to $20 a pop. Parts of Paris go black. Is the power
outage going to cascade? Times Square fizzles out, so do
Philadelphia and Scranton. 911? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   A 72-year-old woman dies on the operating table, becoming the
first confirmed Y2K death. A nuclear meltdown in Sweden kills all
plant workers. Could the fictitious Emerald Canyon nuke plant in
Seattle be next?
</P>
<P>
   In the process, ``Y2K'' leaves so many loose ends it looks as if
it belongs in the Kansas football Jayhawks playbook this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My slogan while making the movie was, `Paranoia is our most
important product,' '' executive producer David Israel, a 1973
graduate of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism,
said. ``I guess it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what has sparked a bit of a controversy around
``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Variety, the Hollywood insider's bible, reports that
organizations requesting an advance look at ``Y2K'' include the
National Governors' Association, the Chicago mayor's office and the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   And the Food and Drug Administration apparently has contacted
the network to make sure Y2K doesn't depict lives lost due to
malfunctioning medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers, federal regulators and others have expressed concern,
fearing ``Y2K'' could create a ``War of the Worlds''-like panic
among viewers. Many organizations have written NBC asking the
network to scrap the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The producers responded to the flap by putting one of those
cover-your-rear ``this program does not suggest or imply that any
of these events could actually occur'' disclaimers at the beginning
of the flick.
</P>
<P>
   But from where we sit, it wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   People didn't quit riding buses after ``Speed.'' They didn't
avoid ships after ``The Poseidon Adventure.'' They didn't avoid
high rises after ``Die Hard.'' And there are at least 100 other
reasons to avoid Oklahoma without ever having seen flying cows in
``Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, unless you were getting paid to write a column
about it, it's unlikely you'll stay put past the first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we heard from the money dudes, the American
Bankers Association was putting its collective foot in its mouth by
circulating a ``pro banking, everything is OK'' sermon it wanted
ministers to read on Sundays. Really, really wrong turn, as it
turned out _ ministers hated the idea.
</P>
<P>
   This time it's the Independent Community Bankers of America,
based in Washington, D.C. Claiming that the ``Y2K'' movie includes
automated teller machine failures, the alert the organization is
sending to bankers suggests they talk to their NBC affiliates about
running ``the real story behind Y2K'' the night the movie is aired.
</P>
<P>
   (Take cover, Jim Swinehart over at KSHB-TV. The note includes a
list of affiliates and contacts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite letters urging the network to pull the movie, chances
are slim that NBC will actually do that,'' according to the alert.
``Community bankers can wield some influence, however, in their own
media markets.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the ``Y2K'' movie doesn't portray any ATM failures.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the ``Y2K'' take from Daniel Perez of Jackson, Mich., who
read our recent column about the movie on our Web site
www.kcstar.com//y2k and sent us e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it interesting that all of these business associations
are making a big fuss over NBC's `Y2K' movie. Nobody freaked out
when the `Simpsons' parodied Y2K on their Halloween special on FOX.
I don't think there's been this much fuss over a TV movie since
`The Day After' was filmed around Kansas City, Mo., and Lawrence,
Kan., back in 1983.''

GRIFFIN IS A KEEPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of these nights, the Boston Celtics will win a basketball
game and Rick Pitino will find himself rhapsodizing about someone
other than Adrian Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian Griffin is an unusual basketball player,'' Pitino
declared Friday night in the wake of his team's exciting, but
uneven, 80-74 victory over the New York Knicks before a (listed)
sellout gathering of 18,624 at the Fleet. ``He's a terrific
basketball player who makes big plays all the time for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Griffin play came with 25.2 seconds remaining and
his team protecting a 77-74 lead. The first-year player _ calling
him a ``rookie'' seems somehow degrading _ was matched up on the
left side of the court with New York marksman Allan Houston, a
seriously big-time scorer with six years of NBA experience. Houston
tried to make his move. Griffin knocked the ball away. It was
eerily similar to the play he had made a week ago Friday night
against Charlotte's savvy Eddie Jones, and it took place on almost
the exact same slice of FleetCenter real estate, an area that
perhaps should be renamed ``Adrian's Landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's play did not yield immediate dividends, as Vitaly
Potapenko missed the two free throws he was awarded after grabbing
control of the ball Griffin had slapped away. It wasn't until
Latrell Sprewell had missed a pair of freebies of his own and
Potapenko had made amends with two foul shot swishes at the
13.2-second mark that the game was safely tucked away, but that
hardly diminished the significance of Griffin's defensive
brilliance. The fact remained that there was a big play to be made
and the rook, er, first-year player had made it.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's rather startling line Friday night included two
interesting numbers. The first was 41, which happened to be his
playing time. The second was 15, which happened to be his rebound
total. The man is 6 feet 5 inches and change. He's no skywalker.
But he certainly is a Capital B, Basketball, capital P, Player, as
his coach continually points out.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be known that this came perilously close to being a
devastating loss. The Celtics never trailed, and the last tie was
at 4-4. They had a double-digit lead for the last 5:33 of the
second quarter, all but 35 seconds of the third quarter, and the
first 3:55 of the final quarter. They led by as many as 16 and were
up by 14 (72-58) with 11:17 left, the result of a Paul Pierce
corner 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Aw, but you've been around. You know the NBA. Things can change
in a hurry. Defenses can tighten up. Teams can go cold. Teams can
become collectively brain-locked.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that with 1:59 left, Kurt Thomas was left alarmingly
alone for a foul- line jumper that reduced the Boston advantage to
3 at 77-74. At that juncture, the home squad was working on an
8-point quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Also let it be recorded for posterity that the Knicks had been
operating since the 6:19 mark of the first quarter without Marcus
Camby, who exited with two fouls and who never returned because of
a tendinitis flare-up in his left knee. Throw in the fact that the
Knicks had played the frisky Timberwolves in Minneapolis the night
before, and the odds were all stacked Boston's way. Blowing this
W-opp would have been nothing less than criminal.
</P>
<P>
   There is no getting around the fact that the fourth quarter was
certifiably ugly from a Boston viewpoint. But the first three
periods contained enough solid play to elicit praise from the
mentor, who especially liked the manner in which his troops had
moved to a 46-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrific first half,'' he declared. ``We distributed
the basketball. We moved the basketball. In the second half they
threw up a half-court trap, and against a half-court trap you've
got to move the basketball, and we didn't do that. And we had too
many turnovers in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess who played a pretty nice game? Antoine Walker; that's who.
He torched the Knicks in the first quarter with an intelligent
mixture of shots. He hit the boards (10 rebounds). He made a
Bird-like crop-down pass to Tony Battie for a layup when he could
have cranked a three. And when he nailed a nice straightaway three
(59-45) in the third period, he resisted the urge to wiggle,
settling for an acceptable fist-pump instead. There's hope for this
lad yet.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 Celtics are still in the baby-step period, and it
really is like raising a child, for both the coach and the fans. It
is this team's misfortune to perform in front of a crowd that has
seen basketball played as well as it is possible to be played, and
it's going to take a lot of work before the team could ever hope to
please such a demanding constituency.
</P>
<P>
   What we can say is that during the first six games, there have
been stretches in which both their heads and their hearts have been
in the right place, so at least people know they are capable of
producing some good works. And as amazing as it might have seemed a
month or two ago, it is apparent that replacing Ron Mercer with a
CBA refugee named Adrian Griffin has been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron Mercer is a very good player,'' acknowledged Pitino. ``But
we do have scorers in Walker, Pierce, and (Kenny) Anderson. Having
too many can work against you. Adrian Griffin has no ego. He may be
the most humble player in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night the Celtics may have been the luckiest team in
the NBA. Repeat, Friday night. ``The other night the Pistons had
three days to prepare and were smarting about being 0 and 4,''
Pitino pointed out. ``Last night the Knicks came here after a war
the night before and then they lose Camby. Injuries are part of the
game. We are very happy to accept the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, so far it's been Adrian Griffin and the boston celtics.
How do you like that?

LAKERS PUNCHLESS WITHOUT SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Something vaguely resembling the Lakers took the
floor Friday night at a place vaguely resembling a home court, but
it was hard to tell whether the eyes and ears could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final buzzer sounded (deafening compared to the
crowd murmur), ending a dismal 97-81 loss to the Houston Rockets,
the Lakers were without their two high-priced talents, Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and their celebrity coach, Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest L.A. star on the floor was Denzel Washington, and
though he got game, he can't play center. And he couldn't pen a
script to avoid the blowout.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was serving his one-game suspension for brawling with
Charles Barkley. Bryant is rehabbing a broken hand. And Jackson? He
was ejected in the third quarter after drawing two straight
technical fouls, the second for calling referee Bennett Salvatore a
profanity that might not have been audible anywhere else but which
was easily heard across the Staples Center floor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers bested the Rockets two nights earlier in
Houston, Jackson knew a second win without O'Neal would be tough.
He called the victory ``lucky'' and when describing his game plan
for the rematch could only smile and say, ``We'll probably be doing
all kinds of stuff tonight. Anything that will work, I'll throw
them at the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Only problem was, nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find some different scorers,'' Jackson optimistically
said before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   They never did. Glen Rice, their lone star, finished with a
team-high 11 and was 2 for 11 from the floor. A.C. Green, Derek
Fisher and Tyronn Lue chipped in 10 apiece, but that was it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, exploiting the loss of O'Neal and seemingly
unaffected by their own loss of Barkley, took a double-digit lead
midway through the first quarter. The Lakers, directionless without
O'Neal, never got within single digits the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets shot better than 50 percent and got plenty of
scoring from rookie guard Steve Francis (22 points) and Carlos
Rogers (16).
</P>
<P>
   How impotent was the Lakers' offense? They scored a season-low
16 points in the first quarter, a season-low 36 in the first half
and just 18 in the third quarter. Allen Iverson has more firepower
in his glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's absence was glaring from the start _ from the sudden
appearance of John Salley in the starting lineup (his first start
anywhere in four years), to the sudden disappearance of the Lakers'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Starting guards Derek Fisher and Ron Harper combined to miss
five of their first six shots. Fisher, Rick Fox, John Salley and
Brian Shaw all tossed up airballs. Rice entered halftime with two
points after a 1-for-7 performance.
</P>
<P>
   And when the rudderless Lakers combined to make just 2 of their
first 15 field-goal attempts, even O'Neal's lousy free-throw
shooting seemed preferable by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   No Laker made more than three field goals in the first half and
the only scoring punch came from Green (eight points) and Lue
(six).
</P>
<P>
   Salley, who drew the early assignment of guarding Hakeem
Olajuwon (12 points), didn't hide the fact the Lakers might be in
for a rough night guarding the future Hall of Famer. His strategy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, pray to his god, your god, have a couple of witches come
to your house the night before, hope for a full moon,'' Salley
said. ``Just play basketball. Stay between him and the basket, make
it hard for him to catch it.... You know he's going to do all of
his moves. Just play straight-up defense, that's what kept me in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also gotta realize, this guy's an Olympian, two-time world
champion, MVP, all that stuff. He may be older, but you still give
him that respect.'' &QL;

UTAH'S RUSSELL EXPANDS HIS ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bryon Russell's on-again, off-again saga as an NBA
starter finds him back on the pine in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it's not Russell's reserve role that's out of the
ordinary. It's the reasoning behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a nice scoring spark off the bench,'' Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made himself a scoring threat,'' teammate Greg Ostertag
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other team always needs to know where Bryon is on the
floor,'' Jeff Hornacek said.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring threat? Russell?
</P>
<P>
   The same guy who, when drafted in 1993, was permanently frozen
in a defensive stance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, why not?'' said Russell, on his new role as Utah's
version of Eddie Williams. ``I'm confident I can score.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the Jazz. Russell, who entered the league based solely on
his defensive ability, keeps gravitating toward becoming a complete
player.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has followed one career offensive year with another. It
wasn't until the last season, though, that he officially arrived as
a scorer.
</P>
<P>
   In an abbreviated 50-game season, he averaged a career-best 12.4
points, scoring 20 or more five times. He set a career-high with 25
points against Sacramento in February, then tied it against Houston
in April.
</P>
<P>
   He scored in double figures in 32 of 50 games, and the Jazz went
27-5 in those contests. He was Utah's leading scorer in six games,
and finished second on the team to Karl Malone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   He knows where to position himself on the break, and he
finishes, too. He isn't afraid to drive to the basket. He cans the
three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't reached his ceiling yet, Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we can expect more,'' Sloan said. ``Hard workers almost
always get better, and Bryon has demonstrated that he's a hard
worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is work. Part is experience. Russell is playing his
seventh season in Utah, and he's had the benefit of playing with
Hornacek, Malone and Stockton the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz has maintained its core of players at a time when free
agency has caused an unprecedented amount of uniform swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my point guard, I know John Stockton, I know Karl,''
Russell said. ``I know who I'm out there with, and I know I belong
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the confidence level just grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell worked his way out of obscurity in the 1996-97 season
when he honed his jumper and became a three-point shooting threat _
essential for a small forward in Utah's pick-and-roll offensive
set.
</P>
<P>
   He started 81 of 82 games that season, as Utah reached its first
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But he started cold from the field the next year, and asked to
be taken out of the starting five. He started just seven games, but
still averaged 27 minutes as a regular component in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he returned to the starting lineup, tipping off in
all 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone through a lot of situations, and he's handled it all
very well,'' Sloan said. ``He became a starter, he came off the
bench, he started again, he didn't start _ it's a lot of change for
one player to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gone up and down for him, but he hasn't lost his
work ethic. That to me is the most important thing a player can
have. He practices hard, he runs the floor, he does everything we
ask of him.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Russell hasn't complained, even though a rookie,
Scott Padgett, has been starting in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely weird when you know Bryon's been in the
league, he's respected, he's played in so many big games, and I
look over and see him on the bench,'' Padgett said. ``But he's made
it easy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first five games this season, Russell is averaging 12.8
points and 4.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he starts on the bench, it's not long before he
rips off his warmups. Russell is averaging 36 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes aside, some players might balk at not being in the
pregame introductions, not being spotlighted in the darkened arena.
</P>
<P>
   They have MVP visions, and no room in their trophy cases for a
sixth-man awards.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said those things don't matter to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role ... I don't have a role,'' he said. ``Play when they
tell me to play, help the team win. That's my role.''

MAYAN CARVING IN BROOKLYN THOUGHT TO BE STOLEN RUIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Guatemala, Calif., Mass)  (rk) 
 By   ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acting on an anonymous tip, detectives made an
unlikely discovery Friday in the garage of a home in Brooklyn: a
2,000-year-old Mayan carving they believe was looted from a ruin in
Guatemala and then illegally carried across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in newspaper and packed inside a wooden crate, the
500-pound carving features a jaguar, its ferocious jaws clutching a
human head. Authorities said they believed the sculpture dated from
150 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it was brought into the country for eventual
sale,'' said Detective Ruben Santiago of the Major Case Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they did not know how the object made its way
to the gritty stretch of Pitkin Avenue in East New York or when it
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives questioned the man who lives at the house at 2808
Pitkin Avenue for several hours and released him after he
maintained, convincingly, they said, that he did not know what the
statue was doing there. ``He was definitely surprised when the cops
showed up at his door,'' one detective said.
</P>
<P>
   Property records indicate that the house is owned by Daphne
Naraine, who lives in Jamaica, Queens. She could not be reached
last night for comment, and the tenant listed at the house, John E.
Williams, did not return messages left on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, more accustomed to dealing with the brutal
side of urban life, were both intrigued and confused by the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen in New York, but it's something I never
expected to run across in East New York, Brooklyn,'' said Sgt. Paul
Helbock, one of the first detectives on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they began working on the case several weeks
ago after receiving a tip. Helbock said they had already contacted
the Guatemalan government in an attempt to trace the carving's
origin. ``It's a very valuable piece, and it shouldn't be in a
garage,'' said Marilyn Mode, the deputy inspector of public
information. ``You're not supposed to remove it from Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the police lifted the concrete-gray,
four-foot-long block into a pickup truck, and briefly displayed it
in the courtyard of police headquarters. Santiago said that
photographs of the sculpture were shown to an expert in Mayan art,
who provided details about its age and origin. They would not
reveal who the expert was, but said he was affiliated with a local
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Mayan civilization cherished the jaguar, and its image
is associated with kings and royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite laws in both the United States and Guatemala against the
exportation of cultural artifacts, experts in pre-Columbian art say
that looting from archaeological sites in Central America has
reached epidemic levels. Richard M. Leventhal, director of the
Institute of Archaeology at the University of California at Los
Angeles, said despite stringent rules against the sale of such
contraband, art buyers continue to fuel the practice by paying huge
sums for Mayan relics. ``It's a big, big business,'' he said.
``It's not just a couple of guys who go out digging on the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Information Agency estimates that such thefts have
become one of the top law enforcement problems in the world, with
the items stolen each year having a value of about $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, a U.N. accord has prohibited the import and export
of any cultural property without export permits from the government
of origin. Still, the practice remains widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is currently embroiled in a
dispute with the Guatemalan government over a 138-piece collection
of Mayan art that Guatemalan officials say was illegally taken from
archaeological sites. The museum, however, refuses to return the
items to Guatemala, saying the country cannot produce legal title
to the objects.

DOCTOR SLAIN, PUSHED OFF CLIFF; COLLEAGUE ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles-area pediatrician was strangled by
another doctor and then pushed over a 250-foot cliff in the Angeles
National Forest in her car after an argument over setting up a
practice together, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Anderson, 40, was being held without bail on suspicion
of murdering Dr. Deepti Gupta, 33, an immigrant from India who was
married to a University of California, Los Angeles, professor and
had a 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatricians, staff members at Huntington Memorial Hospital
in Pasadena, about 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, drove to
the Angeles National Forest on Thursday night to talk because they
were having second thoughts about going through with an agreement
to set up private practice partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had gone out and apparently had even leased property and
contacted patients to advise people they were going to become a
team, but Anderson changed his mind,'' said Sheriff's Lt. Ray
Peavey. ``There was a disagreement about the patient list.
Apparently she believed he was taking some of her patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson told investigators it was his idea to go to the forest
to talk, and Gupta agreed, Peavey said. ``According to him, they
were up there to clear the air.'' But he lost his temper when they
were arguing in his car, Peavey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He strangled her, put her in her car, pushed her car over the
embankment to make it look like an accident,'' said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputy Margarita Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who lives in La Verne, about 25 miles east of downtown
L.A., was arrested after a witness saw him use his Toyota 4-Runner
to push Gupta's Mercedes SUV over a cliff on Angeles Crest Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The witness saw Anderson's Toyota 4-Runner right behind Gupta's
car on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the witness drove past, the Toyota appeared to push the
Mercedes over the side of the highway,'' Deputy Joan Raber said.
``The witness turned around, drove back to the location and saw
Anderson leaving in the Toyota.''
</P>
<P>
   The witness looked over the side and saw the Mercedes about 250
feet down the side of the mountain, Raber said.
</P>
<P>
   The witness followed the Toyota, which broke down about five
miles from where the Mercedes went over the side of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies from the Crescenta Valley sheriff's station were
notified, found the body near the Mercedes and arrested Anderson,
Raber said. Gupta's body had been ejected from her SUV. She was
pronounced dead at the scene, and an autopsy Friday determined she
had been strangled before she was pushed over the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson later told his story to sheriff's deputies, who found
no evidence to disprove it, Peavey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's resigned to the fact that he did a terrible
thing,'' Peavey said.
</P>
<P>
   At Gupta's home in Glendale, a city about nine miles north of
downtown L.A., a friend who answered the door said the family was
privately mourning and would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, the family is in total shock,'' said a statement
released on behalf of her husband, Vijay, a professor of mechanical
and aerospace engineering at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and their 2-year-old daughter, Divya.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital were shocked at news of
the murder and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huntington Hospital is very sorry about the course of events
that have apparently occurred between Dr. Kevin Anderson and Dr.
Deepti Gupta. ... Huntington will work with the medical community
to ensure that any patients of these physicians will be
appropriately cared for,'' a hospital statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta immigrated from New Delhi, India, to the United States in
1992 for an internship at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   She completed her pediatric residency at the University of
Southern California Medical Center in 1998 and became a
board-certified pediatrician the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an excellent doctor, excellent rapport with children,
warm smiles and provided state-of-the-art care,'' said Lawrence
Opas, chief of pediatrics at County-USC Medical Center and director
of the residency program. He knew Gupta during her residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be up all night, and you wouldn't know it,'' he
said. ``Everyone liked her. I feel a loss for the profession, but
more for the children who didn't have a chance to be cared for by
her.''

DISNEY TO RELEASE FOUR DIGITAL MOVIES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. gave a major boost to digital
cinema by announcing it will show four high-profile movies,
including ``Toy Story 2,'' in selected theaters in the new format.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, taking the lead in promoting the new
technology, will launch digital showings on the same date as the
launch of the regular release, the first time a film has opened in
both formats simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' opens Friday in digital form at the El Capitan
in Hollywood, followed by a nationwide rollout Nov. 24 that will
include digital showings at the AMC in Burbank, a city about 11
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles and the home of Disney
headquarters. The film also will be shown in theaters in Irvine and
San Francisco, Calif., Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' will receive similar treatment on Dec. 17
at sites in Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Phoenix, Toronto and
Vancouver, while ``Mission to Mars'' will be shown digitally in 12
theaters in March. Disney's key animated summer release,
``Dinosaur,'' will be handled similarly.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Disney comes less than five months after the world's
first digital showings took place with ``Star Wars Episode I: The
Phantom Menace'' at four theaters and ``An Ideal Husband'' at one
site.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology eliminates scratches and faded colors from
repeated showings of celluloid film and generates savings in
distribution. The unanswered question remains who will pay for
installing digital systems, which will cost at least $100,000
compared with $20,000 for a conventional projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new process for cinematographers, directors,
exhibitors and the public, so we need feedback,'' said Bob Lambert,
Disney's senior vice president for new media and technology. ``We
want people to get comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies will be shown using Texas Instruments projectors,
which convert digital signals to light and contain three microchips
with 1.3 million mirrors each. Lambert said each projection system
will be installed for two years with costs assumed by Disney, the
exhibitors and TI.
</P>
<P>
   In previous digital showings, exhibitors ran a conventional 35
mm projector in the booth at the same time as a back-up system, but
the digital systems operated without problems. Lambert said the
decision whether to use both systems at once would be left up to
exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   AMC executive Richard Fay said digital showings of ``Tarzan''
and ``Phantom Menace'' in Burbank boosted grosses without technical
problems. ``Everything went very smoothly,'' he added.

   The restaurant chain's Pokemon toy promotion -- its most popular
ever -- led to shortages at several locations Thursday when
children were off for Veterans Day, but Friday company officials
scrambled to restock.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, they expect the crowds to return. Miguel is
anticipating about 30 percent to 40 percent more business than
usual this weekend and will have four extra staff people on duty to
handle the crush.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, dozens of boisterous kids were lined up in
front of the AMC Promenade 16 in the suburban Los Angeles community
of Woodland Hills, which was showing ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
on three screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a really, really good movie,'' said 6-year-old
Charles Einy of Tarzana, who stood in line with his mother and
friend for an hour before show time.
</P>
<P>
   He owns 73 Pokemon cards and wants to see the movie for his
favorite character, Mewtwo, which he doesn't have on a card yet.
Wide-eyed, he enthusiastically described seeing a young girl in
line: ``She showed me her card, and she has a Mewtwo. That's the
bestest card!'' he said, jumping up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Huge crowds are expected today and Sunday at The Promenade at
Woodland Hills, where a collectors store is hosting a Pokemon Expo
near the theater, which is showing the movie at least a dozen times
a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon Expo, organized by Collectors Guide to the Galaxy,
will feature training for kids who don't know how to play the
Pokemon game, as well as trading, a tournament and display of
Pokemon artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The store will have almost 20 employees on duty but does not
anticipate a need for extra security to control the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids can be rowdy, but they're usually in control,'' said
store owner Kenny Pruitt. ``I don't think they're going to be
beating each other up or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon -- for anyone who has been living under a rock -- is an
animated Japanese import that features 151 characters on trading
cards which kids collect and trade with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The characters, which have become tremendously popular with
children, are featured in video games, TV shows and toys, and in
their first feature-length film, ``Pokemon: The First Movie,''
which was released Wednesday with huge sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some Burger King stores, such as the one in Panorama City,
northwest of Los Angeles, were still reporting shortages Friday.
While the company had expected an onslaught of customers, it simply
could not stock enough supplies in advance, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all we're selling hamburgers too,'' said corporate
spokesman Charles Nicolas. ``There's just not enough room in the
restaurants. We could basically fill the whole restaurant with
toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas said this is the company's largest promotion ever,
topping ones for previous movies like ``The Lion King'' and ``Toy
Story,'' for which at least 70 million toys were given away.
</P>
<P>
   And things might get even crazier Monday, when Burger King
unleashes yet another promotion: gold-plated trading cards, given
away with the purchase of any $1.99 value meal. They come inside a
Pokeball, which has a spring that opens it slowly to reveal the
card inside. Unlike the main promotion, which will last until Jan.
2, the gold-plated cards will only be given out for three weeks,
and supplies will not be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses have been riding the Pokemon wave as well.
</P>
<P>
   Home builder Kaufman &AMP; Broad, which has several communities in
the San Fernando Valley, is giving out two free tickets to anyone
who visits one of the company's communities. Last weekend, that
resulted in a 21 percent increase in customer traffic, and at least
a few additional home sales, according to company spokeswoman Wendy
Marlett.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon trading cards have become so popular across the
country that they have occasionally resulted in violence or theft.
</P>
<P>
   In Lakeland, Fla., a seventh-grader was recently charged with a
felony and may be expelled from school after he attacked a teacher
who confiscated his Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   And in Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles, two students
were arrested this week for allegedly stealing more than 150
trading cards from backpacks of other students at nearby elementary
schools, according to a sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of student fights and disruptions from constant
trading, some schools have taken to banning the cards.
</P>
<P>
   At an elementary school in suburban Van Nuys, the cards were
banned in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play with them, and they get into arguments over them,''
said Assistant Principal Tom Kutras. ``There's been a few
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But theater owners are thrilled with the receipts.
</P>
<P>
   In its first two days of release, ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
grossed $19.7 million and could take in an additional $30 million
in ticket sales by the end of the weekend, according to industry
experts. Thursday's showings generated a slight 5 percent decline
with business totaling $9.6 million at 2,901 theaters. The studio
added 143 locations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears the Pokemon craze won't be dying out anytime
soon. Warner Bros. plans a sequel next summer called ``Pocket
Monsters,'' based on a film released in Japan this summer that will
be reworked for American audiences.

POKEMON MOVIE EXCITEMENT BUILDS FOR KIDS, RETAILERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Burger Kings and movie theaters are bracing for
an onslaught of Pokemon-crazed kids, as the fad hits a fever pitch
in the first weekend of the movie's release and promotional
tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to go crazy,'' said Bonifacio Miguel, manager of a
Burger King in Pacoima. ``There's going to be a tremendous amount
of kids.''

MAN UNDERGOES ANGIOPLASTY AT 105
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Donna Huffaker  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Tough former Marine Arpiar Missakian set a record
by successfully undergoing an angioplasty at the age of 105, his
doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Missakian, who has smoked since his teens and still lives on his
own in Glendale, a city nine miles north of downtown Los Angeles,
was recuperating at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where he was
operated on after suffering a heart attack Wednesday (NOV. 10,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good genes. He's in good condition,'' said Dr. Jivan
Melikian.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon procedure was needed to clear clogged arteries to
the heart, Melikian said. Doctors implanted a metal mesh to help
keep open a coronary vessel following the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Melikian consulted with Missakian's sons, Andrew and Michael
Churukian, who decided to have Melikian operate rather than use
medication that could cause kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not afraid to die. He's not afraid of anything. But his
heart was going to go bad if left the way it was, and we preferred
he stay a whole person,'' Andrew Churukian said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kessab, Syria, in 1894, Missakian entered the American
University in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1913, where he studied dentistry,
his son said. At that time, the Ottoman Turkish empire occupied
Syria and Armenians had to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Missakian came to America in 1920 and worked in a steel mill in
Pittsburgh before deciding to join the Marines, serving as a rifle
instructor until illness forced him to be discharged, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Missakian returned to Syria and married in 1928. He worked the
fields and ran a winery there until coming back to America in 1946.
He and his family then moved to Los Angeles, where he was a metal
plater until 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His grandson, Craig Missakian, a Republican candidate for the
state's 43rd Assembly District, said Arpiar has always been the
leader of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves this country and always represented to us values of
hard work and patriotism that we try to live up to,'' he said.
``They don't make them like him anymore.''

MUSIC-INDUSTRY FIRMS CONSIDER INVESTMENT IN WEB SITE OPERATOR

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Universal Music Group and BMG Entertainment may
be considering an investment in ArtistDirect, an operator of more
than 50 musician-specific Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Universal and Encino-based ArtistDirect declined to comment on
the proposed transaction, first reported by the Wall Street Journal
with attribution to unnamed sources. A person familiar with the
deal cautioned the agreement could unravel and that the size of
investments has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   But such a deal would reflect the increasing importance of the
Internet in the music industry as an effective method of reaching
those most interested in a specific artist or group.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old ArtistDirect, which has 170 employees, filed in
September for an initial public offering to raise a
yet-to-be-disclosed amount for advertising, promotion, content
production and Web site development along with general corporate
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ArtistDirect.com is the home for sites it operates for artists
and groups such as the Rolling Stones, Aerosmith and Limp Bizkit.
It also offers the UBL.com music search engine, the iMusic
community site and ArtistDirect Superstore.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, the world's largest music company, announced earlier
this week it will launch a Web site for unknown musicians. Jimmy
and Doug's Farm Club would allow submission of music through the
site with the goal of signing a recording contract.

LAKERS PUNCHLESS WITHOUT SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Something vaguely resembling the Lakers took the
floor Friday night at a place vaguely resembling a home court, but
it was hard to tell whether the eyes and ears could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final buzzer sounded (deafening compared to the
crowd murmur), ending a dismal 97-81 loss to the Houston Rockets,
the Lakers were unrecognizable. No Shaquille O'Neal, no Kobe
Bryant, no Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest L.A. star on the floor was Denzel Washington, and
though he got game, he can't play center. And no one in uniform
could conjure a Hollywood-esque come-from-behind ending.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's loss was expected, the result of a one-game suspension
for brawling with Houston's Charles Barkley two nights earlier. And
Bryant is rehabbing a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson? The Lakers' coach and lone remaining celebrity was
ejected in the third quarter after drawing two straight technical
fouls from referee Bennett Salvatore. The second technical was
earned with a profanity directed at Salvatore, which wouldn't have
been audible anywhere else but which was easily heard across the
low din of Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jackson missed anything while he was in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wasn't going to stay around and watch that kind of
ballgame,'' Jackson said, ``and I think some of the fans understand
why, because they probably left about the same time I did. It was a
rabbit-ear official that got me out of the game, but I deserved to
be run, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some of what he missed: a wayward offense that shot 33.7
percent and produced a mere 15 assists. A weak inside game that let
the Rockets block 10 shots, six by an unchecked Hakeem Olajuwon.
And a defensive lag that let rookie Steve Francis again run wild,
for a game-high 22 points _ more than any two Lakers combined.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, the misfiring Rockets, sans Barkley, got their
first win in six tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just stuck in mud out there tonight,'' Jackson said.
``We just didn't react. Our key was keep that game close enough so
we could win it at the end. And we just didn't find the energy to
keep the game close enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Close'' disappeared midway through the first quarter, when the
Rockets took the double-digit lead. The Lakers, rudderless without
O'Neal, never got within single digits the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice figured to be the offensive focus, but he hit just 2
of 12 shots, one in each half, and finished with a team-high 11
points. A.C. Green, Derek Fisher and Tyronn Lue chipped in 10
apiece, but that was it.
</P>
<P>
   How impotent was the Lakers' offense? They scored a season-low
16 points in the first quarter, a season-low 36 in the first half
and just 18 in the third quarter. Allen Iverson has more firepower
in his glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice said the lack of O'Neal wasn't the only problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I was feeling the lack of was my shot,'' he
quipped. ``They just weren't going in tonight....
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got everybody shooting like that, you got to look
at it as just one of those things,'' Rice said. ``We played a lot
of ballgames in the last 10 days and I think our legs were a little
tired. We definitely were a step too slow out there at times.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's absence was glaring from tipoff, when John Salley
appeared at center court _ his first start anywhere in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Salley, who drew the early assignment of guarding Hakeem
Olajuwon (12 points), didn't hide the fact the Lakers might be in
for a rough night facing the future Hall of Famer without O'Neal
around. His strategy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, pray to his god, your god, have a couple of witches come
to your house the night before, hope for a full moon,'' Salley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He must have forgotten the rabbit's foot and the four-leaf
clover. Not to mention the 7-foot-1 center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have Shaquille, this is a team we should beat,'' Jackson
said. ``Can they take on this big a load individually? I think it
was an overwhelming load for them and they understood that after
the first half.''
