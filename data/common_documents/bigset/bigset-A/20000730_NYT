Montana an extraordinary Joe
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CANTON, Ohio _ When he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame on Saturday, it would have been difficult to find anyone in
the record crowd of more than 20,000 who would have argued that Joe
Montana was not the greatest quarterback in football history.
</P>
<P>
   No quarterback in history has better credentials than Montana.
He was a Parade All-American, helped Notre Dame win a national
championship and led the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was voted the NFL's Most Valuable Player three times. He
was a Super Bowl MVP three times. On Saturday, he was enshrined
with the game's greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had that El Cid aura,'' said former Raiders defensive end
Howie Long, who was enshrined with Montana. ``He could've been
dead, but they could've marched him out on a horse, and just the
sight of him would've made the enemy retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-year career, including the first 14 with San Francisco,
Montana had a flair for the dramatic that made Hollywood
screenwriters envious. He was at his best when the pressure was on,
directing 31 come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had the right stuff, and he wasn't afraid to make a
mistake,'' said former 49ers defensive back Ronnie Lott, who also
was inducted Saturday. ``In practice, we were competing against the
best, and we wanted to beat the heck out of him. Even though it was
practice, going against Joe so many times helped me understand why
players and coaches who played against us got so frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   In four Super Bowl appearances, Montana never suffered an
interception, despite throwing 122 passes. He completed 83 of 122
passes for 1,142 yards and 11 touchdowns. His passer rating for
Super Bowls was 127.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was the most fierce competitor I've ever been around, and
he's smarter than a lot of people give him credit for,'' said
Cleveland Browns vice president of football operations Dwight
Clark, who was one of Montana's favorite receivers. ``He was
relentless, and it didn't matter what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in our careers, we played things like video games and
pool. He was good at everything. If you could beat him at something
he hadn't played as much, he'd master it in a matter of hours. When
we played pool, Joe was always thinking ahead as if he was setting
up the next two shots. He was always that far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 10-year period _ 1981 through 1990 _ the 49ers finished
first in the NFC West eight times and second once.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Joe hadn't played football, I'm sure he would have used his
personality and competitiveness to prevail in whatever line of work
he chose,'' said Browns president Carmen Policy, who had the same
position with the 49ers during Montana's career. ``He could have
become a golf hustler. He's a pretty good golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, he's great in the clutch. When the money's
on the line, I'm going to bet on Joe to make that putt.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Montana's physical stature that intimidated opponents.
He was 6 feet, 2 inches and 195 pounds during his career, which is
one reason he lasted until the third round of the 1979 NFL draft
and three quarterbacks _ Jack Thompson, Phil Simms and Steve Fuller
_ were selected ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him I was sitting at the counter in a
restaurant at our first minicamp,'' Clark said. ``In walked this
scrawny-looking guy with a Fu Manchu mustache. He looked like a
kicker. I was blown away when I found out that was Joe Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons later, Montana and Clark would combine on one of
the most famous plays in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bill Walsh, the 49ers had finished 3-13 in 1981. They
hosted the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game. Trailing
27-21 in the final minutes, the 49ers had the ball at their 11-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   With 51 seconds remaining, Clark caught Montana's desperation
pass in the end zone for the winning touchdown that would go down
in history as ``The Catch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That pass to Dwight was one of two plays that really stand out
for me,'' Montana said. ``It was a pivotal play in 49ers history
and a defining moment in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other play was the touchdown pass to (John) Taylor in the
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XXIII, the 49ers trailed Cincinnati 16-13 with
3:20 remaining. San Francisco got the ball at its eight-yard line.
With 34 seconds left, Montana threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to
Taylor that produced a 20-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to treat every minute of the game the same and not
worry whether it was the fourth quarter or the first quarter,''
Montana said. ``I tried to do that with my personality as well.
Whether we were behind or ahead, I tried to be the same person
until the game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he grew up in Monongahela, Pa., which is about 25 miles
from Pittsburgh, and his family visited relatives in Canton often,
Montana never dreamed about making the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   However, his father Joe Sr. recalls a family trip to the Hall of
Fame when his son was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Someday, how would you like to be here?''' the
elder Montana said. ``I said, `If you want to be here, it's going
to take a lot of work and dedication on your part.' And here he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, known as Joe Cool to his teammates, said, ``The Hall of
Fame was never something that was really tangible to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for us _ players and coaches _ to say, `I'm going to
be in the NFL. I want to win the Super Bowl. Or I want to throw
this many touchdown passes.' Those are things you can achieve by
working hard and making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get in the Hall of Fame, you have to rely on what others
think about you. When I was a kid, we had family in Canton, and we
used to visit all the time. But I never let myself dream about
being in the Hall of Fame because it wasn't something tangible I
could work on.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Houston fans experienced Montana's magic before
the rest of the nation knew who he was.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 Cotton Bowl, the University of Houston played Notre
Dame in the worst conditions in the bowl's history. Sub-freezing
temperatures left the field covered with ice. Despite the horrible
weather, the Cougars built a 34-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was so cold he had to be fed soup in the dressing room
to keep warm, but he rallied the Fighting Irish from the 22-point
deficit midway through the fourth quarter to an improbable 35-34
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew there was something special because he worked hard,
and he wanted it,'' Clark said. ``He was a terrible loser. He had
to win. It was the only thing that mattered to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had such great vision. He could always find the open guy.
If he had to throw a pass where you ended up getting smashed, he
would run down there, help you up and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that offense so well and could see the field so well
that 95 percent of the time he would find the open guy. That's
probably why a lot of his receivers were able to play so long. They
didn't get killed after the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana was always uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the field
with 10 other offensive players, he was magnificent. His actions
spoke more eloquently than anything he could have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that huddle with your peers, he could get fired up when he
needed to,'' Clark said. ``He was very calm under pressure. With
people talking in the huddle, he could easily quiet the huddle
down. He had everybody's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started talking, everybody was listening to him. And
when he would give directions or change a little something about a
play or tell you, `Be ready, I might come to you,' you knew it
wasn't bull. You knew he had something up in his mind that he had
seen before, and he was going to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Joe's easily the greatest quarterback of all time.
Obviously, I'm biased, but in that offense, he was unstoppable. I
think four Super Bowl rings validates the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana might get physically ill if he was forced to be drawn
into a long conversation about the best quarterback in NFL history.
He would never say he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be mentioned in the same breath as a lot of
those guys,'' he said. ``It's impossible to compare quarterbacks
from different eras. The game has changed so much from when those
guys played and I played. In some cases, some of those guys had
almost a round ball to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just honored to be in Canton with so many great players,
including all those great quarterbacks who got here before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana is a family man who doesn't have to worry about money.
He still does commercial endorsements, but you won't find him doing
anything that requires a lot of talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still live life like a kid, and I hope I never have to grow
up,'' he said. ``The other day, Jennifer (his wife) told me to
straighten my shoulders, that I was slumping too much again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other members of the Hall of Fame, Montana wishes he
could still put on the pads and engineer one more miracle drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I wish I could still be playing,'' he said. ``Sunday
afternoons were special. You can't get that adrenaline rush, and
you can't find that camaraderie on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football wasn't easy, but it was fun. When you have fun, a lot
of people perceive it as easy. I was fortunate to be on great teams
with a lot of great players. Without them, I wouldn't be lucky
enough to be where I am on this very special day.''

Not by Long shot can 49ers hog induction ceremonies
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CANTON, Ohio _ Even a late-morning torrential downpour _ the first
time it had rained in the 38-year history of the Pro Football Hall
of Fame _ could not spoil Pro Football's Greatest Reunion or
disrupt the Class of 2000's induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   With 111 of the 136 living members of the Pro Football Hall of
Fame returning to Canton, Saturday's ceremony was a walk down
memory lane for the record crowd of more than 20,000 and a national
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   After each member was introduced, the Class of 2000 was
officially enshrined among the greatest players in history. Because
quarterback Joe Montana, defensive back Ronnie Lott and linebacker
Dave Wilcox played for San Francisco, the overflow crowd was a sea
of 49ers red.
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted were former Raiders defensive end Howie Long and
Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, who joined his late father,
Art Rooney Sr., as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, the consensus was that Long had given
perhaps the greatest acceptance speech in history.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Long said that baseball may be America's
pastime, but football is America's passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an out-of-body experience,'' Long said. ``It's like
it's not really happening to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just boggles the mind. The Hall of Fame has the greatest
team assembled in sports. It goes beyond divisions and conferences.
Where else would you see Steelers and Raiders embrace. I never
really hugged guys from San Francisco before I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, who went to eight Pro Bowls and won a Super Bowl ring
during a 13-year career, invited his first defensive line coach,
Earl Leggett, to be his presenter.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, who won four Super Bowls with the 49ers, drew the
loudest ovations. He grew up in western Pennsylvania. Montana set a
Hall of Fame record by getting 352 credentials for family and
friends. The previous high was 310 by Don Shula in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what an honor it is for me to go into the
Hall of Fame with two other 49ers, especially Ronnie,'' Montana
said. ``Ronnie was part of that initial flip of the page with the
49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana invited former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., a native
of Youngstown, Ohio, to be his presenter.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, who won five Super Bowls as an owner, was forced by
the NFL to sell his share of the team to his sister. He now resides
in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who won four Super Bowls with the 49ers but also played
with the Raiders and Jets, was presented by his father, Roy Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put the (Hall of Fame) jacket on, a lot of people were
putting it on with me,'' Lott said. ``Being here today gives me a
tingle inside, kind of like the tingle I got when I really hit
somebody hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott was known as one of the hardest hitters in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I miss the feeling of hitting someone, but I know I
can't do it anymore,'' he said. ``I wanted to leave the game
exhausted. When they kicked me out _ took away my scholarship, so
to speak _ I didn't want to have a feeling that I had one more hit
in me. And I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of this year's inductees said the most impressive thing
about the festivities was meeting the other members, especially
those they had grown up admiring and emulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie Brian's Song showed me how you're supposed to treat
a teammate,'' Lott said about the 1970 film that showed the close
relationship between Bears running backs Gale Sayers and Brian
Piccolo, who died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know Gale Sayers, but he was a hero of mine, and
then I got to meet him. Man, I've just been so incredibly
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame festivities continue today when the members
play a golf tournament at Firestone Country Club in Akron. San
Francisco and New England play the annual preseason game Monday
night in Canton.

Astros stumble after early fumbles
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ An epidemic of amnesia apparently overcame the Astros on
Saturday as the team seemed to forget all the things that helped
put together a season-high five-game winning streak before arriving
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros committed four errors _ not to mention a couple of
other botched plays _ and walked eight batters in a 13-5 loss to
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the ugliest _ if not the ugliest _ showings in a
season that has seen many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the errors were the biggest part of our problems,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ``If we hadn't made all of those
errors, we might have been able to keep the game close enough to
play for the win. It was an extremely sloppy game.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, pitcher Shane Reynolds (7-8) had to leave
the game after the first inning because of recurring tightness in
his lower back. His status will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   The injury obviously affected Reynolds' performance _ the Braves
got to him for four runs before his early exit. Atlanta scored four
more in the second inning and three in the third en route to a
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied a season high for runs allowed, surrendering 13
for the fifth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has days like this,'' second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``You're probably going to have five games like this during
the course of the year, and about five of them are going to go your
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to expect to win when you make four errors and walk
a lot of guys. It was a tough day in general; it seemed like we
were standing out there a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Every member of the infield committed an error except for Julio
Lugo, who has been the Astros' most error-prone fielder this
season. Bagwell committed a fielding error in the first, Chris
Truby in the second and Biggio in the third, when catcher Tony
Eusebio chipped in with a throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves benefited from three unearned runs, and three of the
walks also led directly to runs. After winning five straight, the
Astros have dropped two in a row to fall to 8-8 since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no shame in losing to the Braves, who own
the best record in the National League. Rafael Furcal, Andruw Jones
and Keith Lockhart led a 14-hit attack with three apiece, and Wally
Joyner drove in four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter John Burkett (8-4) spaced nine hits over seven
innings, allowing five runs.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of two-run homers _ by Javy Lopez and Joyner _
highlighted the Braves' four-run innings in the first and second.
Jones' two-run single gave Atlanta an eight-run lead after just
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say the Astros were victims of fatigue
Saturday after Friday's rain-delayed game kept them on the field
until 1 a.m. But the Braves were in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get much rest,'' Bagwell said. ``But neither did the
Braves. It's a little better when you get to be at home and sleep
in your own bed, but there is no excuse for the way we played. We
made a bunch of mistakes, and they capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros responded to the Braves' first-inning wakeup call by
scoring three runs with a two-out rally in the second. Eusebio hit
a solo homer, Daryle Ward had a pinch RBI triple and Lugo singled
home a run.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about as much noise as the offense could make all
day, and by then it already was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie relievers Jason Green and Wayne Franklin were pressed
into emergency duty after Reynolds' exit, and neither responded to
the challenge. Green allowed seven runs (five earned) and walked
five batters in two innings. Franklin surrendered two runs on six
hits and three walks in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Both walked Burkett, which perhaps says all you need to know
about what kind of day it was. Burkett was one of three batters
Green walked on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burkett might be the worst-hitting pitcher in the league, and
we walked him twice,'' Dierker said. ``Our young guys might have
better arms than some of the other guys, but today they learned the
hard way about walks.''

GREEN TRYING TO END SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green
continues to work at his swing in the batting cage and keep a
positive mindset, but his frustration remains even though he's
beginning to show signs of breaking out of a funk.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed in the worst month of his career, Green's average is at
.282. He ended a longest-of-the-season 0-for-18 slump with a
sixth-inning single Saturday and has hit the ball hard lately, but
it isn't making the matter easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not locked in, but I know I've lined out I don't know how
many times,'' said Green, who went 2 for 4 in Saturday's loss to
the Phillies. ``It's a lot nicer to see hits falling. You hit a few
bloopers and you feel better at the end of the day than with two
line outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' best string of the season _ nine wins in 12 games _
has somewhat masked Green's dismal month, but until he starts
hitting again, it means less quality pitches for left fielder Gary
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   During Green's 0-for-18 slide, Sheffield went 3 for 12 with
eight walks and saw few good pitches. Green, who batted .260 with
two homers and 18 RBI in June, is batting .198 (19 for 96) with
five homers and 13 RBI in July _ not exactly what the club had in
mind when they traded for him and signed him to a six-year, $84
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get locked in, you'll know,'' Green said. ``Obviously,
I want to produce, drive in runs, do that stuff, get a lot of hits.
But sometimes you have to crawl before you can walk. I'm hitting
the ball hard. That's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dealin' Darren: After an awful stretch in which the Dodgers
wondered just when, if ever, things would click for right-hander
Darren Dreifort, the time apparently has arrived. Dreifort is 3-0
with a 1.29 ERA since the All-Star break, but manager Davey Johnson
said he will continue to monitor Dreifort's pitch count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he went through a stretch where his elbow was bothering
him, and knowing Dreif, he maybe went through a period where his
knee was bothering him,'' Johnson said. ``I'm going to be careful
with him, keep his pitches to around 90 to 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has had arm troubles that prematurely ended his last
two seasons. The right-hander has allowed two hits in seven innings
in each of his last two starts, but he's been held under 100
pitches each time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is trying to limit Dreifort's innings, because he has an
eye for September, a place Dreifort hasn't seen often. His 43
innings pitched in September are half the number he's thrown in any
other month.
</P>
<P>
   And if Dreifort and the Dodgers remain in the race, it'll be
interesting to watch how Johnson uses his catchers. Dreifort is 3-5
with a 5.38 ERA when either Todd Hundley or Paul LoDuca start, 4-2
with a 2.78 ERA with Chad Kreuter catching.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking left: The Dodgers' bullpen might be one of the best
in baseball, but it doesn't just lack the big-time lefty who could
be used late in games. It lacks a lefty, period.
</P>
<P>
   While Dodgers management continues to look, they believe the
situation isn't dire because there aren't any available
left-handers better than the right-handers the Dodgers possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd need to be good, real good, to fit into this bullpen,''
Dodgers assistant general manager Bill Geivett said. ``That's
really the issue. I think the classic bullpen has a dominant lefty
in it. But the way our bullpen is, it would be tough to find one
available who would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' current lot of relievers are holding left-handed
hitters to a .214 average, led by Mike Fetters. Lefties are hitting
.146 off Fetters, followed by Antonio Osuna (.172), Terry Adams
(.183), Matt Herges (.242) and Jeff Shaw (.328). Gregg Olson hasn't
yielded a hit in two at-bats.

   PHILADELPHIA _ The trading deadline remains a day away and
postseason roster setting is more than a month away.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers have 59 games remaining _ six against
Arizona and three against San Francisco. There is plenty of time
for the playoff race to be decided, but there is also something to
be said for wasted chances.
</P>
<P>
   With the Diamondbacks and Giants losing, the Dodgers did nothing
to move closer, losing to the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0 Saturday at
Veterans Stadium to remain in third place, 2 games out of first in
the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too early (to scoreboard watch), but the fact of the
matter is you have to win it yourself,'' Dodgers right-hander Kevin
Brown said. ``You can't depend on somebody else losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stunner for the Dodgers was losing a game Brown
started against a Phillies rookie making only his fifth start.
Brown (10-4) battled through six innings in which he allowed three
runs on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also walked four, equaling the number of walks he issued
in his last four starts (31 innings) and telling the story of what
kind of night it was for him.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Phillies right-hander Cliff Politte (2-2),
recalled from the minors as an emergency starter because of an
injury to Paul Byrd, baffled Dodgers hitters. Politte yielded just
four hits and struck out six in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going against a guy who's 10-3 with some of the best
stuff in the game,'' Politte said. ``You try to match him pitch for
pitch, but I certainly don't have that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't have his typical stuff, but he managed to keep the
Dodgers close. However, for the third time in his four losses, the
Dodgers failed to score a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 1-0 lead in the first on Scott Rolen's RBI
groundout and made it 3-0 in the fifth on a run-scoring double by
Mickey Morandini and an RBI groundout from Bobby Abreu.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ricky Ledee watched his new team from the
bench yesterday, but the seat was only temporary. Beginning today,
Ledee will get the opportunity to prove he's more than an
overvalued prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, acquired Friday from the Cleveland Indians in a trade for
David Segui, arrived at The Ballpark in Arlington yesterday.
Manager Johnny Oates wanted to give him a day to get acclimated and
meet his new teammates but said he'll play right field and bat
sixth today.
</P>
<P>
   And after that?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll play a lot,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The playing time could give the 26-year-old outfielder the
opportunity to match his potential with production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give me an opportunity I'm going to try to do my best,
play hard and whatever happens, happens,'' Ledee said. ``I want to
establish myself. I don't want to be just one more player. I want
to be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee had the look of a future star when he hit .305 with 29
home runs and 101 runs batted in between Double-A Norwich and
Triple-A Columbus in the New York Yankees system in 1996. He
displayed good power and speed, and a strong arm in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   That potential remains largely untapped.
</P>
<P>
   He made it to the majors in '98, and has shown flashes of his
talent with 19 home runs and 91 RBI in 583 career at-bats. But his
average is .254.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very talented,'' said Rangers outfielder Chad Curtis,
Ledee's teammate with the Yankees in '98 and '99. ``He's got one of
those sweet swings that everybody talks about, but he's struggled
being consistent with it in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   After being a part-time player on the Yankees' World
Series-winning teams in '98 and '99, when he also spent time in the
minors, Ledee was supposed to have a chance to win the left-field
job outright this season.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to capitalize, and after hitting .241 in 62 games was
traded to the Indians on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee said the chance to win the job was an illusion, because
the Yankees wouldn't leave him in the lineup through good times and
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a lot, but if you had one bad game you were sitting
again,'' he said. ``It's not fair for any young player. If you have
a bad game, you're going to start wondering or trying to get a hit
to see if you can play the next day. It's frustrating to play like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He played regularly with the Indians, but when general manager
John Hart decided to make a run at the wild-card position Ledee and
his potential were on the move to Texas for the proven bat of
Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee is glad for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want me to hit and start playing like I know how to,''
he said. ``That's what I want, too. I really don't feel like
waiting and waiting to see it happen. I want it to happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get his chance beginning tonight.

DODGERS WASTE OPPORTUNITY

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The trading deadline remains a day away and
postseason roster setting is more than a month away.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers have 59 games remaining _ six against
Arizona and three against San Francisco. There is plenty of time
for the playoff race to be decided, but there is also something to
be said for wasted chances.
</P>
<P>
   With the Diamondbacks and Giants losing, the Dodgers did nothing
to move closer, losing to the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0 Saturday at
Veterans Stadium to remain in third place, 2 games out of first in
the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too early (to scoreboard watch), but the fact of the
matter is you have to win it yourself,'' Dodgers right-hander Kevin
Brown said. ``You can't depend on somebody else losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stunner for the Dodgers was losing a game Brown
started against a Phillies rookie making only his fifth start.
Brown (10-4) battled through six innings in which he allowed three
runs on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also walked four, equaling the number of walks he issued
in his last four starts (31 innings) and telling the story of what
kind of night it was for him.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Phillies right-hander Cliff Politte (2-2),
recalled from the minors as an emergency starter because of an
injury to Paul Byrd, baffled Dodgers hitters. Politte yielded just
four hits and struck out six in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going against a guy who's 10-3 with some of the best
stuff in the game,'' Politte said. ``You try to match him pitch for
pitch, but I certainly don't have that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't have his typical stuff, but he managed to keep the
Dodgers close. However, for the third time in his four losses, the
Dodgers failed to score a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 1-0 lead in the first on Scott Rolen's RBI
groundout and made it 3-0 in the fifth on a run-scoring double by
Mickey Morandini and an RBI groundout from Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the job,'' Brown said. ``I need to pitch better. I
made a couple of mistakes and it cost us.`'
</P>
<P>
   Politte located his fastball well and kept his pitches on the
outer half of the plate. It didn't help that the Dodgers weren't
patient and failed in their few chances.
</P>
<P>
   The leadoff hitter reached twice, in the fifth and ninth
innings, but never got past second base. Left fielder Gary
Sheffield, fourth in the NL with 87 RBI, didn't have a runner on
base in all four of his plate appearances as Todd Hollandsworth and
Mark Grudzielanek combined to go 0 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much time left, you can't beat yourselves up over
something like this,'' Hollandsworth said. ``We have to come out
here (today) and win the series. That's what it's all about. We
definitely wanted to go out there and win this ballgame for Brownie
and for the team. We've been playing real well, but you have to
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was the only baserunner to reach to third, singling
with one out in the eighth, moving to second on Shawn Green's
single and to third on a two-out walk to Todd Hundley that loaded
the bases. But Adrian Beltre, who had three hits in his last three
at-bats with the bases loaded, grounded into a fielder's choice to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the way things were stacking up around the league, this
is one we need to win and catch up a little bit, but we didn't get
it done and we had our chances,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``That's why this game is so great. You can't always predict
the outcome.''

 GYMNASTICS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For months, all the talk had been about the
Magnificent 7 minus 2. Could Shannon make it back? How about
Dominique? Awesome Dawesome? Et cetera, et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   Except this wasn't a trip down memory lane. It was the US
Gymnastics Championships, prelude to next month's Olympic trials at
the FleetCenter. And when the math was done Saturday &UR;  &LR; night on the
floor of the Kiel Center, the teenagers had grabbed the spotlight
away from the twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past Olympians are absolutely awesome for coming back,''
declared 18-year-old Elise Ray, after she'd dethroned two-time
all-around champion Kristen Maloney by less than three-10ths of a
point. ``But I think it's great that we can compete with them all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, Maloney, and the rest of last year's world team did more
than compete with the Class of 1996. They dominated them, sweeping
the top five places with Jamie Dantzscher, Vanessa Atler, and
Alyssa Beckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Atlanta gold medalists were stunned. ``I'm not
surprised,'' said Dominique Moceanu. ``We haven't been training the
last four years the way those girls have. Most of us have only been
training for six months. To finish where we finished, that's pretty
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Chow, who withdrew from Stanford to try for a reprise at 22,
was sixth. Moceanu, who hadn't competed in two years before this
month, climbed up from 10th after the prelims to eighth. And
Dominique Dawes, bidding for her third Olympic team at 23, was
ninth after training seriously for only four months.
</P>
<P>
   All of them easily made the 12-woman cut for the trials, where
they may well be joined by fellow gold medalists Shannon Miller and
Jaycie Phelps, who withdrew after the prelims and are asking for
injury waivers.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the Magnificent 7 minus 2 can crank up their skills
during the next fortnight, they'll be hoping for one of the three
wild-card spots the selection committee will hand out in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Only the three gymnasts with the top combined scores from
nationals and trials are automatic and Ray and the 19-year-old
Maloney look like locks. They were separated by decimal points all
meet long (Maloney led by five-100ths after the prelims) and were
head to head in the same rotation Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. And it wasn't
until Ray hit both her vaults in the finale that she nailed it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' exulted Ray, who had knee arthroscopy last month.
``This is such a dream of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray had been the top American finisher (eighth) at last year's
world championships, but Maloney had pulled out injured. Then
Maloney had missed four months of training after shoulder and leg
surgeries last fall. So she was expecting anything but a walkover
coronation here. ``It was my first event since worlds,'' Maloney
said. ``So I'm really happy with how I did and how I ended up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ray hadn't botched her vault in the prelims, she would have
taken the lead into Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. As it was, she grabbed it
right from the start, icing her bars routine for a 9.85 before
Maloney got a 9.60. Then Ray added some padding on beam with a 9.70
to Maloney's 9.575. The floor was all but a wash _ 9.85 for
Maloney, 9.80 for Ray.
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to vault, Ray's weakest event. After Maloney hit
it for a 9.425, Ray needed only 9.2 to win _ but she didn't know
that. ``I'm glad I didn't know how much I needed,'' Ray said. ``I
knew I needed to do better than I did on Thursday, but I wasn't
sure by how much.''
</P>
<P>
   So she decided to attack. ``I wanted to go after it, no matter
what,'' Ray said. After scoring a 9.35 on her first bid, she needed
only to avoid a butt-landing to win. But Ray decided to go out
boldly and asked coach Kelli Hill if she could use a Yurchenko
double full, which she'd never tried in competition. Hill assented,
and watched Ray land it for a total of 9.425 _ the same as
Maloney's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really happy for her,'' saluted Maloney, who would
have been the first woman since Kim Zmeskal (1990-92) to win three
straight titles. ``She's an awesome gymnast. She's come a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the rest of the Class of 1999, which came back sixth and
shaky from China last year. What they wanted to prove here was that
US women's gymnastics didn't end when the Magnificent 7 left
Atlanta with their gold medals. ``A lot of the attention was on
them,'' Maloney said. ``I think me and Elise and Jamie showed them
that we're still here.''

CHANG NO HELP TO YOUTH MARKETING CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Obviously it is about time Michael Chang steps
aside and lets the younger players have the stage. Michael, here's
a gold watch. Don't let the door hit you. Check out that sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's not Chang's tennis that suggests his moment has passed.
Saturday he defeated Justin Gimelstob in two of three sets to
advance to the final against Jan-Michael Gambill in the pro
tournament at UCLA. So he still has a game.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Association of Tennis Professionals that seems to have
decreed Chang is old news. Who are we to argue?
</P>
<P>
   The ATP has unveiled an ad campaign to familiarize the public
with ``the young players currently invigorating the men's game.''
You might have seen it this week in a national newspaper and a
national news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the winking headline, ``New Balls Please,'' stand seven
grim-faced young men with rackets. They're identified in a caption:
Gambill, Lleyton Hewitt, Tommy Haas, Gustavo Kuerten, Juan Carlos
Ferrero, Nicolas Lapentti and Roger Federer. Don't feel bad if
you've never heard of half of them. Each is 23 or younger and
Federer has never won a pro tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Let's let the ATP Tour newsletter explain what's going on here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following a series of photo shoots taken during Wimbledon and
the UBS Open in Gstaad, phase one of the campaign, developed in
conjunction with the Tour's advertising and PR agency
Burson-Marsteller, shows the players striking gladiatorial poses on
imposing black and white backgrounds,'' International Tennis Weekly
reports.
</P>
<P>
   This is how athletes make their reputations these days
</P>
<P>
   in conjunction with an advertising and PR agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the `New Balls Please' campaign,'' ATP Tour
public-relations vice president Matt Rapp is quoted saying in the
newsletter, ``we have struck a balance between a classic tennis
statement and a touch of irreverence.''
</P>
<P>
   Burson-Marsteller's Johnathan Trimble adds that ``the players
all left (the photo shoot) with a sense that something really
exciting was happening. It is a great opportunity for fanatics and
those new to the game to see that these new players are enjoying
life both on and away from the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, from the looks on their mugs, they don't appear to be
enjoying themselves as much as they appear to be standing in
barrels full of spiders. But we'll take anybody's word for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   The point of all this, as an ATP official explained to me
Saturday, is that the tour is eager to prepare its fans for the day
when established stars Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi and Chang
retire. Agassi is 30, Sampras and Chang 28, but there's no use
waiting for the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   There's also no use, the ATP must think, in waiting until the
young Turks (and Australians, Brazilians and Germans) accomplish
something worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP apparently thinks it's hopelessly old-school to let
athletes find fame and infamy based on their results, which is the
quaint way sports used to work, before the NBA pioneered a
different idea.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's Australian Open victory, Sampras' seventh Wimbledon and
Chang's rebound apparently aren't invigorating enough for the men's
game. It needs to show off the ``intriguing personalities'' to whom
Rapp refers.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't do it like this when Chang was one of the
youngsters. He won the French Open (at age 17 in 1989), !ital!then
got his face in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if it's deserved, they should be there,'' Chang said
Saturday of the players in the ads, without actually saying if he
thought it's deserved. ``Obviously, for the game to survive, you
need to have new faces and new talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang considers himself ``one of the young guys among the older
generation'' on tour.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Chang is striking a blow for that older generation.
He humbled Gimelstob, who's 23. He ought to be favored over
Gambill, who's 23.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, we can only hope he hasn't set back the ATP
marketing plan too badly.

CHANG IN FIRST FINAL SINCE '98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DELBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was patience and maturity over power and
emotion, and perhaps more important for the shrinking Mercedes-Benz
Cup, a good name for its marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang might have almost fallen off the tennis map last
year, but he was very much alive Saturday afternoon when he
overcame Justin Gimelstob's quick start by sweeping the last 11
games and advancing into today's final.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 28, will try to overcome another power player in
Jan-Michael Gambill to capture his first tournament title in 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's career comeback appeared in trouble Saturday when he
lost the first set 6-3, then quickly fell behind 1-3 in the second.
The intense Gimelstob was forcing the pace and appeared ready to
take control.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was a right-knee bruise suffered diving for the
ball before winning the set's fourth game, the sweltering afternoon
heat or the perseverance of Chang, Gimelstob was never heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   Chang won the semifinal 3-6, 6-3, 6-0, leaving the Mercedes-Benz
Cup with the closest thing it has left to a headliner going into
today's 2 p.m. final.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of tennis' big names failing to show, bailing
because of injury, being defaulted or upset, the Mercedes-Benz
desperately needed someone of note in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chang has enjoyed top billing in a while. The Orange
County product failed to make a final for the first time in 11
years in 1999. The former French Open champion saw his ATP ranking
fall as low as No. 76.
</P>
<P>
   This year he has slowly been trying to rebuild his career. The
Mercedes-Benz marked the fourth semifinal he's reached this season.
He has pushed his ranking to No. 34, a number that will lower after
surviving Gimelstob's fast start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely tried to hang in there,'' Chang said. ``That was
pretty much what I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I was back in a final. I feel very
blessed to have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempermental Gimelstob was feeling something much different
but was still feeling plenty. At different times as the match
started to slip away, he yelled at someone to turn off a cell
phone, threw his racket and ripped his shirt off.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the match was over, he punched a locker and had to
have his right hand examined at UCLA Medical Center. He returned
later to complete his doubles semifinal with Rick Leach but dropped
it in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   All and all, not the day the former UCLA star had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got a little flustered,'' Gimelstob said.
``Experience was a tell-tale sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make any errors. He stayed the course and I didn't.
I lost sight of what I was trying to do. . . . I got very scattered
and made a lot of errors and he didn't. I lost the match mentally
and emotionally, not physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered has seldom looked like this: During one stretch, Chang
won 35 of 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob's emotional play had served him well when he served up
the week's biggest upset, knocking off the highest-seeded player,
Mark Philippoussis, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion in the second semifinal belonged to Frenchman Arnaud
Clement, who showed plenty of touch in winning the opening set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Gambill came storming back to sweep the second set 6-0, and
finally broke through a tight final set when he broke service in
the eighth game to advance 3-6, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill had 11 aces and took 30-of-34 points on his first serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't win letting him dictate all the points,'' Gambill
said. ``I started taking it to him better and it pretty much turned
it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang and Gambill have split their four previous meetings,
Gambill having won the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough matches,'' Gambill said. ``The first time I
played him was in one of my first tournaments and I was just in awe
of being on the same court with Michael Chang.

CHANG IN FIRST FINAL SINCE '98
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS MISSPELLED BYLINE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was patience and maturity over power and
emotion, and perhaps more important for the shrinking Mercedes-Benz
Cup, a good name for its marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang might have almost fallen off the tennis map last
year, but he was very much alive Saturday afternoon when he
overcame Justin Gimelstob's quick start by sweeping the last 11
games and advancing into today's final.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 28, will try to overcome another power player in
Jan-Michael Gambill to capture his first tournament title in 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's career comeback appeared in trouble Saturday when he
lost the first set 6-3, then quickly fell behind 1-3 in the second.
The intense Gimelstob was forcing the pace and appeared ready to
take control.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was a right-knee bruise suffered diving for the
ball before winning the set's fourth game, the sweltering afternoon
heat or the perseverance of Chang, Gimelstob was never heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   Chang won the semifinal 3-6, 6-3, 6-0, leaving the Mercedes-Benz
Cup with the closest thing it has left to a headliner going into
today's 2 p.m. final.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of tennis' big names failing to show, bailing
because of injury, being defaulted or upset, the Mercedes-Benz
desperately needed someone of note in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chang has enjoyed top billing in a while. The Orange
County product failed to make a final for the first time in 11
years in 1999. The former French Open champion saw his ATP ranking
fall as low as No. 76.
</P>
<P>
   This year he has slowly been trying to rebuild his career. The
Mercedes-Benz marked the fourth semifinal he's reached this season.
He has pushed his ranking to No. 34, a number that will lower after
surviving Gimelstob's fast start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely tried to hang in there,'' Chang said. ``That was
pretty much what I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I was back in a final. I feel very
blessed to have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempermental Gimelstob was feeling something much different
but was still feeling plenty. At different times as the match
started to slip away, he yelled at someone to turn off a cell
phone, threw his racket and ripped his shirt off.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the match was over, he punched a locker and had to
have his right hand examined at UCLA Medical Center. He returned
later to complete his doubles semifinal with Rick Leach but dropped
it in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   All and all, not the day the former UCLA star had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got a little flustered,'' Gimelstob said.
``Experience was a tell-tale sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make any errors. He stayed the course and I didn't.
I lost sight of what I was trying to do. . . . I got very scattered
and made a lot of errors and he didn't. I lost the match mentally
and emotionally, not physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered has seldom looked like this: During one stretch, Chang
won 35 of 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob's emotional play had served him well when he served up
the week's biggest upset, knocking off the highest-seeded player,
Mark Philippoussis, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion in the second semifinal belonged to Frenchman Arnaud
Clement, who showed plenty of touch in winning the opening set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Gambill came storming back to sweep the second set 6-0, and
finally broke through a tight final set when he broke service in
the eighth game to advance 3-6, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill had 11 aces and took 30-of-34 points on his first serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't win letting him dictate all the points,'' Gambill
said. ``I started taking it to him better and it pretty much turned
it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang and Gambill have split their four previous meetings,
Gambill having won the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough matches,'' Gambill said. ``The first time I
played him was in one of my first tournaments and I was just in awe
of being on the same court with Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our great players playing great tennis. It's just
great to meet another American in the finals.''

RANGERS WILL TAKE THEIR TIME JUDGING VALUE OF EX-YANKEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ricky Ledee wasn't born in Yankees
pinstripes, but the diaper service seems to have gotten there as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He was a tender 16 years old when he played his first game for
the organization, debuting with Tampa of the Gulf Coast League in
1990. Ten years later _ 10 years, mind you _ Boss Steinbrenner
finally decided that Ricky was worth more leaving the Yankees than
playing left field for them.
</P>
<P>
   With a curiously brief intermediate stop in Cleveland, Ledee
became a Ranger Friday. Another pinstriped orphan, left in the
bulrushes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. If you can't beat them, trade for them.
</P>
<P>
   Around baseball, that seems to be the trendy philosophy. The
market for ex-Yankees, for some reason, remains breathlessly
bullish. Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled Yankee masses.
</P>
<P>
   So how good is Ledee? The Rangers fully intend to see.
</P>
<P>
   The club thinks he's good enough that general manager Doug
Melvin preferred to roll the dice on Ledee's potential than to jump
on the Brett Tomko merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko, of course, is a starting pitcher, which means that his
rejection speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give our young pitchers a chance,'' Melvin
explained last night.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager, in other words, feels that the franchise is
better served presently by continuing to dispatch Ryan Glynn and
Matt Perisho, both 25, to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Would Tomko be any more consistent than the two kid pitchers? I
don't think so. And given the current Pudge-less state of the
Rangers, why should the focus be on anything sooner than 2001?
</P>
<P>
   How good is Ledee? Melvin gave a hint yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two calls today on him and turned them down,'' Melvin
reported. ``People were asking, `Did you get him to trade him?' Our
answer is no, we've decided the kid has moved enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be young and a New York Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, Ledee was traded to the Indians for David Justice.
Minor leaguers were also involved in the deal, but the essence was
that Steinbrenner United swapped a guy who couldn't crack its
starting lineup for a solid, one-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   And now he has been traded again, this time for David Segui who,
for all he was not, was still a .336 hitter here with 29 doubles
and 57 RBI. Heading into this season, Ledee didn't have that many
doubles or runs batted in in his whole big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee reportedly was more than a little shaken when the Yanks
dealt him away last month. That might explain his modest totals _ a
.222 average with 8 RBI _ with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But he seems to be over the postpartum pinstripe blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was given a good shot there,'' Ledee said. ``It was up to
me, and I couldn't put it together. They're trying to win it all,
and so they felt they had to make a change and went with Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that we can never really weigh is how much pressure
there is to be a relative youngster, wearing some of baseball's
sacred vestments, playing left field in one of its true cathedrals
_ and where the boss demands a World Series winner every year.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kenny Rogers about the pressures of playing for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' Ledee admitted. ``It's like there, you never
really win. You always have to look over your shoulders. If you go
4-for-4 and make an error, somebody is going to want to talk about
the error. You really have to be strong mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee isn't the first ex-Yankee _ excuse me, pre-owned Yankee _
to say something like that.
</P>
<P>
   So how good is Ledee?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said that even he isn't sure. ``I've seen
maybe five at-bats his whole career,'' Oates said. ``It's a little
early. You're talking to the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates added that he intends to find out. Ledee will be in
the lineup tonight, and lots more after that.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the scouting reports, Melvin is bullish about the newest
Ranger. And Melvin is well aware of the built-in pinstriped bias.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes, for starters, Ruben Rivera, Brien Taylor,
Russ Davis, Pat Kelly and Ed Yarnall.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers may be the only guy ever to don the Yankees pinstripes
and see his value go ``down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Rangers, there is plenty of time to kick the
new guy's tires and to check Ledee's oil.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, we hardly knew ye. But as an impending free agent,
Segui's stay probably was never going to be long, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the home team, the youth movement continues. And that isn't
all bad.
</P>
<P>
   You do trust that Steinbrenner guy, don't you?

TIGERS START FAST, DUMP RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Gabe Kapler and Bill Haselman spent the first
two games of the series against the Detroit Tigers proving that the
Rangers did receive something of value in the off-season trade of
Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Both played key roles as the Rangers won Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Francisco Cordero's turn to defend the honor of general
manager Doug Melvin last night, and the young reliever responded
with his longest and perhaps best outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances were less than ideal. Rangers starter Kenny
Rogers was knocked out in the third inning of what became a 10-2
loss at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (10-8) gave up eight runs (six earned) on nine hits and
three walks in 22/3 innings, putting the Rangers in a huge hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick and painful,'' Rogers said. ``Today was just bad all
around. I wasn't too good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tigers starter Hideo Nomo (4-10) pitching about as well as
he did when he started the 1995 All-Star Game in Arlington, the
Rangers had no chance to climb out. Nomo allowed two runs on seven
hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, losing for the first time in five games, fell to
two games under .500 and 91/2 games behind the Seattle Mariners in
the American League West. They're 51/2 games out in the wild-card
standings, with five teams between them and first place.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of getting back into contention appear slim.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, naturally, still want to win as many games as
possible. But the real purpose of the final two months is likely to
be evaluating the talent on hand with an eye toward their roles for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   One job that could be open is that of closer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if incumbent John Wetteland isn't traded in the next couple
of days _ something that looks unlikely at this point _ the Rangers
still could need somebody new to finish off victories next season.
Wetteland can become a free agent at the end of the season, and
Melvin isn't close to signing him to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero came from the Tigers with the tag of future closer.
That's the kind of label they put on you when you throw in the
mid-90s with a hard slider.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero's arm hasn't yielded the results hoped for, though. He
had a 5.28 earned-run average, and had allowed 55 hits and walked
32 walks in 441/3 innings, before yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The raw stuff remains impressive, but Cordero usually tries to
throw the ball past hitters rather than setting them up. That
doesn't work at the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   When Cordero came in last night, he at first suffered from the
same malady. He got off to a shaky start, allowing two runs in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the first four batters reached, with the only out a
liner right back at Cordero. But after a visit to the mound by
pitching coach Dick Bosman, the young reliever settled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out and told me that throwing as hard as I can wasn't
going to help me,'' Cordero said.
</P>
<P>
   He took a little off his fastball, and threw his slider for
strikes, and dominated his previous team for the next three
innings. He retired 11 of the last 12 batters he faced, four of
them by strikeout. He fanned five overall, a career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I would like to do every time I come into a
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero's outing was important in the short term because he
saved the bullpen with his 41/3 innings. Doug Davis was the only
other reliever who had to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordero pitched very well,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``That
was the longest outing of his major-league career, and he saved our
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   His outing could be more important in the long term if he
continues his success and becomes the pitcher the Rangers
envisioned when they made the trade.

RED SOX PHILOSOPHICAL AFTER 12-1 LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ATHLETICS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It was a night when men in cleats, with
remnants of sunflower seeds or tobacco in their teeth, sought
consolation in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   What else can you do when you are humiliated, 12-1, before a
crowd of 36,325, about 10,000 of whom turned out for free yo-yos?
</P>
<P>
   How else could the Red Sox lay down their heads softly
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night after the thumping they took from the A's?
</P>
<P>
   Philosopher Rod Beck, a giant ice pack on his neck after
pitching the final inning of the beating: ``When I first started
playing this game professionally, they told me the difference
between winners and losers is that once a week you get your butt
kicked and once a week you kick some butt. It's what you do with
the other five days that makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosopher Jimy Williams, the manager, flashing a smile of
resignation: ``It's just one of 162 games, that's all I can say. We
just gotta move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing pitcher, Jeff Fassero, mixing art and science: ``It was
that kind of night, bad angles for me.'' Real bad.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the first two games of the four-game series, the
Sox gave and gave Saturday night. Before Fassero (7-4) succumbed
with no outs in the fifth, he was on his way to yielding eight runs
(seven earned) on six hits and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Bryce Florie fared little better, getting knocked
around for three runs on four hits before the inning was over. And
Beck, who walked two of the first three batters he faced in the
eighth, gave up the 12th run.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oakland starter Kevin Appier, whom the Red Sox have
coveted through the years, shut them out through seven innings
before he left the game to his bullpen. The righthander allowed
four hits, three walks, and permitted no Boston base runner past
second.
</P>
<P>
   The loss cost the Sox a chance to overtake Oakland for first
place in the American League wild-card race by a half-game.
Instead, they linger 1 1/2 games back. And they remained 2 1/2
games behind the Yankees in the AL East, as the Bombers also lost,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox will send their new best hope, Rolando Arrojo, against
the A's Sunday as they try to vanquish the memory of Saturday
night's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who expressed displeasure last week at being scheduled
to pitch Saturday night on a week's rest rather than his usual five
days, set himself up for pain throughout, walking five A's, three
of whom scored.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, he said the extra rest made him a little
stronger than he prefers. He also said his delivery was affected by
the slope of the mound. And he said the A's benefited from a number
of strike calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were borderline pitches that just didn't go my way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also induced a number of grounders that other nights might
have turned into outs instead of singles, doubles, or triples. ``I
just didn't get any breaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the A's seized almost every opportunity. Oakland rookie Adam
Piatt struck the most menacing blows, a run-scoring single in the
first and a three-run homer in the third. Yet every Oakland player
but two in the starting lineup scored by the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very patient hitters,'' Williams said. ``They got
some walks and they took advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of pending woe, Fassero walked the first batter of the
game, Ryan Christenson, who moved to second on Olmedo Saenz's
two-out single and scored on a single by Piatt.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, it was deja vu all over again _ and then
some. Oakland slugger Jason Giambi, handcuffed the night before by
Pedro Martinez, drew a one-out walk. Fassero then walked the next
batter, Saenz, and served up a three-run gopher to Piatt, spotting
the A's a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then he unraveled in the fifth. After throwing 84 pitches in the
first four innings (he hadn't thrown more than 98 in an outing all
year), he led off the fifth by yielding a double to Giambi, a
single to Saenz, and a walk to Piatt, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   An error then finished Fassero to the showers. Terrence Long hit
a soft grounder to first baseman Jose Offerman, who had all the
time he could want to throw out the lumbering Giambi at the plate.
But Offerman threw the ball wildly past catcher Scott Hatteberg,
letting two runs score to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Out went Fassero, in came Florie, whom the A's soon appeared to
use for batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada greeted Florie with a two-run double. After he
retired the next batter, Ramon Hernandez, on a grounder for the
first out, the A's all but eviscerated the righthanded reliever.
</P>
<P>
   The toll: a double by Eric Chavez, a triple by Christenson, a
single by Randy Velarde, and a walk to Saenz before the nightmare
ended with the Red Sox in an 11-0 hole. The A's sent 12 batters to
the plate in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Appier had lost five in a row. But he faced little opposition
from the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Boston batters reached second base before the
seventh: Hatteberg on a two-out double in the second, Ed Sprague
with a two-out single and a walk to Trot Nixon in the fifth, and
Nomar Garciaparra in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who was 0 for 3, reached on a fielder's choice. He
advanced to second on Troy O'Leary's bloop single. But both were
stranded when second baseman Mike Lansing, in his first action with
the Sox, flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the game slipping out of reach, Williams lifted Garciaparra
after the sixth, sending Manny Alexander to shortstop. He also
replaced Offerman with Izzy Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored their only run in the eighth after Darren Lewis,
Brian Daubach, and Alcantara each singled to load the bases. Lewis
scored on Bernard Gilkey's fielder's choice.

MCCAIN TRAVELS IN STYLE ON FAMILIAR BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS _ He may have fired up his
trademark bus once again Saturday, but John S. McCain wants to make
this very clear: He's not trying to steal anybody's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't intend this bus trip to be an extravaganza,'' a
jovial McCain said as he sat in his usual red swivel seat in the
back of his white bus, drinking soda after soda. On board were many
of the staff members who had run the Arizona senator's campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination, and some of the reporters
who had covered his many town hall meetings in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were hoping was it would just be a good time, and that
it would be reported as such,'' McCain said. ``We thought we'd have
a trip where just the old timers came with us, but it just grew and
grew and grew.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain traveled from Arlington, Va., to the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia with several busloads of reporters in
tow. The convoy was bigger and a good deal more festive than it had
been for most of McCain's unsuccessful primary campaign, and McCain
was happy to have the company.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at a town hall meeting Saturday afternoon in Blue
Bell, Pa., with state senator Stewart Greenleaf, a candidate for
the US House. The crowd of several hundred gave McCain a loud
ovation, and laughed heartily at his well-worn one-liners, like the
one about Arizona being so dry the trees chase the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that his trip, and his busy schedule in Philadelphia, had
annoyed some aides of the soon-to-be GOP presidential nominee,
George W. Bush, McCain was careful to give the Texas governor his
due at every possible turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I'd support the nominee of the party,'' McCain
said, ``Governor Bush is running the kind of campaign I would have
run if I were the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Bush for appealing to a wider variety of voters now
than during the primaries, and said the governor was running a far
more ``centrist'' campaign, concentrating on issues like education
and military reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven primaries, including New Hampshire, Michigan,
and Massachusetts. The battle in South Carolina, which the senator
lost, was especially vicious, and McCain was clearly angry during
and after it because of what he called the Bush campaign's negative
tactics. But the Bush of South Carolina had not been the true Bush,
McCain said Saturday, calling the tactics there ``the exception to
the rule of the campaign he's run.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McCain said, he would do himself no good by
dwelling on his injuries now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I was unhappy about some of the things that
happened during the campaign,'' McCain said. ``I don't know of a
campaign that the loser isn't unhappy with some things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the point is, you can't be a sore loser. Americans do not
admire or appreciate a sore loser, so you just move forward and try
to make the very best of it. I think I'm at step eight of the
12-step presidential recovery program.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his relationship with Bush these days as
``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator will deliver a prime-time address in support of the
Texas governor on Tuesday night, and has a busy schedule of
appearances throughout the convention, including a speech at the
``shadow convention,'' organized by commentator Arianna Huffington.
McCain said that speech, too, would be an attempt not to compete
with Bush, but to bolster him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hosting a reception for his delegates Sunday to thank
them for their work, and to urge them to put aside their anger and
throw themselves behind Bush. McCain will campaign with the
governor out West for three days after the convention, and have
Bush and his wife, Laura, visit his ranch near Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stepped gingerly Saturday into the subject of his own
future ambitions. He said he fully expected Bush to win in
November, and probably would be elected to a second term. His
strongest supporters are counting on the senator's running in 2004
if Bush loses to Gore. And this week's high-profile appearances may
be a kind of testing of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to avoid the subject Saturday, but when pushed to
talk about what he might do if Bush lost, McCain said he wasn't
sure whether another run at the presidency was even possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you have to figure is, could we catch that lightning
in a bottle again?'' he said. ``Could the circumstances that
prevailed last time happen again? The kind of unconventional
campaign we ran, could that work?''
</P>
<P>
   He was nostalgic about his campaign. ``It was the greatest
experience of my life,'' McCain said. ``I can't tell you how
grateful I am for having had this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The old fire returned, however, when a reporter asked McCain if
he had gotten Bush's permission for his pre-convention odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked,'' he bristled, ``I'm a US senator elected
by the people of Arizona.''

 &HT;    Fleeing war, refugees now victims of poverty
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona remembers the day clearly _ a
Tuesday in July 1998 _ when the sound of the trucks echoed through
her small town of Mapiripan 200 miles southeast of Bogota,
Colombia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks carried about 100 armed paramilitaries, who had come
looking for leftist sympathizers _ families whose sons or fathers
might be supporters of the Marxist rebels trying to overthrow the
Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rounded up everybody at 5:30 a.m.,'' said Barahona, 60, a
widowed mother of five who ran a small restaurant and store. ``They
stuck a machine gun in my chest and asked where the guerrillas and
the guns were. I told them I didn't know anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With no police and no army soldiers around, the paramilitaries
had their way in remote Mapiripan for weeks. Suspected informants
and sympathizers were rounded up, questioned and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona, her children and the other townspeople were told to
stay in their homes with the windows closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were torturing and killing people,'' she recalled. ``We
couldn't even count the number of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Barahona's story is all too common. The military
has ceded huge swaths of the countryside to guerrillas or
right-wing paramilitary gangs. Both groups sweep through rural
towns looking for recruits and enemies, conducting a reign of
terror funded by tribute they collect from Colombia's drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle are poor campesinos like Barahona, most of whom
hide any political opinions they have in a bid for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Many flee the countryside, heading for larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures list more than 1 million Colombians as
displaced from their homes in the past five years, but human rights
advocates say the number of ``desplazados'' _ the displaced _ is
closer to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has spread over the last two years to areas not
traditionally affected,'' said Albeiro Salazar, a researcher at the
Center for Investigation and Education, a human rights group in
Bogota. ``The guerrillas and the paramilitaries want the civil
population to take sides, and they enforce their will through
massacres and torture. Now, we have whole regions of the
countryside that are depopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the poor have fled within Colombia's borders, the
better-off have fled the country altogether. As Colombia's woes
have grown, they have formed long lines outside foreign embassies,
applying for visas for Spain, Canada, the United States, Costa Rica
and other nations. Colombia is losing doctors, lawyers, engineers
and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But for the poor like Barahona, the only escape is a bus ticket
to Bogota, Medellin or the like. Hoping to find work in the
relative peace of the cities, many stumble from the crisis of the
countryside into poverty and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Few find work; Colombia is enduring its worst economic crisis of
the last 70 years, with unemployment topping 20 percent and
unofficial estimates ranging up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to living in the city,'' Barahona said as she
stood aimlessly outside a building she occupies with more than 100
other displaced people. ``I feel trapped here. Where I lived
before, I knew everybody. Here, the rich people walk past and
insult us. We want to work and get on with our lives, but there are
no jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona spends her days looking for work and applying for
government assistance. Her nights are spent reliving the terror of
recent years and longing for a home she fears she will never see
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second of August, 1998, the guerrillas arrived and
there was a terrible shootout,'' she said. ``The paramilitaries
were dug in beside our house and the shooting went on for hours. It
started at 2 a.m. and went on until the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddling in her house with her children, Barahona eventually
escaped, running for the nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back two days later and everything from the store and
restaurant was stolen,'' she said. ``I saw more than 40 dead,
guerrillas and paramilitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked townspeople buried their dead and tried to go on, but
the war wouldn't leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Nov. 3, the guerrillas came again and they killed three
young boys they said were accomplices of the paramilitaries,'' she
said. ``They told us then to leave or die. We left with just the
clothes we were wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   After living several months in a nearby town, Barahona returned
to Mapiripan when she heard that things had quieted down. She
stayed until the guerrillas returned in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted my three oldest children,'' she said. ``They
wanted them to join the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   This time she fled all the way to Bogota, only to find thousands
of other refugees like herself.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona knows little of plans by Colombia's president, Andres
Pastrana, to fight the drug lords and the guerrillas with nearly $2
billion in foreign aid _ more than $1 billion of it from the United
States. She doesn't know that critics fear the pl

 &HT;    Oh, for some rousing words that won't fit bumper sticker
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dear William Jennings Bryan,
</P>
<P>
   Could you return to Earth? We're desperate for a colorful
orator. Although you electrified the Democratic convention of 1896,
you might find the GOP a more comfortable home today.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a history book around that doesn't still recount
your words on the free coinage of silver: ``You shall not press
down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not
crucify mankind on a cross of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Southerners, especially poor farmers, loved you for it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we need more fiery orators is because today's
presidential nominating process is about as exciting as watching
paint dry. You helped put Woodrow Wilson's nomination over the top
on the 46th ballot at the 1912 Democratic convention, but we
already know Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney of Wyoming will be the GOP nominees for
president and vice president. Neither is going to say anything
memorable. But preordained Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore
won't either. He's taken to pounding on the podium and raising his
voice lately, which hardly makes him an orator.
</P>
<P>
   While the political conventions haven't produced any great
orators recently, there have been some great performers and some
shows of courage. Four years ago, Elizabeth Dole gave a new kind of
walking-talking speech for her husband, telling his life story by
greeting folks in the audience who had helped him along life's way.
Few could have pulled it off with such poise and grace. Colin
Powell, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a
speaker this time, spoke with courage in support of affirmative
action and women's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Ann Richards, who later became governor of Texas, gave a
rip-roaring keynote speech, too, but it was designed more to
entertain than to challenge our better selves. She started by
pointing out a sad truth _ that she and the late U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan of Texas were the only two women in 160 years to be
Democratic convention keynote speakers (although the Democrats
claim to be big supporters of women's rights).
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S WORDS RING OUT
</P>
<P>
   There have been some terrific women orators at conventions since
your day, when women weren't even allowed to vote. Jordan, the
first black elected to the Texas Senate, is the most memorable. Her
1976 Democratic keynote speech still rings in the ears of Americans
who worry about losing our sense of community in the materialistic
Internet age:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the great danger that America faces, that we will
cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest
groups, each seeking to fulfill private dreams. Each seeking to
satisfy private wants. If this occurs, who will speak for America?
Who will speak for the common good?''
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed in the last 100 years. There's still
little humility among politicians. Humility doesn't always mark
Jesse Jackson's speeches, but passion does. And in 1984, the civil
rights leader quit his quest to be the nation's first black
president with a humble confession and a plea for party unity:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant doing my
best against the odds. Be patient. God is not finished with me yet.
This campaign has taught me much: That leaders must be tough enough
to fight, tender enough to cry, humble enough to make mistakes,
humble enough to admit them, strong enough to absorb the pain and
resilient enough to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a great orator is one who can deliver a timeless
message with passion, a substantive message that inspires the
democratic dialogue. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University
of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, says the
television age has caused us to elevate what amounts to a string of
bumper stickers to great oratory. She thought Richards' 1988
speech, which included the line about former President Bush being
born with ``a silver foot in his mouth,'' fell into that category.
Still, you have to hand it to Richards _ she delivers great bumper
stickers.

 &HT;    CBS head Moonves rationalizes 'Big Brother' abuse
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The reality TV business is cheap and creepy.
That's a given.
</P>
<P>
   But until ``Big Brother'' came along, it wasn't criminal. Yes,
criminal. How else to describe the child abuse that CBS, led by
Leslie Moonves, and ``Big Brother'' are inflicting on the teen-age
offspring of one of the house's unstable inmates?
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a week into the every-night-but-Sunday saga,
Karen, a 43-year-old Indiana mother of four, had a meltdown and
began dissing her husband, Tom. As far as she's concerned, their
22-year marriage is finished. Between racking sobs, Karen said Tom
has major intimacy problems, including an aversion to kissing
because he doesn't like his face touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so ugly about so many things,'' Karen whined to fellow
inmates _ and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   That excruciating installment was followed by a live studio
interview with the vilified husband, who said in the show's opener
that he thought his wife had ``lost her mind'' for joining the
10-member group. Tom seemed hesitant to discuss his ruined
marriage, but prodded by perky host Julie Chen, he gave in.
</P>
<P>
   If two adults want to make fools of themselves on national
television, fine. They both signed release forms. They're free to
expose themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But back home in Indiana, the four children of Karen and Tom are
watching. Karen's online bio says she considers her children ``her
greatest accomplishment.'' If that's true, why did she cause them
so much pain? When they return to school in a few weeks, ``Big
Brother'' will still be on, and Karen will still be babbling about
her domestic hell. Stares and whispers will rain upon these poor
kids like acid-dipped confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Release forms or not, CBS should be held accountable for these
children's misery. No, the network certainly didn't cause the
marriage to collapse, but by agreeing to broadcast the parents'
revelations, they invaded the children's privacy, to put it mildly.
And the damage may go much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about the children,'' CBS president Leslie
Moonves told TV critics in Los Angeles last week. ``Do we have a
responsibility for Karen talking about her marital problems? I
don't believe so. If it hadn't happened on the air, it would have
happened somewhere else. . . . We have nothing to apologize for.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for smug and cold hearted? As long as ``Big Brother''
is pulling big ratings (not blockbuster but healthy), Moonves
doesn't care who gets hurt. His weak defense was that PBS had a
similar tragedy in 1973 with ``An American Family,'' a multipart
documentary about the Louds of California. That marriage collapsed
by the end of filming, too.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an important difference. ``An American Family''
was filmed over a period of many months and then edited into a
documentary. By the time it aired, a good deal of time had elapsed,
and the Louds all knew what would be in the film. In fact, they had
all participated in the filming. Nobody was caught off guard.
Everybody agreed to the broadcast beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, CBS should have been more careful about
screening applicants for ``Big Brother.'' From the get-go, Karen
seemed like an explosion ready to happen, and it didn't take a
genius to see that her marriage was shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Karen isn't the only resident cruising toward an emotional
breakdown _ and serious repercussions back home. It has been
revealed that George, a 41-year-old father of three, accidentally
shot and killed a friend in a hunting accident years ago. George's
wife, Teresa, has said the event traumatized her husband, and she
told Chen that he will be ``destroyed'' when he finds out his
tragic past was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Even a perfunctory background check should have uncovered this
trauma, allowing CBS to warn George that the information would be
revealed or reject him from the guest list. Ditto the show's first
official celebrity, William ``Mega'' Collins, the Philadelphia
fellow who was found to be a past member of the New Black Panther
Party, which espouses hatred and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent $100,000 on background checks,'' Moonves said. ``I
don't know how better we could have done it. A lot of people have
skeletons.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, of course, is to have high drama among the residents
while the ever-present cameras are whirring. If everybody got along
and happy-talked, life would get boring. But ``Big Brother'' needs
to draw the line when children are affected. Karen's kids should
not pay for their mother's emotional turmoil, and CBS should not
compound the abuse by serving it up as prime-time entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a helpful hint for political convention coverage, which
begins tonight:
</P>
<P>
   Every four years the broadcast networks are faced with low
ratings for their prime-time coverage. Viewers, it seems, are as
apathetic as voters.
</P>
<P>
   But since networks have a responsibility to cover them somehow,
they should try a pool arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Let ABC take the first night, CBS the second, NBC the third, and
then all three can do their own analyses/coverage of the nominee's
speech on the final night. (PBS, which isn't a slave to ratings,
can stick with its same nightly plans.)
</P>
<P>
   That way, viewers who want to watch will have a free, noncable
outlet each night, and other viewers will have more entertainment
choices. Good thinking, right?

 &HT;    How to buy art when you have no idea what to buy and limited
cash
 &HT;    By Jane A. Black
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You look at your bare living room walls. You
wonder: What can I put on them that will look great?
</P>
<P>
   You look at your wallet. You ask: How can I afford art that I'll
like, and that will be good?
</P>
<P>
   You look around. You think: Wouldn't it be nice to support local
artists, as long as I'm shopping?
</P>
<P>
   And now, you wonder: Where do I start?
</P>
<P>
   Say you had a bit of money to invest in local artworks. Suppose
you had $500. We asked a number of local observers and authorities
on the Dayton-area art scene what they would do.
</P>
<P>
   We add, first, two things, right off the bat: $500 isn't much _
in this context, anyway _ and nobody is going to tell you what to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of the folks we asked feel squeamish about the
question, hesitating to single out artists as worthy or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, this is a no-brainer, and on another hand it is
very difficult,'' says Jud Yalkut, an internationally recognized
video artist who runs the Miami Valley Cooperative Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   He specifies that his answer is offered in the context of his
own collection. And that's one of the main things to remember: You
have to look at an artwork in your own context, as well as that of
the ``art world.''
</P>
<P>
   What is a good value for one person, or a good piece of art, is
not the same for the next. Keep in mind what you have, what you
like and where the piece will be placed. It is vital to trust one's
own instincts and think big picture. And despite the disdain of
some, it's OK to buy something because it goes with your couch.
Remember, you have to live with it. You should love it.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be one style and/or one medium. We, for
instance, have a large abstract and a traditional oil-on-canvas
still life not far from some watercolors by my mother-in-law.
Nearby are two small needlepoint pictures of wildflowers we got for
a wedding present next to a large calligraphy-and-colored-pencil
drawing. It all works together, though it's hard to say exactly
why. It helps that the large pieces all have dark frames.
</P>
<P>
   I look at every piece of art in my house every day. That's the
great thing about buying original art _ it is ever so much more
lovable than a poster. It's not that posters are bad art _ but can
they really engage your eye, your mind and your heart the way an
original artwork can? Usually not.
</P>
<P>
   So where do you go to find real art? One place are annual spring
art festivals. They are fun events and you can see the range and
depth of work being produced by regional artists. You can expect to
get good value for your money.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that buying what you like doesn't preclude the
idea of educating yourself. The more you look, the more you will
understand what really excites you, and holds your interest. For an
overview anytime of year, visit the galleries that carry a variety
of local artists.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' cooperatives are a popular way for individuals to get
their work out in front of the public. A group will finance and run
the business, allotting space for each person's work.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial galleries represent artists, showing their work and
taking a commission from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have looked a bit, you will probably find an artist or
two who appeals to you. At that point, you may want to follow the
lead of Terry Welker, a local architect who has run Archetype
Gallery for the past few years. He recommends taking a bottle of
good wine to the artist's studio to share while you look over their
body of work and talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not just about owning a piece of art work, its
about having a relationship with the artist. I'm fascinated by
other people's view of the world. Ownership is not an end in itself
but a means of sharing the artist's view,'' says Welker.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists will sell to you directly, especially if you found
them through a group show and they are not represented locally. An
artist who has work in a commercial or cooperative gallery should,
and probably will, complete the sale through that entity.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Clift, president of the board of trustees for the Dayton
Visual Arts Center, says she would probably ``search for a
watercolor because it is one of my favorite techniques . . . and I
think I would be able to secure a smallish one depending on the
complexity of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Caron, professor of art history at Wright State University
and head of Dayton's Public Arts Commission, also suggests thinking
about it in terms of media. ``Because $500 is not a whole lot, I'd
probably look at purchasing prints, drawings or photographs rather
than paintings or sculptures. An interesting possibility might be
to approach established painters or sculptors and ask if their
drawings are for sale. Often such works are compelling glimpses
into the creative process and have an immediacy that is very
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Smith, local artist and president of the Riverbend Board
of Regents, has a different idea. ``I wouldn't necessarily buy
things based on who the artist is, but rather on how much I was
drawn to the individual piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   So, taking into account that you have to decide for yourself,
and you are going to have to fill those empty walls slowly if you
want to buy original work, who might you consider buying? The
following artists are those who were named by the gallery owners,
artists, and art professionals quoted in this article. Check them
out!

 &HT;    New system cuts down on drying time
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The average load of laundry takes about 30
minutes to wash in a residential model automatic washing machine,
but the same load takes abut 50 minutes to dry, according to the
Whirlpool Corp.'s Institute of Fabric Science.
</P>
<P>
   That means on the day more than one load is being washed, when
the second load of clothes is ready to come out of the washer it
has to wait 20 minutes while the first load finishes drying before
it can go into the dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool has introduced a line of high-tech clothes dryers that
the company claims eliminates the lag time by drying an average
load of laundry in 30 minutes instead of 50. The Senseon Drying
System uses moisture and temperature sensors to dry clothes as
quickly as possible without overdrying or excessive shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Ottusch, Whirlpool's senior home economist, said the
Senseon Drying System uses two types of sensors: strips that
monitor the amount of moisture in the clothes and a ``thermister,''
a heat-sensing device to track the temperature in the dryer
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The user sets the dryer to a category, such as permanent press,
and the sensor array monitors the progress of the drying process
cutting off the cycle as soon as the clothes are sufficiently dry.
The sensors can tell the type of laundry being dried _ denim pants
vs. blouses, for example _ and adjust the drying cycle
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Ottusch said the average homemaker tends to keep clothes in the
dryer until they are bone dry; that takes extra time and can damage
the fabric. The Senseon Drying System, she said, lets clothes keep
some of their natural moisture while reducing drying times.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool started shipping its new Senseon dryers to retailers
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Several dryers are available with the Senseon Drying System, and
their manufacturer's suggested retail prices go up to about $599.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool offers Senseon dryers in electric and gas models and
with either digital or mechanical (dial) controls, and one model
has a ``Resource Saver Cycle'' that reduces energy consumption.

 &HT;    Looking for the love connection
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ There's nothing worse than being set up
on a blind date, am I right?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it's hard enough being on a date with someone you
know, but the tension is only compounded when meeting somebody for
the first time on a first date.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the fear of getting lettuce stuck between your
teeth while eating dinner, which isn't exactly a good thing when
negotiating a second date.
</P>
<P>
   Or you worry that your palms are all sweaty, which only makes
the problem worse. And then there is the issue of a goodnight kiss
provided your date hasn't escaped out the bathroom window of the
restaurant sometime during the evening.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to report that none of the above happened in The
Grand Junction Daily Sentinel's experiment called, ``The Dating
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, we matched up singles in the valley on the basis of
compatibility and interests. The idea came after hearing single
people complain that there aren't any singles in the valley. We
sent out questionnaires to those who are unattached and selected 10
people from a pool of dating candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It's time now to reveal who was matched up with whom and what
happened on the da open to meeting lots of people because that's
the only way to meet someone interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple No. 2: Sandy Miller, 48, and George Kelly, 47.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is an assistant executive director for a nonprofit and
George is a general contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's motto is, ``Life's short, make the most of it.'' So when
she heard that The Daily Sentinel was looking for singles, she
filled out a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a little adventure,'' said Sandy. ``Why pass up the
opportunity to meet someone new?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the characteristics Sandy looks for in the opposite sex
is a good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   George describes his sense of humor as zany and he loves to make
others laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy and George met at Bailey's in the Grand Vista Hotel for a
glass of wine and then went to Applebee's for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, George and Sandy didn't really have that much
in common and probably won't go out again, although she did admit
George was ``pretty entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to meet people, but it's that `right' person that is
more difficult to find,'' said Sandy.
</P>
<P>
   Couple No. 3: Chris Herrman, 37, and Raphael Allred, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael is a family practice resident and Chris is the western
region director of a land conservation nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris picked up Raphael at her house, he noticed she had a
jukebox _ a good sign since they are both music lovers. The date
started with dinner at Suehiro, a sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about all kinds of stuff,'' said Chris. ``All
evening the conversation flowed easily. We talked about Greek,
Roman and Biblical history because I had just been to Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really good conversation,'' added Raphael. ``I had a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The date concluded with ice cream and tunes from the jukebox
where they both ended up talking over the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem being single, so I don't think it's hard
being single here,'' said Chris. ``But it's challenging to connect
with like-minded single people, especially if you don't do the bar
scene. The sports that I do tend to be solitary kinds of things, so
it's unlikely to meet somebody after you've just hiked an hour into
the Black Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple No. 4: Blanche Means, 23, and Allen Gemaehlich, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche is a page coordinator and Allen is a sports writer for
The Daily Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche and Allen's date started at the Rockslide Brew Pub for
lunch, which was followed up by an evening showing of ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' at the Carmike Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The date went pretty well with the basic getting-to-know-you
stuff and that's when they discovered they really didn't have a
whole lot in common and their viewpoints differed on being single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that meeting people is hard,'' said Blanche,
``especially for shy people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as hard (being single in Grand Junction) as other
places I've been,'' said Allen. ``I'm optimistic about meeting
someone here. There's a good range of people my age, so I feel the
possibilities are there and it's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there wasn't a love connection, Allen is teaching
Blanche how to play tennis and their ``chance'' meeting could be
the beginning of a new friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Couple No. 5: Ann Winterholter, 26, and Scott Poindexter, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Ann is a copy editor at The Daily Sentinel and Scott is a
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   Scott says it's challenging to meet single people in Grand
Junction who are in his age range because ``Most single people are
in Denver trying to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it's difficult being single in Grand Junction, Ann
said, ``It depends on who you are. I think it's harder if you
absolutely know what you want and it's absolutely not here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty Cap Trail was the setting for Scott and Ann's
evening hike. The open trail gave them a chance to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a date like that, you have no idea who that person is,''
said Ann. ``So on the first date, if you can at least be friends,
that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   On the hike down, Ann talked about her interest in music and
Scott described his adventures working at a steakhouse in Japan.
They also discovered they attend the same church.
</P>
<P>
   The hike was followed by dinner at Suehiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about (being single),'' said Ann. ``I
enjoy hanging out with my friends and I have plenty to do. When I'm
ready to fall in love, I will.''

self-styled anarchist demonstrators will come later in the week.
City police are well restrained, even amiable so far, in the hands
of Commissioner Timoney, an ex-New Yorker, who is riding in his
bike helmet and shorts with motorcycle police as the best way to
monitor things. ``So far so good; but it's early, and you never get
cocky,'' he said as the police adjusted to such ad hoc marchers as

over the Bay Bridge, it is 10 degrees warmer, with the sun a notch
brighter and the breeze as light as baby's breath. And for every 10

INVESTORS TAKE NOTE OF INSURERS' EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good earnings reports for some of the biggest names in American
commercial insurance last week suggested that long-depressed prices
for coverage were beginning to rise. And that caught the attention
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices rose sharply for American International Group, the
biggest and strongest of the group, as well as for Chubb Corp.; St.
Paul Cos.; Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., the world's largest insurance
brokerage, and Hartford Financial Services Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prospects are clearly improving,'' said Weston Hicks, an
analyst at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh McLennan &AMP; Cos., the world's largest insurance broker,
reported a 17 percent rise in operating earnings, to $506 million,
for the second quarter. American International Group, widely known
as AIG, posted an increase of 13 percent, to $1.43 billion.
Hartford Financial Services also reported an increase of 13
percent, to $239 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Chubb Group reported a 10.5 percent rise in operating
income, to $180.7 million, but its per-share earnings remained flat
at $1, reflecting an issue of stock for the recent purchase of
Executive Risk, a company specializing in liability coverage for
company executives and board members.
</P>
<P>
   But, as did the St. Paul Cos., which reported a 9 percent
decline in operating income, to $158.9 million, Chubb reported
improvements in profits in its commercial lines. At Hartford Group,
earnings from life insurance offset heavy property-casualty claims.
But the company reported a 7 percent increase in worldwide property
casualty premiums, to $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so excited because it is seeing things happening
that are going to lead to better results in the future,'' Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks had extra spring in them, he said, because, in terms
of revenue and net assets, they have been trading at extremely
cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of AIG, which operates
in more than 130 countries, said that in his company's domestic
business ``there is an increasingly better tone to the commercial
property-casualty market as rates continue to firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Frank, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, noted that
several of the property-casualty companies had negotiated higher
prices with customers. Frank upgraded his rating on St. Paul Cos.
from neutral to buy and increased his price targets for St. Paul as
well as AIG and Chubb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the commercial insurance market improving
virtually across the board,'' Frank said.

 &HT;    Bush strives for 'different' convention
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ He turned to his father's Cabinet for a running
mate and his father's friends for a boatload of campaign cash. Now,
George W. Bush is choreographing a Republican National Convention,
which begins today, aimed at showing that this is not his father's
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a political high-wire act, balancing reverence
for his family's and party's past while promising something new.
Behind the scenes, Bush and the party that will nominate him for
president this week have decided on a strategy that uses the word
``different'' as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Governor Bush is a different kind of Republican it
should come as no surprise that this will be a different kind of
Republican convention,'' Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said
as the team geared up for tonight's opening of the Republican
National Convention's four-night run.
</P>
<P>
   Different could be a hurdle for a candidate who is Bush-born and
bred, right down to his beloved dog Spot, the offspring of the late
Millie, a White House pet. The effort begins early on opening
night. Eager to put a new, more inclusive face on the GOP,
convention officials have loaded the program with people of color
and others not usually associated with the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's first half-hour will include Mari Griego, a
10-year-old New Mexico girl who has won honors for her art work.
The invocation will be offered by Rabbi Victor Weisburg of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the usual parade of elected officials,'' said
Bush, noting a schedule filled with ordinary people who have done
extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Dick Cheney, who served as defense secretary for
the elder Bush, also has gotten the word that ``different'' is an
important part of the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects he is different than his dad,'' Cheney said
on Fox News Sunday. ``I know them both pretty well now. Governor
Bush is very much a Texan, a lot more like his mother in some
respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Also different will be the way Bush is nominated. Instead of
saving the roll call vote for the convention's third night, the
process will begin with a group of states tonight and continue
through Wednesday. Currently, there are not plans to take Bush's
home state of Texas out of order to put him over the top the moment
that he officially secures his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The great state of Alabama is scheduled to begin the voting
tonight. The great state of Iowa is scheduled to end tonight's
portion of the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the voting, Bush's name will be placed in nomination
today by one of the 2,066 delegates who are converging on this
city.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been concocted to come off as a four-night live-action
miniseries to launch the general election campaign of a candidate
who knows that the old way _ which led to Republican defeats in
1992 and 1996 _ won't get it done this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers should expect to see real people representing
educators, working families, senior citizens, people with
disabilities and new Americans,'' said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different'' being the operative, oft-repeated word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours will be a different kind of convention for a different
kind of Republican,'' said Andy Card, convention co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Different will be measured by the standard set by the GOP
conventions in Houston in 1992, when the elder George Bush was
re-nominated, and in San Diego in 1996, when Bob Dole got the nod.
Both went on to lose their elections to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 convention, especially Pat Buchanan's speech, gave the
GOP a right-wing face it is still battling to shed. Buchanan, who
had blistered the elder Bush during the 1992 primaries, urged
delegates to join a ``religious war for the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is gone this year, self-exiled to the Reform Party
after his candidacy went nowhere in early GOP contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attempt to put an inclusive face on the GOP will be
helped by events such as today's gay and lesbian luncheon,
highlighted by Bush adviser Mary Matalin. Organizers are billing
the meeting as ``the first time the gay and lesbian community has
joined together at a Republican National Convention in such large
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It may well end up highlighting how the party, especially its
influential conservative faction, will react to the fact that one
of Cheney's two daughters is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand will be Rep. Jon Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly
gay Republican in Congress. Tuesday night, Kolbe will speak at the
convention, though his topic is international trade, not gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush inclusion message will take on its bi-partisan face
Thursday night when he is introduced by Jan Bullock, widow of
Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who befriended Bush, endorsed him
for re-election in 1998 and talked about him as a presidential
candidate long before other officials did.
</P>
<P>
   But mixed in with the new will be links to the GOP past. Tuesday
night, retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf will speak to delegates from
the USS New Jersey on the eve of the 10th anniversary of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, another key figure in Desert Storm,
speaks tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking Tuesday night will be Elizabeth Dole and John
McCain, both of whom endorsed Bush after he beat them in the
primaries. McCain, who never settled his differences with Bush over
campaign finance reform, is prepared to play good soldier,
according to an early draft of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago, the governor's father fought for our country,
with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my
turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's subordinate,'' the
draft said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night speeches by Elizabeth Dole and husband Bob will
offer critics a handy tie to the GOP past. You have to go back to
1972 to find a GOP ticket that did not include a Bush or a Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, it all adds up to an ambitious effort to re-package
his party. University of Texas presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan
is waiting to see if the GOP can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to rally his troops, which is an internal matter, and
it means avoiding any kind of unpleasant disharmony on the floor
that gets televised concerning abortion or anything else
controversial,'' said Buchanan. ``This is his first opportunity
with a large national TV audience to introduce himself and set a
tone. What he has got to do is portray himself and (running mate
Dick) Cheney as authentic purveyors of compassionate conservatism
and deflect this effort to portray the ticket, through Cheney, as
exceptionally right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort is sure to become a constant theme for Al Gore, who
will pick up the Democratic nomination next month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the GOP ticket has ``concocted a strategy of phrases
and photo opportunities to convey the impression of inclusion and
moderation. But you and I know this is not about show business.''
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns his way toward a Wednesday arrival here, Bush
understands the challenge of trying to honor the past and craft a
new course for the future.
</P>
<P>
   He denies a ``political relationship'' with his father, but said
he plans to use the convention to proclaim his love for his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush made clear in an interview with ABC television how deep
that love runs: ``If I catch anybody in my campaign saying, `Well
the boy better distance himself from his father,' they're not going
to be around much because this is a relationship that's way beyond
politics.''

`THE WAR AGAINST BOYS': BOYS AS SOCIETY'S VICTIMS, NOT GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Hoff Sommers' new book argues that American boys are
being harmed by a wide current of opinion that masculinity itself
is a social evil, the root cause of violence against women. A
corollary argument made by Sommers is that a campaign waged by
feminist educational groups has given great currency to the idea
that girls are victimized by a system that favors boys. Sommers'
counter to these views is first, that boys being boys is not
terrible in itself and second, that girls today are ``enjoying more
freedoms and opportunities than any young women in human history.''
The burden of her thoughtful, provocative book is that it is
American boys who are in trouble, not girls.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers, whose last book, ``Who Stole Feminism?,'' caused a stir
with its claim that the women's rights movement was veering toward
self-pity and authoritarianism, makes these arguments persuasively
and unflinchingly, and with plenty of data to support them. There
will no doubt be rejoinders, especially from among the leading
feminist scholars (female and male) whom Sommers takes on by name
in this book. But she has laid down an unignorable challenge to
views that have been widely expressed in American public discourse
in recent years, views that have been given credibility by much of
the media.
</P>
<P>
   She begins, in a chapter called ``Where the Boys Are,'' with an
unsparing examination of the finding, supported by many reputable
institutions, that the male-dominated culture is harming girls. She
cites the educational psychologist Carol Gilligan of Harvard's
graduate school of education, who wrote in 1990, ``As the river of
a girl's life flows into the sea of Western culture, she is in
danger of drowning or disappearing.'' In 1991, inspired by
Gilligan's finding that girls, when they reached 12 or 13, suddenly
lost confidence in themselves, the American Association of
University Women published a study called ``How Schools Shortchange
Girls,'' which contended that girls had second-class status in
schools compared with boys, with devastating effects on their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The description of America's teen-age girls as silenced,
tortured, voiceless, and otherwise personally diminished is indeed
dismaying,'' Sommers writes. ``But there is surprisingly little
evidence to support it.'' By many important measures, she writes,
girls are doing better than boys in school: They get better grades,
go to college more often and join in more extracurricular
activities than boys. She cites data showing that among blacks
almost all the gains in enrollment in higher education are
accounted for by women, which would seem to indicate that it is
boys who, as Sommers puts it, ``are on the fragile side of the
gender gap.''
</P>
<P>
   As she covers her various subjects, Sommers comments acidly here
and there, but her tone is generally measured, and she bolsters her
points with an array of studies, statistics and charts. She gives a
brief history of the nationwide semiholiday Take Our Daughters to
Work Day, which, in her view, exemplifies the public response to
``the manufactured crisis of diminished girls.'' She shows an
appreciation of the sensibilities involved here since, after all,
who wants to appear soft where harm to America's girls or women is
concerned?
</P>
<P>
   She also shows how the more alarming presentations of issues get
attention while alternative, nonalarming findings are ignored or
even hidden. There is, for example, the ``gender equity'' group
that got a five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education
after putting out statements to the effect that ``every year nearly
4 million women are beaten to death.'' That, Sommers dryly
observes, would mean that 11,000 women are beaten to death every
day, while FBI statistics for 1996 showed that 3,631 female deaths
were attributed to murder in the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   There would seem in short to be some exaggeration abroad, and
Sommers pounces on many examples. Her argument nonetheless would be
more persuasive if she had dealt directly with what would seem to
be an incontrovertible fact, that at the top echelons of American
corporate and professional life women are still grossly
underrepresented. It's likely that most of the fathers and mothers
who take their daughters to work are not so much being credulous
about girl victimization as they are trying to help their daughters
get ahead in what remains, despite the problems of boys, a
male-dominated world.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers' controlled ire is perhaps most aroused by what she
presents as a discrediting of the nature of boys, a movement strong
in the academic world, which sees masculinity itself as a grave
threat to the moral order. She cites some amazing examples of this,
among them statements by a number of feminist writers to the effect
that highly publicized episodes like the school shootings in
Littleton, Colo., in 1999 represented ``patriarchal culture gone
haywire.'' Here is where Sommers' vision clashes in the deepest
philosophical and moral sense with that of the camp she decidedly
is not in. When a boy does serious wrong, she argues, it is not
because of what others describe as patriarchal culture; it is
usually because the boy in question had no father living in his
family. In other words, she writes, it is not the masculine
presence that is the problem but its absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called manly virtues of honor, duty, and self-sacrifice
 &UR; are  &LR;  caring virtues,'' she writes, ``and it is wrong to deride
them as lesser virtues.'' The problem in America is the slow
disappearance of the sort of strong moral guidance for children,
especially for boys, that teaches restraint, honor and
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about moral failure is less stylish than talking about
the inimical workings of patriarchy,'' she writes. ``But it is far
more to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Observations like that lift Sommers' book from polemic to
entreaty. There is a crying in the wilderness quality to her book,
a sense that certain simple truths have been lost sight of in the
smoky quarrelsomeness of American life. One may agree with Sommers
or one may disagree, but it is hard not to credit her with a moral
urgency that comes both from the head and from the heart.

 &HT;    FOR GOP, CONVENTION WEEK WATCHWORD IS 'DIFFERENT'
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ He turned to his father's cabinet for a running
mate and his father's friends for a boatload of campaign cash. Now,
George W. Bush is choreographing a Republican National Convention,
which begins Monday, aimed at showing that this is not his father's
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a political high-wire act, balancing reverence
for his family's and party's past while promising something new.
Behind the scenes, Bush and the party that will nominate him for
president this week have decided on a strategy that uses the word
``different'' as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Governor Bush is a different kind of Republican, it
should come as no surprise that this will be a different kind of
Republican convention,'' Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said
as the team geared up for Monday night's opening of the Republican
National Convention's four-night run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different'' could be a hurdle for a candidate who is Bush-born
and -bred, right down to his beloved dog Spot, the offspring of the
late Millie, a White House pet. The effort begins early on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to put a new, more inclusive face on the GOP, convention
officials have loaded the program with people of color and others
not usually associated with the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's first half-hour will include Mari Griego, a
10-year-old New Mexico girl who has won honors for her art work.
The invocation will be offered by Rabbi Victor Weisburg of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the usual parade of elected officials,'' said
Bush, noting a schedule filled with ordinary people who have done
extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Dick Cheney, who served as defense secretary for
the elder Bush, also has gotten the word that ``different'' is an
important part of the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects he is different than his dad,'' Cheney said
Sunday on Fox News. ``I know them both pretty well now. Governor
Bush is very much a Texan, a lot more like his mother in some
respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Also different will be the way Bush is nominated. Instead of
saving the roll call vote for the convention's third night, the
process will begin with a group of states Monday night and continue
through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are not plans to take Bush's home state of
Texas out of order to put him over the top the moment that he
officially secures his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The great state of Alabama is scheduled to begin the voting
Monday night. The great state of Iowa is scheduled to end Monday
night's portion of the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the voting, Bush's name will be placed in nomination
Monday by one of the 2,066 delegates who are converging on this

NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SPAR FOR THE PERFECT, INCIDENTAL PHOTO 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What am I bid for an image of a supersonic airliner, airborne,
spitting the flames that signaled disaster? Last week, after a
couple of auctions _ consisting of flurries of phone calls and
e-mails on both sides of the Atlantic _ the take for the photograph
snapped by a Japanese businessman was $75,000 and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The price, in part, reflected the economics of scarcity. On
Tuesday afternoon, as firefighters and rescue vehicles streamed
toward the village of Gonesse and the burning shards of the
Concorde airliner, the photographers of agencies like Corbis-Sygma,
Gamma/FHM and SIPA were jumping onto motorcycles and rushing to the
scene, while agency executives were contacting photo editors around
the world, making deals.
</P>
<P>
   But it was three amateurs _ a Hungarian aviation buff, the wife
of a Spanish truck driver, and the Japanese businessman sitting on
another plane at Charles de Gaulle airport in Roissy _ whose luck
and reflexes produced the signature images that news audiences
would carry in their minds' eye.
</P>
<P>
   Their work immediately spawned mini-markets, some as frenetic as
they were ghoulish. There was little consistency in the economics.
Disasters spawn whirlwind negotiations; the process is as
idiosyncratic as a cyclone's path.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a few standing principles, the same ones that
govern markets everywhere. The fewer the images, the more leverage
the sellers have. The more the photo editors buying know about all
the images available, the more leverage they have.
</P>
<P>
   Wire services tend to pay less than news magazines; tabloids
tend to pay more. And in most cases, auctions and other
negotiations are opened and closed within an hour. Editors and
producers have only that much time to calculate how much to pay to
deprive rivals of an image _ and then calculate whether it is worth
swallowing the cost and possibly ponying up more should a better
image come along before deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The route the Japanese businessman's photo took to become part
of the media bloodstream does not provide a map to future profits
by lucky amateurs. But it does illustrate the system in action.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz, a small new London-based photo agency, heard about the
photo a day after the crash. The businessman, whose name Buzz
executives agreed to keep confidential, reached a member of the
agency through intermediaries, and e-mailed the image to his home
computer, said Steve Lake, a partner in Buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that the photograph was taken through a plane window
with a disposable camera, Lake's Buzz colleague felt no urgency.
But when he opened the e-mail after returning from work on
Wednesday evening, he turned around. ``He stuck them on a disk,
hopped on a scooter,'' Lake said. ``We popped them on a disk here
and said, `Yes, these are good.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was 8 p.m. in London; newspapers were an hour, more or less,
from their early deadlines. The crash was still big news, but it
was a second-day story. The first day, the young Hungarian's grainy
image of the plane in flight, which had been purchased and
distributed by Reuters, had dominated front pages around the world.
Was there a new still image, or was the Japanese snapshot the lone
new image?
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a few discreet inquiries,'' Lake said. ``There was
nothing on the wire services. We thought, `Well, that gives us a
bit more leverage.'''
</P>
<P>
   They started making calls to newspaper picture desks around
Britain. ``We weren't sure how to price it,'' he added. Their
opening suggestion was 4,000 pounds to 5,000 pounds, or from $6,000
to around $7,500. By the time The Daily Mail, The Mirror, The Sun
and The Express had finished bidding, the price was 16,000 pounds,
or close to $25,000, he said. The auction had taken an hour; when
the Mirror closed the the deal, its presses were ready to start.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror had purchased the rights to print the image in the
United Kingdom. Thursday morning, the image dominated the tabloid's
cover, under the headline ``NO CHANCE.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Lake was on the phone to Germany, selling the
German print rights to the publication Bild. And several photo
agencies, including Gamma and Sygma, were on the phone to Lake,
suggesting that a tiny photo agency with one phone line might not
be equipped to do the large deals for international rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lake agreed. After an auction among photo agencies Thursday
morning, London time, he agreed that Sygma would negotiate further
deals; Buzz would get a percentage. By late morning, New York time,
J.P. Pappis, Sygma's formidable New York-based negotiator, was on
the phone to Sarah Harbutt, the photography director for Newsweek
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Harbutt, like her counterparts, Michele Stephenson at Time,
Bronwen Latimer at U.S. News &AMP; World Report, and Maura Foley at
People, was looking for new images.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of photographers to the crash scene had already
produced some wrenching photos. Some of these were spoken for: Time
had a deal with Gamma/FHM giving it rights to the work of Eric
Bouvet. Bouvet, who had been on a long-term assignment illustrating
the work of French firefighters, got access to the crash scene
through his fire contacts. But Bouvet's best pictures were also the
hardest for viewers to take: They showed charred corpses. ``It
looks almost like Hiroshima,'' Stephenson said. ``Very strong. But
it was too much to ask people to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek had struck its deal with Sygma. On Tuesday, Harbutt
said, she had paid $5,000 to underwrite the cost of eight Sygma
photographers at the scene, in return for first refusal on their
images.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pappis called Newsweek to offer first crack at the
Japanese businessman's snapshot, an image new to the United States.
For that, Harbutt said, Pappis proposed Newsweek pay $25,000. After
``lots of back and forth'' the two settled on a fee closer to
$15,000 _ if you count the $5,000 Newsweek kicked in earlier,
closer to $20,000. Pappis said he never discusses the terms of his
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Pappis, Harbutt said, ``makes you feel like the whole world
wants this image and you are about to lose this image.'' But buying
it is making a bet that there is no better image out there, at
least none that will surface before the magazine goes to press
Saturday. ``When I buy at the beginning of the week, I run the risk
of being trumped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quality is another consideration. Harbutt said she considers
whether an image is good enough to carry the cover, or whether it
could be displayed across two inside pages.
</P>
<P>
   How much will the Japanese businessman earn? It depends on his
deal with Buzz, and Buzz's deal with Sygma. ``He could have
negotiated for himself,'' Harbutt said, ``but John Q. Public
wouldn't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   When amateurs have some business acumen, she said, they can
drive prices up. Stephenson said that one of the higher prices Time
ever paid for an image went to a young business student who had, in
a shoebox, the now-famous photograph of a photograph of Monica
Lewinsky, in a beret, smiling up at President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   How fast do photographs lose their value? ``It depends on the
newsworthiness of the story,'' said Latimer of U.S. News. ``The
amateur photographs taken in the Oklahoma bombing were iconic.'' As
for the Concorde disaster, she said, the Hungarian student's image
``will remain in people's minds a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters will not disclose how much it paid for that first image
of the Concorde in flight; printed accounts in Britain put the
figure at under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   If those figures are anywhere close to accurate, the image that
thus far defined the Concorde crash, the image that had the widest
audience, earned a small fraction of the fees that the Japanese
businessman's image will attract.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephenson explained it, ``People want to know how much you
can make from a photo like this. But there's no way to put a value
on it, because the value depends so much on the timing, and on what
else is out there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are few areas of modern society that are as
nasty, brutish and just plain catty as the world of fashion
magazines. Fueled by skim cappuccinos infused with Sweet 'n Low and
the rather desperate illusion that this month's hemline length is a
matter of grave importance to the world's population, the
fashion-editor's world is a place that embraces the casual morsel
of malicious gossip and recycles it over and over again until it
snowballs, in a frenzied crescendo of hushed cell-phone
conversations and secret e-mail messages, into something resembling
truth _ which, of course, it rarely is.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent episode: Katherine Betts became editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar in August of last year. Less than a year later _ or
faster than you can say ``Waiter, a saucer of milk for this table,
please!'' _ a competing editor, Bonnie Fuller of Conde Nast's
Glamour, buoyed by reports of Bazaar's sluggish newsstand sales,
was angling for her job. She had even created sample page spreads
illustrating her vision for Harper's Bazaar, said one former
Glamour editorial staff member who saw the spreads and one current
staff member. A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, disputed the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The episode wound up in Inside.com and The New York Post. But
what is more important is that the reports kicked off weeks of
industry speculation about the safety of Betts' job _ which is, by
the way, perfectly secure, said Hearst executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can become very personal very quickly,'' Betts said,
discussing her world in an interview in her 37th-floor office last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from dealing with the day-to-day slings and arrows of
the magazine world, Betts faces several other challenges, some
arguably greater than sidestepping the droppings of the rumor mill.
For starters, she had to take over from Liz Tilberis, a well-liked
editor who died of ovarian cancer last year. Now, Betts must make a
historic fashion magazine relevant and appealing to readers in a
crowded field that includes W magazine, Vogue, Elle and Bazaar. All
four fashion magazines must now also compete with fast-growing
titles like Time Inc.'s In Style and Hearst's O: The Oprah
Magazine, which have found readers by showing less concern with
fashion than with celebrities (In Style) or self-improvement and
lifestyle (O: The Oprah Magazine).
</P>
<P>
   Betts must also reconcile Bazaar's core philosophy, which has
for much of its 134-year history been to document the evolution of
high-end fashion and couture clothing, with changing American
tastes at the retail level: Americans are less likely to spend
money on formal clothing; they are buying casual wear at cheap-chic
chain stores like H &AMP; M and Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, chief executive of Hearst Magazines, said
that part of the reason she hired Betts, who at 36 is the youngest
editor in chief in Bazaar's history, was because she felt she could
reconcile those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing is that women can buy couture now, and
they can also shop at Banana Republic,'' Black said. ``An editor
does not have to make choices for all American women. Kate is a
young, modern woman who can bring those concepts together in the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts must recast Bazaar after a year that has not been the
smoothest sailing. During her first 11 months, she changed
three-quarters of the magazine's editorial departments and
supervised a redesign that was criticized for streamlining the
distinctive cover typeface conceived by the fabled art director
Alexey Brodovitch. On a more personal level, Betts allowed the
Lifetime network to film a documentary about her first few months
on the job; while it showed several poignant moments of her
balancing motherhood and work, the documentary, ``Putting Baby to
Bed,'' also portrayed her at times as frosty and domineering.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as fashion-world habitues hope for more such morsels
to chew over in lieu of lunch, they may be sorry to learn that from
all outward appearances, Bazaar appears to be taking baby steps
forward under Betts. Advertising pages are up 10 percent for the
year, according to Cynthia R. Lewis, the publisher of Bazaar since
April, as compared with last year, which was one of the worst in
the magazine's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are No. 4 in our competitive set, which is Elle, Vogue, W
and Bazaar, in terms of advertising,'' Lewis said, adding that she
believed ``the window between us and W is closing.'' The September
issue will have around 354 pages, Lewis said, the second largest
September issue in the magazine's history. The February issue had
148 ad pages, and March, 263, both the largest ever for those
months.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the picture is less clear. Overall circulation is
steady; newsstand sales are up slightly, and subscriptions are down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Publisher's Statement filed with the Audit
Bureau of Circulation, the February 2000 issue, which was Betts'
first, sold less than its 1999 predecessors on the newsstand. But
March, April, May and June all sold more than the comparable issues
the previous year. Subscriptions were down by 6.6 percent during
the first six months of 2000, which Hearst executives said they
expected with the redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Bazaar's refashioning comes at a time when all four of the
fashion magazines appear to be in transition. W's publisher, Susan
Blank, resigned unexpectedly two weeks ago; she was the third
publisher in six months. W's ad pages in the all-important
September issue will be less than last year's, said a Fairchild
executive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elle's editor in chief, Elaina Richardson, resigned two months
ago to become director of Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y. The new editor, Roberta Myers, has just taken over.
Elle's ad pages are expected to be up moderately for the September
issue.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Vogue _ Betts' former stamping ground _ is
experiencing something of a setback. Ad pages will be up only
moderately up for the September issue, and Conde Nast publishing
executives said Vogue's advertising pages may be flat for the year.
Richard D. Beckman, Vogue's publisher, and Anna Wintour, its editor
in chief, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   So, Betts' remaking of Bazaar comes at a time when she may be
able to take advantage of setbacks at other magazines. Apart from a
redesign that took hold in February _ it even retroactively changed
the cover logo on Tilberis-era covers featured on subscription
blow-in cards, to some criticism _ she has moved away from the
stark photographic style that was a Tilberis hallmark in favor of
less stylized, looser images. Betts also sought to give the
magazine a younger feel by including features about largely
undiscovered, even obscure fashion designers and artists, a
decision she has since reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the magazine feel younger was specifically part of our
mandate,'' she said. ``I think the first three issues were
definitely much younger-feeling, and that may have come as a shock
to some readers. But our overall mandate, what I tell my staffers,
is that we really want to be of the moment. There is so much
competition out there and so much product that it is very hard to
make every page of the magazine feel like it is right now, of this
moment. And that, to me, is very important and something we will
keep working for.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said, ``I think Kate would be the first to agree that the
first few issues were too young, but she is evolving the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media
services company, said Betts' Bazaar, most importantly, was
appealing to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the magazine is perceived to have some style and
elegance, a little bit more whimsy, and is a little less chilly,''
he said. ``I think the initial reactions have been positive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Hearst executive, the feeling at the corporate
level was one of minor disappointment during Betts' first months,
but that has been recently tempered by the uptick in advertising
pages. Unlike Conde Nast, where editors and publishers come and go
(and come back again), Hearst is a company known for long-term
relationships with its editors; Betts is one year through a
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Black said she would not comment about the length of any
editor's contract, but she did say that Hearst remained fully
supportive of Betts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is smart, she is a winner, and she is driven to make this
magazine successful,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional criticism and the heavy workload, Betts
said she tries to remain buoyant and follows advice given by her
husband as the cameras were rolling for the Lifetime documentary:
``Take the Eisenhower approach and radiate optimism at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this climate and in this day and age, everything is about
the nanosecond, so people judge each other all the time,'' Betts
said. ``When you're the leader of a team, it is very important to
be coherent and have a point of view, and get everybody on the same
page. If the message stops with one person, then you've lost it.
That will not happen.''

 &HT;    PARADE IS A PATCHWORK QUILT OF PROTEST
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Merrily anti-Republican, they cavorted for a
collage of causes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At least on this sunny day, peace and humor prevailed for the
thousands of protesters who rallied several miles from the First
Union Center, where the Republican National Convention officially
opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators danced down the Benjamin Franklin Parkway while
GOP delegates looked down from the balconies of high-rise hotels.
At the end of their march, they staged a street festival near the
steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where ``Rocky'' ended his
triumphant training run.
</P>
<P>
   Police watched from sidewalks, squad cars and motorcycles all
along the route, but the march attracted fewer than half of the
expected 20,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchist and anti-globalist groups have threatened more
confrontation and disruption after the convention convenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know that they are going to have every
opportunity to say what they want to say _ no matter what words
they want to use,'' Police Commissioner John Timoney told the
Associated Press after riding his bicycle alongside the protesters.
``We're fair, we're equitable, but we're also prepared to keep
everyone safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Unity 2000 gathering brought together scores of groups with
a myriad of causes and grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Only the satirical ``Billionaires for Bush'' carried signs
supporting the Republican nominee, and they were really advocating
campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   There were placards for abortion rights, animal rights, freeing
Tibet and Burma, gay rights, universal health care, reparations for
the descendants of slaves, the death penalty and organized labor.
There were signs against rich people, the Star Wars missile
defense, suburban sprawl, police brutality, Latin American death
squads, capitalism, multinational corporations and lynching.
</P>
<P>
   ``More good. Less evil,'' summed up a bunch of chanting guys in
orange T-shirts with a big ``L'' for libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oink. Oink,'' said somebody dressed as a pink pig in protest
of the ``greed'' of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Chaifetz, a Green Party congressional candidate in New
Jersey, wore a ``Go Vegan'' tank top and campaigned against bear
hunting in his home state. Some Asian Americans rallied against
Philadelphia's plan to build a new baseball park in Chinatown. A
group of Mohawks in ``Warpath'' T-shirts jogged by without slowing
to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants of many movements set up tables and sold radical
wares. For $10, you could buy a T-shirt that said ``Dubya. Dubya.
Dubya. Bushoncrack.com'' or ``Support Organic Farmers'' or
``Veterans for Peace.'' Fittingly, they were giving away bumper
stickers that said ``If God Existed, Capitalism Wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Chute, the author of the critically praised novel, ``The
Beans of Egypt, Maine,'' carried a ``Border Mountain Militia'' flag
but tied her camouflage jacket around her waist in the midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a no-wing militia. We don't believe in capitalistic or
socialistic power,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the demonstrators said they dislike Democrats as
much as they loathe Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are corrupt and the political system has to be
scrapped, declared Matt Prescott, an anarchist and student at the
University of New Hampshire.

organization is training for.''

   Minor clashes erupted between anti-abortion and abortion rights
activists, including an injury to an abortion rights protester and

ADVERTISING: YEARLY SURVEY SHOWS IMPROVED AGENCY-CLIENT RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dealings between agencies and advertisers are improving after
two years of strained relations, according to an annual survey. But
difficulties remain in some important areas.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies
and client companies to evaluate their working relationships, show
that tensions have eased, thanks to efforts to bridge the gap
between the two sides. ``We're seeing a lot of steps in the right
direction,'' said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz
Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the 2000 Salz
Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Salz, who has sponsored the survey annually since 1986, said she
was most pleased by this finding: When agency executives were asked
for what percentage of their clients were they able to do their
``best advertising,'' the mean percentage was 65.4 _ the highest
figure ever in that category. ``We hypothesize that this is related
to a renewed appreciation for advertising'' among marketers, Salz
said, generated by the recent spate of extensive campaigns for
dot-coms, which ``allowed agencies to feel they were doing better,
more creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 survey also sought to determine for the first time
whether the the relationships marketers have with interactive
agencies differed from those they had with traditional agencies.
The advertisers who responded said there was more tension in their
dealings with interactive shops and more focus on money; in
addition, they said they provided more strategic direction to their
interactive agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency executives, for their part, said working with dot-com
clients was more tense and time pressured but offered more
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Salz Consulting survey have seesawed in
recent years. In 1996 and 1997, there were strong suggestions of
improved relationships, followed by widespread signs of setbacks in
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In working together to create campaigns to turn consumers into
customers, ``the agency people are often very focused on using
creativity to get attention,'' Salz said, ``while the advertisers
are very focused on hammering home the benefits, making sure the
strategic message comes through.'' The resulting tensions are
evident in divergent answers to some of the survey questions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when asked if there has been more teamwork in
relationships in the last year, 54 percent of the advertisers said
yes, compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if they agreed that there was more focus on money in
the last year, 54 percent of the agency executives said yes,
compared with 32 percent of the advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if there was more or less focus on how they work
with each other, 57 percent of the advertisers said ``more,''
compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were several indications of better relations. When
asked if there were more or fewer hassles _ that's the way the
question was worded _ in their dealings with each other, only 12
percent of the agency executives said ``more,'' while 12 percent
said ``fewer'' and 73 percent said they saw no change. The results
were similar among advertisers: 23 percent said there were more
hassles, 20 percent said there were fewer and 57 percent said they
saw no change.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a
scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers
was 7.2, an increase from 7.0 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, advertisers that compensate their agencies based on
performance criteria like sales rather than conventional commission
or fee methods ranked the quality of their advertising higher, a
mean rating of 7.5 compared with 7.0 for those who use conventional
methods. That was the first time advertising created under
performance-based compensation plans was deemed superior. And after
three years of declines, advertisers indicated that advertising was
becoming more important to them. When asked how much sales could
improve if their agencies did the best possible work, the mean
figure the respondents gave was 26.1 percent. By comparison, last
year the mean figure was 21.4 percent, the lowest response since
the recession year of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Salz was asked if the record boom in ad spending as the American
economic expansion enters its 10th year was serving as a lubricant
to reduce friction between advertisers and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very happy when budgets are increasing and
advertising is driving sales, but I don't think it's the budgets
that have affected what the agencies are feeling,'' Salz replied.
``It's more about the work they're producing.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in April and May for Salz Consulting by
Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J. Salz Consulting
sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising
development for marketers like American Express, Clorox and Compaq.

<P>
   And the mean old MoJo wire, www.motherjones.com, which comes
from a different political side than the vice presidential
candidate, has collected some of his pronouncements: ``I had other
priorities in the '60s than military service,'' he told the
Washington Post in 1989, explaining why he escaped serving in
Vietnam. ``I flunked out,'' he said in 1991 of his career at Yale.
``I set out to be a political science teacher,'' he said in 1978.
``My years in Washington sort of got in the way of that, but it all
ties in. What I want to do is political stuff.''

MARKET PLACE: LACK OF DATA ON VIVENDI-SEAGRAM LEAVES ANALYSTS
PUZZLED
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What is a Vivendi?'' That is what some bewildered Wall Street
media analysts were asking last month when Vivendi SA announced
that it was buying the Seagram Co. for what was then $34 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those analysts are still trying to figure out what
Vivendi is _ or at least what it is up to with Seagram. And their
puzzlement has made them reluctant to offer investors guidance on
whether to buy or avoid the shares of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance has translated into listless stock prices for
both Seagram and Vivendi. Seagram shares are trading well below the
premium Vivendi has agreed to pay. And in Europe, Vivendi shares
have dropped roughly 27 percent since rumors of the deal first
circulated.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a core group of analysts say they have
received little insight into the economics of the merger between
Seagram, a liquor and media company based in Montreal, and Vivendi,
a diversified French company that has stakes in the water,
environmental, industrial, telecommunications and entertainment
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks at Vivendi have gotten very ham-handed advice from
their bankers,'' said Christopher Dixon, media analyst at
PaineWebber, who is one of those frustrated by how little guidance
he said Vivendi had been giving to analysts and institutional
investors. Lazard Freres in Paris represented Vivendi in the
merger, while Goldman, Sachs represented Seagram. Both investment
banks, and the merging companies, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and other analysts say that Vivendi, which until the
announcement of this deal was not well known in the United States,
had been adding and spinning off assets at a dizzying pace. This
makes the company's financial performance and growth prospects hard
to calculate, even before the Seagram deal. And since the deal,
they say, Vivendi has done little to explain the value of acquiring
Seagram or to articulate a growth plan.
</P>
<P>
   The communications gap stems in part from the trend toward
global mergers. Investment analysts in this country are accustomed
to receiving detailed financial data from each partner in a merger.
They expected Vivendi and Seagram to provide the data that would
enable them to make projections. While some of those figures are
public, much of Vivendi's data remains veiled, an analyst said,
because ``French accounting rules do not necessarily disclose how
things are being consolidated.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such projections are produced by enthusiastic and
aggressive investment bankers and chief executives eager to
consummate mergers. Whether or not the future proves them accurate,
they are at least a basis for analysts to start building their own
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, there is little to build upon. More than a
month after the deal was announced, on June 20, there are few
specifics, according to several analysts. ``If you call the
company, they will tell you they are anticipating 40 percent
growth,'' one analyst said. ``But they don't tell you how they will
get that growth. They tell you it will come from telephone and
entertainment, and then tell you they will get back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to Vivendi and its bankers at Lazard Freres
responded that Vivendi had been forthcoming with financial data and
that much of the information was publicly available. But an analyst
pointed out that because Vivendi was now projecting faster growth
than the company's historical growth rates, past data were not all
that enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in global deals lies in logistics and
geography. When Vivendi announced the purchase on June 20, it was
8:45 a.m. in Paris _ 2:45 a.m. in New York _ an hour when few
analysts are glued to their television sets or computer screens.
Vivendi officials flew to New York that day and held a news
conference. But a subsequent conference call with analysts seemed
only to annoy Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came on the phone and never really described the deal,''
Dixon recalled. ``They just took questions.'' It was a stark
contrast to the custom of executives at American companies, who
typically make detailed presentations of merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Vivendi and Seagram held a conference call.
This time, Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., fielded
questions solo for 45 minutes, because Vivendi's chairman,
Jean-Marie Messier, was late, compounding Wall Street analysts'
irritation. Ed Hatch, an entertainment analyst at SG Cowen, said,
``The call was a big feel-good meeting, but it was totally
useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the scarcity of data is having a negative
effect on the two companies' stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each Seagram share would be
exchanged for 0.8 Vivendi share _ assuming Vivendi's stock remains
below $96.69.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing price in Paris for Vivendi of 86.5
euros a share, or $79.84, the 0.8-to-1 ratio means that Seagram
theoretically should be trading at $63.87. But Seagram shares on
the New York Stock Exchange closed Friday at $56.50 _ or an 11.5
percent discount to the deal's valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the merger is expected to close by the end of the year,
that discount could be compelling for investors if they could have
confidence in the Vivendi story,'' said Scott Davis, who follows
Seagram for First Union Securities. But, he added, ``the
information on Vivendi is still forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon of PaineWebber attributes the two stocks' performance to
the lack of guidance from the companies. ``The net result,'' he
said, ``is that everyone has shrugged their shoulders, walked away
and said, `Who needs this now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is among the shruggers. ``If you are going to invest in
the entertainment industry,'' he said, ``remember Woody Allen's
famous line, `The secret to success is showing up.' They haven't
even done that.''

 &HT;    NETWORKS' CONVENTION SNUB ANGERS POLITICIANS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican and Democratic party chairmen
Sunday jointly accused the three major television networks of
evading their civic duty by sharply limiting their convention
coverage this year.
</P>
<P>
   But network anchors and news executives said the cutbacks, which
are even more severe than in 1996, were justified.
</P>
<P>
   They have occurred, they said, largely because the political
parties have leached nearly all the controversy out of their
quadrennial conventions, turning them instead into tightly scripted
events that the viewing public finds boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parties want to put on a week-long infomercial, they
have the right to do that,'' Tom Brokaw, anchor of the NBC Nightly
News, told a Harvard-sponsored forum held at Philadelphia's
historic City Hall. ``But we don't have to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Brokaw added, ``there are many more layers of media out
there that give people more choices than ever before in how to
access the conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that by 2008, most Americans will be getting much
of their political news via real-time streaming video on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News President Andrew Heyward said it was a ``surprise that
we're devoting as much resources as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In making the conventions perfect enough to be TV shows, all
the interest has been drained out of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS and ABC will each air five hours of coverage from the
Republican National Convention, which opens here Monday, while NBC
will limit its air time to half that amount. All three, however,
intend to offer in full the 45-minute acceptance speech that the
GOP nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will deliver in prime
time on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers fall far short of what Jim Nicholson, the
Republican National Chairman, found acceptable. The networks need
to do much better, he said, for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Surveys how that one in five voters decides whom to support in
November on the basis on what happens at the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 25 million registered voters lack access to either cable
or satellite services, relying on the over-the-air networks for
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a social and moral responsibility to do better,''
Nicholson said. ``Everything doesn't have to be (controversial)
news,'' he added. ``Some of it can be simply information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's views were echoed by Edward Rendell, the Democrats'
general chairman. ``What they are doing is flat-out inexcusable,''
said Rendell, who called on the Big Three to air four hours of
convention coverage of each of the four nights.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Brokaw, pressed by the panel moderator, Marvin
Kalb, former director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center for Press,
Politics and Public Policy, conceded that his personal views do not
hold much sway at the network that employs him.
</P>
<P>
   If he were running NBC, he said, it would be doing a lot more
political coverage here, instead of shunting much of his work to
MSNBC, the cable outlet that NBC owns jointly with Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brokaw criticized the convention planners of both parties
for ``draining all the excitement'' out of these events. ``The
issues have been all worked out in advance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Chris Bury, a correspondent for ABC's
``Nightline,'' found it ironic that ``the slicker these shows have
been, the more of the audience gets turned off. I know the
political parties are always looking to get a big bounce out of
their conventions. But we're under no obligation to inflate that
balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Woodruff, who co-anchors Atlanta-based CNN's election
coverage, aligned herself with the politicians on the
lack-of-coverage issue. The Atlanta-based cable news network will
employ more than 400 staffers to present an extensive convention
report.

SPOTLIGHT WILL BE ON LAURA BUSH AS CONVENTION OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Of the various stories about their relationship
that Laura and George W. Bush like to tell, not one gets a more
frequent and thorough workout than this: She married him only after
they had reached an agreement that she would never have to make a
political speech on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   She must have been skeptical. It was the end of 1977, and Bush
was gearing up for what would turn out to be an ill-fated campaign
for a congressional seat from west Texas, and his father was laying
the groundwork for his own ill-fated presidential bid in 1980.
These were the Bushes _ politics was in their plasma. Her vow of
silence was doomed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's appearance at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia on Monday night will be the latest _ and by far the
most nerve-frazzling _ illustration of that. She is scheduled to
deliver the first major address of the event, with thousands of
people spread out before her, the invisible eyes of a national
television audience on her, and the responsibility for properly
jump-starting a four-day jubilee in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get butterflies a little bit, thinking about it,'' she said
in a recent interview, adding that she remained a bit baffled by
how she got from there to here, from a placid career as an
elementary school librarian in the 1970s to the turbulent reality
of a presidential campaign that put her on a national stage,
whether she wanted to be there or not.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, too, marveled at that trajectory. ``If I'd have
said, `Honey, you'll be the kickoff speaker at the Republican
convention in the year 2000,' she would have said, `You've totally
lost your mind, and I'm not marrying you,''' he told several
reporters at the governor's mansion last week.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's remarks point to one of the most intriguing aspects
of Laura Welch Bush, a trait that sets her apart from many of her
predecessors on this path: She never aspired to it, never planned
it, never looked across the broad expanse of the future and saw
herself in a wash of light, with a microphone under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, several of her friends and acquaintances say, she
could trade it all for long afternoons of reading or mornings of
gardening and be utterly happy _ perhaps even happier.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, friends and relatives say, she has adapted to her role
in the limelight and her part as a political spouse with relative
ease and remarkable vigor, drawing on a serious (albeit quiet)
intellect to become an active first lady in Texas and to develop a
public voice and style more mellifluous than her husband's, and
maybe even more assured.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voters who take note of Laura Bush for the first
time on Monday night will undoubtedly be surprised and impressed by
that, and will get little sense of the reluctance she openly
expressed before Gov. George W. Bush launched his campaign for the
White House last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, the former first lady, said in a recent interview
that her daughter-in-law adhered to ``a great philosophy in life _
you can either like it or not, so you might as well like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her convention speech was, in fact, a
harbinger of more activity and a higher profile for her. With the
couple's twin 18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, heading for
college around Labor Day and leaving the Bushes with an empty nest,
Laura Bush plans to hit the campaign trail full-time, at her
husband's side and on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unbelievable life experience,'' she called it in one of
four interviews over the last two months. ``An unbelievable
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were ever-present hints, in her words and gestures and
the observations of those who know her best, that her attitude
about this whole crazy pageant was much more complicated than that.
After her husband literally got choked up when he talked about her
during an event in Greensboro, N.C., three months ago, he explained
in an interview, ``I know she's making a huge sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush made it clear that her interest was in helping
him, not promoting herself, and that she was not offering voters
two for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for office,'' said Laura Bush, 53. ``George is
running for office. I don't really even want to talk about issues
that much. I'm not that knowledgeable about most issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about education,'' she added, mentioning the topic of
her convention speech. ``I know about things that I've worked on.
But you know, most other issues I don't know that much about. And
just to put in my 2 cents to put in my 2 cents _ I don't think it's
really necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference from four years ago, when Elizabeth Dole,
roaming among the delegates at the Republican convention with a
mobile microphone and Oprah-esque panache, was not simply singing
the praises of her husband, Bob Dole, the party's presidential
nominee, but also strutting her own political stuff. It turned out
to be a prelude to her short-lived bid for the presidency last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle hovered Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
first lady who had never been shy about throwing in her thoughts,
and who also had a candidacy in her future.
</P>
<P>
   But their counterparts this time, Tipper Gore and Laura Bush,
seem to be more ambivalent recruits, as content in the background
as in the foreground, yanked by their husbands' desires into races
and places that they might never have chosen for themselves.

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, an intensely private woman, shares none of her
husband's showmanship or garrulousness; toward the end of an
interview with her aboard his campaign plane, when the governor
exuberantly jumped in to compete for the attention of the reporter
seated beside her, she promptly turned away, pulled out several
pieces of stationery and began writing thank-you notes to
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is always bouncing off the walls,'' observed Anne
Johnson, who has known the couple for decades and whose husband,
Clay, is the chief of staff in the governor's office. ``Laura is so
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush says that contrast is one reason that their union,
both personally and politically, works well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I temper that personality,'' she said, referring to
her husband's brashness, ``but I also think that he makes life much
more exciting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But both she and her husband's advisers seem unsure at times of
how exactly to cast Laura Bush's degree of reserve.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they clearly see her detachment from the
messier, more vainglorious dimensions of politics as an advantage:
evidence to support her husband's assertion that he, too, is a
grounded, down-to-earth person not driven by an insatiable ego or a
partisan blood lust. The way Bush praised her in a recent interview
was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cuts right through, through the posturing and
positioning,'' Bush said proudly. ``America's starved for
something. I'm telling you: They're starved for something real. And
that's what she brings. She's a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bush campaign also does not want to
present her as a bashful, timid throwback or blandly dutiful
helpmate _ an inaccurate portrait that might not play well with
female swing voters and that decidedly sells Laura Bush short.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with other journalists in the past, Laura Bush
readily called herself shy, but she now emphatically rejects that
label. Some of her friends go out of their way to do likewise. It
is as if they all received the same memo.
</P>
<P>
   And an expression of distaste swept over her face recently when
this reporter brought up a story, which had appeared elsewhere in
print, that she had once answered a question from George W. Bush's
paternal grandmother about what she did with her life, by saying,
``I read, I smoke and I admire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally made up,'' Laura Bush said. ``I'm sure I said
`I read.' But I certainly didn't say `I admire.''' (As for smoking,
Laura Bush eventually quit.)
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Bush said in a recent interview that she remembered
both her daughter-in-law's three-part answer and her
mother-in-law's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush darn near collapsed,'' Barbara Bush said, recalling
the reaction of the former president's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Laura Bush had a busy professional life as an
elementary school teacher and librarian for a decade before she
began dating George W. Bush, and she remained single, without pangs
of worry, longer than any of her close female friends. She was 31
when she and Bush married in November 1977, three months after they
met.
</P>
<P>
   Her avidity for reading is really an abiding love of literature,
and when she and Bush were living in Dallas and raising their two
daughters in the 1980s, Mrs. Bush, who had given up her career
around the time of her wedding, used her spare time to take classes
on William Faulkner, Greek tragedy and other literary topics.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican primaries earlier this year, she was on a
Truman Capote binge, but had to interrupt it because she found
herself in the middle of ``In Cold Blood'' around the time that
Bush lost the New Hampshire contest to Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so foreboding,'' Laura Bush said of Capote's masterwork,
``and I was reading it during the most anxiety-provoking time, and
I had to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name her favorite book, she cited part of one: the
``Grand Inquisitor'' section of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' by
Dostoevsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said that she moved into the first lady's office in
Austin in 1995, after her husband was first elected governor, with
the expectation that ``cobwebs would grow on the phone,'' she did
not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Right away she became a driving force behind the inception of
the annual Texas Book Festival, which has raised about $900,000 for
the state's public libraries, and in 1998 and 1999 she helped
write, lobby for, and secure the passage of legislation that
allocated $17 million a year to improve programs to teach preschool
children in Texas to read.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush also has a sassy streak that gets scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, George W. Bush occasionally joked in public speeches
that his wife had a librarian's narrow concept of oratory, and it
amounted to a single syllable: ``Shhhh!'' Laura Bush was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a speech, to kid him, to get back at him, I said he was a
gregarious businessman who thought that a bibliography was the
biography _ the story _ of the person who wrote the Bible,'' she
recalled. She laughed heartily at the memory of her little act of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   And she has an adventurous impulse: For her 40th and 50th
birthdays, she went river-rafting with four close female friends,
including a Democratic state senator from Kansas and a midwife from
San Francisco who recently visited Indonesia to teach classes on
childbirth. Around Austin, Laura Bush maintains a similarly
eclectic mix of social acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say that the governor often solicits her
advice, asking for her intuition about people and situations, and
she serves as his filter for much of what gets written about him in
newspapers and magazines, which she seems to monitor more closely
than he does. He often tells reporters not what he thought of their
articles but what she did.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear that she shares his positions on
sensitive issues. He opposes abortion; she declines to elucidate
her feelings. He has presided over more executions than any other
governor; she does not comment on the death penalty either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in so many ways, she has followed his lead. He ran for
governor despite her expressed fears about the privacy that their
family would lose. Then he upped the ante by running for president,
even though she had talked publicly about her trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say to George, for something that he really
wanted to do, that he couldn't do that,'' Laura Bush said, adding
that he, too, would never deny her something that she deemed
important. People who know the couple well have said that his
decision to quit drinking 14 years ago was partly a response to her
entreaties and to a growing worry that he was endangering his
marriage and family life, which he cherished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her own family life had been a stable and
deeply loving one. She grew up as an only child in Midland, where
her father was a successful home builder and her mother kept his
books. Although neither of her parents finished college, they let
Laura know early that they expected her to do so, and she was a
conscientious, excellent student who never got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   She was acutely aware of her mother's other failed attempts to
have a child, several of which ended in premature babies who died
within days, and, perhaps as a result, she said: ``I felt very
obligated to my parents. I didn't want to upset them in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   She and George W. Bush, who also grew up in Midland, went to
different elementary schools but were in the seventh grade together
at the same middle school, although neither of them remembers
knowing the other well. She stayed in Midland while he went to
Philips Academy in Andover, Mass. She and her friends described her
high school years as happy and generally uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   But one day in 1963, when she was 17, she drove through a stop
sign and hit another car. Its occupant, a boy who happened to be a
close friend, was killed in the collision, which was deemed an
accident; no charges were filed against her. Laura Bush said that
she was steeled for the incident to come up during her husband's
presidential campaign, as it did earlier this year, but she
nonetheless tensed at the mention of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, terrible thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1964, she headed to Southern Methodist University
in Dallas, where her major was education. It was a conventional
choice, and one that she briefly doubted in the years after her
graduation in 1968. Feminism had come into vogue; she was reading
some of the books that the movement had spawned, and she said she
told her father that he should not have ``programmed'' her to be a
teacher when she could have been a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Daddy almost immediately pulled out his wallet,'' she
recalled, ``and said, `I'll send you to law school.' He would have
loved to.''
</P>
<P>
   But she remembered: ``I had to admit, when he did that, that I
didn't want to be a lawyer. I wanted to be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She taught in inner-city elementary schools in Dallas and
Houston for three years, living at one time in the same apartment
complex in Houston as her future husband, who was then a pilot in
the Texas Air National Guard. But her place was on the quiet wing,
and his was on the rowdy one, and they never crossed paths.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a master's degree in library science from the
University of Texas in 1973, she settled in Austin, where she
worked as an elementary school librarian. She said that she never
lacked for dates but did not find the right man until, in the
summer of 1977, she visited Midland, where Bush was making his way
in the oil business. A couple who knew them both invited them for a
backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked and talked. Laura Welch listened and listened. The
next night, he took her out for a game of miniature golf. And three
months later they married.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments were necessary. She was persuaded to make her first
political speech the next year, when he waged his unsuccessful
campaign for Congress. He learned to conform to her standards of
tidiness and order, which were so high that one of her friends, Jan
O'Neill, recalled that Laura Bush organized the books in the
couple's bedroom in accordance with the Dewey decimal system.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush family gatherings, she made an unusual addition to the
sometimes rambunctious clan. Her husband recalled his parents and
siblings sitting around the table in Kennebunkport, Maine, their
plates clean, while they watched and waited patiently for his wife
to pick her way through her meal.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wanted a large family of their own, tried for several
years without success, and had already begun the adoption process
when she finally learned that she was pregnant with fraternal
twins.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the outlook was uncertain; she developed toxemia, and
her doctor told her that she would be lucky to deliver one healthy
child. Laura Bush said that whenever she went to the grocery store,
she avoided the aisle with diapers and baby-related items, because
she did not want to stoke her hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she has been a fiercely devoted mother. They also
say she has been an integral part of her husband's success, not
because she is a second engine of his ambition but because she is a
shock absorber, keeping him calm and stable, and occasionally
keeping his mischievous and arrogant streaks in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rein it in, Bubba,'' she told him one day on his campaign
plane, as he held forth at length in front of reporters. Privately,
when she catches him ribbing people mercilessly or strutting
shamelessly, she simply murmurs, ``Bushieee,'' her voice rising at
the end. He knows what that means.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has not given extensive thought to what kind of
first lady she might make, but her mother-in-law has some ideas.
Barbara Bush said her daughter-in-law would be different from
Hillary Clinton because she would ``not get into foreign affairs or
controversial subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would rather make a positive impact on the
country,'' Barbara Bush said. ``And I'm not criticizing Mrs.
Clinton. But it's like oil and water. We're talking about two
different subjects. They're two different people. I think Laura
thinks of others.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said her daughter-in-law would be ``better, much
better'' in the role than she was. ``She won't be a fat,
white-haired old lady,'' Barbara Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   She would also be less voluble, and in many ways less
accessible, because there are tight boundaries around what Laura
Bush is willing to offer for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last September, when she accompanied her
husband to an outdoor memorial service for the seven people killed
by a gunman at a church in Fort Worth. She wore sunglasses, which
she never took off. But every so often, she lifted a tissue to her
face, delicately tucked it behind her dark lenses and then quickly
put it away.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was easy to miss, as she clearly intended it to be.
Campaign or no campaign, Laura Bush was not about to share her
tears.

ANALYSIS: NEW _ AND CURIOUS _ CEASE-FIRE IN KASHMIR MAY BE
SHORT-LIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The conflict between India and Pakistan over the
Himalayan territory of Kashmir is one of the most volatile and
intractable in the world, but the past week has brought the first
tentative signs since intense fighting last summer that tensions
may be lessening, if only for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest anti-India militant group
operating in the part of Kashmir controlled by India, announced a
unilateral three-month cease-fire last Monday that is intended, one
of its leaders said, to give ``peace a chance.'' Hizbul has been
fighting for years so that Kashmir, India's only majority Muslim
state, would have the right to join the Islamic nation of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India, which insists Kashmir is an integral part of India,
reciprocated the Hizbul offer Friday by inviting its leaders and
those of all other militant groups in Kashmir for talks. And the
Indian army followed up Saturday with an announcement that it was
suspending all military operations against Hizbul Mujahideen,
though not against other militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragility of this peace initiative became apparent
Sunday: Hizbul was already threatening to revoke its cease-fire
offer unless India agreed to make the talks ``unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   When it invited Hizbul to negotiate, India left out its usual
requirement that such talks occur within the context of the Indian
constitution, which defines Kashmir as an inalienable part of
India. But Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser, said
in a television interview Saturday night that the constitution
would still define the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra's statement apparently outraged Hizbul, which said in a
handwritten statement from Islamabad Sunday, ``India is once again
using its traditional deception and duplicity. Unless New Delhi
announces in unequivocal and categorical terms that talks will be
unconditional and not under the Indian constitution, the Hizbul
will not honor the cease-fire promise.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what is behind the Hizbul Mujahideen's initiative,
which was denounced by other militant groups, as well as by the
head of Pakistan's main religious political party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami, such as whether the cease-fire was conceived by
Hizbul or the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations with
Pakistan, India, or both.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there seems to be no evidence that either the
Hizbul or India has a solution in mind that would be acceptable to
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, other efforts toward a peaceful solution to
the insurgency in Kashmir have been unsuccessful. And India and
Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since 1947 over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India's Lt. Gen. John Ray Mukherjee, who announced the Indian
army's cessation of operations against Hizbul, said that a majority
of the estimated 1,500 militants in the overwhelmingly Muslim
valley of Kashmir are part of Hizbul. He said that most of them are
from Kashmir, not Pakistan or Afghanistan, but that Hizbul receives
money from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India's Home Minister L.K. Advani said on Saturday that the
amount of violence in Kashmir has decreased since Hizbul's
cease-fire announcement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a broad range of speculation about who convinced Hizbul
Mujahideen to declare the cease-fire _ all of which assumes that
Hizbul did not make the decision on its own. India Today, a news
magazine, reported last week that Indian intelligence sources said
it was their agency that had persuaded leaders of Hizbul, who have
been looking to establish supremacy over the other militant groups
operating in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts in Pakistan and India said they find it
difficult to believe that Hizbul would have taken such a dramatic
step without the tacit approval of its supporters in the Pakistani
government.
</P>
<P>
   They said Hizbul's initiative could be part of a Pakistani
effort to regain the international standing lost last summer when
military forces backed by Pakistan crossed into the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir and occupied some mountain passes, setting off
weeks of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Once India discovered the incursion, it abruptly ended peace
talks with Pakistan and launched an intensive military assault and
diplomatic efforts that led to the withdrawal of Pakistan-backed
forces from the Kashmir heights. In the West and in India, Pakistan
was seen as the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be that Islamabad was not in the loop? This does not
sound plausible,'' wrote Friday Times military columnist Ejaz
Haider of the Hizbul cease-fire offer. The Friday Times is a weekly
publication based in Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan foreign office denied that Pakistan has any
influence with militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan does not exercise any control over freedom
fighters,'' the spokesman, Riaz Muhammad Khan, said Saturday at a
press conference in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Hizbul's cease-fire offer, he said, ``That is a
matter for Kashmiri leadership to decide as part of the dynamics of
their struggle. We do not wish to comment on that further.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, India has repeatedly refused Pakistan's
offers to resume peace talks, maintaining that it will not
negotiate again with Pakistan until there is a marked decline in
the Pakistan-sponsored militancy in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent decline in violence in Kashmir, India's offer
last week to talk with militant groups, notably, did not include
Pakistan.

NEW ECONOMY: AOL'S RIVALS CALL FOR ACCESS TO ITS INSTANT MESSAGING
SYSTEM  
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case
for opening up its instant messaging service _ or IM, as it is
known in the trenches _ is a struggle between the forces of
democracy and those of autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Case, on behalf of the IM industry and users everywhere,
tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of Tribal
Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications
Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve
Case. ``Users of IM, like users of e-mail and the telephone,''
Bagully said, ``deserve the right to free and open communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the FCC building a handful of protesters marched with
signs that read, ``Free IM!''
</P>
<P>
   The ``wall'' that Bagully referred to is the partition that
keeps AOL's instant messaging service a closed system _ one that
prevents users of other companies' instant messaging services from
exchanging messages with users of AOL's service. Instant messaging
enables people to send messages over the Internet that pop up on a
recipient's screen almost instantly, allowing people to communicate
in ``real time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, the Microsoft Corp. is among a dozen or so
smaller players in the IM market that decry what they consider to
be AOL's market-dominating behavior in instant messaging, and they
are demanding that it step up efforts to make its system interact
with theirs. Among the other companies that share the 10 percent of
the IM market not occupied by AOL are Yahoo, Odigo, iCast and
Tribal Voice.
</P>
<P>
   It was the outcry by competitors that landed instant messaging
on the agenda of the FCC's hearing, along with other issues _ most
notably the question of equal access to Time Warner's giant cable
network _ as the commission reviews the pending merger of AOL and
Time Warner. As far as instant messaging is concerned, competitors
contend that AOL's closed network stifles innovation and stymies
growth in their industry.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 180 million registered users so far, IM is
particularly popular with teens and families. But analysts predict
that within a few years business people will account for nearly
half of all IM users.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that the debate is not about whether the
various IM systems will ever work together, but about when and how.
Even AOL does not dispute the need for an interconnection standard.
But like most market leaders, the company would prefer to control
the standard.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's FCC hearing, Barry Schuler, president of AOL
Interactive Services, said that the development and testing of an
instant messaging standard would take over a year. AOL has
continually insisted it needs this much time to ensure the privacy
and security of its customers, particularly against spammers _
people or advertisers that blast unsolicited messages to hundreds
or thousands of recipients. But AOL's critics accuse the company of
stalling in order to better solidify its market position.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said AOL's competitors in instant messaging did not
understand _ or have sufficient sympathy for _ the scope of the
spam problem and how it might impact instant messaging. ``Nobody
else has 23 million people paying them to provide an environment
that's monitored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company said, it has already ``opened'' its
network through royalty-free licensing agreements that allow
Internet service providers and Web companies to use AOL Instant
Messenger technology to create their own messaging software.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's competitors see the spamming and security argument as
a smoke screen. ``They've been saying that the last few months, but
they've never backed it up with facts,'' said Avner Ronen, chairman
of Odigo, which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when AOL submitted its proposal for an IM
specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the industry
committee whose job it is to create a technical standard,
competitors criticized its plan as unacceptably vague _ and a
further sign of foot dragging.
</P>
<P>
   A year can seem an eternity on the Internet. So last week, a few
days before the FCC hearing, IM companies formed a new group to
hasten the arrival of a standard, even if only a temporary one. The
group, which calls itself IMUnified and is led by Microsoft, plans
to release a temporary specification next month that would permit
IM systems to talk to one another while a long-term solution is
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ronen said, ``We hope AOL will come to its senses and
cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The IM dispute has been fraught with nastiness and distrust from
the outset. Starting last year, Microsoft and other AOL rivals
began using technical loopholes to interact with AOL's IM users.
Each time, AOL technicians have quickly patched the holes. Odigo, a
small IM provider with about a million users, says that it found a
way to connect its customers to AOL's on 17 recent occasions and
that each time AOL blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   AOL considers these efforts ``attacks'' on its system and vows
to defend itself against security breaches; its competitors contend
their IM customers deserve to be able to freely exchange instant
messages with users of other services.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the AOL-Time Warner merger probably does not hinge
on resolution of the instant messaging dispute. Certainly of
greater concern to the FCC last week seemed to be whether the
merged company would make good on its promise to give all Internet
content providers open access to its cable systems.
</P>

FILM-EASTWOOD &HT;    FILM LEGEND REMAINS A TOUGH GUY WITH A SOFT TOUCH
 &HT;    With optional trim
 &HT;    By LOUIS B. PARKS,
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPACE CENTER, Houston _ The tour groups tromping through
Building 9 at NASA's Johnson Space Center have come to see
astronauts and spaceships. Some also see stars.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting his summer adventure comedy ``Space Cowboys'', which
opens Friday, Clint Eastwood has brought his cast of movie veterans
_ Donald Sutherland, James Garner and Tommy Lee Jones _ to meet the
press at JSC.
</P>
<P>
   It's a return trip for the crew. Last year they filmed several
scenes here for ``Space Cowboys'', a story of vintage test pilots
who finally get a chance to go into space 40 years after their
prime.
</P>
<P>
   It's late now; there's a thunderstorm outside; and Eastwood's
young family _ his wife, Dina Ruiz, and their daughter, Morgan, age
3 _ is waiting for Eastwood to join them in a limousine to a
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who is 70 _ yes, Dirty Harry is a senior citizen _
Eastwood looks remarkably fit. True, age lines surround the eyes.
The hair has thinned and grayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's nothing fragile about the tall, thin frame. His eyes
are still steely. He's still the guy who has punched out or blown
away hundreds of villains while playing some of the roughest,
baddest-tempered good guys in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   (start ital)``Do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya?''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   There's no temper or attitude here, however. Eastwood is
soft-spoken, thoughtful, even chatty. His tone is casual.
Welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' is an ideal vehicle for Eastwood. He's still
playing a determined, tough guy. (He and Jones exchange friendly
punches.) He's still in the middle of the action, though this time
it's in space.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not packing heat or shooting anybody. The script
emphasizes his age rather than pretending he's still a young buck.
He insists neither he nor his co-stars had a problem playing old
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reluctance at all,'' he says. ``These guys are all very
realistic. That's why I hired 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other actors sitting around getting cosmetic
surgery, wearing toupees, and maybe those actors, that's fine for
them. But I wanted guys who weren't afraid to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd play a grandfather in a second. Because I am a
grandfather. People are more realistic nowadays. There are
grandfathers who are hip, vital people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Eastwood and his pals were all 1950s Air Force
test pilots who expected to be among the first men in space but
were passed over.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie's unlikely scenario gives these old-timers
another chance to blast into orbit, they jump at it. Unfortunately,
they can no longer jump very high. The film gets great mileage from
the humor in their attempts to get into shape. Eastwood steps aside
and lets the rest of the cast steal most of the laughs, especially
Sutherland as an amorous old boy still chasing everyone in skirts,
including NASA doctors, engineers and astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman arrives to give the naked flyboys an examination,
everyone ducks and covers _ except Sutherland, who proudly shows he
has the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are asked if they wanted stunt doubles for their
backside nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't need one,'' the grinning Garner says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our butts were already doubled,'' Sutherland adds.
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets around to slightly more serious stuff as the
septuagenarian astronauts blast off to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood had this project in mind even before 77-year-old John
Glenn returned to space in 1998. He picked it because he thought it
would be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (for) the whole idea of resurrection, the chance of guys
coming back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood movies court a youthful audience, so a big-budget film
in which almost all the stars are well over 50 is a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go for fads,'' Eastwood says. ``Right now there's sort of
an obsession about making young films, and that's great, that's
cool. I guess they feel (that way) because the audience is younger.
But they don't credit the audience with wanting to see a lot of
different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of older audiences are going to see `The Perfect Storm,'
things like that. I've done pictures that appeal to younger
audiences, but I'm not making it for any audience, I'm making it
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little kid watching movies, I always identified
with the grown-up. I wanted to be the gunslinger or the fireman,
the cop, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are sitting there saying, `When I'm 70,
I'd love to be doing an adventure like that.' Not `Grumpy Old Men,'
but guys performing at that age in life. It's kind of a fantasy
thing, but that's what films are all about, fantasy. Granddads in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE
</P>
<P>
   You could also say legends in space, but calling Eastwood a
legend is an understatement. His career spans an incredible 47
years. He started at Universal in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was loop (dub) other people that they were too cheap
to bring back and pay for looping,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He had bit parts for several years, but made no impression and
considered giving up acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I did the `Rawhide' series in the late '50s and
'60s,'' he says.``I guess I've been around as long as about
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1964 Sergio Leone spaghetti Western `A Fistful of Dollars'
made Eastwood a star. (He has been Hollywood's No. 1 box-office
attraction of the year five times.) It also ended forever the
traditional American style of Western, which placed clean,
wholesome cowpokes in a tidy, moral West. It was a movie Eastwood
almost didn't make.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent said, `Do you want to go to Italy and do this
Spanish-German-Italian co-production of a (reworked) Japanese
film?' It's real low-budget. And I said, `No, I really don't. Who's
the director?' Sergio Leone. `Never heard of him.' He did a picture
called `Colossus of Rhodes.' `I said, `Oh, yeah, I saw that. Piece
of (junk).'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fistful of Dollars'' is a Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's
samurai movie ``Yojimbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the script. I loved `Yojimbo,' and I loved Kurosawa.
And they said this guy Leone was clever,'' Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been to Italy or Germany or Spain, so I said, `Why
not? I'll go over there, I'll get a trip; nobody will ever see the
film.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film came out and surprised everybody, caught them on
their heels,'' Eastwood says, sounding almost wistful.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Spain with a European cast and crew (except Eastwood),
``A Fistful of Dollars'' was such a hit overseas that it led to two
sequels with Eastwood playing the same role, ``The Man With No
Name,'' in ``For a Few Dollars More'' and ``The Good, The Bad and
the Ugly.'' All three finally made it to the United States in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``So sometimes a little dream like that can come true,''
Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood formed his own company, Malpaso, and made ``Hang 'Em
High,'' which became his first American hit. He's never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   Westerns remained his metier for years, but Eastwood soon moved
into contemporary crime (``Coogan's Bluff,'' 1968), taking the high
level of screen violence with him. By the time he made ``Dirty
Harry'' (1971), he was clearly a star who would last.
</P>
<P>
   He also became the poster boy for film mayhem, for which he was
soundly criticized. The political attitude of ``Dirty Harry'' (it
was often called a fascist film because of the behavior of
Eastwood's police character) no doubt tempered critics' view of
Eastwood. It was as a director that his work was first taken
seriously by most critics. Since directing himself in ``Play Misty
for Me'' (1971), Eastwood has directed 22 films, starring in all
but three (``Breezy,'' ``Bird'' and ``Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil'').
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, he has directed eight of his nine films. (Wolfgang
Peterson directed ``In the Line of Fire'' when Eastwood wanted a
break after ``Unforgiven.'') He won best director and best picture
Oscars and got his only acting nomination for Unforgiven. He also
directed Meryl Streep when she was nominated for ``The Bridges of
Madison County.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his career, Eastwood says, directing gives him
the most satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in the total and not just the one
component,'' he says, quickly adding, ``But I enjoy acting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still willing to be directed by someone else if the project
is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone said, `Let's do a big special-effects movie right
now,''' he says, thinking of all he went through preparing ``Space
Cowboys,'' ``I'd say, `Let's get another director.'''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood may be a granddad in space, but he's a daddy at home.
He married Ruiz, 34 and his second wife, four years ago. They had
Morgan that same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep joking that I didn't have any grandchildren, so I had
my own grandchildren,'' Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood actually is a grandfather. He has two grown children,
Kyle and Allison, with his first wife, Maggie Johnson, and another
daughter, age 6, with Frances Fisher, his co-star in
``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Eastwood says of his family life. ``It's one of
the nice things, and unfair about the male gender, that you can
have children at a fairly old age where you can really appreciate
it, and you're not obsessed by a lot of other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I love family, and I'm much more attentive to it
now than I ever was in my life. I know all the `Scooby Doo' tapes
backwards and forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Family has even replaced moviemaking as the most important thing
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get obsessed by work,'' Eastwood says. ``Which I'm not
now. And I thank God for that. If anybody wanted to know the best
part of aging, it's losing that obsession for work. And spending a
little more time with family and personal life. I think it is great
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't ready to retire, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I (still) have the passion, but I don't want to do as many
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that he's getting better at his job as he gets
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every experience you have every day goes to making you a
better actor,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an intellectual art form. It's an emotional art form.
A gut-reaction art form. The more you allow your inner guts and
emotion to drive you, the more fun you can have with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by ``Space Cowboys,'' Eastwood is still having lots of
fun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What is a Vivendi?'' That is what some bewildered Wall Street
media analysts were asking last month when Vivendi SA announced
that it was buying the Seagram Co. for what was then $34 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those analysts are still trying to figure out what
Vivendi is _ or at least what it is up to with Seagram. And their
puzzlement has made them reluctant to offer investors guidance on
whether to buy or avoid the shares of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance has translated into listless stock prices for
both Seagram and Vivendi. Seagram shares are trading well below the
premium Vivendi has agreed to pay. And in Europe, Vivendi shares
have dropped roughly 27 percent since rumors of the deal first
circulated.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a core group of analysts say they have
received little insight into the economics of the merger between
Seagram, a liquor and media company based in Montreal, and Vivendi,
a diversified French company that has stakes in the water,
environmental, industrial, telecommunications and entertainment
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks at Vivendi have gotten very ham-handed advice from
their bankers,'' said Christopher Dixon, media analyst at
PaineWebber, who is one of those frustrated by how little guidance
he said Vivendi had been giving to analysts and institutional
investors. Lazard Freres in Paris represented Vivendi in the
merger, while Goldman, Sachs represented Seagram. Both investment
banks, and the merging companies, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and other analysts say that Vivendi, which until the
announcement of this deal was not well known in the United States,
had been adding and spinning off assets at a dizzying pace. This
makes the company's financial performance and growth prospects hard
to calculate, even before the Seagram deal. And since the deal,
they say, Vivendi has done little to explain the value of acquiring
Seagram or to articulate a growth plan.
</P>
<P>
   The communications gap stems in part from the trend toward
global mergers. Investment analysts in this country are accustomed
to receiving detailed financial data from each partner in a merger.
They expected Vivendi and Seagram to provide the data that would
enable them to make projections. While some of those figures are
public, much of Vivendi's data remains veiled, an analyst said,
because ``French accounting rules do not necessarily disclose how
things are being consolidated.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such projections are produced by enthusiastic and
aggressive investment bankers and chief executives eager to
consummate mergers. Whether or not the future proves them accurate,
they are at least a basis for analysts to start building their own
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, there is little to build upon. More than a
month after the deal was announced, on June 20, there are few
specifics, according to several analysts. ``If you call the
company, they will tell you they are anticipating 40 percent
growth,'' one analyst said. ``But they don't tell you how they will
get that growth. They tell you it will come from telephone and
entertainment, and then tell you they will get back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to Vivendi and its bankers at Lazard Freres
responded that Vivendi had been forthcoming with financial data and
that much of the information was publicly available. But an analyst
pointed out that because Vivendi was now projecting faster growth
than the company's historical growth rates, past data were not all
that enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in global deals lies in logistics and
geography. When Vivendi announced the purchase on June 20, it was
8:45 a.m. in Paris _ 2:45 a.m. in New York _ an hour when few
analysts are glued to their television sets or computer screens.
Vivendi officials flew to New York that day and held a news
conference. But a subsequent conference call with analysts seemed
only to annoy Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came on the phone and never really described the deal,''
Dixon recalled. ``They just took questions.'' It was a stark
contrast to the custom of executives at American companies, who
typically make detailed presentations of merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Vivendi and Seagram held a conference call.
This time, Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., fielded
questions solo for 45 minutes, because Vivendi's chairman,
Jean-Marie Messier, was late, compounding Wall Street analysts'
irritation. Ed Hatch, an entertainment analyst at SG Cowen, said,
``The call was a big feel-good meeting, but it was totally
useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the scarcity of data is having a negative
effect on the two companies' stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each Seagram share would be
exchanged for 0.8 Vivendi share _ assuming Vivendi's stock remains
below $96.69.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing price in Paris for Vivendi of 86.5
euros a share, or $79.84, the 0.8-to-1 ratio means that Seagram
theoretically should be trading at $63.87. But Seagram shares on
the New York Stock Exchange closed Friday at $56.50 _ or an 11.5
percent discount to the deal's valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the merger is expected to close by the end of the year,
that discount could be compelling for investors if they could have
confidence in the Vivendi story,'' said Scott Davis, who follows
Seagram for First Union Securities. But, he added, ``the
information on Vivendi is still forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon of PaineWebber attributes the two stocks' performance to
the lack of guidance from the companies. ``The net result,'' he
said, ``is that everyone has shrugged their shoulders, walked away
and said, `Who needs this now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is among the shruggers. ``If you are going to invest in
the entertainment industry,'' he said, ``remember Woody Allen's
famous line, `The secret to success is showing up.' They haven't
even done that.''

 &HT;    Pools reflect Poles' summer adventure
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The shrill trill of a lifeguard's whistle is the
universal language of public pools the world over. It allows Konrad
Balabuch to maintain order despite a limited command of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must jump straight,'' Balabuch says after a sharp, short
blow of his whistle. Then with a sweep of his arms he shows a
cluster of children how they must jump from the diving board to the
middle of the pool, not the side.
</P>
<P>
   Balabuch is one of three college students from Warsaw working as
lifeguards this summer at the Lawrence Street Pool in Marietta, Ga.
The three are among the 30 or so Polish students working as
lifeguards in metro Atlanta for USA Pools, a pool management
company.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in better-paying jobs _ even for high school and
college students _ has made finding enough lifeguards a problem in
metro Atlanta this summer, as it has for the past five years. Most
lifeguards make less than $8 an hour. So for the second straight
year USA Pools recruited lifeguards from Europe and Central America
to work here under four-month visas.
</P>
<P>
   International lifeguards must be at least 20 years old, and they
must pass a Red Cross certification course before donning their
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   His poolside position provides Balabuch, 23, with intensive
practice with English, one of the principal reasons he took the
job. ``But the first reason is to have adventure in America,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   That includes learning what a catfish is and hitting the
nightclubs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really keen on dancing,'' says 22-year-old Katarzyna
Ostrowicz who during her stay here goes by ``Kathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostrowicz spent last summer as a lifeguard at a water park in
Wisconsin, so her English is the best of the group. Still, American
slang _ especially the ubiquitous `wazzzup' _ baffles them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were learning British English, so it is difficult to
understand slang,'' says Magdalena Rapinczuk.
</P>
<P>
   But the Poles have quickly caught to the importance of a set of
wheels. ``Life in the U.S.A. is impossible without a car,'' says
Rapinczuk.
</P>
<P>
   After renting a car for a month, Ostrowicz and Rapinczuk chipped
in to buy a 1980 Honda Prelude for $800. Balabuch recently went to
an auto auction to buy a car. Pool supervisor John Galloway has
helped the new car owners navigate the paper maze of emissions
testing and getting a car tag.
</P>
<P>
   People who gripe about Atlanta traffic lack global perspective,
the lifeguards say. Traffic here is a breeze compared to Warsaw,
the urban Polish capital where traffic regularly slows to a 2 mph
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic,'' Rapinczuk says dismissively. ``I can't see traffic
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But American food is worse _ especially the bread. ``I can't eat
this bread,'' Balabuch says.
</P>
<P>
   Any cultural exchange is mostly one-way at the city pool. The
children playing at the Lawrence Street pool pay attention to the
lifeguards only when the whistle blows. The children at the
Marietta Community School Summer Camp come to the pool each Friday
and most were unaware the lifeguards were from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently mistaking Polish for Spanish, 8-year-old Geoffrey
Fontenot thought Balabuch was from someplace else altogether. ``I
think he is Mexican 'cause I heard him speaking,'' Geoffrey
explains.
</P>
<P>
   The lifeguards will be working here until September and all
three plan to return to the states, in part because Americans smile
more than Poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are not so serious,'' says Ostrowicz, ``so it's
easy to have fun. People here are really keen on that.''

It allows Konrad Balabuch to maintain order despite a limited

a sharp, short blow of his whistle. Then with a sweep of his arms
he shows a cluster of children how they must jump from the diving
board to the middle of the pool, not the side. Balabuch is one of
three college students from Warsaw working as lifeguards this
summer at the Lawrence Street Pool in Marietta, Ga. The three are

(resending with keyword) &HT;    FILM LEGEND REMAINS A TOUGH GUY WITH A SOFT TOUCH
 &HT;    With optional trim
 &HT;    By LOUIS B. PARKS,
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPACE CENTER, Houston _ The tour groups tromping through
Building 9 at NASA's Johnson Space Center have come to see
astronauts and spaceships. Some also see stars.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting his summer adventure comedy ``Space Cowboys'', which
opens Friday, Clint Eastwood has brought his cast of movie veterans
_ Donald Sutherland, James Garner and Tommy Lee Jones _ to meet the
press at JSC.
</P>
<P>
   It's a return trip for the crew. Last year they filmed several
scenes here for ``Space Cowboys'', a story of vintage test pilots
who finally get a chance to go into space 40 years after their
prime.
</P>
<P>
   It's late now; there's a thunderstorm outside; and Eastwood's
young family _ his wife, Dina Ruiz, and their daughter, Morgan, age
3 _ is waiting for Eastwood to join them in a limousine to a
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who is 70 _ yes, Dirty Harry is a senior citizen _
Eastwood looks remarkably fit. True, age lines surround the eyes.
The hair has thinned and grayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's nothing fragile about the tall, thin frame. His eyes
are still steely. He's still the guy who has punched out or blown
away hundreds of villains while playing some of the roughest,
baddest-tempered good guys in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   (start ital)``Do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya?''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   There's no temper or attitude here, however. Eastwood is
soft-spoken, thoughtful, even chatty. His tone is casual.
Welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' is an ideal vehicle for Eastwood. He's still
playing a determined, tough guy. (He and Jones exchange friendly
punches.) He's still in the middle of the action, though this time
it's in space.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not packing heat or shooting anybody. The script
emphasizes his age rather than pretending he's still a young buck.
He insists neither he nor his co-stars had a problem playing old
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reluctance at all,'' he says. ``These guys are all very
realistic. That's why I hired 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other actors sitting around getting cosmetic
surgery, wearing toupees, and maybe those actors, that's fine for
them. But I wanted guys who weren't afraid to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd play a grandfather in a second. Because I am a
grandfather. People are more realistic nowadays. There are
grandfathers who are hip, vital people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Eastwood and his pals were all 1950s Air Force
test pilots who expected to be among the first men in space but
were passed over.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie's unlikely scenario gives these old-timers
another chance to blast into orbit, they jump at it. Unfortunately,
they can no longer jump very high. The film gets great mileage from
the humor in their attempts to get into shape. Eastwood steps aside
and lets the rest of the cast steal most of the laughs, especially
Sutherland as an amorous old boy still chasing everyone in skirts,
including NASA doctors, engineers and astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman arrives to give the naked flyboys an examination,
everyone ducks and covers _ except Sutherland, who proudly shows he
has the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are asked if they wanted stunt doubles for their
backside nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't need one,'' the grinning Garner says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our butts were already doubled,'' Sutherland adds.
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets around to slightly more serious stuff as the
septuagenarian astronauts blast off to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood had this project in mind even before 77-year-old John
Glenn returned to space in 1998. He picked it because he thought it
would be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (for) the whole idea of resurrection, the chance of guys
coming back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood movies court a youthful audience, so a big-budget film
in which almost all the stars are well over 50 is a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go for fads,'' Eastwood says. ``Right now there's sort of
an obsession about making young films, and that's great, that's
cool. I guess they feel (that way) because the audience is younger.
But they don't credit the audience with wanting to see a lot of
different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of older audiences are going to see `The Perfect Storm,'
things like that. I've done pictures that appeal to younger
audiences, but I'm not making it for any audience, I'm making it
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little kid watching movies, I always identified
with the grown-up. I wanted to be the gunslinger or the fireman,
the cop, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are sitting there saying, `When I'm 70,
I'd love to be doing an adventure like that.' Not `Grumpy Old Men,'
but guys performing at that age in life. It's kind of a fantasy
thing, but that's what films are all about, fantasy. Granddads in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE
</P>
<P>
   You could also say legends in space, but calling Eastwood a
legend is an understatement. His career spans an incredible 47
years. He started at Universal in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was loop (dub) other people that they were too cheap
to bring back and pay for looping,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He had bit parts for several years, but made no impression and
considered giving up acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I did the `Rawhide' series in the late '50s and
'60s,'' he says.``I guess I've been around as long as about
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1964 Sergio Leone spaghetti Western `A Fistful of Dollars'
made Eastwood a star. (He has been Hollywood's No. 1 box-office
attraction of the year five times.) It also ended forever the
traditional American style of Western, which placed clean,
wholesome cowpokes in a tidy, moral West. It was a movie Eastwood
almost didn't make.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent said, `Do you want to go to Italy and do this
Spanish-German-Italian co-production of a (reworked) Japanese
film?' It's real low-budget. And I said, `No, I really don't. Who's
the director?' Sergio Leone. `Never heard of him.' He did a picture
called `Colossus of Rhodes.' `I said, `Oh, yeah, I saw that. Piece
of (junk).'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fistful of Dollars'' is a Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's
samurai movie ``Yojimbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the script. I loved `Yojimbo,' and I loved Kurosawa.
And they said this guy Leone was clever,'' Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been to Italy or Germany or Spain, so I said, `Why
not? I'll go over there, I'll get a trip; nobody will ever see the
film.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film came out and surprised everybody, caught them on
their heels,'' Eastwood says, sounding almost wistful.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Spain with a European cast and crew (except Eastwood),
``A Fistful of Dollars'' was such a hit overseas that it led to two
sequels with Eastwood playing the same role, ``The Man With No
Name,'' in ``For a Few Dollars More'' and ``The Good, The Bad and
the Ugly.'' All three finally made it to the United States in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``So sometimes a little dream like that can come true,''
Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood formed his own company, Malpaso, and made ``Hang 'Em
High,'' which became his first American hit. He's never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   Westerns remained his metier for years, but Eastwood soon moved
into contemporary crime (``Coogan's Bluff,'' 1968), taking the high
level of screen violence with him. By the time he made ``Dirty
Harry'' (1971), he was clearly a star who would last.
</P>
<P>
   He also became the poster boy for film mayhem, for which he was
soundly criticized. The political attitude of ``Dirty Harry'' (it
was often called a fascist film because of the behavior of
Eastwood's police character) no doubt tempered critics' view of
Eastwood. It was as a director that his work was first taken
seriously by most critics. Since directing himself in ``Play Misty
for Me'' (1971), Eastwood has directed 22 films, starring in all
but three (``Breezy,'' ``Bird'' and ``Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil'').
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, he has directed eight of his nine films. (Wolfgang
Peterson directed ``In the Line of Fire'' when Eastwood wanted a
break after ``Unforgiven.'') He won best director and best picture
Oscars and got his only acting nomination for Unforgiven. He also
directed Meryl Streep when she was nominated for ``The Bridges of
Madison County.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his career, Eastwood says, directing gives him
the most satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in the total and not just the one
component,'' he says, quickly adding, ``But I enjoy acting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still willing to be directed by someone else if the project
is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone said, `Let's do a big special-effects movie right
now,''' he says, thinking of all he went through preparing ``Space
Cowboys,'' ``I'd say, `Let's get another director.'''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood may be a granddad in space, but he's a daddy at home.
He married Ruiz, 34 and his second wife, four years ago. They had
Morgan that same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep joking that I didn't have any grandchildren, so I had
my own grandchildren,'' Eastwood says.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood actually is a grandfather. He has two grown children,
Kyle and Allison, with his first wife, Maggie Johnson, and another
daughter, age 6, with Frances Fisher, his co-star in
``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Eastwood says of his family life. ``It's one of
the nice things, and unfair about the male gender, that you can
have children at a fairly old age where you can really appreciate
it, and you're not obsessed by a lot of other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I love family, and I'm much more attentive to it
now than I ever was in my life. I know all the `Scooby Doo' tapes
backwards and forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Family has even replaced moviemaking as the most important thing
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get obsessed by work,'' Eastwood says. ``Which I'm not
now. And I thank God for that. If anybody wanted to know the best
part of aging, it's losing that obsession for work. And spending a
little more time with family and personal life. I think it is great
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't ready to retire, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I (still) have the passion, but I don't want to do as many
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that he's getting better at his job as he gets
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every experience you have every day goes to making you a
better actor,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an intellectual art form. It's an emotional art form.
A gut-reaction art form. The more you allow your inner guts and
emotion to drive you, the more fun you can have with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by ``Space Cowboys,'' Eastwood is still having lots of
fun.

SAN FRANCISCO PAPER'S SALE CLEARED _ AND NOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caught like a subway train in a system with malfunctioning
signals, San Francisco's newspapers have been stuck in place for
almost a year. Last week, a federal judge threw a switch, and the
city's leading newspaper owner, the Hearst Corp., moved quickly
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Legally freed to complete its deals to buy The San Francisco
Chronicle and sell The San Francisco Examiner, Hearst did both in
26 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the antitrust battle apparently behind it, Hearst has
important decisions to make. Having promised that all Examiner
employees can work at The Chronicle, it must consolidate two
newsrooms. It must select a publisher and a top editor and it must
decide what battles to fight in a several-front war.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new and different Examiner. Ted Fang, the new
owner, is free to remake it in the image of his family's other
publications as an emphatically local community paper that wears
its political agenda on its sleeve. Should The Chronicle, which
sells more copies outside San Francisco than in it, go ultra-local
in city coverage to compete?
</P>
<P>
   Jay Harris, the publisher of The San Jose Mercury News
(circulation 289,000), The Chronicle's Silicon Valley competitor to
the south, has taken the battle for readers into San Francisco,
where he now has 2,000 readers. Harris has added 200 newspaper
boxes and 70 retail sales outlets _ all the better to sell the new
edition, which drops ``San Jose'' from its name plate.
</P>
<P>
   Should The Chronicle (circulation 465,000) respond in kind,
expanding its coverage of Santa Clara County, and of the Silicon
Valley business empires that are the show-piece of the national
economy?
</P>
<P>
   National newspapers like USA Today, The New York Times and The
Wall Street Journal are a growing presence. Metro, the
Swedish-based company that brought its free tabloid product to
commuters on Philadelphia's bus and subway system earlier this
year, is hoping to start up in San Francisco. Should The Chronicle
offer more news digests, like Metro, or its own national and
international coverage?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is going to be more competitive than it has ever
been, said William Dean Singleton, chief executive of the MediaNews
Group, whose papers in Alameda County are an irritant on the
Chronicle's southeast flank. P. Anthony Ridder, chief executive of
Knight Ridder, which owns The Mercury News as well as The Contra
Costa Times, east of San Francisco Bay, suggests dryly that readers
would be well served by the competition and better served if they
bought his newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists in The Chronicle's old newsroom are eager to
compete regionally. With enough invested by Hearst, they think The
Chronicle can rise to heights that have eluded it. Ken Conner, an
assistant city editor, welcomes competition with The Mercury News.
``We are serious,'' he said. ``They are serious. It would be a
great newspaper war.''
</P>
<P>
   But decisions usually require planning, and while the antitrust
case brought by Clinton Reilly, a multimillionaire real estate
executive, remained undecided, Hearst forbade Examiner and
Chronicle executives from talking about the future. Now they can
talk. But who will lead the discussions? The career of Timothy O.
White, the Examiner's onetime publisher, is in limbo. Testimony
during the antitrust trial disclosed that White had suggested
``horse-trading'' with Mayor Willie Brown. (I support your
campaign, you stop opposing Hearst's plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Steven Falk, the president of the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency, the business arm of both papers, which have had a
joint operating agreement since 1965. Perhaps someone like W.
Lawrence Walker Jr., a decade ago the No. 2 executive at the San
Francisco agency, and now a seasoned publisher at Hearst's San
Antonio Express-News with practical experience in shutting down a
joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who will be picked first, an editor or a
publisher. It is also unclear if candidates include people at other
newspapers. But soon, someone has to decide if the home-delivery
schedule needs to be moved up, to compete with The Mercury News.
Someone will have to tell the reporters what jobs they will be
doing. If only one television critic is needed, what happens to the
second one? How many metropolitan columnists should there be?
</P>
<P>
   For Gerald Roberts, The Chronicle's current managing editor, the
top three priorities are creating a robust Sunday paper, expanding
coverage of local news, and coverage of collegiate and high school
sports.
</P>
<P>
   For Phil Bronstein, The Examiner's executive editor, city and
suburban news coverage are crucial, but the most-pressing priority
is business coverage (``this is the center of a universe, if not
the universe, in technology.'') Both men want some foreign
coverage; both mention Asia and Mexico.

PATENTS: EARLY DETECTION OF MELANOMA; PINPOINTING LETHAL BURIED
OBJECTS; NEW TWIST FOR BOWLING

<P>
   Skin cancer rates are rapidly increasing, and many aging baby
boomers may discover that sun exposure in early childhood lead to
dangerous lesions in adulthood. Health-care providers and the
public have been taught in recent years to follow the A B C D rule
_ to watch for and inspect skin spots that are Asymmetrical, have
Border irregularities, Color variations and a Diameter greater than
6 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
   But those features are not always visible to the naked eye. Dr.
Marek Elbaum, a New York physicist and engineer, says he thinks a
computer with a light-and-vision system that he and a group of
colleagues have patented will be much better at detecting melanoma
in its earliest stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clinician has to be trained in differentiating between
malignancy patterns of tissue and benign patterns,'' said Elbaum,
who is also president of Electro-Optical Sciences, in Irvington,
N.Y. ``With melanoma,'' he said, ``that is very difficult indeed,
so difficult that thousands of patients die because the melanoma is
not detected early enough. And there is a huge overbiopsy rate
because physicians try to play it safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbaum said 4 million people had high risk factors for melanoma
and must have moles and other growths tested once or twice a year.
Those patients, he said, would be better served by a computer
system that doctors could use as an outpatient tool to determine
whether a lesion is cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central to the computer vision system are ways of analyzing
melanoma lesions, imaging them and then quantifying those images,''
Elbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   First, a sensor shines light from the visible, invisible and
infrared spectra onto a lesion. Light from these different
wavelengths is reflected back from the skin. Ten images are taken
of each lesion.
</P>
<P>
   Software based on a mathematical formula called wavelet maxima
processes the data from those images to weed out irrelevant
information. The software creates a score for each lesion,
indicating the probability of cancer, Elbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaum's company is conducting clinical trials in hopes of
winning approval for the device from the Food and Drug
Administration. He wants to have a device on the market that can be
used by specialists or even nonspecialists by the end of the year.
Elbaum and his colleagues _ Dina Gutkowicz-Krusin, of Princeton,
N.J.; Michael Greenebaum of New York; Adam Jacobs of Glen Ridge,
N.J.; and Alexandru Bogdan of New York _ won patent number
6,081,612.

   Lasers That Pinpoint Lethal Buried Objects
</P>
<P>
   Bell Laboratories was in the news last week with the
announcement of the first so-called plastic laser _ one that could
be less expensive and have a wider variety of uses than the metal
semiconductor lasers commonly used in consumer electronics and
commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   But two inventors from Mississippi recently received a patent
more in keeping with the original, matter-piercing, science-fiction
notion of lasers.
</P>
<P>
   When introduced in the 1950s, lasers _ the word is shorthand for
``light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation'' _ were
popularly conceived as scorching rays of red light that could slice
through sheer rock or solid steel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly half a century later, the most common use of lasers
is to read digitally stored media like compact discs, CD-ROMs or
DVDs. And lasers have found their way into countless medical,
engineering, computer and agricultural devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the one patented last week by James Sabatier and Kenneth
Gilbert of Oxford, Miss., is intended to find what may be millions
of land mines buried in war zones and former battlefields around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The patent covers a method of using lasers and sound signals to
detect buried objects. The system is based on the fact that sound
is reflected from hard objects buried a few inches to a few feet
under a porous surface like dirt. Sound signals bounce between such
buried objects and the surface, and off the objects into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say the vibrations generated by an object like a
land mine are three to 20 times as strong as those coming out of
empty soil. A laser is used to detect those vibrations from a
distance, and to reveal the location of the buried object.
</P>
<P>
   First, a beam of laser light from a sensor called a
laser-Doppler vibrometer is scanned over the ground. The seismic
vibrations cause upper- and lower-side band signals to form in the
laser's frequency, and those signals increase in strength when the
laser passes over a hard, buried object. Laser light is scattered
back to the sensor, where the frequencies are separated and
analyzed to pinpoint the buried object's location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of a buried object, such as a mine, is detected
by the increase in the amplitude of the side bands,'' the inventors
write in their patent. They say their device can be mounted on a
tower or an airplane, so wide areas can be surveyed. Sabatier and
Gilbert received patent 6,081,481.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers That May Add New Twist to Bowling
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ciniello says that lasers will help bowling compete with
interactive electronic and computer games. He has patented a method
of using lasers projected across a bowling lane to increase the
number of points a player can win for a strike or a spare, and to
make the speed and timing of a rolling ball a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to win additional points by timing the roll of the
ball so that it keeps pace with moving spots of laser light. The
spots, from a laser suspended from the bowling-alley ceiling, are
beamed across the lane in a sequence as the ball rolls toward the
pins.
</P>
<P>
   A sensor along the side of the lane detects the ball as it
moves, and a bowler wins the extra points if his ball passes that
spot at the same time the laser lights hit it. Various spots along
the lane are given extra points to add to the traditional strike or
spare score.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the lights can be varied depending on the skill of
the bowler, so, for example, better bowlers might be challenged by
faster light sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ciniello, who lives in Bonita Springs, Fla., won patent number
6,077,167.
</P>
<P>

ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only small changes are expected in the weather pattern across
the eastern half of the nation. A flow of warm, very humid air will
occupy much of the Atlantic seaboard with varying amounts of clouds
and thundershowers. A cluster of storms may drench the eastern
Carolinas. High pressure near Maine will circulate cool, moist air
into much of the Northeast leading to thick clouds and rain from
New York to southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A weak cool front approaching the Appalachians and the Gulf
coast will trigger thunderstorms, some with flooding rains. Low
pressure in the southern Great Lakes will keep the Midwest
unsettled with showers.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of hot air from the Rockies will move to the Plains.
Isolated thunderstorms will precede the heat in the eastern
Dakotas. Record heat will dominate the interior West, with high
temperature records being challenged in Idaho. Tropical storm winds
and rain will lash Hawaii as Daniel passes Oahu.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SMOKEHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Montana is known as Big Sky Country, but travelers around Great
Falls on Saturday must have wondered if they were caught in a
smokehouse. Fires raging in the Lolo National Forest spilled plumes
of dense smoke across central Montana lowering visibility to just a
few miles. Meanwhile, a heat wave crested over the central sections
sending the temperature above 100 degrees at Great Falls for the
first time since Aug. 11, 1996. The heat and smoke will persist
much of this week.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was perhaps the most arcane statement in all the
hours of acronym-filled testimony, one that came on the last day of
the six-day trial. But it may have been a turning point in an
important battle over the limits of a new copyright law, a
potential landmark case that ended its trial phase last week in
Manhattan and now awaits a verdict by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   More news coverage may have been devoted to the recent legal
wranglings over Napster, the Web service that the recording
industry has accused of abetting widespread music piracy. But the
Manhattan case, involving the copying of DVD movie disks, may have
more far-reaching effects _ both on the way cultural products are
consumed and on whether computer code is deemed to be speech
deserving of First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand last Tuesday, David S. Touretzky, a
professor and computer scientist at Carnegie-Mellon University,
paged through a series of exhibits that included lines of software
source code in the C computer language, an English-language
description of the code, long strings of ones and zeros known as
object code and a picture of a T-shirt with the object code printed
on it.
</P>
<P>
   All of the exhibits pertained to the subject of the trial: a
software program that enables a user to decode the scrambling
technology meant to prevent DVD movie disks from unauthorized
copying. Touretzky, an expert witness for the defense, told the
judge that if he saw fit to ban any one depiction of the
DVD-unscrambling software he would have to ban them all, because
they all communicate the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as having a chilling effect on my ability as a
computer scientist to express myself,'' Touretzky said. He was
referring to the court's preliminary injunction that barred a Web
site from posting the underlying, or source, code for the cracking
program. ``If the court upholds this injunction, what would happen
is that certain uses of computer language _ my preferred means of
expression _ would be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment in the trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis A.
Kaplan had appeared to have little doubt about the copyright law's
constitutionality. In ordering the injunction, he had noted that
the First Amendment does not shield copyright infringement, and
that computer code was essentially ``no more expressive than an
automobile ignition key.''
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the professor's testimony, Kaplan said, he would
reconsider his constitutional analysis. It would be hard to make a
case ``that computer code of any kind has no expressive content,''
the judge said. ``Which then gets you to the question of how then
do you deal with it under the First Amendment?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant statement to many legal experts, who see
the DVD case pitting Hollywood's right to retain copyright control
in the digital age against the right of individuals to exercise
First Amendment free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the DVD case does not center on traditional
copyright issues, like how much of a given work may be freely
copied, or how many copies may be legally made, or even _ as in the
Napster case _ who can be held liable for enabling someone else to
make illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the DVD trial is the first test of a 1998 federal law
that made it a crime to manufacture or ``offer to the public'' a
way to gain unauthorized access to any copyright-protected work
that has been secured by a technology like encryption. It may sound
like a hair-splitting distinction, but some people in the debate
see it as a fundamental change _ as if the law now made it illegal
not only to photocopy and sell a copyrighted book, but also to
simply tell someone how to open and read that book without the
publisher's authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called anti-circumvention provision is part of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Congress' attempt to update
copyright law at a time when digital technology has made copying
words, sounds and images far easier and less expensive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the law in its current form worry that it goes
far beyond the specific copyright challenges of the digital age to
give copyright holders broad new powers over how the public uses
their material. They worry that even time-honored ``fair use''
privileges like quoting from a novel in an essay of literary
criticism or showing a movie snippet on a televised review could
become illegal or even technically impossible since devising a way
to do so would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fundamentally change the face of copyright law if we say
none of the limitations and defenses to copying apply if the
copyright owner was smart enough to encrypt,'' said Mark Lemley, a
law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not
involved in the case. ``Can you reverse-engineer software? Can you
make parodies of someone's work? Can you make educational copies?
All of that may be irrelevant if the mere act of getting access to
the content for these purposes turns out to be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the DVD case, eight Hollywood studios are suing the publisher
of 2600, a hacker magazine, for publishing computer code on his Web
site that enables someone to break the encryption system on DVD
movie disks. Studio executives say they are depending on the new
law to prevent the sort of mass copying of movies over the Internet
that is already happening with music. Without the guarantee of that
protection, a Warner Bros. executive testified in court, the
industry would never have begun releasing movies in digital format.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the magazine publisher, Eric Corley, argue that
the law may violate the First Amendment, and that the same
principle of ``fair use'' of copyrighted material that is built
into traditional copyright law should be applied to controlling
access to digital works.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argues that there is a legitimate use for the code
that Corley published on his Web site at the end of last year. They
say that the code is a crucial part of a legal reverse-engineering
process that enables DVD owners to view the disks on computers
running the Linux operating system, something that is otherwise not
currently possible.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome depends on Kaplan, who presided over of testimony
with obvious technological savvy. He has made clear his position
that Congress did not build the notion of ``fair use'' into the
restriction on circumventing encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Corley's defense team, led by the prominent First Amendment
lawyer Martin Garbus, and financially backed by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a free-speech group, have not been optimistic
about winning the trial and have said all along that their main
goal is to lay the groundwork for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side is willing to predict how the judge may now
rule. Kaplan has indicated that he planned to release his decision
shortly after lawyers submit closing briefs on Aug. 8. The wild
card may be Touretzky's testimony, which Jackson said was
``extremely persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The events that prompted the Motion Picture Association of
America, a trade group representing eight leading movie studios, to
sue Corley, 40, began last fall in Larvik, Norway. There, Jon
Johansen, a skinny, self-confident 15-year-old, decided he was
tired of dedicating an entire computer to Microsoft's Windows
operating system just so he could watch DVD movies on a PC. All of
his other computer activities were on machines running either the
Linux operating system or FreeBSD, another alternative to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to his testimony in the Manhattan trial, Johansen and
two people he knew via the Internet agreed to try to make something
that did not yet exist: a software program that would play DVD's on
computers running Linux. They knew that would mean cracking the DVD
encryption system, Johansen said, but their purpose was not to make
illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the DVD encryption, known as CSS for Content
Scramble System, was not difficult to decode. In a matter of weeks
Johansen had sewn together a decryption program he called DeCSS
(pronounced DEE-C-S-S). He posted the DeCSS source code _ its
recipe, in effect _ to an Internet list of people working on a
Linux DVD software player program.
</P>
<P>
   The code was later incorporated into a program that is currently
available on the Web in a test format.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the source code for DeCSS had been widely
disseminated across the Internet. In response, the licensing
organization for CSS _ made up in part of the major film studios
and consumer electronics companies _ has, under a California law,
charged some 500 Web site operators with violating its trade
secrets by posting the code. A preliminary injunction against the
defendants is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen, now 16, was recently named in the California case.
Norwegian authorities, who seized his computer and held him for
questioning last January, have also charged him under Norwegian
laws for contributing to copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, offers have starting surfacing in Internet chat
rooms to trade DVD movies over the Internet that have apparently
been decoded with DeCSS or other programs. The movies would be sent
over the Web with new data-compressing software known as Divx. The
technique is similar to the way MP3 music files are transmitted via
Napster and other music services, except that video files are much
larger and encrypted and typically take many hours longer to travel
across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Just how widespread such copying is, and to what extent DeCSS is
used in such activities, was a matter of some debate at the trial.
In fact, the studios conceded that they had no evidence of an
individual who had actually used DeCSS for piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to prove it,'' said Leon Gold, a lawyer with the
New York firm Proskauer Rose LLP, who is the studios' lead lawyer.
``The point is, we're trying to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the eight studios filed suit under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act against Corley and two other New York
defendants, who have been dropped from the case. The studios are
seeking an order that would permanently bar Corley from publishing
DeCSS, in addition to a declaration that his conduct was unlawful,
but the judge has expressed doubts about whether the power of an
injunction should be invoked in a situation where he may well
conclude that ``the horse is clearly already out of the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue, too, is whether the judge will grant the studios'
request that he forbid Corley from posting links to other Web sites
where DeCSS is available. Such a move would also raise First
Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Garbus, one of Corley's lawyers, The New York
Times submitted an affidavit in the case stating that an article on
the Times' Web site last April provided a link to the 2600 site's
list of links to other sites that were publishing the DeCSS code.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual outcome of the case, legal experts expect
it to lay the groundwork for future battles over the new copyright
act. Corley is being tried for making unscrambling code available
to the public. But there is another key provision to the law, a
portion that Congress suspended when it passed the act in the fall
of 1998. That portion would make it a crime for anyone to
circumvent encryption to gain access to a digital work _ in effect,
to open and read a digital book without the publisher's
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has been asked to issue a
recommendation, due in October, about what groups of people or
classes of works, if any, should be exempted from the statute.
Depending on the outcome, it could be a crime for anyone to use a
program like DeCSS.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only way you got material is basically in an encrypted
form subject to a contract that says, `You may not copy any of
this,' how do you make fair use?''' said Marybeth Peters, the head
of the U.S. Copyright Office. Peters has been holding hearings on
the matter for two years and must make her own recommendation soon
to the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has been weighing arguments by copyright holders who
contend they will have no incentive to produce digital material
without the assurance of such protection, and by educational and
civil liberties groups who argue that society will suffer if access
to the products of mass culture is curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   On many days ``I'm ready to tear my hair out,'' she said. ``The
issues are really complicated, the legislation is less than clear,
the interests are many and varied and we have very little guidance
because the language is ambiguous and the stakes are very high.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
CHENEY SAYS HE MIGHT DO CONTROVERSIAL VOTES DIFFERENTLY (For use by
New York Times News Service clients.) By DAN FREEDMAN c.2000 Hearst
Newspapers PHILADELPHIA Republican vice presidential hopeful Dick
Cheney said Sunday that if he were in Congress now, he might vote
differently than he did as a conservative House member from Wyoming
in the 1970s and 1980s. Cheney's backpedals on his conservative
voting record came as Democrats prepared an ad blitz depicting him
as a conservative extremist and focusing on his votes against the
Head Start pre-school program for impoverished children and
environmental protection programs. Cheney mostly took a ``no
regrets'' approach to his voting record during appearances on the
Sunday morning TV talk shows. But he also suggested that he would
think twice now about some of his controversial votes if he had a
chance to do it all over again. Cheney was greeted by a welcome
rally when he arrived here the day before the opening of the
Republican national convention. At the rally, Cheney again defended
his record and said that ``most of all we want to make Americans
proud again by giving them a president they can respect.'' As the
state of Wyoming's lone House member from 1979 to 1989, Cheney
amassed a strongly conservative voting record, including votes
against a resolution urging freedom for then-imprisoned South
African leader Nelson Mandela and against legislation to ban easily
concealed plastic weapons. On ABC's ``This Week,'' Cheney said ``I
cast 2,000 to 3,000 votes'' in Congress. ``I'm happy to defend my
record.'' He described media questions on his votes as ``trivial.''
Nevertheless, Cheney said on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' that were he
in Congress today, ``I might find a couple I would do
differently.'' Cheney spoke the day before a Democratic National
Committee television ad on his record begins airing. The 30-second
spot singles out Cheney as ``one of only eight members of Congress
to oppose the Clean Water Act, one of the few to vote against Head
Start.'' It continues: ``He even voted against the school lunch
program, against health insurance for people who lost their jobs.''
Cheney shrugged when asked to explain these votes. ``I frequently
voted against measures because I thought funding was excessive,''
he said on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC. ``We had big deficits in the
1980s.'' Cheney dismissed the Democratic attack ad. ``I think the
American people want to hear about the future, not the past,'' he
said. On CBS Cheney said he now supports federal funding for Head
Start. And although he initially opposed creation of the U.S.
Department of Education, he now supports its continued existence, a
position that Bush also endorses. On ABC he defended his votes
against bans on armor-piercing ``cop-killer'' bullets and plastic
guns, which are easy to smuggle through metal detectors. Cheney
cited the Constitution's Second Amendment as guaranteeing Americans
the right to bear arms. ``I'm a strong believer in the Second
Amendment,'' he said. Asked whether that protection was
``absolute'' no matter what kind of weapon, Cheney responded ``it's
pretty absolute when it's in the Constitution.'' Still, on NBC, he
said he voted against the bans because House procedural rules
barred amendments and limited debate. Cheney said he'd be ``happy
to entertain'' the idea of banning the bullets and guns now. On the
Nelson Mandela vote, Cheney said on ABC that while he did not want
the enigmatic South African leader to stay in prison, the
resolution calling for his freedom was coupled with language
calling for recognition of the African National Congress. At the
time of the vote 1986 the ANC was considered a ``terrorist
organization.'' Cheney acknowledged that now the ANC is a
mainstream political organization.(Dan Freedman can be contacted at

 &HT;    When life changed: TV recalls great moments in rock
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ VH1 researchers have roamed through the television
vaults to compile this five-hour flashback through rock 'n' roll
history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the moment that best captures the pure joy of watching
``The 100 Greatest Rock &AMP; Roll Moments on TV'' _ shown by ranking
of importance rather than in chronological order _ isn't clip No.
100 on the countdown (clue word: ``Chastity'') or even, five hours
later, clip No. 1 (clue word: ``Moptops''). No. 16 (clue word:
``higher'') is the vignette that cuts to the point.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, 1967, Ed Sullivan, looking like a protege of J.
Edgar Hoover, introduces a new singing sensation rock group, the
Doors. Standing on a set literally decorated with suspended doors,
lead singer Jim Morrison appears like a Greek god in black leather.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of Brylcreem, his tousled, curly hair defiantly
tumbles below the collar. His pants are so tight that they leave
little to the imagination. While the other guys roll their heads
Zenlike with the beat, Morrison closes his eyes and utters a scream
that sounds like adolescent angst incarnate: ``Come on baby, light
my fie-yer.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, millions of teenagers, sitting trancelike in
front of their black-and-white TV sets, had a jolting, communal
thought: Life as they knew it was going to be different.
</P>
<P>
   If you had to pick the common theme underlying these 100
television clips _ and why they often evoke deeply personal
memories for the people who watched them _ it's change. Changing
fashion. Changing music. Changing sexual mores. Brazen challenges
to authority, meant to disrupt political agendas and points of
view. The moment when what is meets what's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Elvis Presley shaking his hips in front of
Eisenhower-era conservatives, the Beatles shamelessly flirting into
Ed Sullivan's cameras or Kurt Cobain screaming ``Smells Like Teen
Spirit'' in a pep rally video from hell, great rock moments on
television have often been the times when an artist boldly broke
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   There's an undulating Madonna rolling around onstage in a
wedding dress at the first MTV Music Awards. The Who blowing up
Keith Moon's drum kit on ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.'' An
avant-garde John Lennon and Yoko Ono co-hosting the strait-laced
``Mike Douglas Show'' with countercultural guests such as Bobby
Seale and Jerry Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Though some moments come from the 1980s and '90s _ such as Ricky
Martin's explosive performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards or Whitney
Houston singing the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV _ the vast
majority come from the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   That may be more because of changing technology than the tastes
of the producers.
</P>
<P>
   Let us remember: During the rise of rock, there were only three
network television channels. No cable. No VCRs. No MTV or Napster.
Hearing tunes on the radio was a random experience; seeing the acts
perform them live was even more fleeting. Throughout the pre-cable
era of the 1950s, '60s and much of the '70s, it was likely that a
televised broadcast of a rock artist was the only opportunity in
the world at that moment to see the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to see the Beatles on TV, you only had one
choice,'' notes VH1 Senior Vice President Lauren Zalaznick, who
oversaw production of this week's show. ``Everything has become
diluted. Now you can see an act on 30 different channels. It's a
good thing and a not-so-good thing. You can hear from musicians all
the time; the music is accessible. The flip side of that is that
people are not driven in the same way to become part of the
frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's plugged-in teenagers may not understand the former
novelty of seeing a favorite act on television. But anyone who
loves rock music should pop a tape into the VCR. This show's a
keeper.

'McCAIN URGES SUPPORTERS TO `KEEP FIGHTING' FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM AND
TO BACK BUSH &HT;    By TIMOTHY SPENCE
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain, arriving here on the eve of the
Republican National Convention, urged his cheering supporters to
``keep fighting, keep fighting'' to overhaul campaign financing,
and at the same time he encouraged them to back George W. Bush for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the same themes that propelled him to victories in the
early GOP primaries, he reaffirmed his support for Bush _ an
endorsement that unleashed boos as well as applause from an
audience of more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is my home,'' the Arizona senator said.
``I am obliged not by party loyalty, but by sincere conviction, to
urge all Americans to support my party's nominee, Gov. George Bush
of Texas. ... It is quite clear that he is the candidate who offers
change and that the vice president (Al Gore) is the candidate of
the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain _ citing education, national defense and Social Security
_ said he and Bush share many of the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's 16-minute speech at a so-called ``shadow
convention,'' organized by several nonpartisan groups and held
across town from the Republican convention site, touched on issues
that attracted independent as well as Democratic voters during the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the beneficiaries of a campaign finance systhem that is
nothing more than an elaborate influence-peddling scheme in which
both parties aspire to stay in office by selling the country to the
highest bidder,'' he told the crowd. ``For our sake and for our
children's sake, and for the sake of America, keep fighting, keep
fighting. .. ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who sent the Bush campaign reeling with his victory in
the New Hampshire primary, discovered that at least for this
audience, his call for limiting political contributions from
corporations and special interest groups remained very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the shadow convention blame voter apathy on the
influence of contributions to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington kicked off the event
with a wry reference to the $63 million Republican National
Convention, largely financed by corporate contributions. In
contrast, she said, ``our convention is being brought to you by a
collective longing to fix our political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of two nonpartisan public policy organizations denounced
both Democrats and Republicans for accepting record amounts of cash
to finance their campaigns, conventions and partisan advertisements
that are mostly paid for by the unregulated donations commonly
known as ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have become glorified money drops for special
interests,'' Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen S. Miller, president of the Public Campaign, which
advocates public financing of political campaigns, said, ``There
are two sets of constituencies in this country _ cash constituents
and ordinary constituents _ and the ones who come first are cash
constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the New Hampshire primary, he captured six other
states for a total of 231 delegates before conceding to Bush
following the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' contest that included New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those delegates have pledged their support for Bush, and
on Sunday McCain has urged the remainder to vote for him on the
first ballot Thursday night, when the party is expected to nominate
Bush.

 &HT;    McCAIN JEERED BY ACTIVISTS OVER SUPPORT FOR BUSH
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Catcalls nearly forced John McCain from the stage
Sunday when he proclaimed his support for George W. Bush at the
``shadow convention'' of political activists.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative gathering on the campus of the University of
Pennsylvania offered McCain a clear illustration of the tension he
faces in trying to stay true to the reform message of his
presidential campaign while pledging loyalty to the man who
defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain got a far different reception _ prolonged applause
from his supporters when he thanked them one last time with a catch
in his throat. With two top Bush aides in attendance as a show of
unity, McCain then formally released his convention delegates and
asked them to work for Bush's election.
</P>
<P>
   Although cheers greeted McCain when he took the stage at the
shadow convention and called for change, some in the audience of
several hundred people turned on McCain when he praised Bush ``as
the candidate who offers change.''
</P>
<P>
   He heard scattered hisses and boos when he said, ``I am obliged
not by party loyalty but by sincere conviction to urge all
Americans to support my party's nominee, Governor George Bush of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one man repeatedly banged the floor with a heavy stick,
McCain interrupted his remarks. ``If you like, I don't have to even
continue,'' McCain said in clipped tones.
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington, the commentator and main organizer of the
alternative convention, hurried onstage. ``This is a convention
where we can hear everything with respect,'' Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain finished his prepared remarks, but departed without
taking part in a planned question-and-answer session. Such sessions
were staples of McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the auditorium, McCain told reporters he scrapped the
audience exchange because he was running late for an appearance to
autograph copies of his best-selling memoir, ``Faith of My
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the speech was ``fun'' and called the heckling a
part of democracy. But in the past, McCain engaged his detractors,
sometimes inviting them to share the stage for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He said his principal mission in Philadelphia is to encourage
independents and his supporters to get behind Bush's campaign. And
while he may have seemed uncomfortable in doing so Sunday, he said
he has no plans to alter that message.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain delivered a blistering attack on
politicians in general. ``It is we who have squandered the public
trust,'' he said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he will utter similar words when he addresses
the Republican convention Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's critics Sunday praised him for showing up at
the shadow convention, but they also expressed disdain for his
stands on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was jeered over his support for legislation critics said
unfairly takes Navajo Indians off their ancestral lands in New
Mexico. McCain told reporters his critics are misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Zurich, 24, of Philadelphia, said she was glad McCain
showed up Sunday. ``He had to see what people are thinking about,''
said Zurich, who said she supports Ralph Nader for president.
</P>
<P>
   And Jasper Sato, 22, of Baltimore, said it is healthy when
politicians have to listen to their critics. ``We shouldn't put
anyone on a pedestal,'' Sato said.

<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The conflict between India and Pakistan over the
Himalayan territory of Kashmir is one of the most volatile and
intractable in the world, but the past week has brought the first
tentative signs since intense fighting last summer that tensions
may be lessening, if only for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest anti-India militant group
operating in the part of Kashmir controlled by India, announced a
unilateral three-month cease-fire last Monday that is intended, one
of its leaders said, to give ``peace a chance.'' Hizbul has been
fighting for years so that Kashmir, India's only majority Muslim
state, would have the right to join the Islamic nation of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India, which insists Kashmir is an integral part of India,
reciprocated the Hizbul offer Friday by inviting its leaders and
those of all other militant groups in Kashmir for talks. And the
Indian army followed up Saturday with an announcement that it was
suspending all military operations against Hizbul Mujahideen,
though not against other militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragility of this peace initiative became apparent
Sunday: Hizbul was already threatening to revoke its cease-fire
offer unless India agreed to make the talks ``unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   When it invited Hizbul to negotiate, India left out its usual
requirement that such talks occur within the context of the Indian
constitution, which defines Kashmir as an inalienable part of
India. But Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser, said
in a television interview Saturday night that the constitution
would still define the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra's statement apparently outraged Hizbul, which said in a
handwritten statement from Islamabad Sunday, ``India is once again
using its traditional deception and duplicity. Unless New Delhi
announces in unequivocal and categorical terms that talks will be
unconditional and not under the Indian constitution, the Hizbul
will not honor the cease-fire promise.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what is behind the Hizbul Mujahideen's initiative,
which was denounced by other militant groups, as well as by the
head of Pakistan's main religious political party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami, such as whether the cease-fire was conceived by
Hizbul or the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations with
Pakistan, India, or both.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there seems to be no evidence that either the
Hizbul or India has a solution in mind that would be acceptable to
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, other efforts toward a peaceful solution to
the insurgency in Kashmir have been unsuccessful. And India and
Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since 1947 over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India's Lt. Gen. John Ray Mukherjee, who announced the Indian
army's cessation of operations against Hizbul, said that a majority
of the estimated 1,500 militants in the overwhelmingly Muslim
valley of Kashmir are part of Hizbul. He said that most of them are
from Kashmir, not Pakistan or Afghanistan, but that Hizbul receives
money from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India's Home Minister L.K. Advani said on Saturday that the
amount of violence in Kashmir has decreased since Hizbul's
cease-fire announcement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a broad range of speculation about who convinced Hizbul
Mujahideen to declare the cease-fire _ all of which assumes that
Hizbul did not make the decision on its own. India Today, a news
magazine, reported last week that Indian intelligence sources said
it was their agency that had persuaded leaders of Hizbul, who have
been looking to establish supremacy over the other militant groups
operating in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts in Pakistan and India said they find it
difficult to believe that Hizbul would have taken such a dramatic
step without the tacit approval of its supporters in the Pakistani
government.
</P>
<P>
   They said Hizbul's initiative could be part of a Pakistani
effort to regain the international standing lost last summer when
military forces backed by Pakistan crossed into the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir and occupied some mountain passes, setting off
weeks of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Once India discovered the incursion, it abruptly ended peace
talks with Pakistan and launched an intensive military assault and
diplomatic efforts that led to the withdrawal of Pakistan-backed
forces from the Kashmir heights. In the West and in India, Pakistan
was seen as the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be that Islamabad was not in the loop? This does not
sound plausible,'' wrote Friday Times military columnist Ejaz
Haider of the Hizbul cease-fire offer. The Friday Times is a weekly
publication based in Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan foreign office denied that Pakistan has any
influence with militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan does not exercise any control over freedom
fighters,'' the spokesman, Riaz Muhammad Khan, said Saturday at a
press conference in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Hizbul's cease-fire offer, he said, ``That is a
matter for Kashmiri leadership to decide as part of the dynamics of
their struggle. We do not wish to comment on that further.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, India has repeatedly refused Pakistan's
offers to resume peace talks, maintaining that it will not
negotiate again with Pakistan until there is a marked decline in
the Pakistan-sponsored militancy in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent decline in violence in Kashmir, India's offer
last week to talk with militant groups, notably, did not include
Pakistan.

ANALYSIS: FUSING BEAUTY AND TERROR, REVERENCE AND DESECRATION
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may seem heartless to think about beauty in the wake of human
tragedy. But the aftershock from news of the Concorde disaster was
linked to the emotions beauty can stir up. One hundred fourteen
people died as a result of last week's crash. Compared with a
single life, the plane itself is nothing, just metal, rubber and
oil. These were nonetheless combined into one of the most important
cultural artifacts of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 31 years since the first Concorde was rolled out, only a
select few have flown on it. But this swan of a craft has winged
through the imaginations of millions more. It's not just the French
or the British who look up admiringly when the Concorde flies
overhead. Anyone with an eye looks up.
</P>
<P>
   To see: A masterpiece of contrapuntal aesthetics. The contrast
between thin, elongated fuselage and wide, swept-back wings.
Between the curve of the wings and the rectangular engines beneath
them. The proportions of windows in relation to fuselage. The
triangular configuration formed by the needle-point nose and the
wing tips (or, when on the ground, the birdlike landing gear). The
ugly duckling-into-swan metamorphosis when the drooped nose swings
back into place. The Concorde's elegance arises from these formal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's beauty is existential. Profit-taking doesn't keep it
aloft. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000.
Even when full, however, the Concorde has lost money. National
pride is one reason it has stayed in service. The pain of writing
off what it cost to develop the plane may be another. But an
ineffable factor is also at work: a reverential feeling akin to the
impulse to admire an oak, contemplate a painting or gaze up at a
Gothic spire.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is French (or half French) in the sense that the
Chartres cathedral is French, but the plane's appeal is global to
the extent that French civilization is available to others. In 1955
Roland Barthes wrote that cars were the precise modern equivalent
of the great Gothic cathedrals: ``I mean the supreme creation of an
era, conceived with passion by unknown artists, and consumed in
image if not in usage by a whole population which appropriates them
as purely magical objects.'' In the mid-50s new cars could even
satisfy the pangs of aspiration. But by the 1960s the U.S. space
program had raised the stakes. Aspiration now came in the form of
altitude and the skyward thrust of jet propulsion. The Concorde was
Europe's answer to our Apollo mission. Let the Americans catapult
their tin cans, play golf and plant metal flags on the moon. We
Europeans will turn space into a secular idea of heaven: Champagne,
caviar and freshly laundered linen napkins on the headrests.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many brave young souls do dream of becoming astronauts
when they grow up. But a trip to Paris on the Concorde does not
involve settling for less. A rich person I know says that the one
thing she truly enjoys about having money is that it makes
traveling easier. Mass travel, in other words, is what gravity used
to be in the early days of flight: an oppressive condition from
which only the privileged manage to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Concorde has long been trailed by a whiff of morbidity.
Until last week the plane's safety record had been impeccable. But
its status as a cultural icon was always fragile. When the United
States canceled its program to develop supersonic transport for
civilians, the British-French endeavor was left without competition
and the benefits that accrue from it. It is not always so great to
be the only game in town. Without competition there was no
incentive to update the aircraft and none of the improvements that
succeeding generations of supersonic craft might have developed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result Concorde pilots must use their brains to operate
controls that on newer subsonic jets are run by computer. Who knows
whether more advanced controls would have alerted the pilots last
Monday to the flames shooting out of the engines? Or whether
advanced technology could have reduced noise, increased head room,
extended the range of flights or eventually brought down fares? The
craft's obsolescence was thus virtually guaranteed before the first
flight took off.
</P>
<P>
   In this the Concorde resembles the Queen Elizabeth 2, which
began trans-Atlantic service in the summer of 1969. Like the
Concorde the new Cunard liner was launched as a fusion of luxury
and modernity. Unlike the stodgy Art Deco interiors of the Queen
Mary and earlier Queen Elizabeth, the QE2 was fitted with dramatic
jet-black carpets and molded plastic fixtures. But who cared?
Design did not suffice to conquer time. No luxury could compete
with speed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s ads promoting a package deal started to appear in
glossy magazines. Sail first-class to Europe on the QE2, fly home
on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The package, presented as a cutting-edge experience, was
actually an invitation to indulge yourself in not one but two
obsolete forms of travel. Five days worth of shuffleboard and
midnight buffets. Three and a half hours on a plane whose days
became numbered when carriers cast their lot with the 747. To gain
a few hours over regular jets, you had to travel on a plane that
was swiftly becoming a museum piece of aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   For some the Concorde disaster evoked the memory of the
destruction of an earlier legendary trans-Atlantic vessel. On Feb.
9, 1942, while being refitted for wartime use, the French liner
Normandie caught fire at its Hudson River berth. Attempts to put
out the flames filled the ship with so much water that it capsized.
The Normandie lay on its side for the remainder of the war and
never sailed again.
</P>
<P>
   As smoke from the fire drifted over Manhattan, it was understood
that this was not an ordinary military mishap. For many the
Normandie was the most beautiful object created in the 20th
century. It epitomized the style and sophistication for which the
French were celebrated. Some compared it to the Parthenon. And its
destruction was an occasion to look for meanings deeper than the
tragedy's immediate cause. The welder's torch was an instrument in
a ritual enactment of the ancient idea that beauty itself may be
condemned to play a tragic, sacrificial role in human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Our relationship to beauty is not entirely positive. The power
to be moved by it can flow in more than one direction. For
Socrates, erotic attraction was to be directed toward a higher,
moral craving. From there it is but a step toward thinking that
physical beauty is a bad thing. The next step is to regard beauty
as an opportunity to relieve intense rage. Destroy the idol! Crush
Salome!
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Concorde crash I found myself in the middle
of an exchange between Peter Eisenman, the architect, and his wife,
Cynthia Davidson, editor of ANY magazine. Eisenman said, ``Hey, the
Stealth bomber is beautiful, too.'' To which Davidson objected:
``No! The Concorde is beautiful. The Stealth bomber is
terrifying.'' My position is that beauty is terrifying. Like
Homer's Helen or Michelangelo's David, beauty throws everything
into an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   There is pleasure as well as horror to be found in the
desecration of beautiful things. After the French Revolution, the
Sainte-Chapelle was used for storing flour. The Ottomans stockpiled
gunpowder in the Parthenon. The Normandie, appropriated by the
United States from France's Vichy government, was being converted
into a troop ship when it burned. Something there is that doesn't
like art.
</P>
<P>
   There's a risk in dwelling too much on the Concorde's
obsolescence. The risk is that we blind ourselves even further to
the outmoded ways of thinking coursing through culture today. The
Concorde's beauty emerged from the context of the 1960s, a period
interior decorators now call retro. We've given ourselves the
luxury of periodizing progress. At Disney World, the Futureland
attractions have been redesigned as Jetson-style, nostalgic
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   This luxury is turning out to be expensive, and not just because
an original Eames chair can cost thousands. The fundamentals of the
'60s context have not disappeared. As Davidson reminded me, the
demand for speed is greater, not less, in today's world. As
Eisenman suggested, the military faces few obstacles in meeting
that demand. Technically there's nothing to prevent development of
a supersonic passenger craft capable of altitudes from which the
sonic boom would not reach Earth. The Concorde crash, in other
words, ought to shock people out of retro ways of thinking in all
spheres of culture. It could easily be used as an opportunity to
affirm them.

<P>
   The opening-night speakers at the Republican National Convention
will include the following.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell
</P>
<P>
   Retired General
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the war in the Persian Gulf, Colin Powell has been
the most eagerly courted yet most reluctant member of the
Republican Party. Four years ago he was mentioned as a presidential
candidate, and even as recently as last week rumors were flying
about the possibility of him being the running mate of Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 63, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989
to 1993 and served under the man who was chosen as Bush's running
mate, Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Conna Craig
</P>
<P>
   Advocate for Adoption and Foster Care
</P>
<P>
   Conna Craig has worked with state and federal lawmakers to
streamline adoption practices. The president of the Institute for
Children, Craig has researched foster care and adoption practices
around the world. Abandoned at birth, Craig was adopted at age 8
and raised in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Feinberg
</P>
<P>
   Teacher
</P>
<P>
   Michael Feinberg has won acclaim for starting an alternative
education program with 50 fifth-grade students at a public school
in Houston in 1994. This Knowledge Is Power Program was so
successful that it was expanded to two other middle schools _ a
charter school in Houston that accepts students from all over
Texas, and a public school in the South Bronx in New York. Students
attend class much longer than most children, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. on weekdays and for several hours on Saturdays. Teachers are
required to be on call at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine L. Chao
</P>
<P>
   President of United Way
</P>
<P>
   Elaine L. Chao, who was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and came to the
United States at age 8, has taken part in several forums on race.
Chao, who will speak about immigration, has emphasized the
importance of looking at dialogues about race not as a debate
between blacks and whites but as a discussion that should include a
cross-section of races.
</P>
<P>
   She was a deputy transportation secretary in the Bush
administration and the head of the Federal Maritime Administration
in the Reagan administration. She served as director of the Peace
Corps from September 1991 to August 1992. In August 1992 she
replaced William V. Aramony, who was convicted in 1995 of fraud,
tax evasion and conspiracy, as president of the United Way of
America. She resigned the position in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the head of the
GOP's campaign committee in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Darling
</P>
<P>
   Literacy Advocate
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Darling of Louisville, Ky., founded the National Center
for Family Literacy in 1989 as a private, nonprofit corporation to
teach 3- and 4-year-olds ``preliteracy skills'' like getting along
with others and communicating orally.
</P>
<P>
   A former director of adult education for the Kentucky Department
of Education, Darling will speak on community-based literacy
programs. In 1988 she was honored for a program she helped start
that focused on teaching scholastic and family skills to parents
who had not graduated from high school. In 1989, Darling was chosen
by Barbara Bush, then the first lady, to serve on the advisory
committee to the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, a
nonprofit group.

COLUMN: ABC 20/20 REPORT ON ORGANIC FOODS IS CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Bylines at end of items) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, the ABC News correspondent John Stossel hosted a
report on ``20/20'' that probably surprised many viewers. It made
the case that organic food is not necessarily healthier than
conventional food _ and might actually be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Citing research that he said was commissioned by ABC News,
Stossel said that organic food seemed more likely than conventional
food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He also said that
conventional produce does not necessarily have more pesticide
residue than organic produce, contradicting one of organic food's
primary selling points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the
conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing
_ Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia,
and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown University's Center
for Food and Nutrition Policy _ said they never tested produce for
pesticide residue for ABC. ABC executives are now looking into
whether the statement about produce, a key premise on which Stossel
built his case, was made without any basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I agreed to do was test for indications of pathogens,''
Doyle said. ``I didn't do tests for pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that while he did not test produce for pesticides,
he did test chicken _ and found residue on the samples of
conventional poultry, but not on samples of organic poultry. Those
findings were not mentioned in Stossel's report.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' denials were first brought to light by the
Environmental Working Group, which supports the consumption of
organic produce. Members talked to the doctors after the report. In
a letter to Stossel, the group asked for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of the segment, David Fitzpatrick, responded in a
letter by saying that the pesticide tests were done and that the
results had been forwarded to the Organic Trade Association, a
group that spoke in defense of organic produce in the segment. The
executive director of the association, Katherine DiMatteo, said
Friday that the organization had not received results from any
tests for pesticide residue on produce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being told by the environmentalists of the doctors'
denials, ABC showed the report again on July 7. During an
on-the-air conversation with Cynthia McFadden, a ``20/20''
anchorwoman, Stossel said, ``It's logical to worry about pesticide
residues, but in our tests, we found none on either organic or
regular produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ABC News executives still could not address the
questions raised in February. They at first said pesticide tests
were performed on produce by Crawford. Told that Crawford maintains
he did not do such testing, they later released a statement saying
they would look into the matter and ``if a mistake was made, we
will correct it.'' Stossel had no comment and Fitzpatrick was on
assignment in Africa and unavailable.

   lST QUESTIONABLE LETTER FOR A LIAR'S MEMOIR
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Slater is a self-professed liar. But this time she really
wants you to believe her.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, a 36-year-old psychologist in Boston, is the author of
the recently released ``Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir.'' The book is
billed as a memoir but is actually a blending of fact and fiction,
in which the main character, Slater, thinks she has epilepsy but
may be imagining her condition.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with a preface written by a Hayward Krieger,
Ph.D., who is described as a philosophy professor at the University
of Southern California. He calls the memoir ``a new kind of
Heideggerian truth, the truth of the liminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reviewers, including Rebecca Mead in The New York Times
Book Review, found Krieger a bit much. She called the university,
found there was no Krieger, and described the stunt and the book as
``unrewardingly wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Slater was not quite done. Last week, The Times Book Review
received a letter to the editor from Krieger. ``Identity has always
been a fragile phenomenon,'' the letter admonished, ``but that it
now rests upon the report of overworked operators at a university
switchboard is perturbing, and we should all beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter reported that Krieger had merely left the university.
The return address was Slater's Boston clinic, along with a phone
number belonging to her husband. There is no Dr. Krieger.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schneider, executive director of publicity for Random
House, which published Slater's book, said she is not sure if
Slater's editors knew that Krieger was fictitious. They were
unavailable for comment, but Slater says they knew. Schneider said
she finds the letter ``pretty amusing,'' adding that it was clever
publicity for the book.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater insists she had no such intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicity?'' she said. ``I am shocked. I can't believe anyone
would say that. I know it is hard to believe me, but I am being
totally honest with you _ I just thought that letter was very, very
funny. I was sure that whoever gets it at the time would think
Lauren Slater is immature and throw it away. You have got to
believe me.'' Her next book, she says, will be true nonfiction,
about the effect of prescription drugs during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK
</P>
<P>
   NOT UPN ANYMORE, IT'S PARAMOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Viacom's UPN television network is changing its name.
As of January, it will be called the Paramount Network.
</P>
<P>
   Executives made the change to go with the corporate flow.
Chris-Craft Industries Inc. has sold its 50 percent share of the
network, which was originally named for Viacom's Paramount
Television Group and Chris-Craft's United Stations.
</P>
<P>
   But executives say they did not like the way UPN sounded anyway.
And, according to their research, it did not mean anything to
viewers. Paramount seemed a better fit because of its
identification with a major movie studio, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Ware, the network's chief financial officer, said, ``
`Paramount' meant Hollywood, it meant movies, it meant
television.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing for the name change would seem strange. After years
of struggling, UPN finally saw a big increase in ratings this past
year, thanks in large part to its Thursday night World Wrestling
Federation program. By changing names, executives admit, they run
the risk of confusing viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ware said that every effort will be made to make viewers
aware of the change before it happens.
</P>
<P>
   He added that executives hope that the change helps attract more
advertising. Though its ratings have improved, the network is still
not profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's new chief executive, Mel Karmazin, has said that if it
does not become profitable soon, he will get rid of it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Betsy Werronen has heard most of the jokes before.
</P>
<P>
   The one about how being a Republican Party organizer in
Washington is like being an air-conditioner repairman in Alaska. Or
how Republicans are outnumbered here like General Custer's scouts
at Little Bighorn. Or how a Republican has as much chance of being
elected mayor of the nation's capital as does Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Werronen, chairwoman of the D.C. Republican Committee, admits
that when she took the job last month of running the party's local
organization, ``people thought I was nuts _ some people think it's
hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You actually want to do this?'' she remembers being asked.
``Are you crazy?''
</P>
<P>
   During a quick trip home from Philadelphia, where she is leading
the Washington D.C. delegation to the Republican National
Convention this week, she says that when she introduces herself to
other convention delegates, ``some of them kind of roll their
eyes'' when they hear that she is from what may be the Democratic
Party's strongest urban stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a real challenge,'' Werronen says in a bit of the
classic understatement that she learned after a career in both
public relations and State Department diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to deliver the District of Columbia for George W.
Bush?'' she asks. ``No. But I would just love to bring the
Republican vote up by a few percentage points.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city that is the workplace of many of the nation's most
prominent Republican politicians, the local party seems barely to
exist. In Washington, registered Democrats outnumber registered
Republicans by more than 10-1, 256,300 Democrats versus 24,500
Republicans. There are many more registered independents in the
city _ 45,800 _ than Republicans. In half of the city's eight
wards, the Republicans are not contesting city council races this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The result is de facto one-party rule by the Democrats, which
Werronen says she is determined to change during her two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Although they blame the federal government's meddling for many
of the capital's problems, Democrats concede that their record of
leadership here is a checkered one.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the city became a symbol of urban decay. During 16
years in power, Mayor Marion Barry Jr., who ran the Democratic
machine until he retired last year, oversaw a city in which the
school system and other services came close to collapse. Yet Barry
was re-elected in 1994 even after serving a six-month prison term
for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Werronen insists that as the crime rate and the abundant
potholes seemed to push the city close to the abyss a few years
ago, she never once thought of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Washington, D.C., I knew I was going to live in
Washington, D.C.,'' says Werronen, whose home is a 150-year-old
town house in Georgetown, which she shares with her husband, Henry,
and two cockerpoos.
</P>
<P>
   One of two children of a parks commissioner in Brookline, Mass.,
Werronen, now 57, moved to Washington in 1965, the year she
graduated from Boston College and went to work for the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 until 1975, she worked for Sen. Edward Brooke,
R-Mass.. For most of the 1980s, she worked at the State Department,
where for a time she oversaw congressional relations. In 1989, she
founded a public relations and consulting firm. She married her
husband, a health care consultant and art collector, seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Werronen says that the city's traditional Democratic voters
should be open to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do feel that the Democratic Party has failed many of
the people they tried to help in this city,'' she said. ``And Bush
is different. He is inclusive. Sure, he's got some very
conservative positions, but he is inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   An early backer of Bush, she says that she disagrees with him on
a central issue. While the party platform calls for a ban on
abortions, she favors abortion rights. ``I think that politically
and legally you've got to have choice,'' she said. ``But there's
not going to be any candidate that anyone can support on 100
percent of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Werronen admits that part of the Republican Party's problem here
is one of image. ``And that's our fault,'' she says. In a city that
is two-thirds black, some people perceive Republicans here as
``lily-white little old ladies in tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   So Werronen has decided to move local party gatherings out of
mostly white neighborhoods to churches and other gathering points
in neighborhoods populated mostly by blacks. ``We've got to get out
there,'' she says. ``We're going to get people out there and talk
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The party has established a Web site (www.dcgop.com), and it has
stepped up fund-raising efforts, allowing the committee's annual
budget to grow to $130,000 this year from about $50,000 two years
ago. In the past, she said, ``there had been a tendency not to ask
individuals for money because they all thought it was going down a
rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is trying to reach out to other constituencies,
including the city's powerful Asian-American, Hispanic and gay
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she can imagine a Republican mayor of Washington
someday, she says ``absolutely'' and then singles out a likely
candidate, David Catania, a popular member of the city council who
happens to be gay. ``I'm a big-tent Republican,'' she says. ``We've
got a little bit of everything in our party, and I want them all to
be comfortable.''

   L'ANSE AUX MEADOWS, Newfoundland _ Out of the cold gray mists of
the North Atlantic, the small flotilla appeared, tiny boats with
fierce prows, propelled by billowing sails and protected by
circular shields of oak and cowhide. Arriving in this rocky cove on
Friday, Icelandic-speaking men with sun-creased faces and unkempt
hair strode to this unfamiliar shore, their first time on dry land
since sailing south from Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   One thousand years ago, there was a similar scene, seen by some
as a defining moment in human history, as Leif Ericson arrived here
on Newfoundland's northernmost tip. Here, in the only authenticated
Viking settlement in the Americas, historians believe, the first
Christian rites were celebrated in the Americas and the first
European child, Snorri, was born.
</P>
<P>
   The sagas say that Indian attacks forced the Vikings to abandon
their colony within a decade. This resistance helped postpone
European conquest and settlement of the Americas for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's historical vignette on this windy strait facing
Labrador, where whales mingle with icebergs, modern reality quickly
intruded on the magical moment. The cameras caught little girls
clutching Snorri dolls, their brothers strutting in plastic horned
helmets and their parents tapping time to the rock version of a
Newfoundland fishing chanty, ``Your Daddy's a Sailor Who Never
Comes Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting modern fascination with the Norse, a seafaring people
whose medieval trade routes stretched from here to Baghdad, about
15,000 tourists from North America and Europe crammed into this
tiny fishing village, winter population 44, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundland, a craggy island nicknamed ``The Rock,'' is newly
determined to shake off its label as Canada's poorest province.
Long isolated from the rest of North America, it is well on its way
to meeting a self-imposed goal of attracting one tourist each year
for each of its 540,000 residents, a ratio long enjoyed by such
tourism powers as France and Spain. This weekend, tourists driving
up the ``Viking Trail'' found no-vacancy signs at the Vinland
Motel, the Viking Nest Bed and Breakfast, and the Valhalla Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Watson Tucker, a 59-year-old former welder and fisherman, said
as he watched the festival unfold that the whole world seemed to be
there. A graduate of a course in Viking culture offered by the
local branch of the College of the North Atlantic, Tucker sported a
thick beard, deerhide shoes, and heavy green tunic for his summer
job acting the role of a Norse poet.
</P>
<P>
   After half a century under Canada's wing, this onetime British
colony is also rediscovering its North Atlantic neighborhood. St.
John's, the provincial capital, is equidistant in flying time from
Toronto and Reykjavik, Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Atlantic is our pond,'' Brian Tobin, premier of
Newfoundland and Labrador, said after buttonholing the visiting
president of Icelandair about starting flights linking the island
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland's national airline now flies three times a day to
Halifax, Nova Scotia. With more and more Icelanders coming here for
business and shopping, the company wants to increase flights to
five a week and to add stops in St. John's. Iceland plans to open
an embassy in Ottawa next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be said that 1,000 years ago, Iceland opened the first
of all embassies in America, here in L'Anse aux Meadows,'' Halldor
Asgrimsson, Iceland's foreign minister, said as the celebration
here was broadcast live on Icelandic television. ``Now, a
millennium later, Iceland is to open another embassy. This time we
have to do it in Ottawa.''
</P>
<P>
   A visiting Norwegian newspaper reporter noted the absence of a
high-level Norwegian delegation and said that Norway, Denmark, and
Sweden increasingly looked east to the Baltics, rather than west
toward their old North Atlantic colonies _ the Faeroe Islands,
Iceland and Greenland. As a result, these islands increasingly are
knitting trade ties with their Canadian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Motzfeldt, Greenland's deputy prime minister, agreed,
marveling in an interview that, in only three hours, he was able to
fly from Nuuk, Greenland's capital, to St. John's, a modern city of
150,000, three times the population of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The Viking re-enactment, with a cruise ship bringing hundreds of
Scandinavian tourists ashore to watch, is the most visible face of
a growing relationship with the North Atlantic. Half an hour down
the road from where two Norwegian archaeologists, Helge Instad and
Anne Stine, discovered the Norse ruins here in 1960, an Icelandic
company is managing a new shrimp processing plant, providing needed
employment to people laid off after the cod fishery collapsed in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Notre Dame Bay, 130 miles south of here, Jonas Kristjansson,
an Iceland saga scholar, is searching this summer for more Viking
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   In St. John's, where plans are under way to triple
Newfoundland's oil production, to 500,000 barrels a day in 2005,
oil executives talk easily of friendships and professional ties
forged in recent years with Scottish and Norwegian engineers as
Newfoundlanders learned skills for building oil platforms in the
iceberg infested North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this decade, oil royalties are expected to help
end Newfoundland's dependence on aid from Ottawa. But, provincial
planners are betting heavily on tourism to reduce Newfoundland's
double digit unemployment rates, the highest of any state or
province in North America.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the number of tourists is expected to hit 450,000, a
50 percent jump in five years, attributable in part to the low
Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Newfoundland has aggressively promoted itself with a series of
events: in 1997, the 500th anniversary of the arrival here of John
Cabot, the explorer; in 1999, the 50th anniversary of
Newfoundland's joining Canada; and this year, the Viking
millennium. An event next summer will revolve around the centennial
of Guglielmo Marconi's reception in St. John's of a trans-Atlantic
radio transmission from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see 1 million visitors a year,'' Charles Furey,
the provincial tourism minister, said as he strode past the
sod-covered church, chieftain's hall, the smithy and the boat shed
of Norstead, the replica Norse port that opened here two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   These living villages populated with re-enactors turn dry
historical sites into family attractions. Nearby, at the ruins of
the real Viking village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attendance
jumped by 50 percent, to 29,000 last year, after Parks Canada hired
re-enactors.
</P>
<P>
   At Norstead, local actors will be rotated with groups from
Britain, Denmark, Maryland, Sweden and Ontario. Belying the new,
kinder image of the Norse as peaceable farmers, a group of English
re-enactors on Thursday practiced throwing axes at a target wall,
then engaged in mock fights _ a sword in one hand and an ax in the
other.

City police are well restrained, even amiable so far, in the hands
of Commissioner Timoney, an ex-New Yorker, who is riding in his
bike helmet and shorts with motorcycle police as the best way to
monitor things. ``So far so good; but it's early, and you never get

   CVN-CONVENTIONS-TV (Philadelphia) _ The chairmen of the main two
political parties accused the heads of the TV networks Sunday of
shirking their responsibility to educate the American public by
failing to show more of the national conventions. At a panel
discussion sponsored by the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government, the networks responded that such a role is no

<P>
   CVN-McCAIN-REFORM (Philadelphia) _ Sen. John McCain brings his
reform message to Philadelphia on the eve of the Republican
National Convention, telling cheering supporters to ``keep

   NEW YORK _ There are few areas of modern society that are as
nasty, brutish and just plain catty as the world of fashion
magazines. Fueled by skim cappuccinos infused with Sweet 'n Low and
the rather desperate illusion that this month's hemline length is a
matter of grave importance to the world's population, the
fashion-editor's world is a place that embraces the casual morsel
of malicious gossip and recycles it over and over again until it
snowballs, in a frenzied crescendo of hushed cell-phone
conversations and secret e-mail messages, into something resembling
truth _ which, of course, it rarely is.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent episode: Katherine Betts became editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar in August of last year. Less than a year later _ or
faster than you can say ``Waiter, a saucer of milk for this table,
please!'' _ a competing editor, Bonnie Fuller of Conde Nast's
Glamour, buoyed by reports of Bazaar's sluggish newsstand sales,
was angling for her job. She had even created sample page spreads
illustrating her vision for Harper's Bazaar, said one former
Glamour editorial staff member who saw the spreads and one current
staff member. A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, disputed the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The episode wound up in Inside.com and The New York Post. But
what is more important is that the reports kicked off weeks of
industry speculation about the safety of Betts' job _ which is, by
the way, perfectly secure, said Hearst executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can become very personal very quickly,'' Betts said,
discussing her world in an interview in her 37th-floor office last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from dealing with the day-to-day slings and arrows of
the magazine world, Betts faces several other challenges, some
arguably greater than sidestepping the droppings of the rumor mill.
For starters, she had to take over from Liz Tilberis, a well-liked
editor who died of ovarian cancer last year. Now, Betts must make a
historic fashion magazine relevant and appealing to readers in a
crowded field that includes W magazine, Vogue, Elle and Bazaar. All
four fashion magazines must now also compete with fast-growing
titles like Time Inc.'s In Style and Hearst's O: The Oprah
Magazine, which have found readers by showing less concern with
fashion than with celebrities (In Style) or self-improvement and
lifestyle (O: The Oprah Magazine).
</P>
<P>
   Betts must also reconcile Bazaar's core philosophy, which has
for much of its 134-year history been to document the evolution of
high-end fashion and couture clothing, with changing American
tastes at the retail level: Americans are less likely to spend
money on formal clothing; they are buying casual wear at cheap-chic
chain stores like H &AMP; M and Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, chief executive of Hearst Magazines, said
that part of the reason she hired Betts, who at 36 is the youngest
editor in chief in Bazaar's history, was because she felt she could
reconcile those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing is that women can buy couture now, and
they can also shop at Banana Republic,'' Black said. ``An editor
does not have to make choices for all American women. Kate is a
young, modern woman who can bring those concepts together in the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts must recast Bazaar after a year that has not been the
smoothest sailing. During her first 11 months, she changed
three-quarters of the magazine's editorial departments and
supervised a redesign that was criticized for streamlining the
distinctive cover typeface conceived by the fabled art director
Alexey Brodovitch. On a more personal level, Betts allowed the
Lifetime network to film a documentary about her first few months
on the job; while it showed several poignant moments of her
balancing motherhood and work, the documentary, ``Putting Baby to
Bed,'' also portrayed her at times as frosty and domineering.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as fashion-world habitues hope for more such morsels
to chew over in lieu of lunch, they may be sorry to learn that from
all outward appearances, Bazaar appears to be taking baby steps
forward under Betts. Advertising pages are up 10 percent for the
year, according to Cynthia R. Lewis, the publisher of Bazaar since
April, as compared with last year, which was one of the worst in
the magazine's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are No. 4 in our competitive set, which is Elle, Vogue, W
and Bazaar, in terms of advertising,'' Lewis said, adding that she
believed ``the window between us and W is closing.'' The September
issue will have around 354 pages, Lewis said, the second largest
September issue in the magazine's history. The February issue had
148 ad pages, and March, 263, both the largest ever for those
months.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the picture is less clear. Overall circulation is
steady; newsstand sales are up slightly, and subscriptions are down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Publisher's Statement filed with the Audit
Bureau of Circulation, the February 2000 issue, which was Betts'
first, sold less than its 1999 predecessors on the newsstand. But
March, April, May and June all sold more than the comparable issues
the previous year. Subscriptions were down by 6.6 percent during
the first six months of 2000, which Hearst executives said they
expected with the redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Bazaar's refashioning comes at a time when all four of the
fashion magazines appear to be in transition. W's publisher, Susan
Blank, resigned unexpectedly two weeks ago; she was the third
publisher in six months. W's ad pages in the all-important
September issue will be less than last year's, said a Fairchild
executive.

BUSH REACHES OUT TO SWING VOTERS IN OHIO (EDS: Stands for
CINCINNATI-dated story on budget.) (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.) By STEWART M. POWELL c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE ASH, Ohio Republican George W. Bush reached out to
independents and crossover Democrats in the swing state of Ohio on
Sunday with promises to bring the upward mobility of the American
dream within reach of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, working his way toward the GOP convention in Philadelphia,
promised to tackle ``tough issues''' in order to overhaul the
education system, bolster defense spending, cut taxes and provide
younger workers the option of privately investing part of their
Social Security deductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to Philadelphia and we're on our way to
victory,'' Bush told several thousand men, women and children who
stood patiently on a freshly mowed baseball field in intermittent
rain showers to hear from the prospective GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had delayed his arrival at the event to give paramedics
time to evacuate an elderly woman who suffered an apparent heart
attack. Ohio Gov. Robert Taft III called for a moment of silence by
the crowd after the woman was taken away. Officials later said
Helen Geiger, 73, of Cincinnati, had died at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes he can carry Ohio a state won by every
Republican who has captured the White House on the strength of his
plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the ideas on our side,'' Bush said. ``We want to
make sure the American dream, the great American experience,
touches every willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is offering America ``good conservative ideas that
will have compassionate results for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that some Americans are disillusioned and don't
feel part of the nation. Bush said his education overhaul would
help bring the American dream within reach of millions of
Americans, including ``kids in some neighborhoods where despair is
the common way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's conciliatory remarks contrasted with some of the warm-up
speakers who addressed the audience, made up mostly of families
accompanied by children.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State Treasurer Joe Deters challenged the crowd: ``Would
you let your daughter be a White House intern?'' And local radio
talk-show host Bill Cunningham ignited the rain-drenched crowd
before Bush's arrival with a fiery diatribe against the Clinton
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years of Clinton-Gore, I think America needs a
bath and I think we got it now,'' Cunningham told the enthusiastic
audience, referring to the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Likening Bush to Ronald Reagan, a former California governor who
ousted Democrat Jimmy Carter from the White House in 1980,
Cunningham said: ``Let's elect another governor form the West to
scour out the White House of the filth and degradation. God bless
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said she hoped
supporters of Bush would echo his ``positive tone'' and ``join him
in trying to raise the level of public debate.'' She said she had
not heard the hard-edged comments by some speakers, including
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, striking centrist themes, portrayed his commitment to
returning a portion of the federal budget surplus in the form of
tax cuts as a sign of his willingness to defy public opinion. Bush
said many polls show that American voters would rather see the
federal budget surplus devoted to purposes other than a tax cut.
``Polls don't say that's what you should be for,'' Bush boasted.
``But you've got to understand about George W. I don't take polls
to tell me what to think. I do what I think is right and I trust
the American people.'' On Social Security, Bush said he wanted
America's younger workers ``to hear something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You better be worried about when the Baby Boomers start
retiring because there's either going to be a big tax increase or a
huge benefit reduction,'' he continued. If elected Bush said he
would rally Republicans and Democrats in Congress to ``make sure
there's a Social Security system for the younger worker.'' The Bush
campaign signaled that it would strike back when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee released a broadcast campaign
aid aired on Sunday that targeted the 10-year congressional voting
record of GOP vice presidential running mate Dick Cheney. The ad
began airing in at least 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Cheney's record say about their plans?'' the ad
asks. ``What are their plans for working families?'' Bush spokesman
Ari Fleischer said the ``first attack ad'' of the Gore campaign
``lives up to his staff's boast that they will 'cook things up' as
part of a 'slaughterhouse' style of campaigning.''' Fleischer
added: ``We need a leader who will bring people together to get
things done and that's why selectively distorting a good man's
record will hurt Al Gore.''

 NEW YORK: Fairchild executive. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elle's editor in chief, Elaina Richardson, resigned two months
ago to become director of Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y. The new editor, Roberta Myers, has just taken over.
Elle's ad pages are expected to be up moderately for the September
issue.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Vogue _ Betts' former stamping ground _ is
experiencing something of a setback. Ad pages will be up only
moderately up for the September issue, and Conde Nast publishing
executives said Vogue's advertising pages may be flat for the year.
Richard D. Beckman, Vogue's publisher, and Anna Wintour, its editor
in chief, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   So, Betts' remaking of Bazaar comes at a time when she may be
able to take advantage of setbacks at other magazines. Apart from a
redesign that took hold in February _ it even retroactively changed
the cover logo on Tilberis-era covers featured on subscription
blow-in cards, to some criticism _ she has moved away from the
stark photographic style that was a Tilberis hallmark in favor of
less stylized, looser images. Betts also sought to give the
magazine a younger feel by including features about largely
undiscovered, even obscure fashion designers and artists, a
decision she has since reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the magazine feel younger was specifically part of our
mandate,'' she said. ``I think the first three issues were
definitely much younger-feeling, and that may have come as a shock
to some readers. But our overall mandate, what I tell my staffers,
is that we really want to be of the moment. There is so much
competition out there and so much product that it is very hard to
make every page of the magazine feel like it is right now, of this
moment. And that, to me, is very important and something we will
keep working for.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said, ``I think Kate would be the first to agree that the
first few issues were too young, but she is evolving the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media
services company, said Betts' Bazaar, most importantly, was
appealing to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the magazine is perceived to have some style and
elegance, a little bit more whimsy, and is a little less chilly,''
he said. ``I think the initial reactions have been positive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Hearst executive, the feeling at the corporate
level was one of minor disappointment during Betts' first months,
but that has been recently tempered by the uptick in advertising
pages. Unlike Conde Nast, where editors and publishers come and go
(and come back again), Hearst is a company known for long-term
relationships with its editors; Betts is one year through a
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Black said she would not comment about the length of any
editor's contract, but she did say that Hearst remained fully
supportive of Betts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is smart, she is a winner, and she is driven to make this
magazine successful,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional criticism and the heavy workload, Betts
said she tries to remain buoyant and follows advice given by her
husband as the cameras were rolling for the Lifetime documentary:
``Take the Eisenhower approach and radiate optimism at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this climate and in this day and age, everything is about
the nanosecond, so people judge each other all the time,'' Betts
said. ``When you're the leader of a team, it is very important to
be coherent and have a point of view, and get everybody on the same
page. If the message stops with one person, then you've lost it.
That will not happen.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Political tidbits from the Republican National
Convention:
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is known for keeping on message. To help
delegates do the same, Republican National Convention officials are
giving each a 435-page copy of George W. Bush's speeches, policy
positions and campaign fact sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Convention Chairman Andrew Card said Sunday the book, entitled
``Renewing America's Purpose,'' includes all Bush's policy speeches
and position papers for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our road map of the governor's key principles and
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan to hold a daily media briefing at the Sheet
Metal Hall every day during the convention to counter the
Republican message, and one of the main targets will be the record
of vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Former Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, general chairman of the
Democratic Party, asked if he's taking Cheney's voting record out
of context, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's out of context about not voting to not ban bullets
whose sole purpose is to pierce bulletproof vests and kill
policemen? ... What's out of context about that (or) voting against
additional funding for head start, against additional funding for
immunization of children? ... Those votes speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now remember, George Bush keeps telling us he's
compassionate,'' Rendell said. ``And his first deed ... was to pick
a vice president. And he picked a vice president who voted .

   In memory of Sen. Paul Coverdell, who was to lead the Georgia
contingent in Philadelphia, delegates and alternates have donned
blue lapel ribbons. State party chairman Chuck Clay has succeeded
Coverdell as chairman. Rather than advance one alternate into
Coverdell's spot, the delegation plans to rotate the late senator's
floor credentials among several alternates, to give as many as
possible a chance to sit in the delegation's No. 1 spot.

E-COMMERCE: DOT-COM EMPLOYEES GROWING IN NUMBER AND BECOMING MORE
SELECTIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   If executives of e-commerce companies thought they were having a
hard time finding employees last year, this year's Summer of the
Dot-Com Shakeout has brought even more misery to the group.
</P>
<P>
   The number of available workers has grown, but as employees jump
off sinking ships or swim away from ones already capsized, they are
being much more selective about where they dock next. Gone are the
days when Internet retailers could dangle 10,000-share stock
options, utter a few words about revolutionizing the process of
buying gravel, say, and then get a prospective employee to sign on
for a galley slave's salary and 16-hour days in close quarters with
24-year-olds and their Labradors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the words ``stock options'' and ``revolutionize'' are more
likely to set a job applicant's eyes to rolling. Recruiters and
executives say employees now want two things from prospective
employers: a good salary and, perhaps more important, good
prospects for corporate longevity. In the short term, at least,
that means that traditional companies with Internet divisions could
have a substantial advantage in the recruiting wars, thereby
putting additional pressure on their dot-com competitors.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has benefited greatly from the consolidation
among Internet merchants is BlueLight.com, Kmart's online store.
The company successfully recruited employees from Petstore.com, an
online retailer that was recently purchased by Pets.com, as well
the Internet Shopping Network, which merged with Styleclick.com
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 50 resumes per week are pouring in from Reel.com,
Homewarehouse.com and other dot-coms that have either failed or are
failing,'' said David Karraker, a BlueLight spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Homewarehouse.com, an online retailer of home improvement goods,
shut down operations earlier this summer, while Reel.com recently
stopped selling DVDs, videos and other goods on its site and scaled
back to an information site about the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pippa Manley, BlueLight's director of human resources, said the
shifting fortunes of Internet companies had saved BlueLight money,
because she now relies less on pricey corporate recruiters to fill
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very inexpensive hires for me, because if I find
them, I don't have to pay 25 percent of a person's salary to a
headhunter,'' Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   As for their demands, Manley said people were less eager to
discuss stock options as part of their compensation, even though
BlueLight's business is structured so that it could eventually sell
its shares to the public. ``A lot of people are saying, `I don't
care about the options _ let's talk salary,''' she said. ``So
there's been more negotiations on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Manley said such negotiations were frustrating, because she
still saw good potential for BlueLight to have successful stock
offerings someday. ``But then again,'' she said, ``I haven't been
through what they've been through, so it's easy for me to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Lyons, BlueLight's manager of marketing partnerships,
joined the company in June from Xoom.com, a unit of NBCi, NBC's
Internet division. ``Options weren't a big priority at all because
of what happened at NBC,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the NBCi stock reached $85 on its first day of
trading last November, but has plummeted since. (The shares closed
at $22 on Friday.) ``So I was more aggressive on salary,'' Lyons
said. ``Other companies I interviewed with were still giving low
salaries and trying to compensate with umpteen options, which was
so unappealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation aside, Kmart's online operation had its own appeal,
Lyons said: ``I also knew that by coming here, I'd be getting
offline experience, which is important. And I'd be exposed to more
than a desk made out of a door, or bagel Fridays, so that was very
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Anderson, a principal with Monday Technology Solutions, an
executive recruitment firm in San Francisco, said he, too, had
recently been hearing job seekers express a preference for Internet
sites that are affiliated with traditional companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hedging their bets,'' he said. ``They might not get as
many stock options, but the chances are they'll at least be worth
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, such sentiments would make it more difficult for
Internet-only companies to compete, because they cannot afford to
increase their salaries to match those offered by traditional
companies. William Chen, chief executive of OnePage.com, an
Internet-only company that allows users to assemble several sites
on one screen, said such a prospect was more theory than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there may be a decline in what pure plays can
afford to pay,'' he said. ``But for now, it's still a race to pay
whatever we can, especially to the top people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the emphasis continues to be placed on salary _ and
bricks-and-mortar pedigree _ instead of equity, Chen said, ``we
might have to spend more to hire better people, but then just not
hire as many people to do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Myteam.com, an information and commerce site for people involved
in youth sports programs, recently bought air time on a Boston-area
radio station to advertise open positions.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Katzman, the company's chief executive, said Myteam, too,
had recently seen an increase in the number of candidates who
stressed salary over stock options. But he said that change could
be attributed to the Internet labor shortage, which has been so
protracted that recruiters are more actively lobbying workers at
traditional companies, where people are less prone to jump at
equity-heavy compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've had to have more conversations about salary lately,''
Katzman said. ``But it still has to work in the context of the
company, and this is a start-up, so you have to be very careful
about how you spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation packages with stock options also motivate workers
``to build the company's value,'' Katzman said. ``Everyone's got to
have some skin in the game for this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional companies with Web operations are
enjoying the fact that dot-com executives are asking to work for
them, rather than raiding them. ``We take some consolation in
knowing we've populated the dot-coms,'' said Christopher McCormick,
senior vice president of L.L. Bean, which has lost senior-level
executives to Send.com, Diamonds.com, Dell.com and eToys, among
others. ``But I've got to tell you, it hurt morale for people to
see folks leave for stock packages worth a zillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the tide has turned, McCormick said, noting for
instance that the company's vice president for operations, Mike
Perkins, recently joined L.L. Bean from Amazon.com. ``And we've
gotten dozens of resumes from people at dot-coms who want out
because their stock is under water, and they see Bean's staying
power and the quality of life here in Maine,'' McCormick said. ``I
do get some pleasure out of this, to be honest.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A real convention speech
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   I've been talking with my dear friend Ima Source, every
journalist's best buddy, the mother of all scoops.
</P>
<P>
   And I've got a dandy!
</P>
<P>
   Ima, whom I've been on a first-name basis with for many years,
has supplied me with an advance copy of George W. Bush' acceptance
speech set for Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, like every other journalist, I'm a sucker for Ima.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, word-for word. Bush speaks, the world listens...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four major food groups in Washington: The
Administration, the Congress, the media and the lobbyists.'' He
pauses for emphasis. ``And we are eating each other alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered applause, some nervous laughter. The delegates seem
confused. Where is this coming from? Where's he going with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we all know the way things work in Washington. Now I want
to tell you how I think it ought to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be able to come together to discuss ideas that
will make everyone's easier, perhaps through less government ...''
</P>
<P>
   Great cheering, whistling, stomping from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``but sometimes, too, by having more government.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence falls on the convention hall like a sledge hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, a lot of those decisions _ whether more or
less _ are made because the Democratic Party or the Republican
Party decides they do or don't like something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then everyone falls into lock step behind them without ever
stopping to talk about, or think about, what the other side is
suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will say, 'Oh, Barney Frank proposed that,' or 'John
McCain is for that' ... 'Then I can't possibly be for that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an automatic knee-jerk that boots out a lot of good ideas
_ a wholesale dismissal of ideas because you don't the party or the
person behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point Bush turns toward the media gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it happens, if you will forgive me for saying so, as much
in the media as it does in the political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here's something the delegates can understand. Our
candidate criticizes the media, and we cheer wildly. Always have,
always will.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shakes his head and holds up his hands for quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay with me on this, please,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge bill is introduced. Reporters immediately want to know
what key leaders think about it. An honest response would be, 'I
don't know, I haven't read it yet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The media won't accept that, and politicians who don't know
any better _ and I mean that quite literally _ will simply ask
party leaders, 'How does our party feel about it?' Told that the
party is against it, that gives him, or her, an easy answer: 'OK,
then I'm against it ... Won't work, won't fly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need instead,'' Bush says, rapping his knuckles on the
podium for emphasis, ``is a concerted effort by everyone not to
knock the other person's ideas until you have actually looked at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that includes the media not asking us for instant
reaction!
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much is at stake,'' he continues, ignoring the applause
and speaking over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing good ideas and good policy for America's critical
needs _ from housing to transportation to energy, you name it ...
Ideas that never get a chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you a story, a true story. A couple of Republican
staffers were going over a piece of proposed legislation. One of
them was puzzled by a some particularly harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Why's that in there?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Oh, to stick it to the Democrats,''' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Why would you want to do that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Why not?''' he said, genuinely puzzled by her response.
</P>
<P>
   ``' Well, this is a good bill without putting it in there. No
reason to be vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly he understood. He sneered at her.'' Bush manages to
do an excellent imitation of a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``'You're not here because you believe in Republican causes,''
the staffer said. He pointed an accusing finger at his colleague
and began backing out of the room as if she had a loathsome
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ```You're a ...' He all but cloaked on the word. 'You're a
PROFESSIONAL!'''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a dropped pin would have all the impact of an
exploding grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great nation America is,'' Bush says in conclusion.
``Just think how much greater she could be if it weren't for us!''
</P>
<P>
   I was beside myself. ``That's it?'' I asked Ima Source. ``That's
what the speech will be?!''
</P>
<P>
   Ima nodded her assurance. ``Word for word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrific,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I was already starting to write the story in my head and halfway
out the door when I paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, is there anything else spectacular going to happen at the
convention this week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this,'' Ima confided, looking around to make sure no one
else was listening and lowering his voice to a whisper: ``Pigs will
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember. You read it here first.

   If executives of e-commerce companies thought they were having a

   Presumably, such sentiments would make it more difficult for
Internet-only companies to compete, because they cannot afford to
increase their salaries to match those offered by traditional
companies. William Chen, chief executive of OnePage.com, an
Internet-only company that allows users to assemble several sites
on one screen, said such a prospect was more theory than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there may be a decline in what pure plays can
afford to pay,'' he said. ``But for now, it's still a race to pay
whatever we can, especially to the top people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the emphasis continues to be placed on salary _ and
bricks-and-mortar pedigree _ instead of equity, Chen said, ``we
might have to spend more to hire better people, but then just not
hire as many people to do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Myteam.com, an information and commerce site for people involved
in youth sports programs, recently bought air time on a Boston-area
radio station to advertise open positions.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Katzman, the company's chief executive, said Myteam, too,
had recently seen an increase in the number of candidates who
stressed salary over stock options. But he said that change could
be attributed to the Internet labor shortage, which has been so
protracted that recruiters are more actively lobbying workers at
traditional companies, where people are less prone to jump at
equity-heavy compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've had to have more conversations about salary lately,''
Katzman said. ``But it still has to work in the context of the
company, and this is a start-up, so you have to be very careful
about how you spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation packages with stock options also motivate workers
``to build the company's value,'' Katzman said. ``Everyone's got to
have some skin in the game for this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional companies with Web operations are
enjoying the fact that dot-com executives are asking to work for
them, rather than raiding them. ``We take some consolation in
knowing we've populated the dot-coms,'' said Christopher McCormick,
senior vice president of L.L. Bean, which has lost senior-level
executives to Send.com, Diamonds.com, Dell.com and eToys, among
others. ``But I've got to tell you, it hurt morale for people to
see folks leave for stock packages worth a zillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the tide has turned, McCormick said, noting for
instance that the company's vice president for operations, Mike
Perkins, recently joined L.L. Bean from Amazon.com. ``And we've
gotten dozens of resumes from people at dot-coms who want out
because their stock is under water, and they see Bean's staying
power and the quality of life here in Maine,'' McCormick said. ``I
do get some pleasure out of this, to be honest.''

MINISTER WITHDRAWS THREAT TO QUIT, GIVING BARAK SOME BREATHING
ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Thanks to complex back-room maneuvering on the eve
of a no-confidence vote in parliament, it appeared Sunday that
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel would be able to keep his
battered government afloat for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the speculation in the last few days centered on whether
Foreign Minister David Levy _ who has a history of changing sides _
would resign over the Camp David peace talks and return to his
roots in the rightist Likud Party. That could have triggered a
voting shift to the opposition in the 120-seat Knesset, or
parliament, that would have forced new elections.
</P>
<P>
   But early Sunday evening Levy announced, after meeting with
Barak, that he would remain in the cabinet for now and abstain from
Monday's no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to topple Barak, Levy said, he would try to
persuade him to create a broad-based government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am making all possible efforts to create a unity government
and if by Wednesday I do not succeed, I will resign from the
cabinet and support the bill for early elections,'' Levy said on
Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat to resign on Wednesday has little practical
weight because that is the last day parliament is to meet before
adjourning for a three-month vacation that so regular a part of
Israeli political life that it is unlikely to be interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Levy could vote on Wednesday for a Likud bill that calls for
dissolution of parliament and new elections. But that also would
count for little because the bill is to be referred to a committee
controlled by Barak's One Israel party, which can bottle it up.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has criticized Barak for offering concessions to the
Palestinians on Jerusalem and other issues while, Levy contends,
Barak has been offered nothing in return. Levy also has complained
that he has been left out of the loop on this, the major foreign
policy issue. During the Camp David summit meeting, Levy, who
stayed home as acting prime minister, made a sympathetic visit to a
hunger strike by Jewish settlers protesting the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in an apparent gesture Sunday to Levy, said after Levy's
announcement that, ``I have to make peace, or at least an interim
agreement, with the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he needed to work with the opposition on the economy,
education and social problems, issues that even his supporters have
criticized him for neglecting in his concentration on peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly returned to his main focus, saying he would work
with the opposition ``so that we may be able to try, not at any
price, but, yes, with all our strength, to bring to the state of
Israel security and peace and a different future for all our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Barak won a strong mandate in the general election
for prime minister. But electoral changes introduced in 1996 _
under which Israelis vote directly for the prime minister as well
as, separately, for the parliament _ have produced a fractured
parliament with a profusion of narrow-interest parties and the need
for coalitions, which have proved unstable. Barak lost his
parliamentary majority in the legislature on the eve of the Camp
David talks, when three religious and rightist parties quit to
protest the peace talks. That reduced his core support from 69
seats to 42 in the 120-seat body.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has not ruled out a national unity government,
particularly should there be an outbreak of Palestinian violence.
But bringing Likud or the religious parties into his coalition
would probably halt peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Likud, for its part, said in a statement Sunday that it had
decided against joining a government of national unity and that it
intended to topple Barak, whom it accused of lying to the people
and breaking his promises to the public not to surrender any part
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way now to stop the danger _ hold early
elections,'' said the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, a hawkish former general, said that Israel needs a
national government that could reach ``a peace that was safer, a
peace that was better, a peace that would last generations, a peace
with a united, undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Under no circumstances should we succumb to any
temptation to form a national unity government because today we
know exactly where things stand. There is only one option: to
replace the government as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts continued on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides to
keep the peace talks alive.
</P>
<P>
   Senior negotiators from Camp David, Saeb Erekat for the
Palestinians and Oded Eran for the Israelis, met in Jericho on
Sunday for the first time since the breakup of the 15-day meeting
in a symbolic show that the effort was continuing. Their
discussions were said to have included such unresolved issues as a
long-declared plan to move Israeli troops and the release of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking Israeli and Palestinian security officials also met in
Gaza in the early evening, part of a joint effort to keep a lid on
violence by extremists on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Sunday, Palestinian police in Gaza arrested the
second-ranking leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas,
Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, in his home. There was no immediate
official explanation, but he and other Hamas officials have been
vocal in their criticism of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   During a demonstration last week in Gaza, Rantissi called on
Arafat to abandon the peace talks and resume an armed struggle, or
jihad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes to the rifle,'' he exhorted the crowd. ``Yes to jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday and met
with Crown Prince Abdullah and other members of the Saudi royal
family for talks apparently aimed at building support for some kind
of Arab summit meeting to work out a joint position on issues in
the peace talks, particularly the critical question of the status
of Jerusalem and its holy places. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
was in Libya on Sunday on a similar mission.

ON AIR AND ONLINE, FIGHTING THE HO-HUM FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Pa.)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, July 30 _ Sunday turned out to be a day to kick the
tires, check the oil and generally make sure that everything was
ready for the Big Event _ and to see how many times on how many
channels Dick Cheney could be asked the same half-dozen questions
before he would reach over and strangle his interrogator with his
mike cord.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the World Wide Web sites threatening round-the-clock
coverage of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia
had not yet begun streaming, but the Sunday morning talk shows were
filled with nothing else _ and already there was not an hour in the
day when some sort of convention-related snippet could not be found
on one or another television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, you know, is home to cheese steaks. Its downtown
has had a major renaissance. Under Democrats! Cheese steaks are
made with thinly sliced rib-eye and served either with or without
onions. The first televised presidential convention was also held
in Philadelphia, 52 years ago. And now, the city is host to the
first convention to be given the full Internet treatment. This
point was made several times, on several channels. Indeed, a whole
new press area has been set up for Web journalists. It is being
called ``Internet Alley.'' Tours were available on at least two
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's vice presidential choice, Cheney, was on
NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' ABC's ``This
Week,'' ``Fox News Sunday'' and CNN's ``Late Edition with Wolf
Blitzer'' (which bills itself as ``the last word in Sunday talk,''
would that it were true).
</P>
<P>
   Displaying none of the puppy dog enthusiasm that former Vice
President Dan Quayle exhibited when chosen by Bush's father in
1988, Cheney was an ostentatiously subdued presence during his
marathon of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   On Fox, he described President Clinton as an ``enormous
embarrassment to the country,'' who was also a ``tragic figure''
with fundamental flaws. This was about as close to controversy as
Cheney allowed himself to get. He complained about being
interrogated about congressional votes he had cast two decades ago
_ opposing bans on plastic guns, against the Clean Water Act, etc.
_ and said it was all part of a Democratic plan to demonize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the sort of thing we've seen in the Gore
campaign,'' Cheney told the host of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Tim
Russert. ``Attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet the Press'' had the Democratic strategist James Carville
and the Republican strategist Bill Bennett to kick things around.
Bennett said that the all-but-crowned Democratic nominee, Vice
President Al Gore, had been exhibiting ``several personalities'' in
recent months, including ``affable Al'' and ``Uncle Al the Kiddies'
Pal,'' none of which were catching on with voters. Unfair, Carville
said, ``the vice president has not yet had a chance to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' they went with a tag-team format. First, Sam
Donaldson did a semi-aggressive number on Cheney, to little effect.
``So far, I am not bleeding from any part of my body,'' Cheney
observed. Then, Cokie Roberts was ingratiating and chatty with
Lynne Cheney, the candidate's wife, who got her back up when the
questions turned to the sexual orientation of one of their
daughters. ``I am appalled at the media interest in my two
daughters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face the Nation'' had what it called an ``exclusive'' talk
with Sen. John McCain, Bush's chief primary opponent (although
McCain had already been heard from on Sunday morning's edition of
``Today'').
</P>
<P>
   Some had wondered, somewhat optimistically, whether McCain would
enliven the otherwise cut-and-dried convention by saying something
intemperate, but he made it clear he would be a good boy. ``Gov.
Bush has been running exactly the sort of campaign I would be
running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest display of emotion came during ``Late Edition,''
when Democratic strategist Robert Shrum and former Republican party
chief Haley Barbour took off after each other. For a few moments,
there was such partisan rancor that it was like a blast from a
previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, even the Internet offered little escape from
drama-free reasonableness. The party's official convention site,
www.gopconvention.com, included such items as a ``Test Your GOP
IQ'' quiz _ How many times has the party met in Philadelphia? Six _
and a discussion of how the ``convention experience'' has changed
since Republicans were last in Philadelphia in 1948. (''One of the
biggest changes: The first-ever free shuttle service for convention
participants.'')
</P>
<P>
   Another section, marked ``Why conventions?'' could be bookmarked
for later in the week, when it may come in handy. There was also an
advertisement that said ``Ask for GOP rates at aruba-rentals.com,''
and a secure online connection for those wishing to make immediate
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   On C-SPAN, one segment included a woman using a felt pen and a
map to show exactly where each of the delegations would be sitting
on the convention floor, one by one. Later, Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News, showed up to take calls from C-SPAN viewers.
Had Cheney appeared on CBS that morning, he was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, a little ruefully. ``Everywhere.''

SUMMER IN SAN FRANCISCO: IS IT COOL ENOUGH FOR YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A gray, windy morning, late November to the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Office workers on downtown Market Street push through the
billows of fog, holding their trench coats against the chill.
Newspaper vendors keep their kiosk windows closed. An old man
selling red roses ($2 a stem) outside the Bay Area Rapid Transit
train station is wearing wool gloves and a ski cap pulled way down.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Schirmer is standing on a corner of First and Market
Streets, waiting for a bus to ferry her across town to her job at a
graphics design company. She is wearing a leather motorcycle
jacket, Army green corduroys and heavy black boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate being cold,'' she says, pulling a canvas hat and a
pullover sweater from her backpack to show she means it. ``I'm from
Orange County. Three summers here, and I've learned how to pile
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is summer in San Francisco, the country's capital of
cool. That's cool as in temperatures, in the 50s morning and night,
60s at high noon. Cool as in a daily mist that gnaws at old bones
and bum knees. The cool justifies the cafes at nearly every corner
and the sweatshirts in the souvenir shops off Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it has been so cool in the city _ 4 or 5 degrees cooler,
at an average of 63 degrees, than is typical in July _ that the
heat that has scorched much of the South seems as foreign as beach
days and backyard pools. Planes get fogged in at the airport and
there is no going out at night without a jacket. A hat is a good
move, too. But San Franciscans simply say ``groovy'' and stroll
along.
</P>
<P>
   They say this is just the way it is here. Summer bypasses this
place as if there is not enough heat to go around. In Oakland, 10
minutes over the Bay Bridge, it is 10 degrees warmer, with the sun
a notch brighter and the breeze as light as baby's breath. And for
every 10 miles inland from San Francisco, the conventional wisdom
goes, the weather gets warmer and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet San Franciscans worth their chest-thumping civic pride are
proud of this paradise of perpetual spring. They boast about the
city's foggy bottom as though there were nothing to be said for the
tropical sun of Oahu or the autumn leaf show in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best weather in the country,'' said Skye
Fernandez, a Web page designer who has lived in San Francisco
virtually all her 30 years. She was standing on trendy Valencia
Street in the city's Mission District, wearing a furry wool sweater
as she waited for a lunch table. Her friend Bobbi Greene braved the
breeze in a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who complain about the summer here have forgotten how
bad it is everywhere else,'' said Greene, who moved here from West
Hartford, Conn., 12 years ago. ``The fog burns off by late morning,
usually. It doesn't come back until late afternoon. In between,
it's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists beg to differ. ``Horrible,'' said Corinne Gulon of
Lyons, France, as she surveyed the day in Chinatown. ``I arrived
here, and no one can swim. I tried yesterday at 12 and had no luck
because of the fog.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals love trotting out the line Mark Twain supposedly said
about the coldest winter he ever spent being a summer in San
Francisco. (Historians say he never said it, but it is too good to
resist. Every San Francisco weather story uses it.)
</P>
<P>
   All city residents have learned (as Jan Null, a meteorologist
with the Golden Gate Weather Service, explained) that the natural
air-conditioning is caused when California's interior Central
Valley heats up in the summer, creating lower air pressure that
causes a sea breeze as air flows from low to high pressure. The
water off the coast is about 55 degrees, and as the air blows over
the top of the water it creates the cool city residents love.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be from the East Coast if you think you miss 90
degrees,'' said J.J. Bunce, a software engineer and recovering New
Yorker who has lived here 15 years. ``Summer is just a state of
mind.''

WRITERS ON WRITING: CONJURING NOVELS THAT REFLECT THE HUMAN
CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Boldface word in 7th and 10th grafs should be set in italics;
second `e' should be accented per the French.) 
 By HANS KONING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I arrived in this country on a Dutch freighter that had taken a
month to get me from Singapore to San Pedro, the port of Los
Angeles. They had to unlock the turnstile at the San Pedro
streetcar station for me, as it hadn't been constructed with
passengers toting large suitcases in mind. That was in the winter
of 1951. I had spent a year in Indonesia as a radio journalist, but
I never thought of myself as anything but a serious novelist: My
first novel was planned and ready in my head.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be written in the first person, and the reader would
learn about its protagonist only from his almost abstract thoughts
about the human condition and his own life within it. That was my
reaction against what I called to myself ``the two fingers of
whiskey school of writing,'' in which reality is supposed to be
pinned to the pages by a most detailed spelling out of its
manifestations, as when we learn that the hero filled his glass
with two fingers of scotch, a splash of soda, one slice of lemon
and two ice cubes. (Different from most young writers I have since
met, I didn't feel the slightest admiration for Ernest Hemingway.)
</P>
<P>
   When I started writing the novel, I found of course that the
purity of the concept needed considerable dilution if I did not
want it to become just an exhausting gimmick. Nonetheless, it took
me years to get the novel published.
</P>
<P>
   The second or third time of making the rounds, it ended up with
Henry Robbins, then a junior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, and he took
it. (Alfred had promised him autonomy and didn't stop him; but
Alfred announced at his own sales conference that he hated the
book.) That was ``The Affair,'' and it was very widely reviewed. I
didn't realize this was unusual for a first novel.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch was my mother tongue, but I had been in the British army
and had started to think and dream in English. Dutch and English
were close kin once. ``The Canterbury Tales'' often reads like
Dutch. English has become marvelously richer of course, having at
its disposal not only the Germanic but also the Roman wellspring of
words.
</P>
<P>
   My English was all right then; even those Westchester ladies
who, at that time, working at home, were the freelance and
scholarly text editors for several New York publishing houses found
little cause for objection. (I've often felt that starting out at
the edge of the language, so to speak, was a blessing in disguise,
because it gives you an awareness of words that is different from
that of the native speaker, who, like Huckleberry Finn, may not
think of, say, ``glove'' as one of the possible words for the thing
but rather as the thing itself.)
</P>
<P>
   But there was a perceived European-ness about my novel that I
had put in on purpose, and that stayed with me through the 12
novels I've written since. It was perceived as European by some
editors and reviewers, but I did not think of it that way at all.
It was the idea that a novel should be committed, what they call in
France,  &UR; engage &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that in English it is expressed by that awkward
word, committed, shows that it's a qualification that plays little
role in the American writing scene. It means to me that if you want
to write a serious novel, you should not only be out to entertain
but you should also, in a hidden way, reflect on the world's
justice and injustice, hope and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Trollope and Oscar Wilde agree with me here, not to mention
Brecht or Garcia Lorca, but the very idea makes many reviewers
nervous. They think it makes a novel political, which in their
vocabulary becomes synonymous with tendentious. Some editors, and
of late agents (who now often occupy terrain where once editors
feared to tread), tell me that it is bad for sales and that I'd do
better to replace it with ``a commercial core.''
</P>
<P>
   There is of course always the danger that all this committedness
turns your novel into a lengthy pamphlet that bores, and then
loses, your readers. But that danger is a challenge to your
writing, not to the idea as such. In order for a novel to be
 &UR; engage &LR; , it isn't in the least necessary that it deals with a
momentous subject. It does not have to deal with war and peace,
love and death. It may be about a lottery swindle in Brooklyn or a
suburban academic whose sex life is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe it needs is evidence that its writer has gone
through an awareness of the human condition, its comedy and
melodrama, its mystery and tragedy. Isn't it that awareness that
can give the crucial dimension to the most banal occurrences we may
want to describe? It is not an awareness tied to a specific
political ideology, and there is nothing specifically European
about it, unless it be that so many American critics have expounded
the thesis that ``true art is above politics,'' which is to say _
although they won't say it that way _ that it is committed to the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   No writer can float in a void above the battle; there are always
links. There is a link between the potato famine and James Joyce's
``Ulysses.'' There is a link between the heroes and heroines of
Henry James and the basics of their society; if they had to run off
to 9-to-5 jobs, they would have lost most of their literary
interest. There is even a link between the portraits of Rembrandt
and the plundering of the Indies by the Dutch East India Co. To be
above politics (politics in the widest sense) doesn't seem
meritorious to me. I believe one can only be that way through total
indifference to our world, or through appalling incomprehension.
</P>
<P>
   When I used the term ``serious writing,'' I was not making a
value judgment. I realize authors of nonserious novels achieve what
they set out to achieve, and often with unsurpassed
professionalism. Serious writing is not better; it has a different
origin. It is writing that you have to write, what you hear in your
mind.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Please don't imagine that I think Jane Austen should really have
introduced a battle of Napoleon or a strike of the Lancashire
weavers in her stories. She lived at a time when, in the words of
Saint-Just, human happiness was invented, and she wrote of and for
men and women who had just become aware of their own unique
destinies, which is why we are still interested in the marriage
prospects of her heroines. That cult of the individual was
precisely the essence of her time, and thus she became more
strongly engaged to it than if she had bothered with Napoleon. That
is not what we are about now, however. Perhaps the essence of our
time is that we have to learn to look beyond our own individual
lives.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I keep aiming toward that novel that is just that, a
true novel, but a novel for our time, dealing with an essential
theme and an essential message in a subterranean, carefully hidden
way, a message like a snake in the grass, as Trollope put it.
There'll be no boy meets tractor, nor even a professor meets
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   A reader (and a reviewer) should find just as much in it as he
or she is prepared to accept. Until one night, perhaps, when such a
reader, for instance of my ``Kleber Plight,'' cannot get to sleep,
and then suddenly the snake would raise its head, and he or she
would start wondering if there was, after all, sense to what its
hero (or antihero) was about on his destructive flight in that
little Piper Tomahawk airplane. Or so I hope.

<P>
   During the age of the sailing ship, Spain built a global empire
stretching from Havana to Potosi in the Andes to Manila _ the first
empire on which the sun never set. But it paid dearly for its
achievement. Thousands of Spanish ships went down over the
centuries, many heavy with gold and silver, emeralds and diamonds,
porcelains and fine steels.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, Spain has taken little action as treasure
hunters and marine archaeologists raised its sunken riches. It
watched as Mel Fisher found the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a galleon
that sank off the Florida Keys in 1622. He eventually hauled up
about $400 million in treasure, and gave Queen Sofia of Spain one
of the ship's cannons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, Spain is laying claim to its lost
ships, and it has won a legal battle over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that Spain
owned the remains of two warships lost off the Virginia coast two
centuries ago. The ruling snatched the ships away from Ben Benson,
a treasure hunter who had estimated that the shipwrecks bear more
than a half-billion dollars in lost coins and precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in Spain's stance, experts said, could mark an end to
the glory days of treasure hunting and the beginning of a time when
Spain oversees the recovery of its lost fleets in pursuit not only
of doubloons but of cultural riches, historical insights and new
respect for Spanish graves.
</P>
<P>
   But Benson, president of Sea Hunt, a salvage company named after
an old television show, may fight the ruling. Having spent nearly
$2 million on preliminary recovery work and legal fees, he is
sailing to the Bahamas, he said in an interview last week, to
meditate on whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Benson said of the ruling. ``There's no case
law to support their conclusion. It's uncharted waters for the
shipwreck industry as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. Goold of Covington &AMP; Burling in Washington, who led
Spain's legal fight, said the victory was sound and long in
developing. ``I'm sure a lot of treasure hunters view this decision
with alarm,'' he said, ``but they should have known it was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain said the victory marked the start of an aggressive effort
on its part to look after its old interests and, probably, to team
up for recovery work with coastal nations whose waters harbor its
sunken ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a turning point,'' said Rafael Rodriguez Ponga, director
of cultural affairs in the Foreign Ministry in Madrid. ``It's a
very important step in the recognition of the rights of Spain all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped Spain's recovery of vanished ships and
artifacts, and their display in public museums and analysis by
scholars, would illuminate and deepen public appreciation of
Spain's past.
</P>
<P>
   David Beltran, legal adviser to the Spanish Embassy in
Washington, said the victory in Virginia would have major
repercussions. ``We need to fix the rules about shipwrecks all
around the world,'' he said. ``This ruling sets a strong
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, Spain lost whole armadas of tall ships to gales,
mishaps and piracy because it started its conquests so early and
acquired so many distant lands, especially in the Americas and the
Philippines. Near the peak of its influence, from 1580 to 1640, it
also ruled Portugal and that country's colonial possessions in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The recent battle over the lost ships _ La Galga (the name is
Spanish for ``the greyhound''), which went down in 1750, and Juno,
which sank in 1802 _ was joined not only by Spain but also by
Britain and the United States, which sided with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said those nations, and others with long maritime
traditions, are increasingly eager to assert ownership of their old
shipwrecks now that technology is fast opening the seas to
exploration and recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Spain, the Justice Department argued that the United
States owned thousands of lost vessels and sought to ensure that
they were ``treated as sovereign ships and honored graves and are
not subject to exploration, or exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court, in its ruling, noted the government's
stance favorably. The courts, it added, ``cannot just turn over''
sovereign wrecks to commercial salvors when all the nations
involved agree that ``title to the shipwreck remains with the
original owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars said the strong opinion was likely to affect
shipwreck claims in many territorial seas and by nations other than
Spain. It might, they added, strengthen state claims to high-seas
wrecks. Previously, the traditional rule was ``finders keepers,''
as when French and American salvors laid claim to the Titanic, the
sunken British luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Norfolk, Va., the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals covers
Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina. Its opinion
weighs heavily in shipwreck law because hundreds of lost hulks lie
in coastal waters off those states. The area off Cape Hatteras,
N.C., is known as the graveyard of the Atlantic, so numerous are
its shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish officials estimate that Spain lost 600 ships in American
waters alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sea Hunt case, which involved dozens of lawyers, the
state of Virginia sided with Sea Hunt, citing a 1987 federal law
giving states jurisdiction over abandoned ships in coastal waters.
Significantly, Benson had agreed to give Virginia some of the
recovered loot and 25 percent of any profits from treasure that he
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Barry L. Clifford of Provincetown, Mass., who found a famous
pirate ship off Cape Cod and helped Benson hunt for Spanish wrecks,
deplored the appellate court's ruling and Spain's ownership claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every ounce of that silver and gold was stolen,'' he said,
referring to theft from the indigenous peoples of Central and South
America. He added that the people were ``forced into slavery'' to
mine the precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   If Spain recovers its lost booty, Clifford added, it will raise
questions of whether it should pay compensation, just as Germany
has agreed to make financial amends to victims of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, playing down the treasure issue, portrayed the two lost
ships in the case as military grave sites and avoided any hint that
it was interested in lost gold, contending that Juno and La Galga
at the time of their sinking carried no riches of any significance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1996, when Benson won Virginia permits to
explore coastal waters off Assateague Island. He soon said he had
found the remains of Juno, a 34-gun frigate whose sinking took more
than 400 lives, and of La Galga, a 50-gun frigate, most of whose
crew and passengers are said to have reached land safely.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, Spain sued for ownership and possession, contending
that it had never abandoned the ships, the issue at the heart of
the case under common law. In 1999, a federal district judge, J.
Calvitt Clarke Jr., awarded La Galga to Virginia and Juno to Spain.
He cited distinctions in international treaties of 1763 and 1819 as
legal rationales.
</P>
<P>
   But writing for the appellate court, Chief Judge J. Harvie
Wilkinson III gave both ships to Spain, arguing that any
abandonment of sovereign shipwrecks had to be explicit, not
implied.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Bederman, an Emory University law professor who helped
represent Sea Hunt, said the court's opinion would be influential
but disputatious. ``We're going to get into historical arguments
over what is sovereign and private,'' he said in an interview,
adding that ``the meaning of that has changed over 500 years,''
with private ships more common in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Ponga of the Foreign Ministry disagreed and said
ownership in those days was usually unambiguous, with the crown
often in charge. Spain, he said, had very good shipping records,
and ownership issues would be settled case by case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter for us if there is treasure or money,'' he
added. ``It's a question of sovereignty.''

BUCHANAN IGNORES ATTEMPT TO KNOCK HIM OFF REFORM BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan has vowed to disregard a vote by Reform Party
leaders to remove his name from their presidential ballot because
of how he collected voters' signatures in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to ignore it,'' Bay Buchanan, chief strategist for her
brother's campaign, said Sunday, responding to a unanimous vote
taken on Saturday in Dallas by a group of party officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is of no consequence to us, and we plan to stand very, very
strongly against the handful of mean-spirited dissidents who have
refused to recognize that at every single turn of the process, they
have been whupped,'' Ms. Buchanan said, signaling that conflict
within the party is likely to endure.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to disqualify Buchanan came just over a week before the
scheduled start of the Reform nominating convention in Long Beach,
Calif., on Aug. 9. This latest controversy almost ensures that the
convention will unfold in an atmosphere of contention and
uncertainty with two distinct camps fighting for control of the
party and the $12.6 million in federal campaign money that will be
available to the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   One side has lined up behind Buchanan, who bolted from the
Republican Party last year to expand his right-wing conservative
base as a Reform Party leader. The other is not so much aligned
behind his only rival, John Hagelin, as it is united in its zeal to
stop Buchanan from using a party founded eight years ago by Ross
Perot as a platform for Buchanan's own conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The result has become something of a political train wreck for a
party that once projected pride in offering a platform of
government reform and optimism in a belief that Reform Party
members could change a system dominated by the two mainstream
parties.
</P>
<P>
   This latest round of intrigue follows accusations that Buchanan
defrauded the process of collecting signatures for his nomination
by turning in names of people who would otherwise not be qualified
to vote in the Reform primary. Unlike Democrats and Republicans,
who choose their nominee through a series of state primaries, the
Reform Party counts votes cast during a five-week period by party
members, people who have requested a ballot or people who have
signed petitions for the current election year.
</P>
<P>
   To investigate accusations of impropriety by the Buchanan
campaign that first came from Hagelin's supporters, the party's
Presidential Nomination Committee appointed a subcommittee to audit
names submitted by both campaigns, along with supporting material.
The Hagelin campaign complied with requests for information; the
Buchanan campaign refused, asserting that the mere appointment of
such a subcommittee violated party rules.
</P>
<P>
   Without all the necessary paperwork, the committee adjourned
without voting, leaving the matter to the three members of the full
committee. With two other party leaders unexpectedly joining them
on Friday in an ex-officio capacity _ the acting chairman, Gerald
R. Moan, and the treasurer, Tom McLaughlin, both of whom are
Buchanan supporters _ the committee voted 3-2 against imposing
sanctions on the Buchanan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a group of party officers, which was enough for a
quorum but did not include Moan and McLaughlin, met in Dallas,
where they reversed the committee vote by saying Buchanan's failure
to cooperate with the subcommittee was grounds for removing him
from the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden to prove the names are valid rests with the
candidate,'' said Russell J. Verney, the original party chairman
who no longer holds a leadership position but remains as a leading
force against Buchanan by virtue of his close association with
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' he added, ``the candidate disqualified himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buchanan denied that her brother's campaign did anything
wrong, unethical or illegal. ``There was absolutely no fraud,'' she
said. ``I dealt very closely with the nominating committee and
followed its instructions to the letter. To come back now and say
anything we did was flawed is a malicious and outrageous
representation of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Both camps agree that the swirl of activity last week is by no
means fatal to Buchanan's quest for the nomination and the federal
campaign money. Ultimately, a vote by delegates at the convention
may be the deciding factor in the nomination. By party rules, a
two-thirds vote of delegates could suspend the primary process,
after which the delegates would vote, with a simple majority
determining the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the Buchanan forces have the
necessary delegate votes yet. A final count will not be possible
before a meeting on Aug. 8, a day before the convention is to
start, when forces for and against Buchanan are expected to fight
over challenges to seat delegates that could affect hundreds of
them _ and set the tone for the days that follow.

 &HT;    Go west, young man - and brew beer
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ ``The air is better, the water is cleaner and
the beer is way better.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Falconer might not rank them in that order, but he wants
you to know that life is sweeter in Oregon than in Atlanta, where
he grew up, attended college and still visits friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1971,'' he says, ``I was 10 years old and Atlanta was 1
million people. Today it's _ what? _ 3.2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only 90,000 or so at Portland's Tom McCall Waterfront
Park, where Falconer was among the minor celebrities this weekend
at the 13th Oregon Brewers Festival. Artisan-in-residence at the
popular Wild Duck brewpub in Eugene, Ore., Falconer was one of 72
brewers whose beer was represented in the largest gathering of its
kind in North America.
</P>
<P>
   For beer lovers, Portland is mecca, with more brewpubs per
capita than any other city in the country. Andy Klubock, proprietor
of Taco Mac megatap bars in the metro Atlanta are, puts it in more
secular terms. ``Portland's the Munich of craft brewing in North
America,'' he says. ``It's one of the top markets in the country,
not just for beer but coffee, too. One of the things about
Oregonians is that they're very protective about their products.
Vermonters are the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's geography ranges from desert in the east to rolling
farmland in the central Willamette Valley to spectacular beaches on
the Pacific coast. But only about 4 million people live there, and
they'd rather be better than bigger.
</P>
<P>
   For Falconer, it's the more assertive pale ales that define the
Oregon palate. ``There are some good ales in Atlanta,'' he says,
``but they're the exception. Here, it's part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents still live in Atlanta, but Falconer seems of another
time and place. He looks like one of the Smith Bros. cough-drop
patriarchs reincarnated at Woodstock. The extravagance of his
salt-and-pepper beard would tempt the wrong person with hedge
clippers in his hands, and so might the pony tail that hangs
halfway down his back.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier day, there might have been starch in his collar
and a certain rectitude in his bearing, but on a balmy Friday
afternoon his sneakers are unlaced and his wire-rim glasses are the
only hint of his scientific training at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Velasco, an Atlanta native who knows the Portland scene,
laughs when he recalls Falconer's introduction to brewing. ``It was
1987 and I had just started homebrewing,'' says Velasco, a reporter
for The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. ``I met Glen through some
friends. I had gone to Georgia State and he was working in asbestos
abatement in Atlanta. I brought over some of my homebrew and he
said, 'Hey, this is really good.' He decided he was going to do it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first few times he homebrewed, he must have
called me a dozen times. 'Eric, am I doing this right?' 'Am I doing
that right?' Every time the phone rang, I thought, 'Oh,. that's
Glen again.' But here he's become one of the best brewers in a
brewery-rich state.''
</P>
<P>
   Many craft brewers boast credentials from the University of
California at Davis or the 125-year-old Siebel Institute in
Chicago, but Falconer's degree is OTJ. ``On the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He apprenticed under Terri Fahrendorf, one of the best-known
female brewers in the country, in Eugene and then under John Maier,
award-winning brewer of Rogue Ales in Newport, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen became a protege of John's,'' Velasco says. ``Maier's got
a saying: 'When in doubt, add more hops.' Glen's of that school.''
</P>
<P>
   Many _ but hardly all _ of the milling crowd were of the same
school. These were hopheads, some of them wearing wreathed crowns
of hop flowers to affirm their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that strike me about Oregon,'' Velasco says,
``is that it's got some of the hippest little towns anywhere.
(``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest`` author) Ken Kesey lives in
Springfield, a twin-city of Eugene's, making yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   You want diversity? There was diversity aplenty at this park
along the Columbia River _ so much so that the attendees who were
conspicuous were the suits. Two men in loosened ties and
button-down Oxford cloth shirts, relaxing at a table Friday night,
might as well have been full-dress Native Americans at a suburban
block party.
</P>
<P>
   An earring was more likely to be found on a man than a woman.
Minors were not admitted but infants in strollers were, and their
numbers were considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Mahar and Elizabeth Moskowitz weren't wearing flowers in
their hair, but they came all the way from Raleigh, N.C., and
brought with them definite opinions. ``You can taste everything in
it. It's very intense,'' Mahar, an engineer in her late 20s, said
of her sample of Maier's Incinerator Doppelbock, a strong
German-style lager aged much longer than most.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Lowry, who moved from Marietta, Ga. last year and works
at the Rogue Public House in Newport, doesn't rule out going back
to Atlanta but says she won't go back to mass-market beer. ``If you
like beer at all and you've tried this, there's no going back,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Falconer rules out going back in any way. ``One of the things
about living out here,'' he says,''is that you can be yourself. How
can you beat that?''

 &HT;    Goths hear the gospel
 &HT;    By Mary MacDonald
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cecil Perkins, an usher, warmly shook the hands of the
young men and women in death-mask makeup, then held open the door
of International Gospel Outreach Family Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' he said brightly. ``Welcome to the house of
the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the first dozen of 25 goth-style protesters politely
entered the interdenominational church in Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   One had a spiked, leather bondage mask strapped to his face.
Another had a black T-shirt with the number 666 surrounded by the
religious symbol of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually filled two rows in the back of the church,
looking on impassively as congregants shouted, danced and swayed
with fervor to a gospel chorus.
</P>
<P>
   They showed up, organizers explained later, to exercise their
freedom to dress and speak as they please. The senior pastor has
equated rock music with devil worship, said organizer Michael
Mallott, who did not attend. Most are members or fans of metal and
goth bands, and they find the satanic comparison unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robin Hancox, senior pastor, disputes all that. ``I
always promote Godly principle,'' he said. ``To my recollection,
none of that ever happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' appearance was sparked instead, he said, by a
failed outreach effort. A member of the church had tried,
unsuccessfully, to help one of the young men embrace God, Hancox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the silent protest made for a weird afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the two-hour service, urged by a preacher to
``look at your neighbor, and say I'm glad you're here,'' a regular
parishioner crossed the center aisle to give one of the band
members a hug. He received it awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   After the service ended, curious church members approached band
members, who lingered near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her young son, both dressed in their Sunday best,
spoke for a few moments to the guy who showed up in bondage
headgear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of church pulls all types of people in. Everybody's
hungry,'' said Kenneth Bentley, the bass player for the church
band. ``I wanted them to not feel like they were freaks, that they
were welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Several children giggled at the ghoul makeup worn by six or
seven members of Fiends Carnival of Souls, a Macon, Ga. band
described by singer Jason Moss as ``horror/epic/punk/metal.'' Their
latest tape includes the songs Spooky Heaven and Devils Shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Moss and the rest of the band applied their stage makeup _ white
foundation, blacked eyes and lips, and a single black tear _
shortly before arriving at church.
</P>
<P>
   Mallott, a band promoter who organized the protest, said he had
attended the church several times before, and found himself treated
differently when he arrived one day in goth-style appearance. ``I
wanted people to see we're good people,'' he explained. ``They
shouldn't be afraid of us just because of the way we look.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brooks, a fairly new congregant, thought there was some
validity in that. ``Even God says, 'don't judge a book by a cover.'
``
</P>
<P>
   But there was something unusual about seeing ghoulish makeup,
chains and black combat boots in a church setting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to see it in my church, but that's their
preference,'' he said. ``...The Bible says, 'come as you are.' ''

 &HT;    CHENEY DEFENDS HIS RECORD AS DEMOCRATS ATTACK HIM AS AN
EXTREMIST
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN AND JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former defense secretary Dick Cheney arrived here
Sunday and defended his record as Democrats raised the volume on
their push to portray George W. Bush's running mate as a
conservative extremist.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican National Convention begins Monday, voters in
at least 15 states will see a Democratic National Committee
television ad documenting Cheney's long-ago votes against the Clean
Water Act, Head Start and several other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are their plans for working families?'' the Democrats ask
in the ad's closing line.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney was defending his record, Bush was in Ohio on a
swing-state tour that will bring him to the convention on
Wednesday.

   Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman, spent the day saying he
isn't running from his record, though he might vote differently on
some issues today. And he invoked the name of one of the GOP's
great icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time in Washington, some 25 years. I'm proud
of those years there,'' he told cheering supporters at a welcoming
rally in a downtown hotel. ``I'm especially proud of my record
voting to support smaller government, lower taxes, stronger
national defense _ the politics of Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his long service in Washington, Cheney on Sunday tried
to craft an outsider image for himself, as befuddled as the next
guy by what goes on inside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get out there and you look back on Washington, I must
say you frequently end up scratching your head and wondering what
the hell are they doing back there,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who preaches campaign-trail civility, brought his usual
message to a Sunday rally in Hamilton County, Ohio, about 15 miles
north of Cincinnati. He was introduced by political fire-breathing
locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready to let your daughter serve as an intern?'' said
Jim Sumner, mayor of the town of Blue Ash, referring to the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio said politics has taught him the
danger of making predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, who would have thought, for example, that you'd see
Microsoft split up and the Clintons still together?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the rally was delayed when 83-year-old Helen
Geiger, a Cincinnati resident attending the event, collapsed and
later died. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney began his day with appearances on the Sunday morning talk
shows. At each stop, he defended a congressional voting record that
Democrats say proves that the GOP ticket is too far right for
moderate voters who could make the difference in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney will say anything to hide his extreme record and
obscure the truth behind George W. Bush's rhetoric,'' said Doug
Hattaway, spokesman for Al Gore, who the Democrats will nominate
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said some of the votes now under attack by Democrats _
including votes against banning armor-piercing bullets and plastic
weapons that elude metal detectors _ were cast because they came in
a format in which debate was limited and amendments were barred.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Cheney said he would now vote to
ban armor-piercing bullets and plastic weapons, though he is a
strong supporter of the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, he said he voted against the Equal Rights Amendment
because he believed it would make women eligible for the military
draft.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Cheney was asked about his lesbian
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got two daughters,'' he said. ``They are fine women. I'm
very proud of both of them and I think their private lives are
private. And I firmly believe that I'm running for public office
(and) they're entitled to their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also jabbed back at the Democrats, branding President
Clinton as ``an enormous embarrassment to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those harsh words, Cheney said he would not become the
ticket's bad cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a slash-and-burn artist who is somebody
who can get up and give a stirring, tub-thumping stump speech, I'm
not your guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney backed up that comment with a less-than-rousing
four-minute speech at the welcome rally that included loud music
and a full-fledged confetti drop.
</P>
<P>
   Once during his remarks, Cheney ran into a Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to re-establish in Washington with
the 19. . . , excuse me, with the 2000 campaign,'' he said. ``I
forgot it is the 21st century.''

<P>
   In what would be one of the biggest strikes in a decade, 85,000
telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening to walk out
next weekend in a struggle that, stripped to its essentials, pits
old-line labor against the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone workers are facing off with Verizon Communications
_ the name that Bell Atlantic adopted last month after acquiring
GTE _ largely because they fear that the company's widespread use
of lower paid, nonunion workers in its fastest growing businesses,
most notably wireless phones, will endanger the wages and benefits
of unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they are taking the strike threat
seriously because the two unions involved in the dispute, the
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers, have never been shy about striking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they struck Bell Atlantic for two days, winning a
no-layoff clause and improved pension benefits. And in 1989 they
staged a 17-week strike against Nynex, which later merged with Bell
Atlantic, rebuffing a company demand to have workers pay monthly
health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the chances of a strike are better than 50-50,''
said Morton Bahr, president of the communications workers' union,
which represents 72,500 of the workers who might walk out.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, threatened for 12:01 a.m. Sunday, could cause
problems for 25 million businesses and households stretching from
Virginia to Maine. It would involve operators, service
representatives and repair workers, and could cause the same
inconveniences that local and long-distance customers experienced
in previous telephone company strikes: delays in repairs,
installing new lines, ordering new phone service and getting
questions answered about telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are large because Verizon, (pronounced ver-EYE-zon),
with 260,000 employees, has far more workers than any other
American telecommunications company and is the nation's largest
wireless company. But while close to 80 percent of the more than
120,000 workers in the company's local lines division, which
provides local telephone service, are unionized, a mere 46 of the
32,000 workers in Verizon's wireless division are.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the two unions is daunting because they are
finding it tough to keep pace with a fast-changing company in a
fast-changing industry. Indeed, Verizon's unions are struggling to
adapt to many developments common throughout the New Economy,
including new job categories, new types of compensation like profit
sharing, and the increased use of contingent workers like temporary
hires and independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The former Bell Atlantic now owns the telephone companies around
the country previously operated by GTE, whose workers will not
strike next week because they are covered by a different union
contract. Verizon also operates the nation's largest wireless
telephone network in a partnership with Vodafone AirTouch, a
European company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Verizon, which long focused on local service as
Bell Atlantic, has recently entered the long-distance market in New
York state and hopes to win regulatory clearance in other states as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In this maelstrom of mergers and reshufflings, of new businesses
and new technologies, labor leaders fear unionized workers will be
squeezed or even laid off as Verizon attempts to pare labor costs
by, for example, contracting out work to nonunion firms.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues in the dispute, union leaders say, are job
security, higher pensions, feelings of stress at work, and the
union's demand for an easier way to unionize the workers in the
company's wireless operations.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials voice fears that if they fail to unionize the
wireless workers, Verizon will aggressively shift business _ and
jobs _ from its unionized operations to its lower-paying nonunion
operations. Union officials complain that many of the more than
5,000 jobs in Verizon's new and fast-growing business installing
digital subscriber lines for computers are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is looking at a situation where the industry is
changing very fast and with the advent of wireless and Internet
services and digital subscriber lines, we are battling with the
company over keeping that work as union work,'' said Bob Master, a
spokesman for the Communications Workers. ``We want to see the
industry change and grow, but we want the union to share in that
growth and we want those jobs to remain good jobs that pay enough
to support families.''
</P>
<P>
   Communications workers estimate that Verizon's unionized service
representatives are paid an average of $26 an hour, about double
the pay of service representatives in the nonunion wireless
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The union acknowledges that Verizon's top nonunion craft
workers, like line repairmen and installers, are paid $27.30 an
hour, on average, 24 cents more than the $27.06 an hour the
unionized craft workers earn.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders say the big difference between union and
nonunion workers comes in benefits. The unionized workers pay no
premiums for family health insurance coverage, while nonunion
workers must pay $600 to $3,500 a year depending on the health
plan. And unionized workers have a defined benefit pension as well
as a 401(k) plan, while most nonunion workers have just a 401(k).

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a demand that unions are increasingly making as they seek to
organize more workers, the communications and electrical workers
want Verizon to allow unionization of its wireless operations
through an expedited process known as a card check. In that
process, a company agrees to let workers join a union if a majority
of employees at a work site signs cards saying they want to join a
union. Labor leaders say it is far easier to organize workers
through card checks than through elections, which often take months
to carry out and can bog down in years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members understand that if we don't organize the people in
wireless, then when the unorganized numbers grow anywhere near the
organized, there's a direct threat to the wages and benefits that
we achieved over 60 years because the nonorganized are not getting
anywhere near what the members are getting,'' said Bahr, the
union's president.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are also demanding that Verizon pledge not to fight
any unionization efforts. As an example of management's anti-union
efforts, the communications workers say supervisors at the Verizon
Wireless call center in Woburn, Mass., have barred workers from
distributing pro-union literature and have asked workers who among
them is supporting the unionization drive.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Marcus, a Verizon spokesman, insisted that the company
was pro-union, not anti-union, and he talked in nonconfrontational
tones, being careful not to stoke the workers' resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is we want to be a union-represented company that can
compete successfully with many companies in our marketplace that
are not unionized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the company's plans to cut expenses, the unions
are demanding numerous job security provisions, among them a
no-layoff clause and restrictions on contracting out work and
transferring operations from one state to another. Verizon
officials say that to hold down costs and remain competitive, they
need to retain the right to contract out work and move operations.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to ensure that thousands of union members will back a
strike, the communications workers' union has held training
sessions for more than 700 workers over the past four months. The
sessions teach workers how to carry out a strike, and educate them
on changes in the industry and the importance of unionizing
Verizon's nonunion workers. These trainees are then responsible for
mobilizing other union members behind a strike and teaching them
about the issues in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For some Verizon workers, a strike can't come soon enough if it
brings about measures to reduce stress on the job. At many call
centers, customer service representatives who take orders for new
service or answer questions about bills say they are inundated with
calls, and that management often requires them to tack four extra
hours onto their shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Egan, who works in a Verizon facility in Queens,
answering questions from residential customers, said, ``We
generally work from 8 in the morning until 4, but often we're
forced to work until 8 at night. It wreaks havoc. People go to
school and they're forced to miss classes. Many workers are single
parents, and this forced overtime is a nightmare. It creates
serious problems for their child care arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   On some days when she is forced to work until 8 p.m., she has to
work from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. without any break, answering phone call
after phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrendous,'' said Egan, who earns about $25 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   She would like the union and company to agree on measures to
reduce stress and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, the Verizon spokesman, said, ``On the stress issue, we
recognize that's a concern. We hope we can address it and resolve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's first quarter operating profits were $1.27
billion, but net earnings were $731 million, or 46 cents a share,
held down by a one-time charge related to its investment in Cable &AMP;
Wireless Communications. In the first quarter of 1999, Bell
Atlantic's net profit was $1.14 billion, or 72 cents a share.
Verizon has not yet announced second-quarter earnings, but earlier
this month, the company said second-quarter sales rose about 15
percent.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Political tidbits from the Republican National
Convention:
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is known for keeping on message. To help
delegates do the same, Republican National Convention officials are
giving each a 435-page copy of George W. Bush's speeches, policy
positions and campaign fact sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Convention Chairman Andrew Card said Sunday the book, entitled
``Renewing America's Purpose,'' includes all Bush's policy speeches
and position papers for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our road map of the governor's key principles and
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan to hold a daily media briefing at the Sheet
Metal Hall every day during the convention to counter the
Republican message, and one of the main targets will be the record
of vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Former Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, general chairman of the
Democratic Party, asked if he's taking Cheney's voting record out
of context, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's out of context about not voting to not ban bullets
whose sole purpose is to pierce bulletproof vests and kill
policemen? ... What's out of context about that (or) voting against
additional funding for head start, against additional funding for
immunization of children? ... Those votes speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now remember, George Bush keeps telling us he's
compassionate,'' Rendell said. ``And his first deed ... was to pick
a vice president. And he picked a vice president who voted ...
against the interests of the American people over and over and over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In memory of Sen. Paul Coverdell, who was to lead the Georgia
contingent in Philadelphia, delegates and alternates have donned
blue lapel ribbons. Georgia state party chairman Chuck Clay has
succeeded Coverdell as chairman. Rather than advance one alternate
into Coverdell's spot, the delegation plans to rotate the late
senator's floor credentials among several alternates, to give as
many as possible a chance to sit in the delegation's No. 1 spot.
Coverdell died several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors rolled around Philadelphia Sunday about politically
picturesque toilet paper decorating a couple of the restrooms at
Philadelphia International Airport. To be exact, the tales involved
toilet paper bearing the likeness of former president Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the rumored toilet paper was on display at the
airport, but not in the restroom, and not just featuring Carter. In
fact, the paper was part of an exhibit put on by the airport titled
``Political Memorabilia.'' For those who use the bathroom but may
not favor Carter, the exhibit also featured toilet paper bearing
the likenesses of Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern and Richard
Nixon. In fact, all sorts of memorabilia is on display at the
airport's Terminal B, including a teapot shaped like Nixon's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love it,'' said Mark Pesce, airport spokesman.
``Walking through the airport, people just stop and look at this
stuff and they smile and laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eva Folse, an alternate convention delegate from
Warner-Robins, Ga., life has been like the movie ``Life is
Beautiful.'' The woman who grew up in England and later settled in
the U.S. says the tragedy and poverty she has seen is part of what
drew her to the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Folse's parents married in Poland. Her father was captured by
the Bolsheviks and as a prison train carted him to Siberia, Folse's
mother demanded to go to the prison with her husband. Later, as the
couple settled in Great Britain, Folse says she saw how dependency
on public assistance can destroy people and how socialized medicine
can kill. In fact, she blames the system for her mother's death
from diabetes in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Folse married and she has lived here in the states 30 years, her
southern twang giving no clue of her background. The Republican
Party teaches independence and cares about people, she said.

GOP CONVENTION WILL BE POP-CULTURE EXTRAVAGANZA 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If there was any doubt that the Republicans were
reaching out to new constituencies this year, consider the
celebrity to whom they have given the honor of delivering the
introduction on Wednesday night of the House speaker, Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   He goes by a stage name, The Rock, and for a living, he hammers
opponents in a ring. The idea of this World Wrestling Federation
superstar hobnobbing onstage with heavyweights of the Grand Old
Party is but one sign that in terms of unity of message and
show-biz pizazz, these proceedings will diverge in marked ways from
past conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The most often repeated phrase from party officials and
convention planners here in recent days is not the convention's
official slogan _ ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together'' _ but
``This is a different kind of convention.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to get less Republican than The Rock, a New
Media star who would seem as unlikely a presence on stage at the
First Union Center as Trent Lott, the Republican Senate majority
leader, would be as a house guest on ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly the idea. The bridge that the Republicans
wanted to build was not so much to the 21st century as to
20th-Century Fox and its ilk. The energy of the media age in all
its manifestations _ music, film, video, the Web, and even
prime-time professional wrestling _ is the aura that the
Republicans wanted. And it is lost on no one here that a pro
wrestler by the name of Jesse Ventura ignited the imagination of
Minnesota voters and won the governorship as a third-party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seem to have concluded that most Americans dwell
in this multimedia-driven, pop-cultural world, as opposed to the
sharper-edged political one that was conjured by what many in the
party have come to view as the off-putting ideological shows that
were staged before. At the 1992 convention, for example, speeches
by hard-right proponents like Pat Buchanan left a bad taste in the
mouths of many voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want people to come away with the feeling that Governor
Bush is going to do things a little bit differently,'' said Russell
Schriefer, a Bush media consultant who has been working on the
convention videos and programs for months.
</P>
<P>
   But when Republicans say ``different,'' they really mean
something else. They are trying to say that by being different
onstage here, they are acting more like the voting majority.
</P>
<P>
   The message is being managed to such a degree that the same
mantras are repeated over and over by officials, as if the
candidate and his minions were circulating them on some
high-security e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a new kind of leader, and this is a different kind of
convention,'' the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge,
said Saturday on ``Larry King Live'' _ an almost verbatim
repetition of the favorite sound bite of the convention's general
co-chairman, Andy Card.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The convention's program is another reflection of the lock-step
approach to message management. On Monday night, for instance, when
the focus on the stage turns to education issues, so will the
satellite feed to three jumbo Liquid Crystal Display screens.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Gov. George W. Bush, speaking live at a school
event in Ohio, will be beamed into the First Union Center. On
Tuesday, when the program calls for talk of defense policy _ and a
speech by a war hero, Sen. John McCain of Arizona _ Bush is again
to appear by satellite, from a site brimming with military
symbolism: Gettysburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   For each night's program, there will be a heavy emphasis on
narrative flow and emotional crescendo: ``Most of the lighthearted
moments are early in the evening, and the evenings will build,''
Schriefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a planning meeting here last week, Card and his staff
_ many of whom have extensive experience in producing television
shows _ went painstakingly through charts of each night's
prime-time offerings, blocked out in five-minute segments, from
7:30 to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If the session had the feel of a meeting of network programmers,
the similarities were intentional: This convention is expected to
put to rest any pretense the party had to producing anything but a
television spectacle. The ``show'' begins much the way an Emmy or
Oscar special might _ from a remote location, using actors _ and
the stage has been designed to look as if it were intended as much
for Brooks and Dunn, a country western group, as for Jennifer Dunn,
a Republican House member from Washington who is to have a featured
role one evening.
</P>
<P>
   As explained by Republican officials, the production will begin
with a satellite feed from Carpenters' Hall, part of the historic
Independence Hall complex in Philadelphia's Olde City, where an
actor in Colonial garb will ring in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Another actor playing Thomas Jefferson will also be featured,
and a few moments later a camera in the First Union Center will
focus on Paul C. Harris Sr., a Virginia state assemblyman who
occupies the seat once held by Jefferson. Harris also happens to be
black.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust is not appreciated by everyone. Among others, Richard
Lowry, the editor of the National Review, a conservative journal,
appeared on CNN the other night to express disappointment that the
issues of the day are being shoved out of the television picture.
And Democrats are clearly trying to cloud the upbeat focus on Bush
with a 17-state advertising campaign criticizing the congressional
voting record of his running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who have been pushing for a mainstream appeal
seem buoyant. ``An inclusive message is a winning message,'' said
Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican Leadership
Council, a centrist group based in Washington. Even a former
adversary, Greg Stevens, who was McCain's media consultant during
the primaries, said he is impressed by how faithfully the Bush camp
has tried to marry Bush's personal style to the convention's
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to like who they vote for,'' Stevens said. ``And
their greatest advantage is the likability factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans appear to have niceness at the top of their
list. ``The problem Republicans have had in the past is we've been
all serious,'' Schriefer said. ``It didn't look like we were having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone wants to see The Rock. The party hopes
it has taken care of that too. The first night will close with a
black-and-white appearance on the screens of that icon of the past
Kate Smith.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A PRODIGY WHO USED HER TALENTS BEHIND THE
SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who wish they had artistic talent usually find it hard to
understand why anyone with such a gift would not use it. But there
can be many complex reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a talented young person is pointedly discouraged from
a professional career, as was Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna,
called Nannerl, who was thought to be hardly less talented than he.
Typical of women of the period, she was not permitted to make
music, except at home, after she turned 18. She married a
magistrate, had three children, gave piano lessons and after her
brother's death became a valued resource for Mozart biographers.
</P>
<P>
   Others may be stymied by internal conflicts, a situation
poignantly captured by David Auburn's play ``Proof,'' which just
closed at the Manhattan Theater Club in New York. The central
character, Catherine, whose father is an ingenious mathematics
professor, drops out of college to care for him after he suffers a
mental breakdown. As she turns sullen, cynical and isolated, it
becomes clear that she, too, is a mathematical genius, although she
has kept her work secret and shuns a career.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most cases of forsaken talent rarely become public.
Until now this has been true of the pioneering record producer
Teresa Sterne, 73, Tracey to her friends and colleagues. From 1965
to 1979, as the director of Nonesuch Records, Sterne turned a
budget classical label into one of the most adventurous companies
in the business. But most of the young artists she nurtured, and
even many of her close friends, had no idea that in her own youth
she had been a piano prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping her past musical life to herself, Sterne made news
at Nonesuch. She recorded repertory that other, bigger companies
ignored: vernacular American song, world music and, especially,
works by living composers. She set off a nationwide craze for
ragtime with some popular recordings of Scott Joplin, performed by
Joshua Rifkin. She sought out great though less well-known artists
and helped establish their careers, among them the pianist Paul
Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert
Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1979 she was dismissed, in a move that anticipated the
current cutback on classical labels, in which innovative, smaller
companies have been gobbled up by profit-minded conglomerates. The
action brought howls of protest from critics and musicians in the
United States and Europe and turned her into a sacrificial symbol
of artistic principle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her colleagues knew that Sterne had once been a serious
pianist but assumed that she was a talented young musician who
could not make it professionally and had wisely chosen another
path.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sterne was a spectacularly gifted prodigy who made a
notable New York debut at age 12, playing Grieg's Piano Concerto
with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a benefit concert at Madison
Square Garden in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   For her debut with the New York Philharmonic the next year, she
played Tchaikovsky's daunting Piano Concerto No. 1 at Lewisohn
Stadium in Harlem before nearly 6,000 cheering people. And although
several critics noted that the 13-year-old Sterne lacked the
strength to fully handle the work's thundering octave passages,
they uniformly praised her temperament, singing tone and impressive
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, thanks to the loyalty of a small group of friends and the
commitment of Robert Hurwitz, the current director of Nonesuch
Records, Sterne's early work as a pianist may become better known.
In October, Nonesuch, the company from which she was once so
publicly ousted, will release a two-disk recording in her honor.
One disk will feature selections from some of the important albums
she produced while directing the label. The other will present her
as a young pianist in live performances. The deteriorating original
tapes have been in Sterne's private collection for years. Although
this archive is not large, it makes clear the depth of her gifts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a vibrant performance of Bach's ``Italian'' Concerto,
made in 1939 when she was 11, and a mature and fleet account of
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20, made just after she had turned 14.
There is also an entire recital at the Brooklyn Museum in 1944,
when she was 16, with works by Bach-von Buelow, Medtner, Debussy,
Chopin and Beethoven, capped by a brilliant performance of Liszt's
Hungarian Rhapsody No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   There is a confident and rhapsodically lyrical Rachmaninoff
Second Piano Concerto, performed with the New York Philharmonic,
again at Lewisohn Stadium, when she was 19. And more.
</P>
<P>
   Sterne and Hurwitz have been considering which performances to
include on the fall recording. But Sterne has insisted on one: the
sonata written for her by David Broekman, a Dutch-born composer and
conductor who became her most important mentor. The recording is
from a WNYC live studio recital in 1951, essentially her last
public performance.
</P>
<P>
   So why did she not continue a career that had begun so
splendidly? Sadly, she is now unable to explain.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sterne is suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the
progressive deterioration of the motor nerves commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's disease. She is confined to her apartment on the Upper
West Side, with its Oriental carpets, rows of books and records, a
grand piano stacked with music, photographs on the walls of
grateful artists she has recorded and a letter from President Jimmy
Carter, thanking her for championing American music, that hangs
inconspicuously in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Other than health care aides, she will see no one except a small
circle of close friends. Having never married, and with no
surviving relatives, she has appointed a longtime friend, Norma
Hurlburt, who recently became the executive director of the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center, as her health-care proxy. The once
voluble Sterne, who was famous among her friends and colleagues for
filling up their telephone answering machine tapes, is now barely
able to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously she is unable to take part in interviews. But in a
letter she wrote a few years ago to a friend, the music critic
Richard Freed, which was passed on to this reporter, she spoke at
length about what led her to abandon a concert career. And during a
series of talks with Hurlburt, who visits daily, Sterne was able to
articulate a few answers to questions posed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Brooklyn to a cultured family with a toehold on
the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who had been part of a
trio that played in movie houses and fancy restaurants, but she
stopped working to devote herself to her talented daughter's
development. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when
she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, also a professional
violinist, provided musical counseling and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Sterne studied piano with a series of local teachers and from
the age of 10 was educated at home by private tutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to live in a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' Sterne
wrote to Freed. ``The Brooklyn house was long paid off, and
expenses like oil heat, etc., were quite minimal. My little aunt,
who lived also at that beautiful house, was `moonlighting' after
her daytime job at the New York State Attorney General's office as
a legal secretary.'' Sterne's ``poor dear mama,'' she added, did
what she could, working as a nanny or sewing and taking odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The program booklets and faded press clippings from Sterne's
years as a prodigy are contained in a large scrapbook with
crumbling black pages. Several early profiles indicate how
constrained her childhood was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teresa looks not very different from a thousand other pretty,
chubby 12-year-olds in Brooklyn,'' one article in PM's Weekly
reported. ``But she doesn't go to school and doesn't play with the
other girls in her neighborhood.'' The interviewer also noted that
young Teresa did not have time to pay attention to ``the modern
swing music,'' then the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right for children who don't understand the
classics,'' young Teresa is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Sterne's career progressed steadily through her teen-age years.
At 20 she auditioned for the powerful manager Arthur Judson, who
offered to arrange a European tour for her, at a cost: $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our circumstance couldn't even visualize that much
money,'' she wrote in the letter to Freed. Still, it was not just
the expense that stymied her, as she explained recently to
Hurlburt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked the sophistication about how to build a career,''
Sterne said. ``My conscience drove me to join the working world. I
didn't want to be a parasite.''
</P>
<P>
   She took courses in touch-typing and stenography and decided to
``change her image'' by enrolling in a low-budget modeling school,
where she learned to walk like a lady and wear makeup. ``I had
grown up not knowing there were boys and girls, just people and
pianists,'' she wrote in the letter. ``I needed terribly to get out
into `the city' and find some kind of life for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a job as a secretary and model in a knitwear showroom
in the garment district, where she typed ``about 100 letters a day
and got propositioned by various young fellows,'' she wrote. For a
time she worked in the offices of Sol Hurok, the famous manager,
helping to promote the careers of other young pianists. Eventually
she spent six years at Vanguard Records, ending up as personal
secretary to the director.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1965, when Jac Holzman, the head of Elektra, the parent
company of Nonesuch Records, offered her the directorship of the
Nonesuch label, she was full of idealism, hardened by the realities
of the record business and ready.
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant assessment of Sterne's missionary zeal as a record
producer, written in 1980 following her dismissal, the New Yorker
critic Andrew Porter commented, ``When a promising new composition
has been billed, when a new ensemble _ Renaissance, Baroque or
contemporary _ has made its debut, Teresa Sterne has been there in
the hall, eager to ensure that the best of what and who deserve
recording and dissemination do get recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   But during her tenure in the 1970s, Elektra and Nonesuch were
acquired by Warner Communications. Nonesuch, the company's only
classical label, was losing money, Joe Smith, the head of
Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch, declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in
its marketplace,'' he said in a blunt interview with The Boston
Globe. ``We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian
Tea Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterne's defenders argued that sales of Nonesuch recordings had
suffered from poor marketing and distribution by the parent
company. Yet rather than oust the marketing director, the company
dismissed Sterne and put the marketing director in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The label drifted for several years, until late 1984, when
Hurwitz took over. Today, he asserted in a recent interview, he
works with popular artists like the soprano Dawn Upshaw and the
Kronos Quartet and has the freedom to record unusual fare, like
Louis Andriessen's opera ``Rosa'' and Stephen Sondheim's first
musical, ``Saturday Night.'' Still, he acknowledges that he has not
matched Sterne's commitment to the most complex, serious
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   Though she never would have anticipated becoming a record
executive when she was an adolescent pianist practicing for five
and six hours a day, Sterne now sees her Nonesuch work as a logical
outgrowth of her artistry and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   As she recently told Hurlburt, ``I felt I could do more to
disseminate music at the highest level through recording artists I
felt the whole world had to hear than through my own
performances.''  &QL;

AMERICAN OFFICIALS APPLY PRESSURE TO TRY TO OUST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ American officials are putting strong
pressure on the president of Montenegro and the leader of Serbia's
largest opposition party to take part in Yugoslav elections called
in September, according to Yugoslav politicians and Western
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials argue that a united opposition in Serbia,
together with voters in Montenegro, Serbia's increasingly
independent partner in the Yugoslav federation, would have a good
chance of defeating President Slobodan Milosevic in the
presidential and parliamentary elections he has called for Sept.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his allies have in recent months begun a new wave
of repression and altered the constitution to create direct
elections for his post _ which he otherwise would have to
relinquish next July.
</P>
<P>
   The only time the opposition triumphed in past elections was
when it united for municipal elections in 1996, winning in Belgrade
and dozens of other cities. Milosevic initially refused to
recognize the victories, prompting three months of mass
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   If these elections are manipulated or stolen, as expected, the
Americans argue, the opposition will have another rallying cry for
anti-Milosevic demonstrations. But a boycott provides no chance to
beat Milosevic, they say, and a divided opposition has almost no
chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, Milo Djukanovic broke with Milosevic and won the
presidency in Montenegro. He has allied himself with the West, but
is refusing to participate in the September elections, arguing that
the constitutional changes were made without consultation with
Montenegro and aim to reduce its influence.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's officials say that to participate in these
elections would only ratify Milosevic's constitutional coup and
legitimize the likely outcome _ a Milosevic victory, fair or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The changes to the constitution have also removed previous
requirements for a minimum turnout of half the eligible voters _
apparently to blunt any opposition boycott or the effect of
widespread apathy among a generally depressed electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the largest single opposition party
in Serbia, the Serbian Renewal Movement, says that he will not
participate in federal elections if Djukanovic won't. Draskovic
also argues that these elections cannot be free and fair _ with
attacks on opposition politicians, the judiciary, student
protesters and intense government pressure on the independent
media.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Serbia's political opposition, largely grouped into
the Alliance for Change, says it will take part, and is urging
Draskovic to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is almost sure to participate in the local elections,
where his party has many seats and privileges to defend. A boycott
of local elections would cause a revolt inside his own party,
Draskovic aides admit.
</P>
<P>
   A likely opposition presidential candidate is Vojislav
Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who is considered free of
corruption or of cooptation by the West _ distinguishing him from
Draskovic or his great rival, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the government took over the Belgrade television station
Draskovic controlled, Studio B, and prevented the independent radio
station, B2-92, and two others from broadcasting in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been regularly suing the independent media
under a tough information law passed in October 1998, and has also
restricted newsprint to major independent publications,
particularly Blic, a popular tabloid whose circulation has been
reduced by nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, in a trial that produced outrage domestically and
internationally, a Serb journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, was
convicted by a military court in Nis on charges of espionage and
sentenced to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Filipovic, who works for the independent Belgrade publication
Danas, Agence France-Presse and a London-based Internet site called
the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, wrote a number of
articles that annoyed the government, including one that cited an
internal Yugoslav army report on unhappiness and remorse over the
brutal tactics used against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo _ tactics
that caused Milosevic and four top aides to be indicted for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual for a suspected spy, Filipovic signed his name to his
articles, and there was no evidence presented to indicate that he
had secret contacts with any foreigner or intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also accused other independent journalists of
being spies and working on the orders of the CIA or the same NATO
countries that bombed Serbia last year, but in no case has provided
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   While these forms of pressure are hardly new, they are
increasing and indicate pre-election nervousness in the Milosevic
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is very shaky and obviously very concerned about
these elections,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a Draskovic aide. ``It's
not just the attacks on Filipovic and the students, but all these
statements about traitors. His worry is not just because of the
opposition, but because the situation in Serbia is disintegrating
in every sense, economically and politically.''

JAPANESE LEADER EMBARRASSED AGAIN; FINANCIAL CHIEF QUITS IN
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Dealing yet another blow to Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori's faltering government, the head of the government agency
charged with overhauling Japan's faltering financial system
resigned Sunday amid a fast-escalating scandal over his
relationship with one of Japan's largest financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Kimitaka Kuze, the chairman of the Financial Reconstruction
Agency, submitted his resignation Sunday afternoon as Mori cut
short a trip to Ishikawa prefecture to return to Tokyo to deal with
yet another crisis in his short but crisis-plagued administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to resign because I thought my personal problems
might disrupt parliamentary deliberations,'' Kuze said at a news
conference. ``This is a time when the government is facing
important domestic and foreign relations issues, and I wanted to
ensure there were no misunderstandings about the financial
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuze acknowledged on Friday that he received 230 million yen, or
$2.1 million at current exchange rates, in cash and benefits from
the Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Corp. for advisory work he did over
13 years that ended in 1996. He refused to resign then, contending
that he did nothing illegal under the laws at the time, a
contention he continued to maintain Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But his critics in the opposition party, which is gaining
strength at the expense of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, insisted that the payments were a bribe from the industry
Kuze was charged with overseeing. And Mitsubishi Trust issued a
statement saying it had indeed hired him for his political
connections, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Reports Saturday that Kuze had accepted 100 million yen, or
$920,000, from a condominium developer only further fueled doubts
about his ability to serve as the head of the agency. More and more
companies are seeking debt waivers, a trend that may mean the
government ends up holding the fate of several debt-laden real
estate and construction companies in its hands.
</P>
<P>
   He was the second head of the agency to resign under a cloud
this year, and his departure is likely to raise further doubts
about the government's ability and commitment to restructuring the
financial system, which two years ago was poised to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Michio Ochi was forced to step down in February after he made
remarks that suggested he would intervene to water down bank
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the agency, which was established in the fall of 1998, has
had three different chairmen in less than a year, and found itself
unable to withstand outside pressure. It has been forced into two
embarrassing retreats, first on the issue of whether to use public
money to bail out a department store owner and most recently over
the terms of the agreement it made to sell the bankrupt Nippon
Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has demonstrated an almost uncanny knack for political
blunders since taking over as prime minister after Keizo Obuchi was
incapacitated by a stroke and later died in May. The prime
minister, a veteran LDP politician who was battered by surprising
losses for the party in parliamentary elections in June, had
recently been bolstered by presiding over a trouble-free summit
meeting of the leaders of the world's industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   He has misspoken so many times since he became prime minister in
April that, during the news conference that closed the summit
meeting, he shuffled through a stack of cards printed with answers
to anticipated questions before saying anything.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely blamed within his own party for the heavy losses it
suffered in the June elections _ criticism that increased when the
drubbing was followed by another bribery scandal involving the
former construction minister, Eiichi Nakao.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mori's knowledge of Kuze's relationship with Mitsubishi
Trust will come under scrutiny. He and other leaders of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party were tipped to the relationship by an
anonymous letter threatening to expose the matter to the media
should Kuze win a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   The party insists it conducted a thorough investigation and
determined that Kuze had not violated any laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   The main opposition party, which itself has been on the
defensive over the last few weeks for its role in drafting the laws
that govern the sputtering resurrection of Japan's financial
system, had seized on the appointment of Kuze to renew demands for
Mori to step down. Mori ``knew the situation when he made the
appointment and thought it was OK,'' Yukio Hatoyama, the head of
the Democratic Party, said in an interview with NHK television.
``So of course he has responsibility for the appointment and
responsibility to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori replaced Kuze with Hideyuki Aizawa, a member of parliament
who heads the Lower House finance committee and has been a harsh
critic of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Aizawa, a financial bureaucrat who was a prisoner of war in
Russia after World War II, has objected to the agency's desire to
allow nonbanks to operate in the banking sector, so his appointment
would likely delay the plans of companies like the Sony Corp. and
Ito-Yokado to set up banks. He is also at the forefront of a
current move in parliament to curtail the use of government
guarantees in rehabilitating the financial industry.

MAIN TOPIC ON EVE OF GOP CONVENTION: CHENEY'S VOTING RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney, the Republican choice for vice
president, arrived here on the eve of the party's national
convention, after appearing on four national television programs to
smooth the more conservative edges of his House voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Once here, Cheney called for the election of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, promising ``most of all to make America proud again by
giving them a president they can respect.'' Cheney spoke for only
four minutes at the hotel where he will be joined by Bush on
Wednesday, and he seemed overwhelmed by his reception from a crowd
organized by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's more important task came on the morning talk shows.
While he called questions about his votes ``trivial'' and
``irrelevant to the important issues of the day,'' he discussed
some of the reasons behind his record.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he voted in 1986 against freedom for Nelson Mandela
because he believed the African National Congress was a
``terrorist'' group. He said he opposed banning cop-killer bullets
and plastic guns that could pass metal detectors because of the
no-amendment procedure under which they were considered. And he
said he voted against Head Start and the Older Americans Act
because they were too costly; on both, he said his position was
different today.
</P>
<P>
   Unimpressed, the Democratic National Committee began showing a
television advertisement Sunday attacking Cheney over votes against
Head Start, the Clean Water Act, the school lunch program and
health insurance for people who lost coverage when they lost their
jobs, and for praising OPEC for cutting oil production. Referring
to Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive presidential nominee, and
Cheney, the ad said: ``What are their plans for working families?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's former challenger for the nomination, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., appeared Sunday before the reformist-to-radical ``shadow
convention,'' and gamely asked the audience to vote for Bush, in
terms that were less than ecstatic. He was soundly booed. Then he
formally released his own delegates, from commitments to vote for
him. Many groaned.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp's plans for a conflict-free convention, meanwhile,
chugged along without serious difficulty. Abortion rights advocates
insisted they were working to find the required six states to
support new language in the platform acknowledging diverse views on
the subject, but they had yet to find them. One minor rules
squabble shaping up was over an attempt to make all 165 members of
the Republican National Committee automatic delegates at the next
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself campaigned Sunday at the replica of the historic
Crosley Field in the suburbs of Cincinnati. Several thousand people
withstood a driving rain to see him. Fireworks popped as he drove
up in a campaign bus emblazened with the slogan, ``Renewing
America's Purpose,'' the theme of his five-day tour through several
battleground states. He told the Republican members of Congress
sharing the stage with him, ``Be patient. Help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working our way to the convention,'' he said, ``And
we're going to states that the Republican candidate hasn't done so
well in lately. See we started off in Arkansas. And then we went to
Kentucky. Now we're here in Ohio. The last two elections we haven't
done so well, but that's going to change come November. We're going
to carry the great state of Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no formal convention business Sunday beyond the
arrival of 2,066 delegates _ mostly middle-aged white males and
generally more conservative than the voters who gave Bush the
nomination _ assembled in the city where Republicans have nominated
five previous candidates, from John C. Fremont in 1856 to Thomas E.
Dewey in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But it became increasingly clear that despite the shadow
convention and occasional minor demonstrations like Sunday's
peaceful march by 7,000 for a variety of causes, the four-day show
beginning Monday is all about Bush and Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The party's congressional wing gets barely an hour at center
stage, yet Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who, as chairman of the
House Republican Campaign Committee, is striving mightily to retain
control of the House, pronounced himself happy with the time given
House candidates at the podium: two segments of fifteen one-minute
speeches during the day Tuesday. Nor did the senators complain at
the opportunity for six four-minute speeches around lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said, ``This convention is about electing George W. Bush.
It's not about the House and Senate.'' He said Republican hopes of
retaining the House, where they hold a 13-seat majority, would be
aided by Bush's ``creating an updraft that our candidates can take
advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that the campaign has settled on a strategy
for dealing with the problems it obviously did not anticipate from
Cheney's voting record. On one television show after another, he
said the votes did not matter, but that he was not wedded to them
today.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's This Week, Cheney complained of ``so much time and
energy and effort devoted to this kind of trivia'' and ``the
trivial aspect of the debates that rage in Washington now.''
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' he said, ``The campaign that
Governor Bush and I will run is very much oriented towards the
future, it's focused on trying to restore a degree of civility in
Washington, to end the kind of partisan backbiting that has been so
much a part of the tone and tenor in this city for all too many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' he said, ``I think the American
people want to hear about the future, not about the past.'' That
choice of phrase recalled what Bill Clinton, then a candidate for
president, said on Jan. 26, 1992, about accusations that he had
conducted an affair with Jennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Cheney said, ``I hope the Democrats
spend the next three months going after my voting record; I'll be
happy to defend it. But in the meantime, we're going to talk about
the future of the country, and we're going to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   His argument about how his pro-gun votes were dictated by House
procedures banning amendments was also consistent from one program
to the next. He put it this way on ABC:
</P>
<P>
   ``Debate was limited. No amendments were allowed. And I often
voted against measures that I thought deserved more serious
coverage and debate than was permitted when the majority brought it
up under the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gave different answers when asked what he would do now on
the measure attacking cop-killer bullets that can penetrate
policemen's bullet-proof vests. He told CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``It
would depend.'' When NBC's Tim Russert asked, ``Would you authorize
money to ban cop-killer bullets and ban plastic weapons?'' Cheney
replied ``Ah, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC he said he voted in 1987 against the Older Americans Act,
which provided $1.6 billion for programs including health centers,
Meals on Wheels and Alzheimer's research by saying ``probably
because it was excessive in terms of the funding.'' He said, ``When
we had big deficits I voted against bills that I thought either
authorized or appropriated too much funds.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also interviewed on Fox News Sunday, but was not asked
about his House votes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He continued the anti-Washington theme here, saying ``For the
last five years, I've been outside Washington, I've been out in the
real world where people are building companies, creating jobs,
inventing new technologies that are transforming our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been the chairman and chief executive of the
Halliburton Co., a large oil services company based in Dallas,
said, ``When I look back at Washington, I scratch my head and ask
what the hell are they doing back there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the platform, Republican abortion rights supporters said they
had yet to concede defeat, and were still trying to get the
majority of six state delegations necessary to bring the issue to
the floor. But by evening, they had yet to get them. Asked if the
Bush forces were blocking their efforts, Lynn S. Grefe, national
director of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, replied, ``The
GOP, somewhere, is pushing against us, and it's very strong.'' The
word had clearly gone out, she said, ``Don't sign anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters filled a ballroom at a downtown
hotel, where speakers assailed the platform but argued that over
the long haul, they would prevail. ``I do believe that ultimately
reason will prevail and the Republican Party will finally eliminate
that anti-choice, anti-woman, and antediluvian plank from our party
platform and we will once again represent the values of personal
freedom and choice,'' declared Roselyn O'Connell, a Republican and
president of the National Women's Political Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But a fight did loom over the plan, recommended Saturday by the
convention rules committee, to make all national committee members
automatic delegates. Morton Blackwell of Virginia, organizing the
challenge, said that unless the Bush campaign squelched it, he
thought he could win a floor right against ``a bad, bad idea all
over. It's an elitist notion.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   For McCain, it was a tough day. Ariana Huffington, the
commentator who is the chief organizer of the shadow convention,
which is focused on campaign finance reform, lingering poverty and
a drug war seen as aimed mostly at filling up prisons, had to
intervene to quiet the booing crowd. When the catcalls continued,
intermittently, McCain canceled a promised question and answer
session.
</P>
<P>
   One participant, Emily Hagopian of Los Angeles, who came with a
group called Youth Vote 2000, said, ``Everybody saw him as our hope
for change and then he came in here with that endorsement. He
disgusted us. He betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then tears came to McCain's eyes when he met with his own
delegates. ``I need every one of you to give this campaign the same
amount of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary
campaign,'' he told them, warning, ``American doesn't like sore
losers.''

<P>
   No one gathering here was anxious to recall the last GOP
convention in this city, in 1948, when the party, which had
regained Congress two years before, met in sweltering heat to
nominate Dewey, and was confident of victory. But some of the
rhetoric of Dewey's acceptance speech could work as well for Bush's
speech, scheduled for Thursday. Dewey said on June 24, 1948:
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity we seek is more than material. It is more than a
matter of things and measures. It is most of all spiritual. Our
problem is not outside ourselves. Our problem is within ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found the means to blow the world, physically, apart.
Spiritually, we have yet to find the means to put together the
world's broken pieces, to bind up its wounds, to make a good
society, a community of men of good-will that fits our dreams. We
have devised noble plans for a new world. Without a new spirit, our
noblest plans will come to naught. We pray that, in the days ahead,
a full measure of that spirit may be ours.''

BUSH SEEMS SERENE AND CONFIDENT ON EVE OF CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE ASH, Ohio _ As he rides toward his moment of triumph,
George W. Bush speaks with extra punch. He belts out his speeches
now, his face flushing, arms waving. Yet once off the stage, he is
unusually introspective, talking of family. History. Legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of the Adams family factor,'' he said on his
campaign plane this past weekend, bringing up unprompted the last
father and son in American history to both win the presidency: John
Adams and John Quincy Adams, so very long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So confident is he that he jokes fondly about his new running
mate's flat campaign style, calling it with notable understatement
``a little more laid-back than mine.'' And though usually allergic
to psychobabble, Bush does not brush off questions about his
relationship with his father, former President George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't all that long ago that he himself was the president
of the United States, which will make the story unique and
different,'' Bush mused.
</P>
<P>
   There is poignancy to this conversation on the plane. At his
rallies, Bush speaks of his popular mother. He revels in telling
the tale of his courtship of his wife, Laura. But the only
acknowledgment of his father is oblique.
</P>
<P>
   It comes when he bellows, ``I understand that the last two
presidential elections haven't gone well,'' and promises to change
that for Republicans come November. Left unmentioned is that one of
those defeats was his father's.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bush clan is gathering once again, just as it did to
watch the father's triumphant nomination by two Republican National
Conventions. This time it is the eldest son who will take his
moment on the stage, capping a remarkable 17-month transformation
from a governor with less than two full terms in office to his
party's great hope for reclaiming the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be there, sure, I think all of my brothers and
sister,'' Bush said. ``I can't think of any boycotters.''
</P>
<P>
   Day after day as Bush gets ever closer to Philadelphia, the
pyrotechnics become more elaborate. On Sunday he stole a technique
from his primary rival John McCain and showed up on a campaign bus
for a rally here at the replica of the historic Crosley Field.
Fireworks shot into the sky to dazzle the crowd of 2,000, who had
waited for hours on the open field despite several rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   In a blue shirt and no jacket, dancing on his heels, Bush spoke
of himself in the third person. ``You got to understand about
George W.,'' he said. ``I don't take polls to tell me what to
think. I do what I think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems serene, though at times emotional too. At the
governor's mansion in Austin late last week, he almost choked up
when he said he would recognize his wife, his daughters and his
parents in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush is at his side at rally after rally, beaming, as he
weaves her into his stump speech by promoting her own convention
speech, which is planned for Monday night. ``The first speaker will
be the first lady of the state of Texas,'' he tells his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He gives them a thumbnail history of the public school librarian
from dusty Midland, Texas. ``I said, `Would you marry me?''' he
says. ``She wasn't particularly interested in politics and
politicians. She said, `I will, except don't ever make me give a
speech.' I said, `OK.''' He pauses and then adds, to rising
laughter from his audiences, ``It's the only political promise I've
ever broken.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Republican convention will be about Bush and the Bush
family and the Bush platform, beginning in prime time on Monday
with Laura and ending Thursday night with Bush's acceptance speech.
``That puts the Bush family arms around the convention,'' said
Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Republican officeholders _ the ones who remind the
public of the the hard-edged Gingrich years _ have been pushed
offstage or to nonprime time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the edge is gone completely. Revving up the drenched
crowd before Bush's arrival on Sunday, Bill Cunningham, the host of
a local radio talk show, asked, ``Are we going to permit an eighth
of an inch of rain to keep us from scouring out the White House
from the filth and degradation of Clinton-Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' the audience thundered back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, who served on the House Judiciary Committee
during the impeachment of President Clinton, wondered jokingly who
would have expected to see ``Microsoft split up and the Clintons
still together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speeches by contrast have few hard edges, except for his
promise to restore ``honor and dignity'' to the presidency, and the
dig at President Clinton that is implicit when he says that Dick
Cheney ``understands what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the speeches is the concept of family, a soft
and subtle way to appeal to his party's conservatives yet also
sound right to suburban soccer moms. ``Love your children all the
time,'' he croons. ``Tell them you love them.'' Or else he shouts,
``I got a kind of special feeling for moms _ if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he sounds more like a revivalist preacher than a
politician. Before 5,000 people in Joplin, Mo., on Friday night,
Bush thundered: ``My administration will rally what I call the
armies of compassion, the decent, kindhearted souls that act not
because of government, that act because they hear our call to
people all across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the confetti and the balloons, and on outdoor stages, Bush
throws out his arms maniacally to give oomph to the old familiar
stump speech. He gets help in looking animated from the contrast
with his new running mate.
</P>
<P>
   On his one day of campaigning with Bush last Friday, Cheney
shook hands fast along the receiving line waiting to greet the Bush
plane. Then he stood alone at the waiting car. Bush was still
working the line, grabbing a hand here, a shoulder there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different campaigning style,'' Bush said the next
day. ``That's the way it is. He's going to be a great partner. He's
warming up.''
</P>
<P>
   And if these are glory days, well, Bush says he learned
something else from his father, who watched his sky-high approval
ratings after the Gulf war collapse, leaving him unable to stave
off defeat in 1992 by a young, untested governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get overconfident,'' said this year's
governor of the moment. ``You know why? I know what can happen. I
have seen poll numbers crumble. I have seen defeat firsthand.''

CLINTON WOOS THE LAWYER AND BLASTS GOP INACTION ON JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.Y., S.C.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton said Sunday that the Republican
majority in the Senate was purposely slowing down action on his
nominees to federal appeals courts and, in some cases, blocking
people solely because they are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of speeches before trial lawyers who are holding a
convention here, Clinton compared what he said was the Republicans'
refusal to consider some minority nominees to the 1986 vote in
Congress when Dick Cheney, now the Republican vice presidential
candidate, and other conservatives voted against a resolution
asking, among other things, that Nelson Mandela be released from
jail in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Cheney's vote on the Mandela resolution was so
amazing, ``it takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Mandela had managed to get out of jail and
helped transform South Africa despite that vote. ``I'm worried
about the people now whom I've tried to put on the court of appeals
who are African-American and Hispanic who are being held in
political jail because they can't get a hearing from this
Republican Senate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In complaining about the refusal of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to schedule a hearing on a Hispanic nominee from Texas,
Clinton also managed to criticize Gov. George W. Bush for not
supporting the nominee to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that the Republicans had refused to consider
two black nominees to the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va.
Although the circuit contains more black residents than any of the
nation's 11 regional appeals courts, Clinton said, it has never had
a black judge.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in presidential election years, the party that
controls the Senate and not the White House, in this case the
Republicans, slows down the confirmation process hoping to preserve
judicial slots that carry lifetime tenure for their own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to appear before the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America, the first president to do so since Lyndon B. Johnson in
1964, Clinton paid tribute to a group that has been one of the
Democratic Party's most reliable sources of campaign donations over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been the party's principal fund-raiser in
recent years, will soon leave office and told an audience in New
York on Saturday that he would never run again. But his appearance
before the annual convention of the trial lawyers group was not
only about gratitude for the recent past but about the importance
of the trial lawyers in the current election.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, figures show that trial lawyers' donations to
Democrats have served as a counterforce to the corporate donations
that go largely to Republicans, producing a kind of complicated
financial ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   In this election cycle, law firms have donated more than $57
million, according to Sheila Krumholz, the research director of the
Center for Responsive Politics. Of that, more than $38 million went
to Democrats with less than $19 million to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers are somewhat critical to Gore,'' Krumholz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, a group that
monitors campaign spending, said the trial lawyers' money had
brought some balance to the enormous battle in state legislatures
and Congress over the issue of limiting lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're having fundamental values being played out here and the
trial lawyers are only trying to level the playing field,''
Harshbarger said in an interview. And there is no more stark
difference between the presidential candidates than on the issue of
so-called civil justice reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made attacks on trial lawyers a centerpiece of his
campaign and has vowed that if elected, he will push a program
similar to the one he helped enact in Texas.He has pointed with
pride to his record in Texas of curbing civil litigation, capping
legal fees and limiting jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Alexander, a San Francisco trial lawyer who is the vice
president designate of the trial lawyers association, said Sunday
that Gore, on the other hand, had been a reliable supporter of the
trial lawyers' interest in maintaining the right to sue
corporations as a counterweight to corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore is someone who believes in consumers, someone who
believes they should have their day in court,'' she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore did not address the convention and has
seemingly resisted emphasizing the issue. Harshbarger said that
corporations had been successful in their effort to ``paint lawyers
as the bad guys.'' He said it was unsurprising that Gore had tried
to keep some distance between himself and the lawyers in the public
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance before the trial lawyers is, in a sense, as
a surrogate for Gore and, to a lesser extent, for other Democrats,
notably Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer advocate who has been closely
allied with the trial lawyers on the issue of civil litigation
rules, said Gore was allowing the president to take the heat of
associating with the lawyers while he was reaping the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just slinking around taking money like crazy from these
guys, and at the same time he's not really standing up for the
civil justice system,'' Nader said. He cited as an example, that
Gore did not respond to a speech last February in which Bush
promised a South Carolina audience of business people that he would
immediately seek changes in the litigation rules.

SPECIAL REPORT: KILLER NEARS END OF HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THE COURTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va., Ore., Calif., Miss., Mass., Conn.)  By BLAINE HARDEN and NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until this month, Dennis Sweeney was the only killer
in New York state who was required by law to go twice a month to a
mental hospital for a six-hour sleepover.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, he drove to a state hospital in Middletown,
N.Y., said hello to the duty nurse and picked out an empty bed on
the third floor. He woke himself at dawn, walked out of the
hospital and returned to the carefully calculated anonymity of his
small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   This odd and empty ritual, which he has performed without fail
for more than five years, was the endgame in a legal and
psychiatric odyssey that began two decades ago when Sweeney
committed a crime that dumbfounded a generation of Americans who
came of age in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, 1980, he walked into a law office in Rockefeller
Plaza and shot dead Allard Lowenstein, the former congressman whose
liberal passion helped shape a decade of civil-rights and anti-war
activism. Lowenstein had been his friend and mentor. But after his
arrest, Sweeney told psychiatrists that he was convinced by voices
in his head _ that Lowenstein was part of a Jewish plot to destroy
him. Quickly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Sweeney was
found not guilty by reason of insanity and packed off to a state
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As his sleepovers at the mental hospital suggest, the world that
Sweeney, now 57, inhabited for more than a third of his life is
governed by rules that are often arbitrary and sometimes useless.
The rules, too, have a history of being turned upside down in
response to public fear, populist politics and sensational crimes
like the shooting of President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the man who killed Al Lowenstein spans an era
of wholesale change in the insanity defense in America. While the
very meaning of insanity was being rewritten in legislatures and
reinterpreted in the courts, Sweeney was living in Middletown,
about 70 miles northwest of Midtown Manhattan, and making what his
psychiatrists describe as a rare and impressive recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The dental crowns that he gouged out of his mouth with a hacksaw
in the early 1970s _ in an attempt to silence the voices _ have
been replaced. Sweeney has said the voices disappeared more than a
decade ago, and doctors at Middletown Psychiatric Center say they
believe him. Hospital furloughs have allowed him to find a job as
an employment counselor. He rents a house with a fine view of the
Shawangunk Mountains. He is active in the Unitarian Universalist
Church in Middletown and managed a Habitat for Humanity project
there that built a house for a disabled couple.
</P>
<P>
   For about a year, court records show, he has been romantically
involved with a woman who works as a counselor to the mentally ill.
He has told her about his violent past. He refused repeated
requests to grant an interview for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Brenda Soloff of State Supreme Court in Manhattan has
been tracking Sweeney's progress for more than 15 years, and on
June 30, she ordered a conditional release that will end his
sleepovers at the mental hospital. Those visits were a legal fig
leaf, she said, covering the reality that he is ``an inpatient in
name only.'' In her decision, the judge concluded that ``for six
years, without medication, Dennis Sweeney has been building an ever
more complex, satisfying and successful life in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing Attitudes
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's recovery and return to everyday life would, in all
likelihood, have been impossible had he pulled the trigger after
John Hinckley shot President Reagan in 1981. Hinckley was later
found not guilty by reason of insanity _ a decision that roiled
public opinion and prodded politicians to act.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Congress sharply raised the bar for the insanity plea.
It changed the test of incompetence from whether defendants
appreciated their acts or could control their behavior to a more
restrictive standard: Did they know right from wrong? Congress also
shifted the burden of proof. Where once the prosecution had to
establish reasonable doubt about an insanity plea, the defense now
has to show convincing evidence to support the plea.
</P>
<P>
   States followed the federal lead, with two-thirds restricting
the defense. Twelve states adopted a guilty but mentally ill
verdict, seven narrowed the test for insanity, 16 shifted the
burden of proof, and 25 tightened release rules for those found not
guilty by reason of insanity. New York state narrowed the test and
shifted the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the law followed a sea change in public attitudes,
according to legal scholars, as the insanity defense generated
mounting skepticism. Psychiatrists who testified as expert
witnesses also retooled the way they judged the sanity of people
who committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Hinckley, our approaches erred on the side of finding
insanity,'' said Dr. Park Dietz, a psychiatrist who has been an
expert witness, usually for the prosecution, in some of the most
notable insanity defense cases of the past 20 years, including
Hinckley's, Jeffrey Dahmer's and the Unabomber's. ``The approach
launched in 1981 would, in the Sweeney case, have looked very
specifically at whether he knew Lowenstein was a man who could be
injured or killed by shooting, and whether he knew that the police
would come and want to punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, several psychiatrists said, Sweeney was sane
when he killed Lowenstein. And by that standard, had he shot
Lowenstein after 1984, Sweeney would have probably been found
guilty of murder, sentenced to life in prison and would still be
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those found not guilty by reason of insanity, the
notoriety of a crime itself _ irrespective of a patient's recovery
from mental illness _ often governs the length of confinement in
mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   If Sweeney had shot someone who was not famous, he probably
would have won a conditional release from Middletown Psychiatric
Center several years earlier, according to researchers who study
forensic law.
</P>
<P>
   The determination that a once-homicidal patient no longer
suffers from a dangerous mental illness is an art, not a science,
and mental health experts agree that it is subject to error.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Predicting a harmful event such as violence is very much
like predicting harmful weather _ estimates rather than guarantees
are all that can be expected,'' said John Monahan, a psychologist
and professor of law at the University of Virginia who specializes
in risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
   That Sweeney is an excellent risk, as judged by mental health
professionals, is of little comfort to Lowenstein's survivors. His
widow and his children say they are afraid of Sweeney, as do two of
his own former friends. Court records show that Sweeney has told
friends of his ability to pull the wool over the eyes of
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sweeney might now be covering up his violent delusions,
two risk assessment experts said it was highly unlikely. They said
that psychiatrists tend to err on the side of caution. But they
said no one, except Sweeney, could be absolutely certain.

</P>
<P>
   A Life Unravels
</P>
<P>
   Until it was ruined by the voices in his head, the life of
Dennis Sweeney had been shaped by idealism and by his own
considerable courage.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Portland, Ore., the only son of working-class
parents who separated when he was an infant. His father, a military
pilot, was later killed in Korea. Dennis grew up bookish, athletic
and handsome. He won a scholarship to Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford he met the charismatic Lowenstein and became one of
his disciples. When his mentor asked him to go to Mississippi in
1963 and join the civil rights movement, Sweeney went. For most of
the next three years, he devoted his life to the movement. Working
in McComb, Miss., he narrowly escaped death when his house was
dynamited. Sweeney made a name for himself as thoughtful, effective
and quietly fearless.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he came to share the feelings of black activists in
Mississippi who felt patronized by white Northern liberals like
Lowenstein. The idealistic student turned against his loquacious
mentor. The break was given a nudge when Sweeney, according to an
account he later told several friends, was asked by Lowenstein to
share his bed. It was an invitation offered to a number of
Lowenstein's male acolytes , according to a friend of Lowenstein
and numerous published reports, , but friends say Sweeney found it
especially disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   As the civil rights movement gave way, for white liberals, to
protests against the Vietnam War, Sweeney's life came undone. A
marriage failed. His friends said he took a lot of LSD. According
to prosecutors in New York and his reported statements to friends
at the time, he participated in the 1968 burning of an ROTC
clubhouse at Stanford, and was questioned about it, but never
charged, by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, after he dropped out of college and lost touch
with most of his friends, Sweeney began telling people about an
electrode planted in his head. He gouged out his bridge work. He
declined voluntary psychiatric treatment in Oregon. He assaulted a
former friend in Boston. He confronted Lowenstein about the voices.
Finally, after the death of his stepfather, for which in his
delusional state, he blamed Lowenstein, he applied for a permit to
buy a handgun. He bought the gun in New London, Conn., and drove
his pickup through a rainstorm to keep an appointment with
Lowenstein in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A Rapid Diagnosis
</P>
<P>
   After Sweeney was arrested and taken to jail on Rikers Island,
psychiatrists had no trouble with a diagnosis. He kept trying to
``spit out the devil'' into a plastic foam cup. Lowenstein was not
really dead, he claimed, and was still out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Persecutory delusions are classic symptoms of paranoid
schizophrenia. Anyone with his diagnosis would today be treated
with a mix of powerful pyschotropic medications, psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   What puts Sweeney ``outside the curve'' of standard treatment,
said Robert H. Berger, director of forensic psychiatry at Bellevue
Hospital Center, is that for almost two decades his recovery has
been without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, his recovery has been so seemingly free of the usual
symptoms of schizophrenia that examining psychiatrists, including
Berger, have questioned whether he was misdiagnosed. They wondered
if he might have had some other mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, two generations of doctors have concluded
that everything in his history fits the pattern of schizophrenia.
The chronic disease is a gradually deteriorating onset of auditory
hallucinations and psychosis. Still poorly understood, it's
attributed to genetic vulnerability, brain chemistry imbalance and
life stresses, sometimes including the effects of drugs like LSD.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of studies of patients with schizophrenia have reported
recovery rates ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent, with or
without medication. The National Institute for Mental Health,
however, now says no more than 20 percent of schizophrenics ever
fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity to calmly obtain a gun permit and make an
appointment for murder does not square with popular notions of
insanity, but psychiatrists say it does fit the profile of paranoid
schizophrenics. They typically appear far more normal than other
psychotics because, outside of delusions, most of their thinking
remains intact. To protect themselves from perceived enemies, they
are adept at deception.
</P>
<P>
   Deception has been a recurrent concern in Sweeney's case. By
1985, his treating psychiatrists said he showed no signs of
illness. Describing him as ``alert, intelligent, friendly,
respectful and cooperative,'' they wanted to transfer him from a
maximum-security hospital to a nonsecure one.
</P>
<P>
   In court hearings the following year, however, evidence emerged
that Sweeney was lying to his doctors. He confided to Charles
Hinkle, an old friend from Oregon, that to win his release he
falsely said he no longer heard voices. By then, court records
show, Hinkle was afraid of his friend. When Sweeney found out in
1986 that Hinkle had told prosecutors about the voices, he angrily
broke off their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Hinkle told a psychiatrist involved in the case
that he hoped Sweeney would never be allowed back in Oregon. When
Sweeney learned about this, he wrote Hinkle a furious letter,
calling the statement ``disgustingly shrewish.'' Hinkle, a lawyer
in Portland for the American Civil Liberties Union, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists who specialize in murder consider Sweeney's case
particularly rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say that his is the only case that I have
personally examined where I believe there has been a spontaneous
remission from schizophrenia without medication,'' said Dietz, who
says he has examined thousands of murderers. He advised the court
in 1993 that Sweeney would most likely be ready for release within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the doctor gave his recommendation, however,
he pulled aside Lowenstein's widow, a psychiatric social worker,
and gave her a private warning that he routinely imparts to
families of victims: No good can come of any contact between your
family and Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   A Troubling Encounter
</P>
<P>
   Kate Lowenstein was 9 when Sweeney killed her father, but family
friends say she was determined to attend a hearing this year on
Sweeney's release. It was a way, somehow, to represent her father's
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom during a recess, Sweeney looked her straight in
the eye and walked over. Sweeney was ``fairly certain'' he
recognized the young woman in the last row, he later told the
court. Lowenstein was astonished that he knew her. At most, he had
seen her once before, when she was a toddler and he was deep in his
delusions.
</P>
<P>
   He would tell the court that he ``just felt like it was one of
those situations where the silence was unbearable and I wanted to
say something.'' No one else in the courtroom was watching. He
started by offering an apology, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what you did to me? Lowenstein asked in reply. He
said that he did not. You broke my heart, she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning closer, he tried to explain why he had done it. She
seemed frozen by distress by the time lawyers ran over to her.
Outside the courtroom door, she broke down. The words of Sweeney's
explanation, as she wrote them down, were: ``The only reason I did
what I did was to stop something terrible from happening. You can't
understand that, but I had to do it. I had to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have repeatedly delayed Sweeney's release, turning
up information overlooked by his changing cast of therapists.
``It's not a question of whether we worked hard to keep him in,''
said Ralph Fabrizio, a prosecutor. ``We tried hard to see what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   They fought to retain Sweeney's fictional inpatient status at
Middletown Psychiatric, Fabrizio said, because legally it made it
easier to reel him back in, if he tried, for example, to contact
members of the Lowenstein family.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they want a tight enough leash on Sweeney to
keep him from slipping through what they call a gap in the law.
Once he is granted conditional release, he cannot be recommitted
just for breaking conditions imposed by the court. A judge would
have to rule that he was dangerously mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, an alternative _ a petition for involuntary
civil commitment. In practice, officials at Middletown Psychiatric
said, this option, which requires the signatures of two
psychiatrists, is routinely used to bring in patients on
conditional release who are judged to be regressing.
</P>
<P>
   To the prosecutors, the courtroom encounter with Lowenstein was
a disturbing illustration of Sweeney's poor judgment, if not his
skewed thinking. They wanted to get it on the record. But when
Fabrizio told Lowenstein he might have to call her as a witness,
``she just turned ashen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They both knew what the psychiatrist had told her mother.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Cusp of Freedom
</P>
<P>
   In Middletown, it took Sweeney eight years to convince
psychiatrists at a maximum-security mental hospital that he was a
good risk for transfer to a nonsecure facility. It took three more
years for him to convince officials at Middletown Psychiatric
Center that he was a good risk for unescorted furloughs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sweeney has had to convince people in a semirural
community of 50,000 that he is not dangerous. It has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney lost his first job after attracting the attention of the
local newspaper. He was counseling mentally disabled adults at an
agency called Crystal Run Village, when a reporter told
administrators that he was writing a story about a psychotic
murderer working with vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handwriting was on the wall and people were running for
cover,'' said Mark Lukens, then executive director at the agency.
``We told Dennis about the story and he resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney started over, working as secretary, lumber-store clerk
and carpenter. It took him six years to land a job he really
wanted, as an employment counselor. Meanwhile, he joined a church
and told its members about his illness and the murder.
</P>
<P>
   When the same newspaper, The Times-Herald Record, in a 1994
article about the local hospital, mentioned him in passing as a
``notorious patient,'' Sweeney complained in a letter to the
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been my experience that people I have met over the
past 2 1/2 years bear me hostility or begrudge me a life, as long
as I do not represent a potential danger to the community or anyone
in it,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the newspaper of trying to sabotage his
chances for work or friendship. Since then, Sweeney has been
mentioned twice in the paper for his work with Habitat for
Humanity. He was described only as ``a former Oregon resident.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several psychiatrists familiar with Sweeney's life said that the
best insurance that he will not slip back into dangerous mental
illness is the web of work, home and love that he appears to have
woven for himself in Middletown. Even psychiatrists who do not find
Sweeney to be a charming person _ and there are several _ say his
release is sound on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an obsessive compulsive man who is very
intellectualized, not a warm, mushy, caring person,'' said Alan J.
Tuckman, one of the examining psychiatrists who recommended
release. ``But that's not the standard. If somebody is going to
have recurrent schizophrenic episodes, they are not going to occur
every 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his conditional release, the precise terms of which
are still being argued in court, officials at Middletown
Psychiatric say Sweeney will continue in psychotherapy and will be
visited at home at least twice a year. He has been ordered to stay
away from the Lowenstein family and from two former friends who
fear him, Hinkle and the man he assaulted in Massachusetts.

TAX AVOIDANCE IN TURKEY HAMPERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Almost everything for sale in Turkey has two
prices: a sticker price for goods sold with an invoice or receipt
reported to government, and a much lower price if the buyer pays
cash: The consumer avoids the 17 percent sales tax and the seller
can hide the income and escape corporate and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The losses to Turkey's treasury from the flourishing cash
economy and other schemes to conceal income are impossible to
calculate, officials said, but new government statistics hint at a
vast scale of tax evasion among business owners and the
self-employed in this country of 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on income reported to the government, the best-paid
professionals in Turkey are notaries, who certify official
documents. Last year, the average income declared by the country's
576 notaries was about $53,000, more than 10 times earnings
reported by lawyers and doctors, nearly 30 times as high as
dentists. And artists, too, have said they were paid more than
engineers, lawyers, doctors and dentists, if income reports to
government are to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe manufacturers, furniture dealers and clothing store owners
were among the categories in which people reported earning less
than the minimum wage of about $138 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Few are likely to believe the figures, given that notaries are
required by law to provide a receipt for every transaction, just as
artists must provide proof of the value of their works.
</P>
<P>
   Other self-employed people routinely accept cash without an
invoice or shift payments to offshore bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another government statistic raised questions about how many
people report earnings. In the last 15 years, Turkey's population
has grown 30 percent and the number of taxpayers has risen only 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tax evasion is certainly not unique to Turkey, but it is
hampering the country's efforts to complete the transformation from
developing to developed nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a government can't raise taxes, they can't run a proper
government or pay their civil servants enough to keep them
honest,'' said Jeremy Pope, executive director of Transparency
International, an organization that tracks government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Corporation income is taxed at about 40 percent, and individual
income tax rates go as high as 55 percent. The Ministry of Finance
has estimated in recent years that 5 percent to 10 percent of taxes
due go unpaid, but most experts view those figures as conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Under prodding from the International Monetary Fund as a
condition for a $3.9 billion loan, Turkey is working on reforms.
New rules were adopted in 1998 to increase compliance by basing
taxes on declared earnings instead of the former assessment of
standard of living, but the results are widely ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance agreed that tax evasion
is a serious problem and that reported income is often far lower
than actual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For now, cash transactions _ and accompanying discounts _ are
prevalent, from the restaurant owner who increases the bill for
patrons paying by credit card to the lawyer who instructs foreign
clients to pay fees into an offshore bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial ethic has disappeared and honesty is called
stupidity,'' said Mehmet Yildirim, chairman of the Istanbul Chamber
of Commerce, quoted in a local newspaper recently.
</P>
<P>
   From the doorway of his men's clothing shop near the bustling
Misir Carsisi, or spice bazaar, Sabri Kefeli said he sees the issue
in terms of economic survival. Facing competitors and surrounded by
sidewalk vendors with no overhead, he said he has little choice but
to please the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers say: `I am not going to take a receipt. What can you
do for me on price?''' he said. ``I must go along.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Kefeli said, he is left to make up
receipts to account for his sales.
</P>
<P>
   As a notary, Metin Tozlu has no such options, he explained as he
sat in his second-floor office on the same street. Unlike his
neighbor, Tozlu must provide receipts for every transaction and
make detailed reports to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if notaries make more than doctors and lawyers, Tozlu,
chairman of the city's 193 notaries, gestured to his modest
quarters. ``What do you think?'' he asked. ``If everybody paid as a
notary pays, then we wouldn't be at the top of list.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a dispute about who avoid taxes most: Some labor union
representatives argue that civil servants and other types of
workers whose taxes are deducted from their paychecks pay more than
their share, while representatives of corporations often blame
small shop owners and the self-employed for shifting too much of
the burden to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many segments of society lack the discipline of paying
taxes,'' said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of an association
representing the country's 2,000 largest businesses. ``The problem
is creating the resources to enlarge the tax base through
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer at an Istanbul firm said that in addition to many
lawyers' asking that fees be paid into offshore accounts, proceeds
from major business transactions are often deposited in foreign
banks, but proffered government some advice: ``My suggestion is to
audit everyone who bought a Jeep Cherokee or Range Rover last
year,'' the lawyer said.

FOR MCCAIN, IT'S BACK TO POLITICS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Politics as usual _ with its compromises,
casualties, and emotional costs _ caught up with Sen. John McCain
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters repeatedly tested his appetite for his own words,
asking, item by item, if he still believed all those nasty things
he had said about his former opponent for the Republican
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush. Over and over, he endorsed the man
he once derided as a phony reformer unprepared for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, one youthful audience here responded with boos,
derisive laughter, and cries of ``Drag him off!'' to what he
insisted was his ``sincere conviction'' that ``all Americans''
should support Bush. On the eve of Bush's National Convention,
McCain was beginning to seem downright conventional, a quality he
despises in politics.
</P>
<P>
   As the senator gathered on Sunday afternoon at a reception with
senior officials of the Bush campaign to formally release his
delegates to the governor, the moment and the message proved too
much. McCain had praised Bush for running a ``centrist, inclusive
campaign.'' He had urged his supporters to give the Bush campaign
``the same kind of enthusiasm and participation'' they had given
him, that had made him believe, for a time, he might be president.
Then he tried to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be grateful,'' McCain told the packed room,
before stopping to harshly clear his throat. He tried again: ``I
will never be able to _ I'll never be able to thank.'' He gave up,
eyes shining, as the room erupted in a full minute's applause
despite his repeated efforts to get back to business. At his side,
his wife Cindy began weeping, along with some of the delegates and
campaign staff, who had never seen tears from their boss.
</P>
<P>
   When he regained control of himself and the room and at last
expressed his gratitude, McCain declared ``This is a time for
celebration.'' Then, to groans and cries, he released his remaining
delegates _ roughly 150 _ to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coming before the four days of processed emotion that is a
modern political convention, McCain's raw moment left some
delegates shaken, even as rock music blared and confetti cannons
blasted the room. ``People really believed in him,'' said Ric
Barros, a lawyer from Massachusetts. ``It's like a death in the
family.'' Asked if he would support Bush, Barros said: ``In time.
Today, I just want to think about John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before McCain, Don Evans, the chairman of Bush's
campaign, praised the senator as ``my American hero'' _ though at
least one McCain aide rolled his eyes. Joe Allbaugh, the Bush
campaign manager, was also present, though he did not address the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp can afford to be gracious. Trailing McCain around
the margins of the convention here is like watching an episode of
``Survivor'' while knowing who has been voted off the island. The
only sense of suspense surrounding his appearances hangs over the
question of how far he will go in endorsing Bush _ and the only
surprise registered by his audiences has been over how far he has
gone.
</P>
<P>
   For his full-throated endorsement, McCain was booed on Sunday by
the sort of audience he usually enraptures, an uneasy assortment of
the disgruntled _ critics of the campaign finance system,
politics-as-usual, and much else _ gathered for a ``shadow
convention.'' Head down, McCain soldiered through his prepared
speech until the noise became too loud, and he looked up. ``If you
like I do not need to continue,'' he said evenly. But a wave of
applause from the generally supportive audience kept him going.
</P>
<P>
   McCain rode his ``Straight Talk Express'' up here on Saturday
for what he insisted was a fun reminder of how his campaign
``caught lightening in a bottle.'' It seemed more like a rolling
test of his humility. Asked on his bus if he still believed Bush
was a ``Pat Robertson Republican,'' McCain said quietly, ``No, no,
I don't believe that.'' To another oft-repeated question, he
insisted that his relationship with Bush was ``cordial'' or even
``very good.'' Repeatedly, he said that he expected to be
supporting Bush's re-election in 2004 and not running himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona senator's self-sacrifice had its limits. He
bristled when asked, for perhaps the hundredth time, whether he had
checked with the Bush campaign before putting his bus back on the
road. ``No,'' he shot back, ``because the last time I checked, I'm
a United States senator.'' He repeatedly reminded questioners that
he always promised to support his party's nominee _ a caveat that
made his endorsement sound more dutiful than heartfelt. But his
sense of humor stayed intact. When asked if he would accept a
position in a Bush cabinet, he said, as he contended with an
enormous soft-serve vanilla waffle cone, that the only job he
wanted was emperor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still admits to differences with Bush, including over
campaign finance reform. But he no longer declares that Bush should
adopt his position, instead noting, as he did at the shadow
convention, that ``we agree on many more issues than we disagree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has repeatedly acknowledged that he is walking a
tightrope, trying to retain an insurgent appeal while playing by
the rules of party politics. He remains extremely popular, which is
why Bush and scores of congressmen are clamoring for public shows
of his support.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters who turned out for the senator during the weekend
said that they understood. ``Everybody who's reasonable knows that
in order to make any change, you have to be incremental,'' said
George Leslie, who stood outside the shadow convention on Sunday
waiting for the senator and wearing a black T-shirt declaring
``Thank God I'm an Atheist.'' ``You have to support the system
you're in.''

 &HT;    Barton victims memorialized one year later
 &HT;    By Stacy Shelton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year later, tears were shed anew.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's memorial service for nine people killed in a gunman's
office rampage gave those who lost the most a place to share their
grief. Sons, daughters, spouses and parents cried again and felt
the sharp pang of absence that started the day Mark Barton shot up
two Atlanta day-trading firms.
</P>
<P>
   But the ecumenical service, attended by close to 1,000 people,
also gave peripheral acquaintances and even strangers a chance to
mark the day they won't forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to come by and see everybody,'' said Terri
Brown, one of the first paramedics to respond to the carnage on
July 29, 1999. ``To see (the survivors), it makes me glad to be
doing what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and half a dozen other paramedics from American Medical
Response wore their white and blue uniforms to the service. Some
shared hugs with those they saved.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bolaji Odusina went to Sunday's service at the Cathedral of
the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill to remember a woman she barely knew.
She'd only met Vadewattee Muralidhara, a mother and devout Hindu, a
few times but felt a strong bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the brief interval I knew her, she made such a big impact
on my life,'' she said. Odusina, a pediatrician, and Muralidhara's
husband had considered going into practice together. ``She was just
an incredible person.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the hour-long service, family members came
forward one-by-one to light 12 candles in front of the pulpit. One
candle for each of Barton's victims, including Barton's wife, Leigh
Ann, and two children, Matthew and Michelle, whom he bludgeoned to
death before the Atlanta shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, who killed himself, was not represented with a candle,
and his name was not mentioned. It didn't need to be. The violence
he loosed on Atlanta was apparent in every message.
</P>
<P>
   From the pulpit, DeKalb CEO Liane Levetan told the mourners,
``We all experienced a sense of shock and uneasiness that something
like this can happen in our home community. . . Feel our
community's arms around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Earl Paulk, the church's pastor told families and friends
to let themselves grieve, because ``sometimes survival depends on
our ability to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told them to share their grief with others, find
forgiveness, and love the people still in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Replace negative feelings with positive action,'' Paulk said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, there was more than just tears. At a reception
following the service, there were also smiles and laughter _ signs
that life continues for families and friends who lost the people
they didn't think they could live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your heart filled up? Mine is,'' said service organizer Dr.
Gulshan Harjee, who's husband, Dean Delawalla, was among the
victims. ``The empty place is full.''

 &HT;    Rocker rumor shot down
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baseball moved up today's trading deadline from
midnight to 4 p.m. this year to save general managers from staying
up half the night to monitor deals that never happen.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, the game may have gotten a head start on itself.
After Friday's flurry of deals, the deadline is expected to pass
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a Philadelphia-Anaheim trade involved ex-Braves
outfielder Ron Gant and right-handed pitcher Kent Bottenfield, and
a deal that gave the Cardinals left-handed pitcher Jason
Christiansen, Sunday was subdued. The Braves were involved in the
day's best rumor _ closer John Rocker to Cleveland _ but general
manager John Schuerholz scoffed at the report, reiterating he is
seeking middle infield help or a left-handed hitting outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   And he implied he was not seeking them too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the acquisition of (starting pitcher) Andy Ashby, we
dealt with the area that we felt we needed to strengthen
ourselves,'' Schuerholz said. ``I felt that was an area we had to
do something. Other than that, there's just a desire to increase
our depth, but not a need to.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported Rocker's trade to the Indians was
imminent, with the Braves given an option of picking one reliever
from Paul Shuey, Steve Karsay or newly-acquired Bob Wickman, even
though Shuey is supposedly unavailable for trade. Indians GM John
Hart, a close Schuerholz friend, denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   After bouts of control problems, Rocker finally appears to have
reclaimed his fastball, walking no one in his last five innings
while recording his first two saves in over a month. While that
might make him marketable, Schuerholz did not sound eager to alter
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen has regained its strength,'' he said, ``with the
continued improvement of (Kerry) Ligtenberg, the healthy return of
(Mike) Remlinger and the continued improvement of Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Gant, batting .254 with 20 homers, moves to his fifth team
because the Angels needed a right-handed alternative to Edgard
Clemente at DH. The Phillies, after dealing Curt Schilling and Andy
Ashby and losing Paul Byrd to injury, were strapped for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals acquired Christiansen from the Pirates in exchange
for minor league infielder Jack Wilson.

SPOTLIGHT WILL BE ON LAURA BUSH AS CONVENTION OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes dateline. Inserts names of Laura Bush's parents in
graf that begins ``Laura Bush said that her own ...'')  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the various stories about their relationship
that Laura and George W. Bush like to tell, not one gets a more
frequent and thorough workout than this: She married him only after
they had reached an agreement that she would never have to make a
political speech on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   She must have been skeptical. It was the end of 1977, and Bush
was gearing up for what would turn out to be an ill-fated campaign
for a congressional seat from west Texas, and his father was laying
the groundwork for his own ill-fated presidential bid in 1980.
These were the Bushes _ politics was in their plasma. Her vow of
silence was doomed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's appearance at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia on Monday night will be the latest _ and by far the
most nerve-frazzling _ illustration of that. She is scheduled to
deliver the first major address of the event, with thousands of
people spread out before her, the invisible eyes of a national
television audience on her, and the responsibility for properly
jump-starting a four-day jubilee in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get butterflies a little bit, thinking about it,'' she said
in a recent interview, adding that she remained a bit baffled by
how she got from there to here, from a placid career as an
elementary school librarian in the 1970s to the turbulent reality
of a presidential campaign that put her on a national stage,
whether she wanted to be there or not.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, too, marveled at that trajectory. ``If I'd have
said, `Honey, you'll be the kickoff speaker at the Republican
convention in the year 2000,' she would have said, `You've totally
lost your mind, and I'm not marrying you,''' he told several
reporters at the governor's mansion last week.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's remarks point to one of the most intriguing aspects
of Laura Welch Bush, a trait that sets her apart from many of her
predecessors on this path: She never aspired to it, never planned
it, never looked across the broad expanse of the future and saw
herself in a wash of light, with a microphone under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, several of her friends and acquaintances say, she
could trade it all for long afternoons of reading or mornings of
gardening and be utterly happy _ perhaps even happier.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, friends and relatives say, she has adapted to her role
in the limelight and her part as a political spouse with relative
ease and remarkable vigor, drawing on a serious (albeit quiet)
intellect to become an active first lady in Texas and to develop a
public voice and style more mellifluous than her husband's, and
maybe even more assured.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voters who take note of Laura Bush for the first
time on Monday night will undoubtedly be surprised and impressed by
that, and will get little sense of the reluctance she openly
expressed before Gov. George W. Bush launched his campaign for the
White House last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, the former first lady, said in a recent interview
that her daughter-in-law adhered to ``a great philosophy in life _
you can either like it or not, so you might as well like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her convention speech was, in fact, a
harbinger of more activity and a higher profile for her. With the
couple's twin 18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, heading for
college around Labor Day and leaving the Bushes with an empty nest,
Laura Bush plans to hit the campaign trail full-time, at her
husband's side and on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unbelievable life experience,'' she called it in one of
four interviews over the last two months. ``An unbelievable
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were ever-present hints, in her words and gestures and
the observations of those who know her best, that her attitude
about this whole crazy pageant was much more complicated than that.
After her husband literally got choked up when he talked about her
during an event in Greensboro, N.C., three months ago, he explained
in an interview, ``I know she's making a huge sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush made it clear that her interest was in helping
him, not promoting herself, and that she was not offering voters
two for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for office,'' said Laura Bush, 53. ``George is
running for office. I don't really even want to talk about issues
that much. I'm not that knowledgeable about most issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about education,'' she added, mentioning the topic of
her convention speech. ``I know about things that I've worked on.
But you know, most other issues I don't know that much about. And
just to put in my 2 cents to put in my 2 cents _ I don't think it's
really necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference from four years ago, when Elizabeth Dole,
roaming among the delegates at the Republican convention with a
mobile microphone and Oprah-esque panache, was not simply singing
the praises of her husband, Bob Dole, the party's presidential
nominee, but also strutting her own political stuff. It turned out
to be a prelude to her short-lived bid for the presidency last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle hovered Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
first lady who had never been shy about throwing in her thoughts,
and who also had a candidacy in her future.
</P>
<P>
   But their counterparts this time, Tipper Gore and Laura Bush,
seem to be more ambivalent recruits, as content in the background
as in the foreground, yanked by their husbands' desires into races
and places that they might never have chosen for themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, an intensely private woman, shares none of her
husband's showmanship or garrulousness; toward the end of an
interview with her aboard his campaign plane, when the governor
exuberantly jumped in to compete for the attention of the reporter
seated beside her, she promptly turned away, pulled out several
pieces of stationery and began writing thank-you notes to
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is always bouncing off the walls,'' observed Anne
Johnson, who has known the couple for decades and whose husband,
Clay, is the chief of staff in the governor's office. ``Laura is so
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush says that contrast is one reason that their union,
both personally and politically, works well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I temper that personality,'' she said, referring to
her husband's brashness, ``but I also think that he makes life much
more exciting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But both she and her husband's advisers seem unsure at times of
how exactly to cast Laura Bush's degree of reserve.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they clearly see her detachment from the
messier, more vainglorious dimensions of politics as an advantage:
evidence to support her husband's assertion that he, too, is a
grounded, down-to-earth person not driven by an insatiable ego or a
partisan blood lust. The way Bush praised her in a recent interview
was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cuts right through, through the posturing and
positioning,'' Bush said proudly. ``America's starved for
something. I'm telling you: They're starved for something real. And
that's what she brings. She's a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bush campaign also does not want to
present her as a bashful, timid throwback or blandly dutiful
helpmate _ an inaccurate portrait that might not play well with
female swing voters and that decidedly sells Laura Bush short.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with other journalists in the past, Laura Bush
readily called herself shy, but she now emphatically rejects that
label. Some of her friends go out of their way to do likewise. It
is as if they all received the same memo.
</P>
<P>
   And an expression of distaste swept over her face recently when
this reporter brought up a story, which had appeared elsewhere in
print, that she had once answered a question from George W. Bush's
paternal grandmother about what she did with her life, by saying,
``I read, I smoke and I admire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally made up,'' Laura Bush said. ``I'm sure I said
`I read.' But I certainly didn't say `I admire.''' (As for smoking,
Laura Bush eventually quit.)
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Bush said in a recent interview that she remembered
both her daughter-in-law's three-part answer and her
mother-in-law's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush darn near collapsed,'' Barbara Bush said, recalling
the reaction of the former president's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Laura Bush had a busy professional life as an
elementary school teacher and librarian for a decade before she
began dating George W. Bush, and she remained single, without pangs
of worry, longer than any of her close female friends. She was 31
when she and Bush married in November 1977, three months after they
met.
</P>
<P>
   Her avidity for reading is really an abiding love of literature,
and when she and Bush were living in Dallas and raising their two
daughters in the 1980s, Mrs. Bush, who had given up her career
around the time of her wedding, used her spare time to take classes
on William Faulkner, Greek tragedy and other literary topics.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican primaries earlier this year, she was on a
Truman Capote binge, but had to interrupt it because she found
herself in the middle of ``In Cold Blood'' around the time that
Bush lost the New Hampshire contest to Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so foreboding,'' Laura Bush said of Capote's masterwork,
``and I was reading it during the most anxiety-provoking time, and
I had to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name her favorite book, she cited part of one: the
``Grand Inquisitor'' section of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' by
Dostoevsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said that she moved into the first lady's office in
Austin in 1995, after her husband was first elected governor, with
the expectation that ``cobwebs would grow on the phone,'' she did
not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Right away she became a driving force behind the inception of
the annual Texas Book Festival, which has raised about $900,000 for
the state's public libraries, and in 1998 and 1999 she helped
write, lobby for, and secure the passage of legislation that
allocated $17 million a year to improve programs to teach preschool
children in Texas to read.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush also has a sassy streak that gets scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, George W. Bush occasionally joked in public speeches
that his wife had a librarian's narrow concept of oratory, and it
amounted to a single syllable: ``Shhhh!'' Laura Bush was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a speech, to kid him, to get back at him, I said he was a
gregarious businessman who thought that a bibliography was the
biography _ the story _ of the person who wrote the Bible,'' she
recalled. She laughed heartily at the memory of her little act of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   And she has an adventurous impulse: For her 40th and 50th
birthdays, she went river-rafting with four close female friends,
including a Democratic state senator from Kansas and a midwife from
San Francisco who recently visited Indonesia to teach classes on
childbirth. Around Austin, Laura Bush maintains a similarly
eclectic mix of social acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say that the governor often solicits her
advice, asking for her intuition about people and situations, and
she serves as his filter for much of what gets written about him in
newspapers and magazines, which she seems to monitor more closely
than he does. He often tells reporters not what he thought of their
articles but what she did.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear that she shares his positions on
sensitive issues. He opposes abortion; she declines to elucidate
her feelings. He has presided over more executions than any other
governor; she does not comment on the death penalty either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in so many ways, she has followed his lead. He ran for
governor despite her expressed fears about the privacy that their
family would lose. Then he upped the ante by running for president,
even though she had talked publicly about her trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say to George, for something that he really
wanted to do, that he couldn't do that,'' Laura Bush said, adding
that he, too, would never deny her something that she deemed
important. People who know the couple well have said that his
decision to quit drinking 14 years ago was partly a response to her
entreaties and to a growing worry that he was endangering his
marriage and family life, which he cherished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her own family life had been a stable and
deeply loving one. She grew up as an only child in Midland, where
her father, Harold B. Welch, was a successful home builder and her
mother, Jenna Welch, kept his books. Although neither of her
parents finished college, they let Laura know early that they
expected her to do so, and she was a conscientious, excellent
student who never got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   She was acutely aware of her mother's other failed attempts to
have a child, several of which ended in premature babies who died
within days, and, perhaps as a result, she said: ``I felt very
obligated to my parents. I didn't want to upset them in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   She and George W. Bush, who also grew up in Midland, went to
different elementary schools but were in the seventh grade together
at the same middle school, although neither of them remembers
knowing the other well. She stayed in Midland while he went to
Philips Academy in Andover, Mass. She and her friends described her
high school years as happy and generally uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   But one day in 1963, when she was 17, she drove through a stop
sign and hit another car. Its occupant, a boy who happened to be a
close friend, was killed in the collision, which was deemed an
accident; no charges were filed against her. Laura Bush said that
she was steeled for the incident to come up during her husband's
presidential campaign, as it did earlier this year, but she
nonetheless tensed at the mention of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, terrible thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1964, she headed to Southern Methodist University
in Dallas, where her major was education. It was a conventional
choice, and one that she briefly doubted in the years after her
graduation in 1968. Feminism had come into vogue; she was reading
some of the books that the movement had spawned, and she said she
told her father that he should not have ``programmed'' her to be a
teacher when she could have been a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Daddy almost immediately pulled out his wallet,'' she
recalled, ``and said, `I'll send you to law school.' He would have
loved to.''
</P>
<P>
   But she remembered: ``I had to admit, when he did that, that I
didn't want to be a lawyer. I wanted to be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She taught in inner-city elementary schools in Dallas and
Houston for three years, living at one time in the same apartment
complex in Houston as her future husband, who was then a pilot in
the Texas Air National Guard. But her place was on the quiet wing,
and his was on the rowdy one, and they never crossed paths.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a master's degree in library science from the
University of Texas in 1973, she settled in Austin, where she
worked as an elementary school librarian. She said that she never
lacked for dates but did not find the right man until, in the
summer of 1977, she visited Midland, where Bush was making his way
in the oil business. A couple who knew them both invited them for a
backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked and talked. Laura Welch listened and listened. The
next night, he took her out for a game of miniature golf. And three
months later they married.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments were necessary. She was persuaded to make her first
political speech the next year, when he waged his unsuccessful
campaign for Congress. He learned to conform to her standards of
tidiness and order, which were so high that one of her friends, Jan
O'Neill, recalled that Laura Bush organized the books in the
couple's bedroom in accordance with the Dewey decimal system.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush family gatherings, she made an unusual addition to the
sometimes rambunctious clan. Her husband recalled his parents and
siblings sitting around the table in Kennebunkport, Maine, their
plates clean, while they watched and waited patiently for his wife
to pick her way through her meal.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wanted a large family of their own, tried for several
years without success, and had already begun the adoption process
when she finally learned that she was pregnant with fraternal
twins.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the outlook was uncertain; she developed toxemia, and
her doctor told her that she would be lucky to deliver one healthy
child. Laura Bush said that whenever she went to the grocery store,
she avoided the aisle with diapers and baby-related items, because
she did not want to stoke her hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she has been a fiercely devoted mother. They also
say she has been an integral part of her husband's success, not
because she is a second engine of his ambition but because she is a
shock absorber, keeping him calm and stable, and occasionally
keeping his mischievous and arrogant streaks in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rein it in, Bubba,'' she told him one day on his campaign
plane, as he held forth at length in front of reporters. Privately,
when she catches him ribbing people mercilessly or strutting
shamelessly, she simply murmurs, ``Bushieee,'' her voice rising at
the end. He knows what that means.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has not given extensive thought to what kind of
first lady she might make, but her mother-in-law has some ideas.
Barbara Bush said her daughter-in-law would be different from
Hillary Clinton because she would ``not get into foreign affairs or
controversial subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would rather make a positive impact on the
country,'' Barbara Bush said. ``And I'm not criticizing Mrs.
Clinton. But it's like oil and water. We're talking about two
different subjects. They're two different people. I think Laura
thinks of others.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said her daughter-in-law would be ``better, much
better'' in the role than she was. ``She won't be a fat,
white-haired old lady,'' Barbara Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   She would also be less voluble, and in many ways less
accessible, because there are tight boundaries around what Laura
Bush is willing to offer for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last September, when she accompanied her
husband to an outdoor memorial service for the seven people killed
by a gunman at a church in Fort Worth. She wore sunglasses, which
she never took off. But every so often, she lifted a tissue to her
face, delicately tucked it behind her dark lenses and then quickly
put it away.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was easy to miss, as she clearly intended it to be.
Campaign or no campaign, Laura Bush was not about to share her
tears.

SETTLERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ With the words of the Old Testament to guide
them, Jewish settlers on the West Bank have never been much
concerned about their image in the world, nor even, for the most
part, how their ways and beliefs are viewed by their fellow
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding provocation of their adversaries _ whether
Palestinians, fellow Jews or American peacemakers _ has rarely been
their way.
</P>
<P>
   So when Avi Dobuler strapped his pistol on his waist Sunday and
led a family of American tourists to the marble-topped grave of Dr.
Baruch Goldstein, the settler who massacred 29 Palestinians in a
hail of rifle fire in one of Islam's holiest places of prayer in
February 1994 and who was then shot to death himself, Dobuler was
not minded to be politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   To him, and to many of the 200,000 settlers on the West Bank, it
has mattered little that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
moving closer to decisions on the settlements' future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the negotiations faltered last week at Camp David, the
issue that caused the impasse was not so much the settlements as
the future Palestinian role in Jerusalem, about 25 miles north of
here.
</P>
<P>
   On the settlements, according to Israeli, Palestinian and
American versions of the discussions, the two sides moved closer
than ever to agreement, and part of that consensus was that the
7,000 Jews living in and around Hebron, the most explosive of all
the West Bank hot spots, will be among about 40,000 Jewish settlers
who will have to live under Palestinian rule in any final peace
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Dobuler, a 45-year-old settler, came to Israel in 1970 from his
home in New York, and now lives in Beit-El, a settlement near the
West Bank town of Ramallah that may also be marked for eventual
Palestinian rule. To him, the news from Camp David seemed like a
good text for a homily at the grave of Goldstein, whom he called a
good man and a friend, on ``a make-believe peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The grave and its graveled surroundings, carefully tended by the
settlers, have become a shrine since the massacre in the Tomb of
the Patriarchs, a sacred place for Jews and Muslims that lies close
by the settlement at Qiryat Arba where Goldstein lived and lies
buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we've no right to be here, but the purchase of this
land by Abraham nearly 4,000 years ago is in the Bible,'' Dobuler
said, raising the carefully-annotated Old Testament he carries on
his guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   To David and Nonie Vonnegut-Gabovitch from Indianapolis touring
Israel with their four children, Dobuler's version of the massacre,
and his exculpation of Goldstein, seemed deeply disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known that the grave was on the itinerary beforehand, I
would have said no,'' said Vonnegut-Gabovitch, a 41-year-old real
estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the occasion served as a powerful illustration of the
complex and darkening world in which the settlers in places like
Qiryat Arba live as the moment nears when they will have to choose
whether to stay on under eventual Palestinian rule, or accept
whatever compensation a final peace agreement offers for returning
inside the sovereign borders of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world that may be easy for some outsiders, including
other Israelis, to disparage, but it is also one that, at first
hand, lends a powerful element of poignancy to the settlers'
plight.
</P>
<P>
   In a day spent touring Qiryat Arba, on heights to the east of
Hebron, and the three tiny Jewish communities beleaguered inside
the town itself, the complaint most frequently heard from the
settlers was that outsiders, particularly the news media, have
represented them as out of touch with reality and extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that people always represent us as some kind of
loonies?'' said David Wilder, the spokesman for the Association for
the Renewal of the Jewish Community in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'm not crazy, and neither are any of the settlers
living here,'' said Wilder, 46, an immigrant from New Jersey. ``We
are living an ideal. We are not criminals or killers. We came here
to re-establish a Jewish community that existed in Hebron for 2,000
years, and we did so in the face of enormous hostility from our
Palestinian neighbors, and that's no more crazy than somebody who
takes the subway in New York at 11:30 at night.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The other side of the settlers' story, as set out by Wilder and
a dozen other settlers, is one of courage in pursuit of a biblical
vision, of moving into the inhospitable terrain made accessible by
Israeli conquests in the Six Day War of 1967, of building
communities from scratch, of growing large families and deep
attachments to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Hebron and perhaps 20 or 30 other settlements that seem
likely to become part of an eventual Palestinian state, the
settlers sense that an Israel that once saw them as pioneers
rejects them as liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Camp David talks last week, members of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government took few pains to disguise
their readiness to abandon settlements like Qiryat Arba.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the maps put forward, and what this would mean for
the settlements, appeared on the front pages of Israeli newspapers,
and sympathy for the settlers was scant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements are towns of Israelis and not Israeli towns,''
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told the newspaper Ma'ariv.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The option that 20 percent of the settlers are going
to have in the end is either to stay there under full Palestinian
sovereignty or accept compensation and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   To the settlers' argument that previous Israeli governments
encouraged them to establish their communities, Beilin replied:
``We aren't dealing with historic justice at present.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who faces chronic political problems in winning
acceptance for a peace pact even if his shaky coalition government
survives a no-confidence vote on Monday, is calculating that the
settlements saved would weigh decisively with Israeli opinion,
against those that would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Israelis, even those who favor the Camp David
proposals, the attempt to anchor settlements that would remain part
of Israel _ perhaps 120 of the 145 settlements, according to Camp
David negotiators _ have a distinctly chimerical, not to mention
expensive, touch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the settlements are armed encampments on the rocky
hillsides, often close by or even inside the West Bank towns and
villages where more than 1 million Palestinians live.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli settlements would be linked, as now, to the rest of
the country by a spaghetti of ``security roads'' patrolled by
Israeli troops, with each settlement likewise provided with its own
defense units, as well as with secure water and electricity
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, higher education, and even limited recreation, would
involve a commute to cities like Jerusalem, through territory that,
as today, could remain vulnerable for years, or even decades, to
attack by renegade Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In Qiryat Arba and the Jewish communities in Hebron, opinions
differed as to whether staying on under Palestinian rule would be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old high school student, Lital Danon, pausing to eat
an ice-cream at Elitzur's, a bakery and soda fountain that is a
favorite Qiryat Arba meeting place, hailed an approaching stranger:
``Welcome to Zion!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Barak plan to hand over Qiryat Arba to a
Palestinian state, she replied briskly: ``It's ugly. It would be
impossible to live with Arabs. But it's also not so easy to find a
place to flee to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobuler, leading his tour, offered an apocalyptic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay here would be a death sentence, because the
Palestinians would pick us off one by one,'' he said. Wilder, in
his role as the settlers' spokesman, concurred on the risks, but
said most settlers would remain anyway, doing whatever was
necessary to protect themselves against Palestinian threats.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli paratroopers patrolling Qiryat Arba, within earshot of
the settlers, endorsed the settlers' sense of biblical purpose. But
as soon as the settlers moved away, young conscripts from cities
like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reverted to the more common view among
Israelis, that the settlers have been living an unsustainable
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they'll have to go,'' said a 21-year-old sergeant
who gave his name as Oren. A companion said: ``There's no religious
significance here. They are Jews, like us, and they can live in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, the prospects of the settlements surviving a peace
agreement seemed still more improbable. The 600 Jews living in the
city, surrounded by at least 150,000 Palestinians, rely on SWAT
teams of Israeli police and jeep-loads of soldiers on 24-hour
patrols _ together with the men deployed around Qiryat Arba, an
armed force of about 2,500 men, according to published Israeli
accounts _ to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   On one short street divided between Jews and Palestinians, the
Jewish homes are protected with a 60-foot high, street-wide fence
against the stones and firebombs that have occurred in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In these neighborhoods, mentioning Barak invites torrents of
vituperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a traitor through and through,'' said one old woman
tending a flower-box on the windowsill of her home, who declined to
give her name. ``Barak thinks he can play God, but he is not God,
and God will punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   A block away, in the teeming Kazazeen bazaar, Palestinians waved
away talk of the Jewish settlements coming under Palestinian rule,
saying they had little faith that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, could deliver on his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews have treated us like donkeys, not like men,'' said
Amer Zalloum, a 19-year-old tending his father's food stall. ``But
they won't go, anyway. Have you seen Qiryat Arba? It's a city, and
the Jews will never give it up.''

LAURA BUSH: PRIVATE WOMAN IN A PUBLIC ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
 BUSH-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The day was hot, the creek was high, and a few
of the picnickers had waded knee-deep into the water to cool off.
Suddenly, the fully clothed first lady of Texas jumped into the
rushing creek, got swept under by the strong current, and then, to
the horror of her security men, started floating downstream faster
than they could run along the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an independent streak,'' said Adair Margo, a friend
who remembers laughing with Laura Bush about the little adventure
as the two hung their soaking-wet underwear on the line to dry.
``People say she is shy and reserved, but when she wants to do
something, she won't hesitate.''
</P>
<P>
   The American people will meet Laura Bush at the Republican
National Convention Monday night. But there is a side of the former
librarian and schoolteacher, who married George W. Bush because she
wanted a little excitement in her life, that they may not see.
</P>
<P>
   She's not the sweetly smiling, seen-but-not-heard spouse who
reluctantly embraced her husband's dream of the White House. She's
the woman who privately cultivates a rich life outside politics,
whether it's bird-watching in Belize, curling up with a great book,
designing a dream ranch on the central Texas prairie, or discussing
the latest theories on the cognitive development of preschool
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be your next-door neighbor or your officemate, she
is that down-to-earth,'' said Dr. Susan H. Landry, chief of
developmental pediatrics at the University of Texas at Houston, who
has worked with Mrs. Bush on some of her reading initiatives in the
state. ``But she is also impressive _ very intelligent, very savvy,
and a strong leader who does what she does with warmth and
sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Credited with pushing the governor and Texas Legislature to add
money for early learning to the federal Head Start program, Mrs.
Bush has credentials to address the convention's first-night theme
_ ``Leave No Child Behind'' _ and to talk about education, the
signature issue of Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Having Mrs. Bush open the Philadelphia
convention is really about personalizing the GOP nominee and
connecting him to a bright and well-balanced woman. By all
accounts, Laura Bush is a happily married mother, an intellectually
curious woman, a generous friend, and a political wife who is
passionate about her causes, unpretentious in her style, and almost
devoid of personal ambition for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura is probably the most articulate of all in the Bush
family,'' said Ron Kaufman, the GOP committeeman from Massachusetts
who is close to the Bushes. ``And living with the governor,
witnessing what he has done in Texas, means she understands better
than anyone what compassionate conservatism means.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention marks a turning point for the 53-year-old Mrs.
Bush, who mostly traveled solo during the primary season, dutifully
speaking to GOP women's groups or showing up at elementary schools
to read to children.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as her 18-year-old twin daughters leave for college next
month, Mrs. Bush will begin campaigning alongside her husband, not
just to highlight first family values and her own expertise in
literacy and early-childhood education; aides believe George W. is
calmer, happier, and more focused when his unflappable wife is
around.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody downplays her role as a political adviser. Yet Mrs.
Bush tends to turn up at key moments _ she was in the kitchen on
July 3, for example, when the governor first broached the vice
presidency with Dick Cheney _ and friends say her husband, whom she
affectionately calls ``Bushie,'' confides in her and also relies
heavily on his wife to size up situations and measure character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura has always been someone George looks to for good
judgment,'' said Donald Evans, Bush's campaign chairman and one of
the couple's oldest friends. ``He knows that she makes the right
decisions for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Bush generally shuns the limelight, there's gushing
in the Bush campaign over her growth and poise in this campaign.
The truth is, between the many state and national races run by her
husband and father-in-law, she has been in training for this for
years. She spoke at the 1996 GOP convention in San Diego, and last
month she gave a spirited address to the Texas GOP convention in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't Laura's life,'' said Regan Gammon, who has been
Mrs. Bush's best friend since grade school, as well as her
companion on Grand Canyon and Yampa River raft trips and on the
bird-watching excursion to Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ``She married George Bush, the oilman, and has ended up here as
the partner and lifemate of the man running for president,'' Gammon
said. ``What could she say but `OK, here we go' and try to make it
a positive experience for herself and her children?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush jokes that both she and her husband broke their
prenuptial vows: He promised she would never have to give a
political speech, and she promised to exercise every day. (Aside
from the dip in the creek a few years ago and frequent long walks,
Mrs. Bush is ``one of the least athletic people I have ever
known,'' said Nancy Weiss, an old friend from Lubbock.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the teacher she was, Mrs. Bush does her homework. In an
interview late last year, Mrs. Bush said she learned a lot by
quietly observing Barbara Bush, but her mother-in-law never gave
her advice. ``Barbara Bush realized that daughters-in-law don't
want a lot of advice from their mothers-in-law,'' Laura Bush said.
``So I'm sure she had to bite her tongue pretty often.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the elder Bushes were delighted when their oldest son,
who was something of a playboy and no scholar, declared his love
for the 31-year-old Laura Welch, the pretty girl with sparkling
blue eyes and a master's degree in library science. In her memoir
Barbara Bush said she liked Laura because she didn't try to compete
with the others. Asked by one of the hyperkinetic Bushes to cite
her interests, Laura said: ``I read, I smoke, I admire.'' (She
stopped smoking years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But friends say it was the extrovert in Bush, the sense that
life with him might be exciting, that attracted Laura, a
self-described introvert. Both had grown up in Midland _ Mrs. Bush
was the only child of a prosperous home builder _ but they had not
met until mutual friends matched them up at a backyard barbecue in
1977. Their courtship was so intense and brief that Laura's parents
had to handwrite invitations to the wedding that followed three
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Friends always remark on Mrs. Bush's inner strength, something
that sustained and guided her when Bush's heavy drinking nearly
wrecked their marriage (she told him he had to stop); when a
serious case of toxemia complicated her pregnancy with the twins;
when her father, whom she adored, died in 1995; and when breast
cancer was diagnosed in both her mother and one of her closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   No one will say _ certainly not Mrs. Bush herself _ how a tragic
car accident in 1963 altered her life. When she was a senior in
high school, she ran a stop sign in a new Chevy and struck a car
driven by one of her classmates. The boy driving the other car was
killed; Mrs. Bush was slightly injured. There was no evidence of
drinking, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was shocked by the story when a supermarket tabloid
reported it recently; she said Mrs. Bush had never mentioned it in
the more than 20 years she had known her. ``It was such an acute
and painful thing in her young life,'' Weiss said. ``Once she got
over the grief, she put it away, and now she just won't go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting her own and the family's privacy has always been
paramount to Laura Bush. It has allowed her to lead a fairly normal
and independent life _ shopping at Home Depot, lunching out with
friends, wearing her favorite uniform of jeans and T-shirts. But it
also was the reason she was slow to jump on board the Bush
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a presidential race, there will be characterizations of you
that you know aren't true, and there will be rumors that are
absolutely not true, but there is no way you can prove they are not
true,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``That is something we knew we would have
to come to terms with, and so I think we accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she realized how being Texas' first lady could advance her
interests, Mrs. Bush accepted the role with gusto. She is the first
governor's wife to have an office in the state capitol _ albeit a
hard-to-find suite in the basement _ and the only one to have
achieved a major policy success. Last year the Texas Legislature
passed a bill she championed earmarking $17 million for Head Start
reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush discovered the power of her office allowed her to do
good and fulfill some of her career goals,'' said Margaret
LaMontagne, a senior adviser to the governor. ``We've seen a true
ramping up in her engagement and comfort with being an advocate.
But she never goes into enemy territory.''
</P>
<P>
   She has more causes than issues, and they aren't ones that bring
trouble. In addition to early childhood education, Mrs. Bush has
found official outlets for her cultural interests by promoting
Texas' writers and artists.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader with eclectic tastes (she just finished ``Gates
of the Alamo'' by Austin novelist Stephen Harrigan and is rereading
Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood''), Mrs. Bush organized the first
Texas Book Festival in 1996 to showcase the state's authors. Now a
must-do event that attracts thousands to the grounds of the state
Capitol one weekend each November, the festival has raised nearly
$1 million for Texas libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Carpenter, a dyed-in-the-wool Texas Democrat who got into
politics working for Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson, said Mrs. Bush's
projects and personality have made her ``beloved and appreciated''
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is someone who will stand by her husband and never
embarrass him, all the while doing her own thing,'' Carpenter, 80,
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, Laura is the most redeeming
feature of George Bush.''

CLINTON WOOS THE LAWYERS AND BLASTS GOP INACTION ON JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.Y., S.C.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton said Sunday that the Republican
majority in the Senate was purposely slowing down action on his
nominees to federal appeals courts and, in some cases, blocking
people solely because they are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of speeches before trial lawyers who are holding a
convention here, Clinton compared what he said was the Republicans'
refusal to consider some minority nominees to the 1986 vote in
Congress when Dick Cheney, now the Republican vice presidential
candidate, and other conservatives voted against a resolution
asking, among other things, that Nelson Mandela be released from
jail in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Cheney's vote on the Mandela resolution was so
amazing, ``it takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Mandela had managed to get out of jail and
helped transform South Africa despite that vote. ``I'm worried
about the people now whom I've tried to put on the court of appeals
who are African-American and Hispanic who are being held in
political jail because they can't get a hearing from this
Republican Senate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In complaining about the refusal of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to schedule a hearing on a Hispanic nominee from Texas,
Clinton also criticized Gov. George W. Bush for not supporting the
nominee to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republicans had refused to consider two black
nominees to the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va. Although the
circuit contains more black residents than any of the 11 regional
appeals courts, Clinton said, it has never had a black judge.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in election years, the party that controls the
Senate and not the White House, slows down the confirmation process
hoping to preserve judicial slots that carry lifetime tenure for
their own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to appear before the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America, the first president to do so since Lyndon B. Johnson in
1964, Clinton paid tribute to a group that has been one of the
Democratic Party's most reliable sources of campaign donations over
the last decade.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ At a time when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
sought to portray the Republican Party as increasingly moderate,
the majority of delegates assembling here Sunday to nominate him
for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit,
according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   On a host of important issues, from affirmative action to
environmental concerns to abortion, the poll found that delegates
stand significantly to the right of much of the nation, and even of
rank-and-file Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a majority of the 2,066 delegates described themselves
as somewhat or very conservative, and their views on a variety of
topics reflected that.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates by and large supported large tax cuts and school
vouchers, and oppose gun control, restrictions on trade,
environmental safeguards, abortion rights, prescription drug
subsidies for the elderly and campaign finance regulation. In one
notable example of the contrast between the delegates and
Republican voters, the Times/CBS poll found that fewer than half
the delegates said they supported mandatory child safety trigger
locks on guns, a measure that was supported by eight out of 10
registered Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has sought for much of this year to distinguish
himself from his party's conservative wing and history, most
delegates interviews Sunday viewed him as conservative, if not
necessarily as conservative as they considered themselves. They are
also, overwhelmingly, enthusiastic about the qualifications and
political skills of the man they will nominate for president on
Thursday night, and confident about his chances against Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has a conservative wing and a moderate wing and both
sides are comfortable with him,'' Eric Melgren, a delegate from
Kansas, said of Bush. ``Republicans are hungry enough that there
is, to at least some degree, things that all are willing to
overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding in the Times/CBS poll, as well as in follow-up
interviews conducted Sunday with delegates, suggested one of the
tasks Bush faces this week: convincing independents and moderate
Democrats, in particular, that his is the face of the Republican
Party, rather than of the delegates who will be celebrating his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of the delegates was conducted by The New York Times
and CBS News by telephone, mail, fax, e-mail and over the Internet
from June 26 through July 28. Of the 2,066 Republican delegates,
1,055 responded to the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates who began arriving here this weekend are, the poll
found, overwhelmingly white _ almost 90 percent _ and mostly male
and middle-age. By profession, they are more likely to be lawyers
and executives than teachers or farmers. They are relatively
wealthy: one in five put their net worth at $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in five said they belonged to the National Rifle
Association, and over half said they or someone in their house
owned a gun.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this campaign, Bush has sought to draw some distance
between himself and conservatives in the party _ and, it seems, he
has paid little price for that among the Republicans here. In
contrast to surveys of rank-and-file Republican voters, the poll of
the delegates found that they were more apt to describe Bush as
conservative. Indeed, in a tribute to Bush's political skills,
delegates who described themselves as moderate viewed Bush as one,
too, while self-described conservatives called him conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Buxton, a delegate from Maine who described herself as
moderate, offered this description of the governor on Sunday: ``I
see him as a moderate with some conservative areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But another delegate from Maine, Elaine Bridge, who described
herself as conservative, challenged the description almost as soon
as it left Buxton's mouth. ``I think he's a conservative,'' she
said. ``More so than his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, people who attend political conventions tend to be
more informed and more partisan, and past polls have noted similar
differences in views between the delegates and the public. Still,
this year's poll suggested a wide disparity between voters and
delegates at a time when Bush has been trying to pull the party to
the center as Republicans seek to win the White House for the
Republican Party, which has lost the last two presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a conservative party,'' Mike Davis, an alternate
delegate from South Carolina, said Sunday afternoon as he sat on a
bench outside Independence Hall. ``We want lower taxes. Less
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the prevailing national sentiment found in other
polls, the delegates said they believed that the nation's budget
surplus should go to cutting taxes, rather than assuring the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   They overwhelmingly opposed a ban on the kind of largely
unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money. They also
opposed a proposed plan to help make prescription drugs more
affordable to the elderly by having the federal government pay
subsidies to insurance companies, allowing insurers to pass the
cost savings along to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 delegates said they believed the federal
government was doing too much when it came to regulating the
environmental and safety practices of business.
</P>
<P>
   And the delegates were also more likely to support the death
penalty, and oppose life in prison without parole, as an
appropriate punishment for convicted murderers. Nearly 80 percent
of the delegates said their views on the death penalty had not been
changed by reports of people on death row who later were found to
be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delegates were overwhelmingly opposed to abortion
rights, only two in 10 said that Bush would consider the issue when
nominating judges to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Howard, 48, a California delegate, said that Bush's views of
government closely hewed to her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes in less government and more individual
responsibility,'' Howard said. ``He probably leans toward the
conservative side, but he's accepting of people and he doesn't
focus on areas where we disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush sees a lot of potential and wants to keep government out
of the way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reflecting the spirit of the occasion, the delegates
viewed Bush's candidacy with enthusiasm _ indeed, with more
enthusiasm than had been voiced by registered Republicans.
Forty-two percent of Bush's supporters across the nation said they
supported him with reservations. Only 4 percent of the delegates
said they felt the same way.

MCCAIN IS MAIN ATTRACTION AT SHADOW CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``If you like, I do not need to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words were spoken mid-address, and over loud jeers, by
none other than Arizona Senator John McCain Sunday, a man lately
unaccustomed to angry audiences.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the star attraction of the day at the Shadow
Convention, an alternative gathering organized by conservative
commentator Arianna Huffington, Common Cause, and other public
interest groups, to highlight issues they say the major parties
neglect: the corrupting influence of money in politics, growing
economic inequality, and the failing war on drugs. Despite McCain's
advocacy of sweeping campaign finance reform, this crowd, made up
of Republicans and liberals who believe the GOP to be the preserve
of the white middle class, were clearly no natural constituency for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The heckling from some in this diverse audience of 1,000 was so
loud at one point that the feisty war veteran, who seriously
challenged Texas Governor George W. Bush for the Republican
nomination, seemed willing to walk away from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the uproar? McCain's loyalty to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's devotion to his party, not to mention his new
admiration for Bush, was as unwelcome at the Shadow Convention as
his criticisms of the party establishment and his advocacy of major
campaign finance reform are at the Republican one, which begins
Monday. The senator has long inhabited a murky middle ground, with
members of the political establishment on one side and those who
abhor it on the other. Sunday's speech highlighted just how
difficult it has been for him to find a comfortable home with
either.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had clearly expected to find a more sympathetic audience
Sunday. And his speech began smoothly enough.
</P>
<P>
   His calls for ``a commitment to break the iron triangle of
money, lobbyists, and legislation,'' brought cheers from many in
the audience, some of whom carried signs that read ``No Stock
Options,'' ``The Rest of Us,'' and ``Disaffected.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mood shifted swiftly as McCained extolled the GOP and
Bush as the best avenues to reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in the audience clapped loudly, but they did not
drown out the first scattered boos, which gathered into a din when
McCain began defending his primary season nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obliged not by party loyalty, but by sincere conviction,
to urge all Americans to support my party's nominee, Governor
George Bush of Texas,'' McCain said. ``I think it is quite clear he
is the candidate who offers change and that the vice president is
the candidate of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes of that, and McCain was drowned out by cries of
``Get him off!'' and ``Gong! Gong! Gong!''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington finally walked onto the stage to quiet the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's event was to be the forum for McCain to say things that
would not have been welcome in his speech to the party faithful
Tuesday night. In his GOP convention speech, some of which has been
leaked by the Bush campaign, McCain will speak in broad terms of
Bush's worthiness as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will talk of ``the potential of America for
greatness,'' but not of campaign finance reform, the issue that
defined his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been negotiating delicate territory since he bowed
out of what was sometimes a bitter race for the Republican
nomination. He built his entire candidacy on the idea that he was
different from the establishment and said repeatedly that Bush
epitomized it.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he has all but reconciled with Bush _
personally, if not philosophically. Sunday, in an emotional
reception, he released his delegates to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing name tags that said ``Straight Talk Express,'' the
delegates shouted, ``We love you, John!'' at the close of the
senator's tearful thank-you speech.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the crowd were unwilling to accept the end. After
McCain announced that his delegates could vote officially for Bush,
Massachusetts delegate Arthur Larrivee of Dartmouth stalked out of
the room, disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see people draft him,'' Larrivee said.``I wanted a
real race.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the loyalty to McCain also showed when the local
delegates boarded a chartered train from Boston to Philadelphia and
learned they had to choose between two coinciding events: one with
GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney, the other with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For most the choice was easy: McCain.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived just in time for the bittersweet goodbye, and for a
few minutes face to face. That was good enough for delegate Spencer
Goldstein of Sudbury, an Air Force veteran who wore his American
Legion cap all day. He walked away with what he wanted: McCain's
autograph on a photo of him standing next to his pickup, which was
decorated in McCain signs and red, white, and blue bunting. He left
a copy of the picture for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little upset, but John is, if nothing else, a good
military man,'' Goldstein said, noting that he was ready to do his
duty and nominate Bush.

A DAUGHTER OF GRAHAM IS TO ADDRESS EVANGELISTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Tenn., Texas, Ga., Calif.)  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ When the Rev. Billy Graham wanted to
call attention to another religious figure not long ago, he took
the relatively rare step among evangelists of singling out a woman:
the second of his three daughters, Anne Graham Lotz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what he said, that I'm the best preacher in the
family,'' Lotz said in an interview here, where she will be one of
only two women to address a convention on Monday of 10,000
evangelists, overwhelmingly men, being sponsored this week by
Graham's organization. ``I take that as my father's blessing on me,
as my father's blessing on my ministry. And I'm humbled by it, and
very grateful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotz, 52, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., does not have the public
profile of her 48-year-old brother, Franklin, the designated
successor to their father as the head of the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association. But she has gained increasing visibility
among evangelical Christians. She arrived here from England, where
she had been the first woman in at least a century to speak to an
annual Bible conference that draws thousands of British
evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places I go, I'm the first woman,'' she said. ``And I
would pray that they're not inviting me because I'm a woman, but
because of the message I bring.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of evangelical Christianity is geographically broad
and can be ideologically diverse. But there is widespread
resistance to the suggestion that Scripture might allow men and
women an equal religious authority. In June, the Southern Baptist
Convention revised its statement of faith to declare that the Bible
does not permit a woman to serve as senior pastor of a church.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz does not challenge that. ``For myself,'' she said, ``I feel
God has forbidden me to be ordained or be a senior pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she calls herself a Bible teacher, and in that capacity
she can draw a crowd. As the head of a small organization, AnGeL
Ministries (the name incorporates her initials), she began this
year to lead a series of two-day events called ``Just Give Me
Jesus'' in arenas across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The events are smaller than her father's ``crusades,'' which run
for three or four days each, can draw upward of 100,000 people and
are intended to convert people.
</P>
<P>
   Her events, she said, are intended to inspire born-again
Christians to make a new commitment to their faith. By her
estimate, 25,000 attended the first one, in April in Knoxville,
Tenn. The next month, she spoke in a Fort Worth arena. Events are
also planned this year for cities including Atlanta and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The events were at least partly inspired by recent experiences,
she said. During the past two years, a fire destroyed the building
where her husband, Dan, a dentist, had long had his office; her
three children married within eight months; her mother, Ruth
Graham, has been hospitalized several times and undergone hip
replacement surgery; and her father, 81, also has been ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was difficult being Billy Graham's daughter, she
said no, and called him the best preacher around. ``It's harder to
be Ruth Graham's daughter,'' Lotz said with a laugh. She listed her
mother's accomplishments: ``A very spiritual, very intellectual''
woman who paints, reads, knows music and talks easily with people.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she herself is conscious of breaking gender
barriers, Lotz said: ``Oh, sure. But that's not my goal.'' She said
her goal was not to put women in ministry, but rather to ``set a
high standard for presenting Bible teaching. In the end, it
shouldn't matter if it's a man or a woman giving a message.''

IBM CHIEF RECALLS DIFFICULT DAYS  
 ALLTEL EXPANDS TO LOUISIANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In hindsight, success tends to look easy, even predictable.
That's as true in business as it is in sports, politics or other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things often look decidedly more unnerving from the vantage
point of the executive on the firing line. The company might just
as easily perish as prosper.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview last week, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the
chairman of IBM, talked mostly about a management reorganization
that the company announced on Monday. But Gerstner, who is often
portrayed as blunt, gruff and seemingly arrogant, also candidly
described his early, uncertain days at IBM _ when he arrived as an
outsider suddenly in charge of a corporation that was both an
American icon and a business in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After he took over in 1993, Gerstner ran the company for over a
year in a style he called ``survival mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to cut $9 billion a year in expenses. We had to bring
the company back, literally, from the brink of death. We had to
deal with cultural and personal tragedies that resulted. And we had
to reassert that we were for real in the marketplace. That was a
very centralized, personalized leadership and organizational style.
It was focused on the short term, and it was very intuitive. There
wasn't a lot of time to study things. There was not a lot of time
to debate things.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was a benevolent dictatorship with me as the dictator
and hoping _ just hoping _ that I was getting some good advice from
my colleagues who knew a heck of a lot more about IBM and this
industry than I would ever know.''

   Alltel Expands to Louisiana
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., the United States' fifth-largest wireless
communications carrier, is expected to announce Monday the
acquisition of wireless operations in Louisiana from SBC
Communications for about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Alltel, which is based in Little Rock,
Ark., expects to gain about 165,000 wireless customers and 300,000
paging customers in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The transaction
also includes rural services in Iberville, St. James and
Plaquemines parishes.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is selling the properties to eliminate overlap resulting
from the linking of its wireless operations with BellSouth's.
Alltel, which already has about 6 million wireless subscribers in
22 states, is trying to expand its presence along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some other companies in this industry we're interested
in buying and not being bought,'' Joe Ford, Alltel's chief
executive, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wireless industry in the United States has been
gripped by acquisition fever, most recently with Deutsche Telekom's
planned acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Corp. for over $50
billion, which was announced last week. But Alltel, larger than
VoiceStream though still a relatively small wireless player, has
been strangely absent from the speculative talk on which wireless
companies will be the next takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, companies like Nextel Communications, of Reston, Va., a
provider of wireless services for corporate customers, and
Powertel, a consumer-oriented wireless company based in Statesboro,
Ga., have been mentioned as likelier consolidation candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That may reflect the low profile of Alltel, which has made more
than 250 landline and wireless acquisitions since it began as a
local telephone company in Arkansas in 1947. The company has
typically focused on rural areas and relatively small metropolitan
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is looking at wireless now, but we've been in
this business for a long time now,'' said Ford. ``We're happy to
keep blending together other companies into our own because that's
just what we do.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Sunday turned out to be a day to kick the tires,
check the oil and generally make sure that everything was ready for
the Big Event _ and to see how many times on how many channels Dick
Cheney could be asked the same half-dozen questions before he would
reach over and strangle his interrogator with his mike cord.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the World Wide Web sites threatening round-the-clock
coverage of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia
had not yet begun streaming, but the Sunday morning talk shows were
filled with nothing else _ and already there was not an hour in the
day when some sort of convention-related snippet could not be found
on one or another television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, you know, is home to cheese steaks. Its downtown
has had a major renaissance. Under Democrats! Cheese steaks are
made with thinly sliced rib-eye and served either with or without
onions. The first televised presidential convention was also held
in Philadelphia, 52 years ago. And now, the city is host to the
first convention to be given the full Internet treatment. This
point was made several times, on several channels. Indeed, a whole
new press area has been set up for Web journalists. It is being
called ``Internet Alley.'' Tours were available on at least two
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's vice presidential choice, Cheney, was on
NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' ABC's ``This
Week,'' ``Fox News Sunday'' and CNN's ``Late Edition with Wolf
Blitzer'' (which bills itself as ``the last word in Sunday talk,''
would that it were true).
</P>
<P>
   Displaying none of the puppy dog enthusiasm that former Vice
President Dan Quayle exhibited when chosen by Bush's father in
1988, Cheney was an ostentatiously subdued presence during his
marathon of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   On Fox, he described President Clinton as an ``enormous
embarrassment to the country,'' who was also a ``tragic figure''
with fundamental flaws. This was about as close to controversy as
Cheney allowed himself to get. He complained about being
interrogated about congressional votes he had cast two decades ago
_ opposing bans on plastic guns, against the Clean Water Act, etc.
_ and said it was all part of a Democratic plan to demonize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the sort of thing we've seen in the Gore
campaign,'' Cheney told the host of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Tim
Russert. ``Attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet the Press'' had the Democratic strategist James Carville
and the Republican strategist Bill Bennett to kick things around.
Bennett said that the all-but-crowned Democratic nominee, Vice
President Al Gore, had been exhibiting ``several personalities'' in
recent months, including ``affable Al'' and ``Uncle Al the Kiddies'
Pal,'' none of which were catching on with voters. Unfair, Carville
said, ``the vice president has not yet had a chance to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' they went with a tag-team format. First, Sam
Donaldson did a semi-aggressive number on Cheney, to little effect.
``So far, I am not bleeding from any part of my body,'' Cheney
observed. Then, Cokie Roberts was ingratiating and chatty with
Lynne Cheney, the candidate's wife, who got her back up when the
questions turned to the sexual orientation of one of their
daughters. ``I am appalled at the media interest in my two
daughters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face the Nation'' had what it called an ``exclusive'' talk
with Sen. John McCain, Bush's chief primary opponent (although
McCain had already been heard from on Sunday morning's edition of
``Today'').
</P>
<P>
   Some had wondered, somewhat optimistically, whether McCain would
enliven the otherwise cut-and-dried convention by saying something
intemperate, but he made it clear he would be a good boy. ``Gov.
Bush has been running exactly the sort of campaign I would be
running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest display of emotion came during ``Late Edition,''
when Democratic strategist Robert Shrum and former Republican party
chief Haley Barbour took off after each other. For a few moments,
there was such partisan rancor that it was like a blast from a
previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, even the Internet offered little escape from
drama-free reasonableness. The party's official convention site,
www.gopconvention.com, included such items as a ``Test Your GOP
IQ'' quiz _ How many times has the party met in Philadelphia? Six _
and a discussion of how the ``convention experience'' has changed
since Republicans were last in Philadelphia in 1948. (''One of the
biggest changes: The first-ever free shuttle service for convention
participants.'')
</P>
<P>
   Another section, marked ``Why conventions?'' could be bookmarked
for later in the week, when it may come in handy. There was also an
advertisement that said ``Ask for GOP rates at aruba-rentals.com,''
and a secure online connection for those wishing to make immediate
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   On C-SPAN, one segment included a woman using a felt pen and a
map to show exactly where each of the delegations would be sitting
on the convention floor, one by one. Later, Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News, showed up to take calls from C-SPAN viewers.
Had Cheney appeared on CBS that morning, he was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, a little ruefully. ``Everywhere.''

JOHNSON STAYS WITH PARK TOO LONG IN DODGERS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When management points the finger at the manager
and questions the strategic style in which games are played, every
move seems to have a little more relevance, either in reality or
just in one's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The moves that work are passed over, the decisions made when a
team wins 10 of 14 aren't questioned. But when a one-run loss is
the subject, look out.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, sultry East Coast kind of humid day, right-hander Chan
Ho Park may have overstayed his outing by one batter and walked in
the eventual game-winning run in the seventh inning of Sunday's 3-2
Los Angeles Dodgers loss to Philadelphia at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And in the ninth inning, after Dave Hansen led off with a walk
against erratic Phillies right-handed closer Jeff Brantley, manager
Davey Johnson elected to go with left-handed power rather than bunt
over pinch-runner Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitters Chris Donnels and Todd Hundley, both with home run
power, lined out and switch-hitter Devon White was called out on
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In losing two out of three to the last-place Phillies, the
Dodgers had 17 hits and scored four runs. It came after the Dodgers
had 20 hits and scored 16 runs in a Thursday win at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Both situations, it seems, are fair game considering the
backdrop that's painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about bunting him over, but the way we've been
hitting, I said, `I better wish for just one big fly rather than
try to bunch a couple hits to get the lead,' '', Johnson said. ``I
had the right people up. Certainly, I could have bunted him over,
but Brantley's not a threat to throw a double play. He's a fly-ball
guy, and I have some guys who can take it out of the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Baseball suggests playing for the win on the road
and a tie at home, but sometimes Johnson doesn't mind throwing that
away and winging it.
</P>
<P>
   This time Johnson stuck to the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play for a tie on the road at times, but not very
often,'' Johnson said. ``If I had some guys that couldn't take
(Brantley) out of the yard right behind him with a man on. ... But
four hits, it's not a lot of offense.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the issue of Park, weary from an 81-degree day,
though the temperature wasn't reflective of the mugginess brought
on by the suffocating humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who had won two straight, began tiring in the seventh
inning. He allowed a leadoff single to pitcher Randy Wolf, who was
stranded on second with two outs. However, Park (11-8) walked the
next three batters, including Pat Burrell on four pitches with the
bases loaded. Johnson said he wanted to stay with Park because he
pitched well to that point and deserved to be a part of the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I'm tired, it was just mistake pitches,'' said
Park, who threw 12 balls in his final 14 pitches. ``It was hot, but
that's OK. I didn't think I was tired, just missed pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros said the heat was the worst it's been
at any point this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get fatigued a little quicker,'' Karros said. ``I was
talking to their first-base coach (Brad Mills) and he said this was
easily the hottest day of the year, and they were fortunate to what
they had weather-wise up to this point. You could see before the
game the heat coming off the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the Dodgers win. everything is nice. But on days
in which they lose close games, contemplation and explanation are
needed especially since Dodgers managing general partner and CEO
Bob Daly and general manager Kevin Malone stated the club needed to
do more of the little things in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Laying down more sacrifice bunts was one of the points
mentioned, though it's obviously subjective and the merits can be
debated case by case.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, an El Camino Real High of Woodland Hills product, capped a
masterful pitching weekend by the Phillies as the Dodgers lost a
series for the first time in five tries. He allowed four hits and
two runs, both coming on Chad Kreuter's two-run bases loaded single
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of games here are the ones that sneak up and bite
you on the butt at the end of the year,'' Hundley said.
``Hopefully, these won't. We don't want them. These guys and the
freakin' Marlins, man.''

A JOURNALIST MOVES ON AFTER 29 WRENCHING, ACCIDENTAL YEARS IN
CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 By CRAIG SMITH     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Standing in the late afternoon light of his near-empty
apartment, Jaime FlorCruz rolls up a massive Qing Dynasty-era map
of this city that for 29 years has been successively his refuge,
his effective prison and his home. At long last, he is moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother agonized about waking me up that morning,'' says
Time magazine's bureau chief of the August day in 1971 when he flew
from Manila to Hong Kong and then crossed by train into China for
what was to have been a three-week tour. She had an inkling that
something might go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Something did. The longhaired, bell-bottomed FlorCruz, a
well-known student advocate during the waning days of Philippine
democracy under President Ferdinand Marcos' increasingly
authoritarian rule, had been invited to see China by the Chinese
Friendship Association _ an illegal journey under Philippine law at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   While FlorCruz visited Mao Zedong's revolutionary redoubt amid
the caves of northern Shaanxi Province, Marcos suspended the writ
of habeas corpus, allowing Philippine security forces to imprison
political opponents without presenting them for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people disappeared, some never to be seen again.
FlorCruz was on Marcos' list of enemies. As a result, he did not
leave China again for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   At first he did not dare leave. Then he could not leave. And at
last, he did not want to leave, having married, had children and
built a career as a journalist here. The soft-spoken FlorCruz, 49,
watched the country emerge from Cultural Revolution fanaticism to
the brutal pragmatism of the post-Tiananmen Square protest era and
became a well-known fixture in Beijing's expatriate community.
</P>
<P>
   He covered the trials of Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, and the rest
of the tyrannical Gang of Four, and he covered the Tiananmen Square
student protests that ended in bloodshed in 1989. Under his watch,
Time broke the story of Jiang Qing's suicide in 1991. He
interviewed Jiang Zemin when he was Shanghai's mayor, and again
after he had become the nation's president.
</P>
<P>
   But FlorCruz has finally had his fill. He says he has reached
the point ``where I can almost write the story without doing any
reporting, and so it is time to go.'' He will spend a year in New
York on an Edward R. Murrow Press Fellowship at the Council on
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   FlorCruz recounted how his early naivete gradually gave way to
cynicism toward the Communist Party. But he showed, too, that he
has retained a remarkable optimism about the country that became
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm conscious of the need to maintain a distance from
politics, to try not to let it color my views,'' he said. ``Just
about any change is an improvement from where I started.''
</P>
<P>
   His hosts brought him and his friends to Beijing nearly three
decades ago, installing them in a small hotel near the heart of the
city. His punishment was mind-numbing boredom. He did not speak or
read Chinese. He and his group soon exhausted the supply of tourist
sites, and they were not otherwise allowed to leave the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says his enthusiasm for the New China was undaunted.
``We blamed everything on Marcos,'' FlorCruz said, his face older,
his hair shorter, but otherwise little changed in appearance from
those days. ``We were still very high on China _ we had that
wide-eyed, gee-whiz attitude,'' he added from behind his new,
owlish eyeglasses. ``There were no flies! The cops didn't carry
guns!''
</P>
<P>
   But the group had little idea how turbulent the times were. Mao
Zedong's anointed heir, Lin Biao, was in power when they arrived,
but gone a month later. FlorCruz remembers being told that Lin was
killed in a plane crash. (Many people today believe he was shot
down while fleeing to the Soviet Union after staging an aborted
coup.) Soon, FlorCruz realized that he and his friends were the
only ones still toting Mao's little red book and that many people
had stopped wearing the Mao pins that had been so ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   The group agreed to go work in the countryside along with
millions of urban Chinese following Mao's exhortation to bridge the
gap between intellectuals and peasants. FlorCruz and his friends
were sent to Mao's home province of Hunan. The work was
backbreaking but occupied the mind.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he and his friends returned to Beijing in mid-1972,
Marcos had declared martial law, making their repatriation even
riskier. FlorCruz's passport expired the next year, leaving him
stateless in China.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on a Yellow Sea trawler shoveling fish, enrolled in a
language school and later earned a degree in Chinese history at
Beijing University. He watched the nation convulse when Mao died in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 the Philippine Embassy finally issued him a new passport
and he visited home. But by then he had a life in China, where he
had started working as a reporter for Newsweek and later Time
magazine. After the 1989 massacre, Time helped secure him a visa to
the United States in case the bureau needed to be evacuated. He was
made Times bureau chief the next year.
</P>
<P>
   From the black vinyl sofa that is about the only furniture left
in his Beijing home, FlorCruz summed up how he feels about all that
has happened since his mother woke him on that morning 29 years
ago: ``It's like a dream.''

DODGERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As the minutes until today's 1 p.m. trading
deadline tick down, Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone is experiencing even more frustration this season than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Already unable to come up with a starting pitcher the magnitude
of Andy Ashby, Curt Schilling or Denny Neagle because of limited
prospects in the minors, thus having to settle for Ismael Valdes,
the Dodgers are also coming up short in their bid to find a marquee
bench player or a left-hander for the bullpen as the deadline
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking to people,'' Malone said. ``What's good.
Who are we going to replace? You're looking around to see who you
can replace. There's definitely no position players available.
We're not looking for a starting pitcher. We're always looking to
get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers continue to run into the same problem when
Malone tries to engage in serious talks. Either he's told the
Dodgers don't have the firepower to make a huge move, or clubs are
asking for the Dodgers' top prospects at the lower minor-league
levels when the Dodgers inquire about bench help or speed for pinch
running.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case when the Dodgers talked to the Colorado
Rockies about reacquiring right-handed starter Pedro Astacio before
settling on Valdes, baseball sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of clubs don't like our prospects,'' Malone said. ``It's
a little frustrating at times when people tell you that you don't
have enough. It's different from last year. We weren't in the same
position (last season) as we are this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocket's debut: Valdes, nicknamed ``Rocket,'' makes his debut
five days after being acquired by the Dodgers from the Chicago
Cubs. And while his reputation is that of someone not fighting
through adverse times, which the club roundly criticized him for a
year ago, expectations are high that he'll pitch well, despite a
2-4 mark and 5.37 ERA in 12 starts with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember him having a lot of bad starts,'' Johnson
said. ``I know he can pitch, and I know circumstances, injuries,
dealing with another club, I know how all those things can affect
your performance. I know he was happy here, and I expect him to
pitch good, not just (today), but from here on in.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Playing three games in Philadelphia and three
more in Pittsburgh on artificial turf concerns Johnson some,
particularly the left knee of center fielder Devon White. White has
fluid on the knee, which he doesn't think will be a problem, but
Johnson will watch it closely. However, White, who returned a week
ago after missing 71 games with a partially torn left rotator cuff,
did start the series finale against the Phillies. ... After getting
two hits Saturday, Shawn Green went 0 for 3 with a walk and two
strikeouts and is 4 for 27 (.148) on the road trip.

WHITMAN IS ONSTAGE, BUT HER ROLE IS LESSENED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ For Gov. Christie Whitman, the contrast to four
years ago could not have been more stark.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the New Jersey governor was to take center stage
at the ``Welcome America'' festivities here. And alongside Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, was to throw a switch lighting the Ben
Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   With that, before the Republican National Convention had even
begun, Whitman's official duties for the week would be done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Whitman was on Bob Dole's short list of potential
running mates. This year, as Whitman has had to acknowledge in one
interview after another, she wasn't even asked to submit personal
background material to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 she was thought of as an eventual presidential candidate
in her own right. Now, if Bush wins, Whitman's prospects are widely
seen as limited to a Cabinet post, at best, or maybe an
ambassadorship _ the political equivalent of being put out to
pasture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Convention in San Diego four years
ago, Whitman, who shared leadership duties with Bush, was on stage
every night. She delivered a prime-time speech, and she was mobbed
by autograph seekers wherever she went. Now, the only people
following Whitman around are her state police bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's stature has been on the decline since 1997, when she
vetoed a ban on the late-term abortion procedure that its opponents
call partial-birth abortion, though it had been passed by both
Republican-controlled houses of the state Legislature. That an
appellate court just last week overturned the ban, passed after the
Legislature overrode her veto, would prove small consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sealed her political future,'' said John Tomicki, a
lobbyist for right-wing causes in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Whitman, despite her national celebrity,
failed to win a majority of the votes in her re-election bid, and
barely squeaked past her Democratic challenger, James McGreevey,
the little-known mayor of Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the governor's national image has been marred by
the controversy over racial profiling by state troopers. And her
political potency within New Jersey was called into question once
again when she abruptly canceled a run for the Senate last fall,
saying the burden of raising money was too great.
</P>
<P>
   By this year, even Whitman's most ardent supporters held little
hope that she would be given a spot on the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd become the bete noire of the pro-life movement,'' said
former Rep. Dick Zimmer, a Republican running to recapture the 12th
District seat from Rep. Rush Holt. ``So that even if Governor Bush
were inclined to choose a pro-choice running mate, it probably
wouldn't have been her.''
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of Whitman here lamented the storm of criticism she
endured this month after a snapshot surfaced showing her grinning
as she frisked a black man, apparently at the urging of a state
trooper, while on a ride-along in Camden in 1996. ``It's one of the
most unfair things in politics I've ever seen,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   At least there were no ``I'm frisky for Christie'' buttons for
sale among the hundreds with Bush's smiling face. But the image
seemed to hover like a too-obvious punch line upon any mention of
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyes rolled, for example, when the governor told New Jersey
delegates on Saturday that Sunday night's festivities on the Camden
waterfront _ the only part of the city that has been rebuilt _
would ``show off the kind of good things that happen when
Republicans get involved in cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Whitman, 53, is doing her best to sound content with her
role at this convention, and to appear relevant. She tried hard in
several early interviews to pump up the Republican ticket, minimize
the importance of its platform and change the subject from her
party's opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   During the convention, the governor noted, she will be appearing
on more than 20 television programs. And she says she takes solace
from her continued cachet as a talking head.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having been the co-chair, to then speak on Monday
afternoon at 3:30 holds no great attraction,'' Whitman said. ``If
you're not speaking in prime time, it's better to do the kinds of
things I'm doing. And the fact that they've asked me to do so much
of that is, to me, an indication that there's still something that
goes along with my name.''

   Phone Workers Threaten A Strike Against Verizon
</P>
<P>
   In what would be one of the biggest strikes in a decade, 85,000
telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening to walk out
next weekend in a struggle that pits old-line labor against the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are facing off with Verizon Communications _ the
name that Bell Atlantic adopted last month after acquiring GTE _ in
large part because they fear the company's widespread use of lower
paid, nonunion workers in its fastest growing businesses, most
notably wireless phones, will endanger the wages and benefits of
unionized workers.

<P>
   Auto Parts Industry Fights Back
</P>
<P>
   After several big auto insurers stopped requiring body shops to
use lower-priced generic car parts because of lawsuits, sales in
the $1.5 billion business plunged by 30 percent. Now, the generic
parts industry is fighting back, starting with a lawsuit in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Stocks Rise
</P>
<P>
   Good earnings reports for some of the biggest names in
commercial insurance suggested that long-depressed prices for
coverage were beginning to rise, and investors lifted the shares of
several big insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Report on Organic Food Challenged
</P>
<P>
   A report by the ABC correspondent John Stossel on ``20/20'' in
February cited research that showed organic food seemed more likely
than conventional food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He
also said that conventional produce did not necessarily have more
pesticide residue than organic produce. But the researchers who
were hired to do the testing said they never tested for pesticide
residue. And ABC executives are looking into whether the statement
about produce was made without any basis in fact.

<P>
   A Glimpse of the Graphic Future
</P>
<P>
   At the Siggraph convention, the most important annual gathering
for computer graphics and interactive technologies, the biggest

prototypes from emerging technologies.

   New Landscape for Bay Area Papers

Bay Area.

   Lack of Data in Deal for Seagram
</P>
<P>
   Since Vivendi announced that it was buying Seagram for $34
billion, many analysts are still trying to figure out what Vivendi
is up to with Seagram. And their puzzlement has made them reluctant
to offer investors guidance, which has translated into a listless
Seagram share price. Market Place.

   Gerstner on Early Days at IBM
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of IBM,
candidly described his early, uncertain days at the company _ when
he arrived as an outsider suddenly in charge of a corporation that
was both an American icon and in deep trouble. Gerstner, who took
over in 1993, ran the company for more than a year in a style he
called ``survival mode'' as a benevolent dictator.  &QL;

   Dot-Com Recruiting Woes
</P>
<P>
   For dot-com companies, the number of available workers has
grown, but as employees jump off sinking ships or swim away from
ones already capsized, they are being much more selective about
where they dock next. Instead of stock options and promises of
revolution, employees now want two things from prospective
employers: a good salary and good prospects for corporate
longevity.

IN PHILADELPHIA, CONVENTION PROTESTERS STIR UP MOSTLY NOSTALGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Devotees of lively political protest, a fading
art in recent decades, had something to cheer for and against on
Sunday as an eclectic, ragtag assortment of causes snaked and
howled through the heart of this city, giving pause to Republican
conventioneers intent on decorum.
</P>
<P>
   A rich assortment of several thousand dissenters _ all of them
orderly, many rambunctious _ dominated the eve of the convention as
marchers consciously sought to revive some old-time 60s rhythms and
jingles, but with strategic updating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho!'' began one group, a generation removed from
the old ``LBJ'' punchline, who bellowed a coda edited for current
events: ``HMO has got to go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we want?'' came one marching question. And the answer
(``Freedom!'' in the old days) came back: ``Health care!''
</P>
<P>
   For all the altered stakes, veteran witnesses of the antiwar
demonstrations of the 60s felt a pang of nostalgia. Particularly
when guerrilla-theater demonstrators capered past with large
papier-mache heads of piggish plutocrats and Darth Vader
caricatures of politicians. Chanting denunciations of corporate
wealth and the two-party system, they happily rose to the bait of a
few fundamentalist Christian counterdemonstrators lobbing bullhorn
taunts from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, environmentalists, get a life!'' boomed John Franklin,
wielding a printed billboard that judgment day was near. ``God will
take care of the trees, then he'll take care of you on the Last
Day, for all the clear-cutting of babies,'' he said mixing the
abortion issue in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers offered as good as they got, several offering an
obscene blend of gesture and advice. Franklin, a 58-year-old
veteran of varied 60s protests, admitted later in an interview:
``At least the kids are trying, scratching away, although they
don't quite have it. It's like watching a cartoon, but it's
nostalgic. They're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Arms outstretched, Michelle Christedes, intervened as a peaceful
parade monitor between the caustic Franklin and an unshaven young
man in a sundress who drew tension-tinged laughter by impishly
shouting contentions about the sexuality of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace was maintained. Other causes strutted by:
opposition to the death penalty, to sweat shops, to the antimissile
defense movement and a score more, many of them clearly pressed by
crowds of galvanized young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for them a long time,'' said Christedes, a
53-year-old psychology consultant who said she felt some of the
fury and swagger of her youth, during which she marched against the
Vietnam war as a doctoral candidate at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old me-generation sold out,'' she said, hoping for better.
Not all the evidence was encouraging. One young man, dressed
melodramatically in the black garb and red bandana of the
self-styled anarchists, brandished a bottle of Gatorade and a cell
phone on his way to the rhetorical ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   Safely beyond all sight and sound of the demonstrators, Rand S.
Larson, a convention delegate, sipped a rum and diet cola at the
poshest new oasis in town, the Ritz-Carlton bar that just opened in
a palatial six-story marble bank building on Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen any of the protest,'' said Larson, a first-time
delegate from Richmond, Vt., who sported a bright ``VIP'' tag atop
his necklace of credentials. ``I don't really fear any trouble from
the demonstrators although my wife and 11-year-old son are coming
down and I hope they have a good, safe time,'' he said. He savored
his drink after working for days to tamp down dissension as a
member of the party platform committee. ``We dealt with all the
right issues in a climate of respect,'' he insisted of the
platform, smooth as a runway for the candidates' landing.
</P>
<P>
   As a man strolled past the bar with one of the day's least
contentious T-shirts (``Dartmouth Fall Foliage Squash
Tournament''), the Ritz's Sunday brunchers seemed all gentled-out
and ready to convene, far removed from the dissenting crowd on the
other side of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside, however, Joe Bramante, a free-lance Democrat from
Derry, N.H., greeted delegates with a big, bluff hello, then asked,
``So, how's the economy?'' Before Republicans could answer,
Bramante spun a hand-printed sign on its stanchion: ``I am Bill
Clinton's Number One Fan!'' And he told each of them about the
booming economy as they sought escape.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east in the city, tourists approaching the Liberty Bell
were distracted by a display of hundreds of pairs of shoes lined up
as part of the Silent March demonstration, the empty shoes
representing the thousands killed annually with handguns. A
barefoot, grandmotherly woman walked stolidly past, bearing her own
printed protest: ``Too angry, too female to vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's larger march of dissenters presented a gathering of
various causes, from NOW to the NAACP, from folk-singing unionists
to animals rights demonstrators, under an umbrella label called
Unity 2000. Some self-proclaimed student anarchists marched amiably
with the larger parade, but they have hinted they may try to act up
by midweek with some hit-and-run street initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far so good,'' said Police Commissioner John F. Timoney,
who has been darting between demonstrations as a member of the
police bike patrol in helmet, shorts, and monogrammed ``P.C.''
shirt. ``But it's early and you never get cocky,'' he said, noting
other potentially more troublesome marches begin on Monday. ``We
can work out deals, even if we don't quite like the deals,'' the
commissioner said in emphasizing flexibility as his chief weapon
for getting through convention week.
</P>
<P>
   This was demonstrated on Saturday evening as the police quickly
put aside confrontation and became escorts of an ad hoc march of
200 teen-agers who showed up on Chestnut Street loudly devoted to
the cause of virginity. ``Free sex kills!'' they warned. ``Honk if
you're a virgin!'' they pleaded as restaurantgoers stared from
sidewalk cafes for a passing moment before turning back to their
food.

GENERIC CAR PARTS MAKERS FIGHTING BACK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Calif.)  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing a court battle over replacement parts for damaged
cars last October, State Farm Insurance stopped requiring body
shops to use lower-priced generic car parts. And the companies that
supply these parts went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Several other big auto insurers, facing their own lawsuits,
followed State Farm's lead, and sales in the $1.5 billion generic
car parts business plunged by 30 percent. Some small suppliers even
went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the generic parts industry is fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed Thursday in state superior court in Fresno,
Calif., a local company that distributes generic parts statewide
and that is backed by the industry's trade group, the Auto Body
Parts Association, is asking that the Illinois decision against
State Farm be declared invalid in California.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald S. Katz, the lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of the
Fresno company, Collision Parts Network, argues that California law
specifically permits insurers to use generic replacement parts and
that an Illinois court lacks the authority to countermand
California law. He also raises several procedural questions that he
says undermine the class action suit in Illinois, in which State
Farm was ordered to pay a $1.2 billion judgment.
</P>
<P>
   If the California court accepts its argument, the Auto Body
Parts Association says it plans to try to undo the Illinois ruling
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Littleton, one of the lawyers in the original State
Farm case, said she thought there was little chance the challenge
would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute over whether generic parts can be used, she
said; in most states, they can. But in California and most other
states, she said, the generic parts must be of ``like kind and
quality'' to those that are being replaced. The main issue with
State Farm, she said, was that the company had promised in its
policy contracts to meet this standard.
</P>
<P>
   The court and jury decided that the generic parts, sometimes
referred to as aftermarket or OEM _ for original equipment
manufacturer _ parts, were inferior to original factory parts and
that State Farm had breached its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court in Illinois is not telling the other states what to
do,'' Littleton said. ``It just said that State Farm lied and that
that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So the California challenge, sets the stage for a re-run of the
Illinois case and its debate over quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying these parts can be as good and that they are as
good and that they often come off the same assembly line as OEM
parts,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   That has been State Farm's contention all along. State Farm says
it uses generic parts because they are indistinguishable from
others, and their lower cost has enabled State Farm to keep
premiums from soaring. A number of consumer advocates, including
Ralph Nader, have sided with State Farm, saying that without
generic parts, the auto manufacturers would have a monopoly on
replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   The price difference is substantial. Ford charges $192 for a
fender for a 1995 Explorer; the generic fender costs $79. State
Farm and other insurers say that to assemble a 1997 Ford Taurus
from factory spare parts would cost $72,000. The cost of the car
new was $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   To restrain costs, New York, Massachusetts and Hawaii encourage
or require the use of generic parts. But the lawyers suing State
Farm say that, until now, the states have simply assumed high
quality. In fact, the lawyers say, generic parts often do not fit
right and can reduce the appearance, functioning and resale value
of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton and her colleagues in the State Farm case have filed
additional suits on similar grounds against eight other insurers:
Allstate, Safeco, USAA, Liberty Mutual, Geico, Farmers, Progressive
and Country Companies, which has a significant share of the auto
insurance market in Illinois. The lawyers have also filed a second
suit against State Farm to cover customers whose cars were repaired
with generic parts since early 1998, the cut-off date for customers
to be included in the original suit.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm filed papers on an appeal of last October's ruling in
May, said Dave Hurst, a spokesman. The response from the opponents
is due next Friday. The two sides are expected to face off in
Illinois' 5th District Court of Appeals in Mount Vernon, near St.
Louis, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Until the State Farm decision, said Scot Hansen, the owner of
the generic parts company in whose name the new suit is being
brought, ``business was going gang busters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``we began to see a downturn. We had a lot of
calls from body shops asking us to pick up these parts and give
back their money. Some of the insured wanted parts already
installed on their vehicles replaced. Basically, the market
evaporated.''

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: EX-MAYOR HAS DIVIDED LOYALTIES; A LITERAL
SETBACK FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE; HUFFINGTON STAGES A PEP RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Rendell is trying to wear two hats. Two party hats, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The former Democratic mayor of Philadelphia is the man who
successfully lobbied the Republicans to hold their convention in
his city. He even promised Jim Nicholson, the Republican National
Committee chairman, that he would wear an elephant tie every day of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before he was named Democratic National Committee
general chairman last January. So when Rendell appeared with
Nicholson at a panel discussion on convention media coverage at
City Hall on Sunday, he wasn't wearing the tie. But Rendell said he
would put it on for the official beginning of the convention on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he was the ebullient tour guide, plying his guest
with (what else?) Philly cheese steaks. ``This is great!'' he said.
``We want the delegates to have a great time in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he wants their ticket to win.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell is thrilled to show off his city and his own record as
mayor, since he helped coax Philadelphia back from near-bankruptcy,
guided its Center City building boom and conceived of snagging a
political convention as a coming-out party for his reinvigorated
city.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a bit awkward for him to join in the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a guy standing out in the rain, looking through the
window at the party inside,'' Rendell said, after walking into the
lobby of the grand, new Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Saturday night to
find it thick with happy Republicans. Rendell worked the room,
back-slapping bipartisanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are more of an affirmation of how far we've
come as a city,'' he said. ``If the Democrats had chosen us, people
would have said it's political.''
</P>
<P>
   An impresario and frustrated caterer, Rendell worked hard to
make it a grand party for the Republicans. He even dreamed up
Political Fest, the expansive, hands-on political exhibit with
everything from a mock Oval Office to a cruise missile, which is
drawing raves here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an A-minus,'' he said. It would have been better if the
Republicans hadn't vetoed a couple of his ideas, the former mayor
said, such as a stage for political comics. ``Too left-wing,'' he
sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   Then he caught himself. ``I don't want to bash the R's,'' he
said. He wants those Republicans to see and spend and spread the
word about the new Philadelphia. Then he wants them to go home and
lose.
</P>
<P>
   A Literal Setback for New Hampshire
</P>
<P>
   Is New Hampshire the Rodney Dangerfield of the Republican
Convention?
</P>
<P>
   You might think the state that hosts the first primary would get
a little respect on the convention-floor seating plan. But New
Hampshire's 24 seats are way at the back and way to the side of the
floor, behind Utah and Arkansas, next to North Dakota, Guam and the
Virgin Islands _ not exactly powerhouses in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Could New Hampshire's faraway seats, _ apparently, one security
guard observed Sunday, not even near the good bathrooms, but the
ones with low-pressure flushing mechanisms _ all because George W.
Bush lost the critical New Hampshire primary to Sen. John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the convention, said it was not
politics, but real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is New Hampshire being punished for voting for McCain?'' he
asked. ``No.'' Can you hear that in the back of the room?
</P>
<P>
   Huffington Stages a Pep Rally
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, Arianna Huffington, all pancake makeup and
dove-gray silk pantsuit, had the air of the high school pep-squad
leader who, with stars in her eyes and a Broadway ditty in her
heart, has decided to string up some lights in the gym and put on a
show starring all of her new best friends.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of Huffington's five-day pep rally billed
as the Shadow Convention, which opened its doors Sunday morning at
the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Center.
</P>
<P>
   First on the agenda was Sen. John McCain, Huffington's buddy
with the biggest marquee draw _ that is, if you don't include Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy, who is scheduled to speak later in
the week. (Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Jack Kemp both
bowed out over a week ago.) But the senator did not stay to make
small talk with the omnipresent talk-show guest; he rushed grumpily
through the stage door after the audience booed him for endorsing
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan A. Nadelmann, the director of The Lindesmith Center, a New
York drug-policy center financed by the billionaire George Soros,
hobnobbed backstage with Huffington's daughters, ages 9 and 13.
Huffington is passionate about the drug issue; her convention even
placed a two-page ad in last week's edition of The Philadelphia
Weekly, an alternative newspaper, that implied that George W. Bush
used drugs in his younger days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about Bush getting away with doing drugs all those years,
if he did,'' she said. ``The message is that if you're white and do
drugs, you can become president, and if you're black and do drugs,
you go to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all that bothers Huffington about Bush. She said,
for example, that Bush has appropriated her theory of
``compassionate conservatism'' _ it's a theme he has mercilessly
pounded on the campaign trail _ and that positively rankles with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote speeches going back to '90, '92 about that very
topic,'' she said. ``In 1993 I gave a speech titled `Can
Conservatism have a Social Conscience?' I mean, I laid out the
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough of weighty matters. It was time for Huffington and Al
Franken, the political comedian, to run lines for their upcoming
speech on political satire. Kozol listened to a few and did not
laugh. Franken tried out a joke about attending a Democratic
fund-raising event in 1996. ``Fifty thousand dollars got you a slow
waltz with Hillary Clinton,'' he said. ``Twenty-five thousand got
you a tango with Tipper Gore.'' Then he reached the punch line,
which was about Janet Reno. Huffington groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there are no feminists in the audience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the press attention, Huffington still wants more,
said her spokeswoman, Megan Colligan. Colligan gestured to the
green room of Comedy Central's program The Daily Show, which
happens to abut the stage door of Huffington's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even get the Daily Show to book us, and they're right
here,'' Colligan said. ``It's so ironic.''

SPIRITUAL LEADER SOUGHT BY CHINA ASKS FOR ASYLUM IN UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ A request for asylum in the United States by the
leader of one of China's largest spiritual movements has put
Washington in the position of harboring a man whom China alleges to
be a criminal or delivering him up to possible political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   After trying to keep the case quiet for months, U.S. immigration
officials delayed a decision on the request by Zhang Hongbao, the
founder of a meditative discipline popularly known as Zhong Gong,
at a court hearing Friday on Guam, a U.S. territory in the South
Pacific and a common destination for Chinese nationals seeking to
enter the United States .
</P>
<P>
   Granting Zhang asylum would amount to the United States telling
China that it does not believe the country's criminal charges
against him and reinforce China's perception that Washington acts
as an agent for domestic groups that Beijing believes are intent on
eroding the power of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The case comes during a widespread crackdown on spiritual groups
in China that began with the banning of the Falun Gong movement a
year ago. Like Falun Gong, Zhong Gong is based on qi gong,
traditional Chinese breathing and meditation exercises that seek to
channel the vital energy of body and the universe to various ends.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States declined China's request for help
in returning Falun Gong's founder, Li Hongzhi, who now lives in New
York. The United States said that Li was a permanent resident and
that it regarded China's charges against him as politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang's case is more nettlesome because he arrived on Guam
in February without a visa and, if he is to stay, the United States
must play an active role in keeping him on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   And China's claims that Zhang is wanted for crimes have a more
complex history than the charges against Li, which were related
primarily to his role in organizing a protest against the Beijing
government.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, rumors of a dark side to Zhong Gong began to
circulate. A close disciple defected from the group and wrote a
scathing expose alleging that Zhang was a fraud who had sex with
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Those rumors were amplified by self-appointed ``cult buster,''
Sima Nan, who has made a career of exposing fraudulent claims by qi
gong masters. He alleges that Zhang is guilty of rape and may even
be responsible for the murder of some former followers.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have repeated the rape allegation to U.S.
officials, though they have not presented any evidence or
documentation of formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang disappeared from public view in 1995 as criticism of his
group grew. It operated a nationwide network of schools and healing
centers based on his particular brand of qi gong before China
outlawed it earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   While his followers insisted for years that he had simply
retired from the world to seek further enlightenment, the group's
Web site (www.zgzg.net) now says the police have been trying to
arrest him since he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no extradition treaty with China, but last
month the two countries signed a mutual legal assistance pact that
was intended to provide a framework for the return of criminals by
either side.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked China for the return of two men
wanted in the slaying of five men in a gambling den in Boston's
Chinatown nearly 10 years ago. China, in turn, has asked the United
States for help in finding Zhang, saying he is wanted on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's request for asylum now complicates any law enforcement
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, U.S. officials said they had not informed
China of Zhang's whereabouts, hoping to keep the case quiet until
the Boston extradition request had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, an immigration court judge on Guam said at a hearing
for Zhang that China had formally requested that the United States
return him and, as a result, a decision on his asylum request would
be delayed. Another Zhong Gong member on Guam was granted political
asylum Friday, according to Frank Lu, a human rights advocate in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zhang was born in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin in
1954. He spent 10 years working on a state farm before studying
metallurgy and working at a succession of northeastern gold mines.
He later studied in Beijing, where he learned qi gong in his spare
time. He started Zhong Gong, his own school of qi gong, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong, whose full name translates as the China Life
Preservation and Intellect Improvement Discipline, was one of
dozens of schools started by self-styled masters during the period
of loose social controls that led to the pro-democracy
demonstrations of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Following the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement,
millions of people flocked to the qi gong movement for spiritual
solace, a sort of mass recoil from the perils of political
engagement and the soulless materialism then sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1990s, Zhong Gong became the most popular of
the various schools, but as controversy gathered around Zhang and
his group, the rival Falun Gong group gained in popularity,
eventually superseding Zhong Gong as the largest movement of its
kind. In the book Falun Gong followers regard as their bible, its
founder, Li, makes veiled criticisms of Zhang, calling him a ``sham
qi gong master.''
</P>
<P>
   China's growing unease with the spreading qi gong movement
eventually forced Li to leave the country in 1998. And a mass
demonstration by Falun Gong followers at Beijing's central
government compound last year triggered a crackdown on it and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, Zhong Gong and a handful of other qi gong schools
have since been outlawed and hundreds of their senior members
arrested. Before the crackdown, Zhong Gong claimed 38 million
followers, though that number, as with Falun Gong's claim of 100
million adherents, is most certainly inflated.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike its widely broadcast propaganda campaign against
Falun Gong, China has moved quietly in its ban of Zhong Gong,
charging that the group has misguided people and closing dozens of
Zhong Gong schools around the country.

   LOS ANGELES _ When Ismael ``Exxon'' Valdes starts losing his
emotional payload on the mound today in Pittsburgh, his old Dodgers
teammates aren't gonna be real keen on mopping up the Titanic-sized
mess this time.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he was dealt before the season started was to
eliminate a bad vibe from the locker room. Did a half season with
the dead-end Cubs in Wrigley provide him with some magical
intestinal fortitude? Did his dead arm suddenly heal? Did his
blister problem go away?
</P>
<P>
   Look at his record. Gotta doubt that. Otherwise, the Cubs woulda
fought harder to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing isn't that the Dodgers were able to reacquire
Valdes this late in the season. No, what's worse is that they can
actually use him in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It was either him or a return of Fernando. ...
</P>
<P>
   --What would each team have to lose today if the Yankees sent
David Cone to the Dodgers for Carlos Perez? ...
</P>
<P>
   --And ya know, Jack McDowell hasn't officially retired. ...
</P>
<P>
   --And if they knew the Angels were gonna just give away Kent
Bottenfield. ....
</P>
<P>
   --Enlightening information in the August issue of GQ. Not from
the cover story on Anna ``Don't Call Me Lolita'' Kournikova, which
that quote is never mentioned in the vapid three-page story.
</P>
<P>
   It's Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, revealing in a ``Why I
Wear What I Wear'' feature that his clothier is named Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma. ...
</P>
<P>
   --ARod, by the way, just turned a quarter of a century. ...
</P>
<P>
   --New Camarillo millionaire Joe Borchard has ``the best power
from a college player since Mark McGwire,'' according to White Sox
director of scouting Duane Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   And if he had stayed for his senior year of football at
Stanford, Borchard coulda been as hot an NFL pick as Dan McGwire
once was. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The $5.3 million bonus Borchard received is, by the way, the
most ever paid to a player who was drafted by any team.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay gave pitcher Matt White a $10.2-million bonus, and
Arizona gave Travis Lee a $10-million deal and pitcher John
Patterson a $6-million check. But in each of those cases, the
drafted players were declared free agents after using loopholes.
....
</P>
<P>
   --And the Sox say they're gonna start working the switch-hittin'
slugger as a center fielder. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Line of the week came from loose-lipped linkster Steve
Elkington on Romie's radio show. Elk, speaking about the size of
Colin Montgomery's rump, said it was so massive that, if it were a
green, ``it could accommodate all four pin placements.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   --Tabloid cover of the week from the Aug. 1 Star: ``Kathie Lee
GETS EVEN! Regis is history, Frank's next.''

from people asking if the events shown in their commercials

<P>
   Again, no, they aren't. ...

THESE LINKS MAY STINK, BUT FARMER HAS NET ON HIS SIDE

   LOS ANGELES _ What business does a Web site called
www.pigfarmer.com have in a sports section?
</P>
<P>
   Those who golf in Stuart, Fla., know.
</P>
<P>
   A course development company is in the middle of litigation
against Paul Thompson, whose 200-head pig farm borders the Florida
Club layout.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1957, Thompson has been farming his land. And since the
mid- '70s, he's been playing country music loudly because he claims
his pigs like hearing it while they eat, and that makes them
fatter.
</P>
<P>
   And when golfers hear the music, they get frazzled.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, according to the Reuters news service, the farmer's
choice of songs, along with the ``malodorous nature'' of his
business, is hurting the development company's multimillion
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you built a house next to a railroad track, would you
expect the trains to stop coming?'' asked Thompson. ``This is
farmland.''
</P>
<P>
   So getting back to the Web site - it's something Thompson has
posted to help set up a legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   --The domain name as well as the entire inventory for
SportsPlayBooks.com is up for auction on ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based company caused a wave of fear when it began
selling old playbooks from college and pro football teams. All it
was trying to do, the Web operators said, was allow high school
coaches a chance to try formations and such that others have used.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 playbooks are part of the sale, which is item
number 394765821 on ebay. Bidding, which started at $100, ends next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   --An auction with the starting bid of $2,500 for the chance to
be a ballboy or ballgirl at Magic Johnson's All-Star Charity
Basketball Game on Sunday at Pauley Pavilion is taking place on
ebay, through the Athletes Direct.com Web site. Two packages are
available, and they come with two VIP seats and a ball autographed
by Magic. Proceeds go to the Magic Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   --Major League Baseball has finally secured the Internet domain
www.mlb.com, and should relaunch under the name in the next few
months. The name had been owned by the law firm of Morgan, Lewis
and Bockius.

IN GREECE, `PHANTOM' TALE OF TREASURE HIDDEN BY NAZI SETS OFF A
HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ After months of dispute and delays, Greek and
French divers are hoping to plunge this week into nearly 300 feet
of water off the southwest Peloponnese, near Kalamata, on an
expedition to salvage what they believe to be a $2 billion fortune
consisting of 50 sealed chests full of gold coins and jewels
hoarded by a Nazi officer.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth was reputedly stripped from Jews sent to labor and
death camps, then stashed at a secret underwater location by the
notorious Nazi, Max Merten, who served as Hitler's senior
administrator in Salonika, in northern Greece, during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But even before a single ounce of gold has been raised, the
prospect of such a fortune has set Greece's famous bureaucracy in
motion and sent a long line of claimants jostling for their stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is crazy,'' said Gregoire Koulbanis, the
40-year-old Swiss diver of Greek descent who is to lead and film
the expedition. ``Such chaos, delays and state of hysteria, I've
never witnessed in my 20-year career.''
</P>
<P>
   Koulbanis, who gained fame heading some of the most daring
expeditions of the late oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, says
he was told of the treasure 10 months ago by a 63-year-old man he
refuses to name but whom the Greek media have dubbed ``Phantom X.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is currently serving prison time for a string of
felonies, says that he first learned of the treasure when he shared
a Greek prison cell with Merten in 1958. The former Nazi officer
fled to Germany after World War II, but returned to Greece that
year supposedly to check up on his fortune. He was arrested, tried
for war crimes and jailed in Athens, according to the Greek Foreign
Ministry and the Central Jewish Council, which represents this
country's 3,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The informant claims that Merten confessed to stowing 50 cases
of gold he intended to retrieve after the war, which a Nazi
submarine ferried from northern Greece to the southern Peloponnese.
From there, Merten commissioned a fishing boat named ``Sofia'' to
carry the cases to a designated site and sank the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential decree in 1959 allowed Merten to return to
Germany, where he practiced law and died in 1976. It is unclear if
he ever tried to retrieve the treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The current expedition, which was supposed to take place over
the weekend, is now scheduled for Friday after being put off by
local officials in Kalamata, who said that the summer holiday
season had left them short-handed to oversee a multi-million-dollar
search by 30 divers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Koulbanis, the head of the expedition, attributes the delays to
``outrageous demands'' by the local authorities and a marsh of
bureaucracy, despite having gained approval for the dive from
Foreign Minister George Papandreou earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Kalamata authorities say they want extra assurances that the
state will get the 50 percent share it has claimed if the fortune
is found. Kalamata authorities are demanding that a special state
committee climb aboard the search vessel to monitor every inch of
the dive by video-link from the deep.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a fleet of coast guard vessels to be placed on
alert, a team of archaeologists ready to appraise the fortune,
which is to be handled by Greek divers only, and a host of finance
ministry experts to store whatever is recovered in special vaults
at the National Bank of Greece. Since the operation may sweep
through a strategic military shooting range, Greek Air Force units
will also be at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors argue that at least a portion of the
treasure is rightfully theirs, particularly since much of it
appears to have been taken from the families of some 9,000 Jews who
were later rounded up under Merten to work at Nazi labor camps in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I alone had to pay him 1,000 gold British Sterling in hope of
winning my father's release from one of those camps,'' said Andreas
Sefihas, a Holocaust survivor and president of the Jewish Council
in Salonika, where 50,000 Jews _ 95 percent of the city's Jewish
community _ eventually perished in Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   But the Greek state's claim may leave Greece's 1,950 living
Holocaust survivors with less than a 25 percent share, with the
remaining 25 percent going to the man who says he knows where the
treasure can be found. Their agreement was negotiated by the
informant's lawyer, Alexandros Lykourezos, the country's star
criminal attorney whose clients have also included the most
notorious men wanted for war crimes in Bosnia.

COMMENTARY: NORMA THE PLUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Bold face in 13th graf should appear with italics or other
emphasis) By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Norma Holloway Johnson, in my view the
most partisan and power-abusive judge on the federal bench, is
finally being forced to answer questions about her conduct.
</P>
<P>
   To avert favoritism, the chief judge of the D.C. District Court
is supposed to assign judges to cases randomly. But when assigning
politically sensitive cases involving Webster Hubbell and Charlie
Trie, Johnson veered ``off the wheel'' to direct those cases to
Clinton-appointed judges.
</P>
<P>
   When this apparent subversion of the administration of justice
drew fire in the press and a formal complaint from Judicial Watch,
the Judicial Council of D.C. listened to the chief judge's
protestations at any challenge to her integrity and too hastily
dismissed the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rep. Howard Coble, chairman of House Judiciary subcommittee
on the courts, sent the Court of Appeals here evidence of four more
cases in which bypassed the system to steer cases embarrassing to
Democrats (including that of Clinton-Gore fund-raiser Maria Hsia)
to judges notoriously soft on Clintonites. The implicit message: if
the Judicial Branch didn't clean up its act internally, the
Legislative Branch would step up to its constitutional
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   This evidence was somewhat sternly passed down to Johnson's
embarrassed see-no-evil colleagues. They hastily convened a
five-judge panel to protect themselves from complicity in what the
House subcommittee chairman called an assignment procedure that was
``unusual, unorthodox and may be improper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council hired an investigator. He is Joe Whitley, a
lackadaisical former U.S. Attorney in Atlanta who recused himself
in the '80s Banca Lavoro scandal _ a suitably Republican choice,
but not the type to rock a boat in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Whitley asked for the chief judge's records to
ascertain a pattern of partisanship in assignments, goes the
scuttlebutt, Johnson resisted until so ordered by the Judicial
Council. Now genial Joe is duty-bound to take testimony from
Johnson's possibly intimidated law clerks about any discussions
with them about what to tell the investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Logic suggests we now have one furious chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, and perhaps temperamentally related to
it, the vindictive Norma Holloway Johnson launches and pursues a
leak investigation even more bizarre and chilling than in the days
of the Nixon ``plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of the beleaguered judge's rage is Charles Bakaly,
once Ken Starr's spokesman. She went after him for supposedly
leaking grand jury information; when the Court of Appeals decided
that no grand jury secrecy was involved, the angry judge charged
him with lying about a non-crime. (Nice irony there.) She wants to
brand him a criminal for swearing he did not pass on ``non-public''
information in talking with a New York Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The huge secret that so incenses our out-of-control jurist was
that the independent counsel was considering indicting President
Clinton. Some secret: that possibility has been common knowledge
for years, and Starr's successor makes no bones about it in public.
</P>
<P>
   I have not discussed the case with my colleague, but I am one of
the thousands of journalists who discuss non-public information
with all kinds of sources every day (sometimes calling it
scuttlebutt) for the public purpose of making it public. I see
Johnson's vendetta as her intemperate way of getting even with the
House, the independent counsel and the press.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: She makes an accusation of criminal contempt and asks
the Justice Department to prosecute her target in her court. Reno
Justice knows her charge is an egregious mixture of petulance and
arrogance, sure to be rejected by a jury, but does not exercise its
prosecutorial discretion to decline. Why? Because Reno political
appointees owe Johnson plenty for steering Clinton cases to
Clinton-appointed judges, and Justice's career lawyers are
terrified of her wrath.
</P>
<P>
   So Justice and the out-of-control judge, perhaps in collusion,
make the criminal charge petty enough to rate only six months in
the slammer, which takes away a defendant's right to trial by jury.
Result: the accusation is made by Norma the Plumber, the trial is
conducted by Norma the Plumber, the verdict is rendered by Norma
the Plumber, and the sentence is meted out by Norma the Plumber.
</P>
<P>
   If that is justice in Washington, D.C, something is rotten in
the state of the Judicial Branch.

COMMENTARY: LISTENING TO WOMEN'S VOICES
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says most Americans are happy in these best
of economic times. Jobs are plentiful. Wages are increasing.
Inflation is low. And even the traditionally hard-core unemployed
are finding work.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is happy. And a lot of those who are unhappy
are women.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide series of focus groups conducted jointly by leading
Democratic and Republican pollsters largely contradicts
conventional wisdom and could change the way the presidential race
is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   The focus groups show that ``women are largely pessimistic about
the present state of the nation,'' and, to a surprising degree,
feel they are not benefiting significantly from the improved
economy. They feel they are working longer and longer hours just to
make ends meet, and that the increasing demands of work leave them
less and less time to spend with their families.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the focus group participants expressed deep
concern over the moral direction of the country, and what they
perceived as the absence of a solid sense of values being passed on
to the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   The economy may be breaking statistical records, but it has not
been able to offset this deep discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women are asking, `What if this is as good as it
gets?''' said Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster who is
surveying U.S. women in the joint project with Republican pollster
Linda DiVall.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, at gatherings of women from widely varied
backgrounds, the focus group leaders heard heartfelt and poignant
expressions of frustration, disappointment and even discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme was that while there certainly were big winners
in the booming economy, there were many more ordinary families that
were working hard but barely holding on from week to week.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed report on the focus groups said women were worried
about their children growing up in environments that are entirely
different from their own backgrounds. It said: ``With the rise of
single parent and dual income households, they are concerned about
children's lack of guidance and their loss of appropriate role
models. With parents busy meeting financial demands, participants
believe children have few sources from which to learn family values
or a sense of morality besides from television and the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake and DiVall organized the focus groups and are conducting a
series of nonpartisan national polls to determine _ as the election
season unfolds _ what issues are of most concern to women. The
project is called ``Women's Voices 2000'' and is sponsored by the
Center for Policy Alternatives, a nonpartisan public policy group,
and Lifetime Television, a cable network that bills itself as
``Television for Women.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on the focus groups will be released Tuesday at a
press briefing in Philadelphia, where the Republican National
Convention is being held. ``We're hoping the candidates see this as
a wake-up call,'' said Carole Black, president and chief executive
of Lifetime. ``They need to hear what women are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most heart-wrenching comments at the focus groups
came from African-American women. They shared the concerns of other
participants, but also spoke movingly about the personal impact of
violence and deteriorating values, and their very real fear that
their children _ their sons, especially _ might not even survive
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sobering and very depressing,'' said DiVall. ``A
lot of them feel they are doing absolutely the best they can to
protect their kids, but it's the outside environment that is
pressing in on them and they feel they have no control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have tended to argue economic issues and values
issues as if they were separate categories that could be addressed
independently. But the women who participated in the focus groups
seemed to be saying that economic pressures made it more difficult
for their families to deal with the many outside influences shaping
the values of their children.
</P>
<P>
   The interrelationship of values and the economy is a difficult
theme for politicians to articulate. But it is close to the core of
the real world of working Americans.

RANDOM HOUSE TO ESTABLISH EXCLUSIVELY DIGITAL WING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stepping up the race to stake out territory in the new world of
digital books, Random House, the largest U.S. trade publisher,
plans Sunday to announce the creation of a new purely digital
imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in January, the house will publish under the name
AtRandom a list of about 20 purely digital books, by authors
ranging from the editor of Harper's magazine to a downtown
dominatrix. All will be sold online as electronic books or in
single copies printed on demand, but they will not be shipped to
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Random House becomes the second major house to begin a digital
imprint, following Time Warner Trade Publishing, which this spring
created a digital imprint of its own, iPublish.com.
</P>
<P>
   All the biggest New York publishing houses are now moving
quickly to prepare for the possibility that digital books will soon
take off. Over lunches at Michael's, the Four Seasons and other
industry hubs, editors are quietly courting agents and authors,
trying to sign deals for the digital rights to their new and
previously published books.
</P>
<P>
   As they acquire new titles, they are beginning to establish the
rules of digital publishing, from authors' royalties to the prices
consumers will pay. In many cases, especially for brand name
authors and older contracts, authors' agents have retained digital
rights. For publishers, that means there is a vast pool of
potentially profitable literary properties waiting to be claimed,
sometimes from another house's list. Time Warner, for example, will
publish the electronic versions of several books by the science
writer, James Gleick, previously published in hardcover by Random
House's Pantheon imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Both Random House and Time Warner are hoping to build their
reputations as desirable places for authors to publish digitally,
much the way places like Random House's sister imprint Vintage are
prestigious names to appear under in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the book business wonder why the rush. Even Ann Godoff,
president and publisher of Random House Trade Group and creator of
the digital imprint, admitted that she had not yet managed to enjoy
reading a book off a screen, or read a whole electronic book.
Neither has almost anyone else in the industry. Many others,
meanwhile, worry that online copyright protection is open to
question.
</P>
<P>
   Print-on-demand books, though roughly comparable in appearance
to trade paperbacks, remain expensive to produce. Lightning Source,
a company that provides the service to publishers, charges a
publisher $4.80 to produce a single copy of a 300-page book, which
is more expensive than traditional printing except in handling
titles that sell fewer than 1,000 copies a year.
</P>
<P>
   But many publishers have high expectations for the profits from
the new digital books. Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner
Trade Publishing, says selling electronic books will boost the
industry's annual growth rate from single to double digits.
Microsoft Corp. will release a new version of its electronic book
reader next week, the first version for reading on desktop and
laptop computers as well as on expensive hand-held devices.
Publishers say the company has estimated that 2 million people will
download free copies in the first two weeks. Dick Brass,
Microsoft's vice president of technology development, believes that
the market for electronic books will exceed $1 billion in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the brave new world we want to see,'' said Godoff at
Random House. ``No printing, no paper and binding, no need for a
sales conference or printed catalog _ we don't know the size of the
market, but it could be potentially very profitable for us.'' She
has particularly high hopes for print-on-demand technology, because
it enables publishers to profitably publish low-selling new and old
titles with narrow readerships, and it obviates the risk of holding
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Karp, vice president and senior editor at the Random
House Trade Group, will head the new imprint. He said he began this
spring approaching authors and agents about signing all-electronic
contracts for new books, swearing each one to secrecy and revealing
none of the other writers' names. Many have verbal agreements but
no formal contracts yet.
</P>
<P>
   Karp said he acquired the rights to projects he thought suited
the medium. ``The Quest to End Baldness'' by the New York Post
columnist, Gersh Kuntzman, and ``Mistress Ruby Ties It Together''
by Robin Shamburg, a dominatrix who also writes a column for
NYPress, may work better in electronic form because they can be
bought and read in private without the embarrassment of taking them
to a cashier. Others will be collections of previously published
magazine articles by Harper's editor, Lewis Lapham, and the writers
Tad Friend and Donald Katz. Such collections do not sell many
copies in paper, but the low volumes make sense in electronic form,
and new material might be added to the collections over time. Some
will be as short as the equivalent of about 150 pages; others, such
as the collections, as long as 300-page books.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Random House's new electronic titles is a
full-length novel, ``Because She is Beautiful,'' by Cameron Dougan,
a first-time author. ``I couldn't be more flattered,'' he said.
``It doesn't matter if it is hardcover or paperback or downloaded
if it's getting attention and people are recommending it to their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Other titles include ``The Secret of Life,'' a book of advice
from Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of ``Prozac Nation,'' and ``Walking
On Ice,'' a biography of the hockey player Mark Messier by Meredith
Berkman, a magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Random House will sell its digital books through online
booksellers and other organizations' Web sites. The house plans to
sell the books for about the price of a typical trade paperback,
for a little less in electronic form and a little more in
print-on-demand. It will pay authors royalties on electronic books
of about 15 percent of the price _ about the same as a hardcover
royalty rate. On print-on-demand titles, authors will receive 7.5
percent of the price, about the same as on a trade paperback.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Random House also plans to publish digitally a
hundred titles from its Modern Library imprint of classic titles.
Some sets of several books, like the volumes of Marcel Proust's
``In Search of Lost Time'' or the complete works of Jane Austen,
will be sold together as single bundles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Random House, Time Warner, which includes Little, Brown
and Warner Books, will sell its electronic books from its own Web
site as well as through online bookstores. Most of its new print
books will also appear in electronic editions, as well as a handful
of new digital books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our digital business will allow us to expand beyond the
best-seller focus of the major chains,'' said Gregory Voynow,
general manager of iPublish.com, explaining that in chains titles
that sell in high-volumes are likely to get the most attention.
``This will allow us to have more control over our own destiny,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, both publishers said, will allow the marketing of
books directly to likely readers on Web sites that reflect their
interests, and letting them download an electronic book with a
click.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also plans initially to discount its electronic
books aggressively, charging about $7 or less for electronic
versions of some books. Time Warner will also offer its authors a
potentially higher royalty rate, about 25 percent of the
publisher's net revenue, including income from any licensing or
other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and agents involved agree that the ultimate digital
royalty rates and book prices remain to be seen, along with the
extent of demand for electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, sure, a 15 percent royalty rate, but it can't be
precedent-setting,'' said Amanda Urban, agent for Tad Friend. ``The
publicity attendant on this will compensate for the low advance,
and collections of reprinted journalism are hard to get published
today anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But other agents are already putting up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These publishers are trying to divide up the new digital world
before we have even mapped it out,'' said Robert Gottlieb, an agent
at the William Morris Agency. ``It is like Antarctica. They have
landed and they are saying it's theirs. There is a tremendous
reduction in overhead from printing, distribution and all of that,
and authors aren't enjoying the benefits of the increased
profitability.''

VISITING THE WORLD OF COLLECTIBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The erratic nature of today's stock market has nothing on the
world of sports collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of slow-growth, always-valuable collectibles,
like anything autographed by Babe Ruth, that rival the security of
Coca-Cola stock or mutual funds. There are several hobby niches
that ebb-and-flow like tech stocks. And there is plenty of what one
might call the junk bonds of collecting, which is 90 percent of
everything produced in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st National Sportscard Collectors Convention came and went
this weekend at the Anaheim Convention Center, and all of those
trends were as obvious as the fragile nature of an Internet IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the 1999 convention in Atlanta, which was considered
a disaster, most dealers and collectors left L.A. content. Those
dealers asked about their long weekend in Anaheim graded the show
from fair- to-good. Business was better than expected on Thursday
and Friday and disappointing on Saturday, usually the busiest day.
No official attendance mark was available, but estimates ranged
around 20,000 for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   From at least one hobby perspective, things were encouraging. If
the show was any kind of indicator, today's collectors are more
savvy than ever. There weren't a lot of looky-loos walking the
floor, which was the case nine years ago, when the 1991 convention
in Anaheim was hit with a tidal wave of collectors salivating for
free promotional handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors this year seemed to know exactly what they wanted,
and with only a few exceptions, there was plenty of everything to
meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good show,'' said Phil Panacci of Chino, a
collector/dealer of vintage publications and tickets. ``I know a
few dealers weren't very happy, but if you talk to people and are
willing to negotiate, there was plenty of business here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the trends, based on personal collecting experience and
feedback from dealers and collectors:
</P>
<P>
   High-end memorabilia remains the most coveted of items, the true
investment-quality material in the hobby, and more collectors
seemed willing to pay the money to make it theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Some prices were steep, but that's a reflection of last year's
Barry Halper auction, which put a lot of terrific material on the
market. But when one trading card sells for $1.27 million (the
recent sale price of a Honus Wagner tobacco card), then paying
$2,000 or more for something signed by Ruth, Ty Cobb or Lou Gehrig
looks like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in memorabilia in general is up, as collectors turn to
tickets, game-used jerseys, old contracts, and other items of
vintage at a time when there is no shortage of trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   The graded card phenomenon -- the process of a third party
company grading cards on a 1-to-10 scale, thereby placing a premium
on flawless cards (a 10) -- has hit a crucial turning point. There
was no shortage of graded cards available, but there was a shortage
of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did buy were only focused on cards with legs, older
tobacco cards in short supply, boomer favorites like Mickey Mantle,
and rookie cards of modern stars. By Sunday, many dealers were
blowing out cards graded 7 and 8 and higher-graded commons.
</P>
<P>
   Two disappointing spinoffs of graded cards were dealers who
tried to get graded card prices for cards that hadn't been graded,
and those who overpriced lesser condition cards.
</P>
<P>
   Many dealers were also trying to get 70-to-80 percent of ``book
value'' (Beckett price guides) for modern cards when half-book is
standard at the twice-weekly warehouse show in Walnut. But as one
dealer noted, the cost of buying a table and flying inventory west
made some stubborn when it came to pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers will be happy to know there is no shortage of cards
from their adolescent years. Every third table appeared to have
binders or stacks of cards from the '50s, '60s and '70s. Complete
sets were available in all price and condition ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Set collectors from the '90s are simply out of luck. Singles are
not available because the cost for dealers to crack boxes is
prohibitive and outweighs the demand. Except for rookie cards and
the aforementioned lottery cards, the market for current cards is
softer than yogurt, and even some of the lottery cards weren't
moving. One dealer with memorabilia cards featuring cut autographs
of Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Ruth, Gehrig and others still had them
in his case as of Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball cards still swing the biggest stick. Football and
basketball cards are stagnating. While the number of hockey card
collectors is even smaller, they're much more passionate. And
one-time non-sport titan Pokemon is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Business was brisk at the autograph booths. More than a dozen
Hall of Famers (Reggie Jackson) and local heroes (John Wooden)
signed for fees ranging from $10 to $50. If visitors were bummed by
the prices, they weren't saying so.
</P>
<P>
   And despite negative publicity about the veracity of autographed
material, there was plenty of it available. It was surprising to
see so many vendors with autographed baseball cards, a
traditionally low-interest item. The payoff here for the discreet
collector may be lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major card companies, distributors and dealers were
advertising their websites, gearing up for the biggest change in
the hobby. The buying, selling, promoting and auctioning of cards
and memorabilia on the Internet is seen as a must-do for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many collectors and dealers make use of the
Internet -- sports items are one of eBay's strongest areas -- is
more proof that the hobby has legs. The 2000 National may not have
attracted as many bodies as the 1991 National, but the ones it did
appear smarter, and that's not a bad thing. &QL;

VENEZUELAN VOTE IS SEEN AS VICTORY FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Rallying to President Hugo Chavez's call
for radical social and political change, Venezuelans Sunday granted
the former paratrooper a new six-year term with enhanced powers,
top officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to use his time in power to sweep away the
last remnants of the traditional political order in this nation of
23 million people that in recent years has been the United States'
top oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the polls were supposed to close, there were no
official results. However, both the head of the outgoing
legislature and the interior minister, Luis Davila, said on
national television that preliminary official results showed that
Chavez had won handily. Voter surveys posted by the the newspaper
El Nacional gave Chavez as much as a 20-point margin over his main
challenger, Francisco Arias Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, Venezuela's poor, disillusioned by
decades of corrupt and unresponsive government, have united around
Chavez and his plan for a complete overhaul of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day of revolution,'' Chavez, 46, who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful military coup attempt, said after casting his ballot
Sunday morning at a suburban polling station. ``Today a new
republic is being born.''
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which Chavez will be able to implement his
revolution, however, depends on the outcome of races to elect 165
members of congress and 23 state governors. Results of those races
were expected only later in the evening or early Monday. Supporters
of the president are expected to win a majority of the posts, but
polls indicate that Chavez may fall short of the two-thirds
majority he needs in the National Assembly in order to govern
without constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Sunday was the culmination of a contentious process of
sweeping political change that began with Chavez's landslide
victory in a December 1998 presidential vote. As a candidate, he
promised voters a ``peaceful social revolution'' if elected, but
also said he would need a new constitution with expanded powers in
order to carry out the transformation the country needed.
</P>
<P>
   In three elections last year, a constitutional assembly was
first convoked and next selected and then finally submitted a new
charter to voters for approval in December. As a result, Chavez's
term of office was expanded from five to six years, and a ban on
sitting presidents seeking immediate re-election for one more term
was removed _ creating the possibility that Chavez could remain in
office until 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the changes were approved, though, the Congress,
dominated by discredited opposition parties, and the Supreme Court
were eliminated and replaced by weakened entities that have proven
subservient to Chavez and his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition. The
authority of governors and mayors was also reduced, the role of the
armed forces was vastly expanded and a Chavez loyalist placed in
charge of the powerful state oil company after it was purged.
</P>
<P>
   With the new constitution in hand, Chavez called a vote to elect
a new unicameral congress, as well as governors, mayors and state
and municipal legislators, a total of more than 6,200 elected
posts. In what he described as an attempt to ``relegitimize'' his
own rule, he also submitted the presidency to a new vote,
anticipating no real challenge to his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Cardenas, a former army colonel who was
Chavez's second-in-command during the 1992 coup and spent two years
in jail with him afterward, broke with the president and announced
his own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, he charged, was assuming dictatorial powers, tolerating
the corruption he had pledged to eradicate, alienating the United
States and forging an undesirable alliance with President Fidel
Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual last-minute incursion into the campaign, Castro
invited a group of Venezuelan journalists to Cuba on Saturday and
issued a ringing endorsement of Chavez, wishing him ``good luck and
lots of votes'' during a rambling news conference that was
televised live here. ``Hugo, I am sure that nothing or no one can
hold you back,'' the Cuban leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's remarks, which appeared to violate a ban on politicking
here after the formal close of the campaign, came days after a man
turned up claiming to be a Cuban intelligence agent and said that
Castro had sent 1,500 operatives here to infiltrate the Venezuelan
government. As the news conference was taking place, Chavez called
Castro, and the two men discussed baseball before ridiculing the
accusations of a Cuban spy network operating here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office 18 months ago, Chavez has consistently
praised Castro and the Cuban Revolution while attacking his
domestic critics as ``a rancid oligarchy'' and pursuing a
nationalist and populist political line. The resulting polarization
of Venezuelan society, with the poor overwhelmingly lining up
behind Chavez and the middle class reluctantly supporting Arias,
was once again on display during Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chavez's strongholds here is a working-class neighborhood
called 23 de Enero, the site of a popular uprising in which
hundreds of people died in 1989, after the government raised
gasoline prices. The area voted heavily for Chavez in 1998, and
appeared Sunday to have rallied to his side again, with scarcely a
supporter of Arias to be found during interviews with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela has awakened, and we will never let ourselves be
fooled again,'' said Julia de Tirado, 61, who described Chavez as
the antidote to 40 years of corruption and misgovernment under a
pair of traditional parties. She praised him for being ``honest and
hard-working'' and said that ``if he were not our president, things
would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Estelita Colmenares, a social worker, added that while her hopes
that ``this country will move ahead and become prosperous,'' have
yet to be realized, she continues to have faith in Chavez and his
government. ``At least they are listening to us, and not belittling
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But across town, at a polling place at a private high school in
the middle-class neighborhood of Chacao, a woman conducting an exit
poll for a local firm said Arias appeared to have a 2-1 advantage
over Chavez. Among the the most vociferous of those voting against
the president was Irma Galindo de Baez, 50, who was wearing a
button that proclaimed ``throw the crazy man out.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez said she voted for Chavez in 1998 because ``Venezuela
needed a change _ it couldn't go on with the dictatorship of the
political parties.'' But ``this government has been a disaster,''
she said. ``This guy has really scared us'' with his incendiary
language, ``there has been a lot of corruption,'' and the police
have allowed a farm owned by her family to be seized by peasants.

   A 48-year-old engineer who declined to give his name faulted
Chavez for the deep recession Venezuela has been experiencing
despite record high prices for its oil. ``If you build a house or
shopping center, who is there to sell it to?'' he complained,
adding that the country would be better of if Chavez were ``not
fighting all the time with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself voted early, thanked Venezuelans for choosing ``a
new horizon, a new path,'' and then spent several hours playing
baseball. Later, though, he met with his economic team to draw up
what he described as ``measures of great impact for the first 100
days of the new government.''

</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My friend Gabor Koranyi was visiting New York from Hungary
recently and took the subway from Manhattan to his hosts' home in
Brooklyn one night. It was after 2 a.m., and when he left the
station he lost his way. The streets were deserted, and although he
stopped a few cabs to ask directions, or to take him to his
destination, none of the drivers knew how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Koranyi didn't want to wake his hosts, but finally realized he
had his cell phone. He called a friend in Budapest, where it was
nearly 9 a.m. The friend logged on to the Internet and in no time
found Koranyi's location on MapQuest. Then he found the destination
and step by step guided his friend to his hosts' house.

   A correspondent, who wishes to remain anonymous, drove her

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Understand I'm approaching geezer status, I'm not much of a
techno-anything and I also happen to be in the highly stressed ad
business.
</P>
<P>
   When I creak out of my cab at my midtown hotel about noon, after
flying in from St. Louis, I usually have numerous things to do,
meetings to get to, and very little time to organize any of it.
Recently I didn't need anything except my glasses, pen, mints and
briefcase, and my cell phone to get a call from a friend who was
joining me later in the day. After a hasty bath, I collected all
the necessary items and sped off to my destination.
</P>
<P>
   When late afternoon came around, I anxiously awaited my friend's
call and thought I'd check Brooks Bros.' annual sale to kill time.
Still no call. My anxiety level up a notch or two, I drifted over
to Paul Stuart. I couldn't imagine what had happened to my always
reliable friend and finally decided to make the call myself. I
reached into my breast pocket and pulled out the hotel room's
television remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I later griped to my finally found friend, ``Ever
notice how these cell phones never seem to work when you want them
to?''

   May the Triple-A cards go unneeded
</P>
<P>
   And our car remain in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   May it circumvent stain and collision

   May the kids in their car seats cease fire
</P>

</P>
<P>
   May their bladders remain large and empty

<P>
   At least till a rest stop's in sight.

<P>
   May the beach house have two separate bedrooms
</P>
<P>
   And a fridge with a place for some ice.
</P>
<P>
   May the bedding not slump toward the corner
</P>
<P>
   And be free from all visible lice.
</P>
<P>
   May the sun be not shy nor elusive.
</P>
<P>
   May the sea be not wild, just wet.
</P>
<P>
   May the sharks keep respectable distance

   Dr. William K. Kopp was reared in Brooklyn, and when he visited
his son and daughter-in-law's new apartment in Brooklyn Heights, he
realized it was only a block from the Hotel St. George and its huge
indoor pool, where he occasionally swam as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity brought to mind a lesson he had learned in 1950 as
an 11-year-old. After swimming and dressing, he was waiting for
friends to take the subway home when an older boy approached,
pointed a knife at him and said he needed money for his sick
mother. The boy added that he hated to do this but his mother
needed medicine badly. If his victim came back in two weeks,
though, he would pay him back.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp said he did go back and the boy was indeed there _ to rob
him again. ``How early we learn about life in a big city,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   After a long day traveling to and from a client's office in New
Jersey, I was trying to make my way to the West Side Highway and
got tangled in Lincoln Tunnel traffic on Ninth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled there for some time, I noticed a sign that advertised
Manganaro's foods. There was a phone number displayed, so I took
out my cell phone and called in a sandwich order, explaining my
pain at the traffic and unhappiness without food. The owner asked
me if I was in the car that was double-parked in front of the
building. Indeed I was, I said, and she offered to bring the
sandwich to my car. Within minutes it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the traffic tangle and the rest of the drive to the
Bronx seemed almost relaxing.

 &HT;    Bush's real speech
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   I've been talking with my dear friend Ima Source, every
journalist's best buddy, the mother of all scoops.
</P>
<P>
   And I've got a dandy!
</P>
<P>
   Ima, whom I've been on a first-name basis with for many years,
has supplied me with an advance copy of George W. Bush's acceptance
speech set for Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, like every other journalist, I'm a sucker for Ima.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, word-for word. Bush speaks, the world listens...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four major food groups in Washington: The
Administration, the Congress, the media and the lobbyists.'' He
pauses for emphasis. ``And we are eating each other alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered applause, some nervous laughter. The delegates seem
confused. Where is this coming from? Where's he going with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we all know the way things work in Washington. Now I want
to tell you how I think it ought to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be able to come together to discuss ideas that
will make everyone's life easier, perhaps through less government
...''
</P>
<P>
   Great cheering, whistling, stomping from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``... But sometimes, too, by having more government.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence falls on the convention hall like a sledge hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, a lot of those decisions _ whether more or
less _ are made because the Democratic Party or the Republican
Party decides they do like or don't like something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then everyone falls into lock step behind them without ever
stopping to talk about, or think about, what the other side is
suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will say, 'Oh, Barney Frank proposed that,' or 'John
McCain is for that' ... 'Then I can't possibly be for that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an automatic knee-jerk that boots out a lot of good ideas
_ a wholesale dismissal of ideas because you don't the party or the
person behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point Bush turns toward the media gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it happens, if you will forgive me for saying so, as much
in the media as it does in the political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here's something the delegates can understand. Our
candidate criticizes the media, and we cheer wildly. Always have,
always will.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shakes his head and holds up his hands for quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay with me on this, please,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge bill is introduced. Reporters immediately want to know
what key leaders think about it. An honest response would be, 'I
don't know, I haven't read it yet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The media won't accept that, and politicians who don't know
any better _ and I mean that quite literally _ will simply ask
party leaders, 'How does our party feel about it?' Told that the
party is against it, that gives him, or her, an easy answer: 'OK,
then I'm against it ... Won't work, won't fly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need instead,'' Bush says, rapping his knuckles on the
podium for emphasis, ``is a concerted effort by everyone not to
knock the other person's ideas until you have actually looked at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that includes the media not asking us for instant
reaction!
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much is at stake,'' he continues, ignoring the applause
and speaking over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing good ideas and good policy for America's critical
needs _ from housing to transportation to energy, you name it ...
Ideas that never get a chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you a story, a true story. A couple of Republican
staffers were going over a piece of proposed legislation. One of
them was puzzled by some particularly harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Why's that in there?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Oh, to stick it to the Democrats,''' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Why would you want to do that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Why not?''' he said, genuinely puzzled by her response.
</P>
<P>
   ``' Well, this is a good bill without putting it in there. No
reason to be vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly he understood. He sneered at her.'' Bush manages to
do an excellent imitation of a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``'You're not here because you believe in Republican causes,''
the staffer said. He pointed an accusing finger at his colleague
and began backing out of the room as if she had a loathsome
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ```You're a ...' He all but choked on the word. 'You're a
PROFESSIONAL!'''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a dropped pin would have all the impact of an
exploding grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great nation America is,'' Bush says in conclusion.
``Just think how much greater she could be if it weren't for us!''
</P>
<P>
   I was beside myself. ``That's it?'' I asked Ima Source. ``That's
what the speech will be?!''
</P>
<P>
   Ima nodded her assurance. ``Word for word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrific,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I was already starting to write the story in my head and halfway
out the door when I paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Er, is there anything else spectacular going to happen at the
convention this week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this,'' Ima confided, looking around to make sure no one
else was listening and lowering his voice to a whisper: ``Pigs will
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember. You read it here first.

</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recasts lede, reorganizes top to raise Cheney's interviews;
In graf bgng, On NBC's ``Meet ..., corrects spelling of Flowers'
first name to Gennifer.) 
By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney, the Republican choice for vice
president, arrived here on the eve of the party's national
convention after trying on several television interviews Sunday
morning to smooth the more conservative edges of his House voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on the morning talk shows, Cheney called some of
the Democratic criticism of his votes ``trivial'' and ``irrelevant
to the important issues of the day.'' But while he defended some of
his actions, like his vote in 1986 against freedom for Nelson
Mandela, he seemed to back away from his votes opposing action
against ``cop-killer'' bullets and plastic guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meanwhile, continued their incessant assault on
Cheney's record, releasing a television advertisement Sunday
attacking his votes against Head Start, the Clean Water Act, the
school lunch program and health insurance for people who lost
coverage when they lost their jobs, and for praising OPEC for
cutting oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive presidential
nominee, and Cheney, the ad asked: ``What are their plans for
working families?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush continued his slow march toward Philadelphia,
campaigning Sunday at the replica of the historic Crosley Field in
the suburbs of Cincinnati. Several thousand people withstood a
driving rain to see him. Fireworks popped as he drove up in a
campaign bus emblazoned with the slogan, ``Renewing America's
Purpose,'' the theme of his five-day tour through several
battleground states. He told the Republican members of Congress
sharing the stage with him, ``Be patient. Help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has made only a few campaign stops since being
selected as Bush's running made, made a brief appearance here
Sunday afternoon, promising ``most of all to make America proud
again by giving them a president they can respect.'' He spoke for
only four minutes at the hotel where he will be joined by Bush on
Wednesday, and he seemed overwhelmed by his reception from a crowd
organized by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's more important task came on the morning talk programs.
He defended his vote in 1986 against freedom for Mandela because he
believed the African National Congress was a ``terrorist'' group.
</P>
<P>
   He said his votes opposing action against cop-killer bullets and
plastic guns that could pass metal detectors were caused by the
no-amendment procedure under which they were considered. In each
case, he said now that he would be ``happy to entertain'' such
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he voted against Head Start and the Older Americans
Act because they were costly. On both subjects, he said his
position was different today.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and Cheney also sought to generate support, Bush's
primary-season nemesis, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also made a
pitch for the ticket. Appearing before the ``shadow convention,''
an event ranging from reformist to radical, he gamely asked the
audience to vote for Bush and was soundly booed for his troubles.
Then he went before his own delegates and formally released them
from commitments to vote for him. Many groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush camp's plans for a conflict-free convention
chugged along without serious difficulty. Abortion-rights advocates
insisted they were working to find the required six states to
support new language in the platform acknowledging diverse views on
the subject, but they had yet to find them. One minor rules
squabble was shaping up _ over an effort to make all 165 members of
the Republican National Committee automatic delegates at the next
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   There was no formal convention business Sunday beyond the
arrival of 2,066 delegates _ mostly middle-aged white men and
generally more conservative than the voters who gave Bush the
nomination _ assembled in the city where Republicans have nominated
five previous candidates, from John C. Fremont in 1856 to Thomas E.
Dewey in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But it became increasingly clear that despite the shadow
convention and occasional minor demonstrations like Sunday's
peaceful march by 7,000 for a variety of causes, the four-day show
beginning Monday is all about Bush and Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The party's congressional wing gets barely an hour at center
stage, yet Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who, as chairman of the
House Republican Campaign Committee, is striving mightily to retain
control of the House, pronounced himself happy with the time given
House candidates at the podium: two segments of fifteen one-minute
speeches during the day Tuesday. Nor did the senators complain at
the opportunity for six four-minute speeches around lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said, ``This convention is about electing George W. Bush.
It's not about the House and Senate.'' He said Republican hopes of
retaining the House, where they hold a 13-seat majority, would be
aided by Bush's ``creating an updraft that our candidates can take
advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that the campaign has settled on a strategy
for dealing with the problems it obviously did not anticipate from
Cheney's voting record. On one television show after another, he
said the votes did not matter, but that he was not wedded to them
today.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week,'' Cheney complained of ``so much time and
energy and effort devoted to this kind of trivia'' and ``the
trivial aspect of the debates that rage in Washington now.''
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' he said, ``The campaign that
Governor Bush and I will run is very much oriented towards the
future, it's focused on trying to restore a degree of civility in
Washington, to end the kind of partisan backbiting that has been so
much a part of the tone and tenor in this city for all too many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' he said, ``I think the American
people want to hear about the future, not about the past.'' That
choice of phrase recalled what Bill Clinton, then a candidate for
president, said on Jan. 26, 1992, about accusations that he had
conducted an affair with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Cheney said, ``I hope the Democrats
spend the next three months going after my voting record; I'll be
happy to defend it. But in the meantime, we're going to talk about
the future of the country, and we're going to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   His argument about how his pro-gun votes were dictated by House
procedures banning amendments was also consistent from one program
to the next. He put it this way on ABC:
</P>
<P>
   ``Debate was limited. No amendments were allowed. And I often
voted against measures that I thought deserved more serious
coverage and debate than was permitted when the majority brought it
up under the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gave different answers when asked what he would do now on
the measure attacking bullets that can penetrate policemen's
bullet-proof vests. He told CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``It would
depend.'' When NBC's Tim Russert asked him, ``Would you authorize
money to ban cop-killer bullets and ban plastic weapons?'' Cheney
replied ``Ah, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC he said he voted in 1987 against the Older Americans Act,
which provided $1.6 billion for programs including health centers,
Meals on Wheels and Alzheimer's research by saying, ``Probably
because it was excessive in terms of the funding.'' He said, ``When
we had big deficits I voted against bills that I thought either
authorized or appropriated too much fund.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' but was not
asked about his House votes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He continued the anti-Washington theme here, saying ``For the
last five years, I've been outside Washington, I've been out in the
real world where people are building companies, creating jobs,
inventing new technologies that are transforming our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been the chairman and chief executive of the
Halliburton Co., a large oil services company based in Dallas,
said, ``When I look back at Washington, I scratch my head and ask
what the hell are they doing back there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult day for McCain. Ariana Huffington, the
commentator who is the chief organizer of the shadow convention,
which is focused on the overhaul of campaign financing, lingering
poverty and a drug war seen as aimed mostly at filling up prisons,
had to intervene to quiet the booing crowd. When the catcalls
continued, intermittently, McCain canceled a promised
question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   One participant, Emily Hagopian of Los Angeles, who came with a
group called Youth Vote 2000, said, ``Everybody saw him as our hope
for change, and then he came in here with that endorsement. He
disgusted us. He betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then tears came to McCain's eyes when he met with his own
delegates. ``I need every one of you to give this campaign the same
amount of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, by way of warning, ``American doesn't like sore
losers.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE STRAWBERRY SAGA _ CALAMITY TIMES TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In baseball today, the saddest of possible words may well be:
Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   While hearts go out to David Cone, who, at 37, is wrestling
sorrowfully with his baseball career, of not getting the fastball
to hum, the slider to slide, among other woes, it is still
primarily a baseball story, distressing for this wonderful
competitor and achiever, but not tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years _ or ever since Strawberry was chosen by the Mets
as the first player in the baseball draft in 1980, an 18-year-old
left-handed batter out of Los Angeles brimming with such fabulous
talent that it was immediately decided by the baseball cognoscenti
that he would be the latter-20th-century Ted Williams _ we have
followed him on the diamond, and in the news.
</P>
<P>
   We have followed him through thin and thick, through his mighty
home runs and his mighty strikeouts, both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   We followed him as he made his way through battles with drugs,
with alcohol, with the IRS, with a paternity suit _ losing many of
them. He was in rehab centers, under house arrest, released from
the Dodgers and the Giants, suspended on a number of occasions,
painfully trying to make it all right again, trying to come back
time and time again.
</P>
<P>
   He became a born-again Christian with a look in his eyes at
times that made him appear nearly hypnotized, and then lapsed. He
sought to become a rededicated family man, a total team player, and
to perhaps hang out with a better class of people than in previous
times.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1995 George Steinbrenner gave ``this young man'' _
Strawberry was then 33 _ ``one last chance,'' he seemed to respond.
``I finally feel free,'' he said at the time. ``I just feel I can
be me now, and not try to be someone other people wanted me to be.
I don't feel the most important thing is to be a baseball star. The
most important thing is for me to be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry developed colon cancer in 1998, then beat it
into remission and came back to help the Yankees win the World
Series last October, he broke down at the ceremony honoring the
team on the steps of City Hall and hugged the manager, Joe Torre,
who was himself a cancer survivor and who had shown confidence in
Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of one's feelings for Strawberry, it was hard not to
be touched by this moment, by the apparent genuineness of the
emotion, of this kind of triumphal culmination of the man's
desperate struggles.
</P>
<P>
   And we followed him to this season when, in spring training with
the Yankees, Strawberry, now 38, failed a drug test _ and was
quickly suspended by the baseball commissioner for a year for
violating the baseball drug laws again. A year earlier he had
propositioned an undercover detective in Tampa, Fla., and had in
his wallet a small amount of cocaine _ along with photographs of
his wife and young children.
</P>
<P>
   And we followed Strawberry to earlier this month when he was
seen attending a sex club in Florida, which, in addition to being
questionable judgment on his part, may have also been off-limits
behavior because of his parole stemming from the sentencing on the
cocaine charge last year.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered, too, that he had decided to leave early from the
drug rehabilitation center he had been in for the last two months.
And then, grievously, it was learned that his colon cancer may have
returned.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been in the club only once, and momentarily,
while a photograph of him with an, at best, underdressed young
woman was seen nationwide. He said he left the rehab center to try
to play baseball again to earn a living for his family, amid rumors
that after earning in the neighborhood of $30 million in baseball,
he was broke. Maybe all of it is true, maybe none of it is, because
he has not always been honest when caught or confronted.
</P>
<P>
   The sadness with Strawberry is, of course, twofold. One is the
diminishment of what might have been one of the great careers in
baseball, from one kind of sickness that he might have had control
over. The other, to be sure, is the tragedy of the physical cancer
that he may well have had no control over.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, the manager who was a coach with the Mets in
Strawberry's first three years with the team, from 1983 to 1985,
watched the 6-foot-6-inch Strawberry arrive in the major leagues
with a talent for the ages and then show signs of squandering that
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been in places we shouldn't, and maybe done things
we shouldn't,'' Valentine said Sunday. ``But many of us say: `Whew,
that was close! I'm not going to do that again.' But Darryl had a
supernatural talent, and it may have made him believe he was
invincible. He was bigger than anyone else, he was faster than
anyone else, he was stronger than anyone else, and so many people
were telling him how great he was. Early on, he was skating on thin
ice but thought he was walking on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Hernandez, a teammate of Strawberry's for most of
Strawberry's career with the Mets, which ended in 1990, was himself
addicted to cocaine and, in a trial in 1985 spoke about the grip
that this ``devil on earth'' had on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to finally go cold turkey to beat it,'' Hernandez
said Sunday while at Shea Stadium for a Mets reunion. ``Some can
beat it, some can't. An addiction is a terrible, terrible thing. I
remember at one point hating it, but feeling unable to control it.
I feel sorry for Straw. Basically, I believe he's a good guy. And
I'm sure all of his so-called conversions have been genuine, but
then something else is working on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing about his not becoming the next Ted Williams, or
not living up to his potential, well, he's not the Lone Ranger.
It's happened to others _ it happened to me to a degree. And that's
hardly the important thing at this point for Strawberry. Now he has
to deal with the colon cancer again. Who cares now whether he could
have hit 500 home runs in his career, or broken Babe Ruth's
records?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all one can do _ should do _ is hope he gets
healthy again.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Politics as usual _ with its compromises,
casualties, and emotional costs _ caught up with Sen. John McCain
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters repeatedly tested his appetite for his own words,
asking, item by item, if he still believed all those nasty things
he had said about his former opponent for the Republican
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush. Over and over, he endorsed the man
he once derided as a phony reformer unprepared for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, one youthful audience here responded with boos,
derisive laughter, and cries of ``Drag him off!'' to what he
insisted was his ``sincere conviction'' that ``all Americans''
should support Bush. On the eve of Bush's National Convention,
McCain was beginning to seem downright conventional, a quality he
despises in politics.
</P>
<P>
   As the senator gathered on Sunday afternoon at a reception with
senior officials of the Bush campaign to formally release his
delegates to the governor, the moment and the message proved too
much. McCain had praised Bush for running a ``centrist, inclusive
campaign.'' He had urged his supporters to give the Bush campaign
``the same kind of enthusiasm and participation'' they had given
him, that had made him believe, for a time, he might be president.
Then he tried to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be grateful,'' McCain told the packed room,
before stopping to harshly clear his throat. He tried again: ``I
will never be able to _ I'll never be able to thank.'' He gave up,
eyes shining, as the room erupted in a full minute's applause
despite his repeated efforts to get back to business. At his side,
his wife Cindy began weeping, along with some of the delegates and
campaign staff, who had never seen tears from their boss.
</P>
<P>
   When he regained control of himself and the room and at last
expressed his gratitude, McCain declared ``This is a time for
celebration.'' Then, to groans and cries, he released his remaining
delegates _ roughly 150 _ to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coming before the four days of processed emotion that is a
modern political convention, McCain's raw moment left some
delegates shaken, even as rock music blared and confetti cannons
blasted the room. ``People really believed in him,'' said Ric
Barros, a lawyer from Massachusetts. ``It's like a death in the
family.'' Asked if he would support Bush, Barros said: ``In time.
Today, I just want to think about John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before McCain, Don Evans, the chairman of Bush's
campaign, praised the senator as ``my American hero'' _ though at
least one McCain aide rolled his eyes. Joe Allbaugh, the Bush
campaign manager, was also present, though he did not address the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp can afford to be gracious. Trailing McCain around
the margins of the convention here is like watching an episode of
``Survivor'' while knowing who has been voted off the island. The
only sense of suspense surrounding his appearances hangs over the
question of how far he will go in endorsing Bush _ and the only
surprise registered by his audiences has been over how far he has
gone.
</P>
<P>
   For his full-throated endorsement, McCain was booed on Sunday by
the sort of audience he usually enraptures, an uneasy assortment of
the disgruntled _ critics of the campaign finance system,
politics-as-usual, and much else _ gathered for a ``shadow
convention.'' Head down, McCain soldiered through his prepared
speech until the noise became too loud, and he looked up. ``If you
like I do not need to continue,'' he said evenly. But a wave of
applause from the generally supportive audience kept him going.
</P>
<P>
   McCain rode his ``Straight Talk Express'' up here on Saturday
for what he insisted was a fun reminder of how his campaign
``caught lightening in a bottle.'' It seemed more like a rolling
test of his humility. Asked on his bus if he still believed Bush
was a ``Pat Robertson Republican,'' McCain said quietly, ``No, no,
I don't believe that.'' To another oft-repeated question, he
insisted that his relationship with Bush was ``cordial'' or even
``very good.'' Repeatedly, he said that he expected to be
supporting Bush's re-election in 2004 and not running himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona senator's self-sacrifice had its limits. He
bristled when asked, for perhaps the hundredth time, whether he had
checked with the Bush campaign before putting his bus back on the
road. ``No,'' he shot back, ``because the last time I checked, I'm
a United States senator.'' He repeatedly reminded questioners that
he always promised to support his party's nominee _ a caveat that
made his endorsement sound more dutiful than heartfelt. But his
sense of humor stayed intact. When asked if he would accept a
position in a Bush cabinet, he said, as he contended with an
enormous soft-serve vanilla waffle cone, that the only job he
wanted was emperor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still admits to differences with Bush, including over
campaign finance reform. But he no longer declares that Bush should
adopt his position, instead noting, as he did at the shadow
convention, that ``we agree on many more issues than we disagree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has repeatedly acknowledged that he is walking a
tightrope, trying to retain an insurgent appeal while playing by
the rules of party politics. He remains extremely popular, which is
why Bush and scores of congressmen are clamoring for public shows
of his support.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters who turned out for the senator during the weekend
said that they understood. ``Everybody who's reasonable knows that
in order to make any change, you have to be incremental,'' said
George Leslie, who stood outside the shadow convention on Sunday
waiting for the senator and wearing a black T-shirt declaring
``Thank God I'm an Atheist.'' ``You have to support the system
you're in.''

JONES PUTS FINISHING TOUCH ON TRAMMELL'S MAGIC MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby J. Jones' final pitch of the game looked so
tantalizing, leaving his sweaty fingers and floating to the plate
as if it were a Frisbee. Fernando Tatis might as well have been a
character in a Bugs Bunny cartoon since he could have waved his bat
once and then twice as he waited for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it reached him, and Tatis swung mightily and missed.
The pitch was a curveball, and the scoreboard said it had traveled
65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is that kind of baffling pitcher, someone who can toy
with hitters when he is at his most effective. Jones, who had a
stint in the minor leagues last month, tossed a complete game, and
Bubba Trammell did a splendid imitation of Mike Bordick by smashing
a three-run homer in his first at-bat with the New York Mets to
guide them past the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-2, Sunday at Shea
Stadium for their sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jones struck out nine, including Jim Edmonds three times, walked
one and gave up four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell heard New Yorkers chant: ``Bub-ba! Bub-ba!'' for the
first time. ``Sure, it's special,'' Jones said. ``I'm just glad I
showed them the good Bobby Jones and not the early on, struggling
Bobby Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, who played right field while Derek Bell rested, joined
the party a day later than Bordick and Rick White, and earned the
first curtain call of his Mets career in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Benny Agbayani led off the first with a homer off
Garrett Stephenson , but it was quickly overshadowed by what
happened in the bottom of the second. With runners on first and
second, Trammell became the seventh Met to homer in his first
at-bat in the team's 39-year history and the second in two days.
</P>
<P>
   After Trammell rounded the bases, he gave high-fives to everyone
in the dugout except Bordick. The two new players, owners of homers
in their first at-bats with the Mets only 24 hours apart, hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what each other was thinking,'' Trammell said.
</P>
<P>
   When Valentine was asked the odds of what Bordick and Trammell
had achieved, he said: ``Kind of like getting in early on an IPO.
Immediate returns. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-0 lead, Jones avoided a speed bump in the fifth, gave
up one run in the sixth and then stifled the Cardinals until Ray
Lankford homered with two outs in the ninth. That merely gave him
the chance to mesmerize Tatis one final time. Jones threw the
fluttering 65-mph curveball, Tatis missed it and the Mets had one
more important moment in this evolving season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' Jones said, ``since I got the last
out in a game.'' &QL;

CONVENTION PROTESTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
and LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 HOUSTON CHRONICLE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As thousands of protesters took to the streets
here Sunday the only real confrontation was among themselves,
despite concerns that police might use force to keep demonstrators
at bay during the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, throughout the day of scheduled and unscheduled
protests, it seemed as if the Philadelphia police were going out of
their way to accommodate the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Sunday, there isn't much traffic,'' said Philadelphia
Police Commissioner John Timoney.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney quickly added that officers may not be so accommodating
Monday, the official start of the convention when an unpermitted
group plans to march down a busy street to the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's demonstrations, police allowed a last-minute
march by abortion rights advocates along a line of anti-abortion
picketers stretched over five blocks in the city's museum district,
miles from convention site at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the minor confrontation between protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers stood guard as the abortion rights group
protesters marched up and down the street taunting their
counterparts. They yelled, pointed and ripped placards from the
anti-abortion group's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Most in the anti-abortion line stood silently as verbal assaults
were hurled at them. Some prayed aloud when a few in the abortion
rights group yelled ``Keep your rosaries off my ovaries.''
</P>
<P>
   A few anti-abortion activists shouted back ``murderer'' as the
taunting group yelled at them nose-to-nose.
</P>
<P>
   Later there was a brief standoff between anti-police
demonstrators and about 40 uniformed officers wielding batons, but
after only minutes the officers turned and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman David Yarnell said the show of batons was not
meant to engage the protesters, only to warn that officers were
moving in.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until later that officers appeared wearing full riot
gear to reinforce police lines as the protesters left the police
station.
</P>
<P>
   These demonstrators did not have a permit, either. Earlier they
had been part of a massive peaceful march in a day when several
hundred groups _ including environmentalists, anti-death penalty
advocates, anarchists, anti-war groups, health care advocates _
gathered as Unity 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney estimated as many as 5,000 people took part in the march
and carnival-like rally afterward. But event organizer Leon Oboler
said park officials estimated as many as 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so exciting to be a part of these people who are not
rich Republicans,'' said Cindy Beringer who drove from Austin,
Texas, to march Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer, who opposes the death penalty, carried a life-size
cardboard picture of Gov. George W. Bush holding a gun. A card
pasted on the front read ``Stop me before I kill again,'' in
reference to the number of executions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Vaught, part of the Austin group planning to drive back
Sunday and Monday, said the long trip was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Bush to know that we're willing to come all the way to
Philadelphia to let him know we want a moratorium on the death
penalty,'' Vaught said.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers converged on a cordoned off block where vendors
hawked Philly cheesesteaks, pretzels and plenty of bottled water.
Those at the rally listened to speeches and music during the
daylong event that seemed more like a festival.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age protesters danced around a wagon, drumming on empty
water coolers and tin pans. Aboard a float designed to look like a
missile, anti-nuclear weapon protesters hosted a mudwrestling
match-up featuring actors wearing caricatures masks of Republican
presidential candidate Bush and Democratic rival Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators with the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade
burned an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about a dozen libertarians showed up to counter
protest the Unity 2000 march. To the other groups demands for
government-sponsored health care and stricter gun control laws, the
libertarian protesters shouted back, ``Government is evil'' and
chanted for ``More guns, less people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that not all young people are anti-corporation
and anti-trade,'' said Rhys Southan, a student at the University of
Texas in Austin here for the counterprotest.

McCAIN GREETED BY HOSTILE REACTION FOR SUPPORTING BUSH 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ John McCain drew choruses of boos and hisses
Sunday when he tried to play loyal supporter to his former
Republican presidential opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile reactions came from groups of McCain supporters and
political activists who were drawn to the Arizona senator's push
for government reform, both in Congress and during his spirited
campaign for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need every one of you to give (Bush's) campaign the same
amount of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary
campaign,'' McCain said during a meeting with his convention
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   When he said he was releasing them to support Bush, some
delegates applauded. Others booed or cried out: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was confronted by an even more hostile reaction earlier
when he praised Bush during a speech before the so-called Shadow
Convention, a gathering organized to air topics _ like campaign
finance reform _ that are likely to go unmentioned during this
week's GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   On the agenda for the alternative convention were a wide range
of issues, including global warming, campaign finance reform, and
American Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded enthusiastically and uniformly when McCain
spoke of change but was divided in its reaction when he launched
into a defense of Bush's bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obliged not by party loyalty but by sincere conviction to
urge all Americans to support my party's nominee, Gov. George
Bush,'' McCain said. He tried to continue but was drowned out by a
mixture of applause and loud boos.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain said he agreed with Bush on such issues as repairing
a flawed education system and reforming Social Security, several in
the audience started laughing and jeering.
</P>
<P>
   And as the senator praised Bush for challenging his opponent to
run a positive campaign, he was heckled by some in the crowd who
claimed he supported moving a Navajo tribe off their land to make
way for coal mining operation. Some protesters yelled: ``Save Black
Mesa.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibly annoyed, McCain told the crowd: ``If you'd like, I do
not need to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, convention sponsor Arianna Huffington walked onto
the stage, urged an end to the heckling and reminded the audience
of the forum's purpose. ``You know this is the convention where we
can hear everything with respect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain returned to the microphone and toward the end of his
address appeared to win over the crowd when he returned to the
issue of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the beneficiaries of a campaign finance system that is
nothing more than an elaborate influence-peddling scheme in which
both parties conspire to stay in office by selling the country to
the highest bidder,'' he said, eliciting applause.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events underscored the difficult balancing act McCain
has been trying to perform by claiming to be both a loyal
conservative Republican and a reformer who appeals to independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's announcement later that he was releasing his more than
200 delegates to support Bush, a move that was largely symbolic,
was an emotional moment for the former candidate and his most
committed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told the crowd that they had waged the ``good fight'' and
that the primary race had made ``Gov. Bush a better candidate.''
When McCain, a former Vietnam War hero, tried to thank the
delegates he choked up, eliciting loud cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that the Bush and McCain campaigns had been working to
overcome lingering anomosities from the hard fought primary
campaign, top Bush campaign officials were on hand for McCain's
release of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, Bush's campaign chairman, called McCain ``a true
American hero.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all McCain supporters and aides were as willing to put
aside their anger. As Bush officials heaped praise on McCain, one
of the senator's aides walked past reporters and muttered loudly:
``I think I'm going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorardeynne Drozdowski, one of McCain's alternate delegates from
Michigan, said she still may cast her vote during the convention
for McCain. ``He's a candidate who represented my beliefs and
philosophies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Larrivee, a delegate from Massachusetts, said he would
``go for Bush, but not because I really want to. I think the
country would be better off with McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican delegates will grudgingly support Bush,
Marshall Witmann, an analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said the Texas governor will have a harder time winning
over the former McCain supporters who are unaffiliated with either
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal with the independent voters will not be closed until
November,'' said Wittman, who served as a McCain adviser during the
primary election season.

O'NEILL AND YANKS FLASH OLD FORM AGAINST TWINS
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Every time Paul O'Neill tries to beat out an
infield hit, he gradually slows after crossing the first-base bag,
stops, bends at the knees and then shakes out his legs, as if he
wants to make sure all his parts are still in working order.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the very few signs that O'Neill is 37 years old.
It is impossible to tell by his production: He had three hits and
three runs batted in Sunday, increasing his batting average to
.307, as the Yankees beat Minnesota, 7-4, and completed a road trip
in which they won 5 of 7 games.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez drove in three runs Sunday with a
first-inning double, staking Andy Pettitte (11-6) to a 4-0 lead.
Chuck Knoblauch, hampered by a sore elbow, returned to the lineup
and collected two hits and two walks, scoring two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won 18 of their last 26 games, aided by the
additions of Denny Neagle, David Justice, Glenallen Hill and Jose
Vizcaino. They will probably add more players before Monday's 4
p.m. trade deadline, if one of two major proposals involving the
San Diego Padres goes through. ``Coming into this road trip, you
got the feeling everything was starting to come together,'' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has 120 hits and 72 RBI after 100 games, which puts him on a
pace to finish the year with 194 hits _ that would represent a
career high _ and 117 RBI, a total that would match his career
high. He had 12 hits in 26 at-bats on the road trip and 12 RBI,
driving in a run in the first, fourth and sixth innings today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so solid,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said. ``He
is right now really having good plate coverage. He's really hitting
the ball sharply; he's knocked in a lot of runs on this trip. I
think he'll hit until he decides to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill spoke vaguely of retirement last season, suggesting at
one point that he might quit before the 2000 season. This spring,
O'Neill said he would evaluate that option from year to year. His
current contract expires at the end of this season. Perhaps,
O'Neill said wistfully, he could play with the Cincinnati Reds in
2001, if the Yankees were not interested in keeping him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees are expected to approach O'Neill about a
contract extension in the next two months. Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager, would not address the question of the
extension Sunday, but he said: ``He's done a good job. He's been
steady, like he always is. He's someone you can count on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the best baseball blooper highlights is a clip of O'Neill
when he played for Cincinnati. He charged a base hit, dropped it,
tried to pick it up again and dropped it, before his temper finally
overcame him and a frustrated O'Neill punted the ball _ incredibly,
right to the cutoff man.
</P>
<P>
   A gaffe he made Sunday will not have the staying power of that
mistake, but it did cause great hilarity in the Metrodome. In the
sixth inning, O'Neill scrambled in to pick up a ground-ball hit,
took the ball out of his glove and tried to throw _ but the ball
squirted out of his hand, like a water balloon, flipping high into
the air and falling about 20 feet or so in front of him. Both
runners took an extra base on his first error of the season, and
when O'Neill's blunder was replayed, laughter erupted from the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill turned and glanced seriously at the scoreboard; his
acute self-deprecating humor kicked in after the game. ``It must be
the way I throw the ball or something,'' O'Neill said. ``Definitely
wasn't one of my finer moments. Definitely wasn't a web gem.''

IN PHILADELPHIA, CONVENTION PROTESTERS STIR UP MOSTLY NOSTALGIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Devotees of lively political protest, a fading
art in recent decades, had something to cheer for and against on
Sunday as an eclectic, ragtag assortment of causes snaked and
howled through the heart of this city, giving pause to Republican
conventioneers intent on decorum.
</P>
<P>
   A rich assortment of several thousand dissenters _ all of them
orderly, many rambunctious _ dominated the eve of the convention as
marchers consciously sought to revive some old-time 60s rhythms and
jingles, but with strategic updating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho!'' began one group, a generation removed from
the old ``LBJ'' punchline, who bellowed a coda edited for current
events: ``HMO has got to go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we want?'' came one marching question. And the answer
(``Freedom!'' in the old days) came back: ``Health care!''
</P>
<P>
   For all the altered stakes, veteran witnesses of the antiwar
demonstrations of the 60s felt a pang of nostalgia. Particularly
when guerrilla-theater demonstrators capered past with large
papier-mache heads of piggish plutocrats and Darth Vader
caricatures of politicians. Chanting denunciations of corporate
wealth and the two-party system, they happily rose to the bait of a
few fundamentalist Christian counterdemonstrators lobbing bullhorn
taunts from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, environmentalists, get a life!'' boomed John Franklin,
wielding a printed billboard that judgment day was near. ``God will
take care of the trees, then he'll take care of you on the Last
Day, for all the clear-cutting of babies,'' he said mixing the
abortion issue in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers offered as good as they got, several offering an
obscene blend of gesture and advice. Franklin, a 58-year-old
veteran of varied 60s protests, admitted later in an interview:
``At least the kids are trying, scratching away, although they
don't quite have it. It's like watching a cartoon, but it's
nostalgic. They're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Arms outstretched, Michelle Christedes, intervened as a peaceful
parade monitor between the caustic Franklin and an unshaven young
man in a sundress who drew tension-tinged laughter by impishly
shouting contentions about the sexuality of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace was maintained. Other causes strutted by:
opposition to the death penalty, to sweat shops, to the antimissile
defense movement and a score more, many of them clearly pressed by
crowds of galvanized young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for them a long time,'' said Christedes, a
53-year-old psychology consultant who said she felt some of the
fury and swagger of her youth, during which she marched against the
Vietnam war as a doctoral candidate at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old me-generation sold out,'' she said, hoping for better.
Not all the evidence was encouraging. One young man, dressed
melodramatically in the black garb and red bandana of the
self-styled anarchists, brandished a bottle of Gatorade and a cell
phone on his way to the rhetorical ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   Safely beyond all sight and sound of the demonstrators, Rand S.
Larson, a convention delegate, sipped a rum and diet cola at the
poshest new oasis in town, the Ritz-Carlton bar that just opened in
a palatial six-story marble bank building on Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen any of the protest,'' said Larson, a first-time
delegate from Richmond, Vt., who sported a bright ``VIP'' tag atop
his necklace of credentials. ``I don't really fear any trouble from
the demonstrators although my wife and 11-year-old son are coming
down and I hope they have a good, safe time,'' he said. He savored
his drink after working for days to tamp down dissension as a
member of the party platform committee. ``We dealt with all the
right issues in a climate of respect,'' he insisted of the
platform, smooth as a runway for the candidates' landing.
</P>
<P>
   As a man strolled past the bar with one of the day's least
contentious T-shirts (``Dartmouth Fall Foliage Squash
Tournament''), the Ritz's Sunday brunchers seemed all gentled-out
and ready to convene, far removed from the dissenting crowd on the
other side of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside, however, Joe Bramante, a free-lance Democrat from
Derry, N.H., greeted delegates with a big, bluff hello, then asked,
``So, how's the economy?'' Before Republicans could answer,
Bramante spun a hand-printed sign on its stanchion: ``I am Bill
Clinton's Number One Fan!'' And he told each of them about the
booming economy as they sought escape.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east in the city, tourists approaching the Liberty Bell
were distracted by a display of hundreds of pairs of shoes lined up
as part of the Silent March demonstration, the empty shoes
representing the thousands killed annually with handguns. A
barefoot, grandmotherly woman walked stolidly past, bearing her own
printed protest: ``Too angry, too female to vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's larger march of dissenters presented a gathering of
various causes, from NOW to the NAACP, from folk-singing unionists
to animals rights demonstrators, under an umbrella label called
Unity 2000. Some self-proclaimed student anarchists marched amiably
with the larger parade, but they have hinted they may try to act up
by midweek with some hit-and-run street initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far so good,'' said Police Commissioner John F. Timoney,
who has been darting between demonstrations as a member of the
police bike patrol in helmet, shorts, and monogrammed ``P.C.''
shirt. ``But it's early and you never get cocky,'' he said, noting
other potentially more troublesome marches begin on Monday. ``We
can work out deals, even if we don't quite like the deals,'' the
commissioner said in emphasizing flexibility as his chief weapon
for getting through convention week.
</P>
<P>
   This was demonstrated on Saturday evening as the police quickly
put aside confrontation and became escorts of an ad hoc march of
200 teen-agers who showed up on Chestnut Street loudly devoted to
the cause of virginity. ``Free sex kills!'' they warned. ``Honk if
you're a virgin!'' they pleaded as restaurantgoers stared from
sidewalk cafes for a passing moment before turning back to their
food.

CHENEY DEFENDS VOTING RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Delivering a low-key performance Sunday in his
first solo rally as George W. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney
defended his voting record in Congress and promised that he and
Bush would restore respect to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by the ``Rocky'' musical theme and a red, white and blue
confetti drop on his arrival in Philadelphia for the Republican
National Convention, Cheney spoke for only about four minutes to a
crowd that had waited for as long as two hours in a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him were most of the country's Republican governors,
including several he beat out for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket,
and convention delegates from his home state of Wyoming, who will
help nominate him for vice president this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who spent 25 years in Congress as a presidential aide,
congressman from Wyoming and secretary of defense under his running
mate's father, former President Bush, said he was ``proud of those
years there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially proud of my record, voting to support smaller
government, lower taxes, stronger national defense _ policies of
Ronald Reagan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has been on the defensive about his congressional voting
record since Bush tapped him for his running mate last Tuesday and
Democrats started hammering away at Cheney's votes in Congress in
the late 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has particularly been criticized for voting against such
things as Head Start, a ban on armor-piercing, cop-killer bullets
and a resolution to free Nelson Mandela, the then-imprisoned hero
of the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa. Democrats have
used those votes to question the Bush-Cheney ticket's
``compassionate conservative'' credentials and efforts to appeal to
moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Cheney did a round of national TV interviews,
explaining that many of his votes were designed to cut spending and
reduce the huge deficit that then loomed over the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a big deficit in the 80s. Now we've got a
surplus. So we can afford to do some things from the standpoint of
programs and support as Governor Bush has indicated that we
couldn't have done 20 years ago,'' he said on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't apologize for my record. It's there. It's my
record. I'm proud of it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC-TV's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,''
Cheney indicated he voted against Mandela's release because the
African National Congress that he headed was ``then viewed as a
terrorist organization.``
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cheney said on CNN's Larry King Live that he wouldn't
vote now against Head Start, a preschool program for low-income
children.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Washington insider told the Philadelphia rally that
he also valued the past five years that he has spent in the ``real
world'' of private business in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about being out in the real world ... away from that
hothouse environment in Washington, is the fact that you're out
there where people are building companies and communities, creating
jobs, inventing technologies that are transforming our lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised governors, such as Bush, for making government
work.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush had demonstrated an ability ``to unite the
Republican Party and to reach across the aisle and bring aboard the
discerning Democrats to achieve great things. That's what we're
trying to re-establish in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he and Bush ``want to make Americans proud again by
giving them a president they can respect.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party's united, our purpose is clear, our cause is just,
and Gov. George Bush will be the next president of the United
States,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney's criticisms of the Clinton-Gore administration
were mostly indirect and mild, he was introduced by Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who openly attacked Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's been vice president for eight years. Tell me, what's
he done? Where's his leadership? What issue do you associate with
him as a leader?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors attending the rally included Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, John Engler of Michigan and Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, all believed to have been considered as possible running
mates by Bush.

WHITMAN IS ONSTAGE, BUT HER ROLE IS LESSENED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd and 3rd grafs with actions at ceremony)  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ For Gov. Christie Whitman, the contrast to four
years ago could not have been more stark.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:55 p.m. Sunday night, the New Jersey governor was took
center stage at the ``Welcome America'' festivities here and spoke
for 68 seconds. And alongside Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, threw
a switch lighting the Ben Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   With that, before the Republican National Convention had even
begun, Whitman's official duties for the week were done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Whitman was on Bob Dole's short list of potential
running mates. This year, as Whitman has had to acknowledge in one
interview after another, she wasn't even asked to submit personal
background material to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 she was thought of as an eventual presidential candidate
in her own right. Now, if Bush wins, Whitman's prospects are widely
seen as limited to a Cabinet post, at best, or maybe an
ambassadorship _ the political equivalent of being put out to
pasture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Convention in San Diego four years
ago, Whitman, who shared leadership duties with Bush, was on stage
every night. She delivered a prime-time speech, and she was mobbed
by autograph seekers wherever she went. Now, the only people
following Whitman around are her state police bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's stature has been on the decline since 1997, when she
vetoed a ban on the late-term abortion procedure that its opponents
call partial-birth abortion, though it had been passed by both
Republican-controlled houses of the state Legislature. That an
appellate court just last week overturned the ban, passed after the
Legislature overrode her veto, would prove small consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sealed her political future,'' said John Tomicki, a
lobbyist for right-wing causes in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Whitman, despite her national celebrity,
failed to win a majority of the votes in her re-election bid, and
barely squeaked past her Democratic challenger, James McGreevey,
the little-known mayor of Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the governor's national image has been marred by
the controversy over racial profiling by state troopers. And her
political potency within New Jersey was called into question once
again when she abruptly canceled a run for the Senate last fall,
saying the burden of raising money was too great.
</P>
<P>
   By this year, even Whitman's most ardent supporters held little
hope that she would be given a spot on the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd become the bete noire of the pro-life movement,'' said
former Rep. Dick Zimmer, a Republican running to recapture the 12th
District seat from Rep. Rush Holt. ``So that even if Governor Bush
were inclined to choose a pro-choice running mate, it probably
wouldn't have been her.''
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of Whitman here lamented the storm of criticism she
endured this month after a snapshot surfaced showing her grinning
as she frisked a black man, apparently at the urging of a state
trooper, while on a ride-along in Camden in 1996. ``It's one of the
most unfair things in politics I've ever seen,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   At least there were no ``I'm frisky for Christie'' buttons for
sale among the hundreds with Bush's smiling face. But the image
seemed to hover like a too-obvious punch line upon any mention of
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyes rolled, for example, when the governor told New Jersey
delegates on Saturday that Sunday night's festivities on the Camden
waterfront _ the only part of the city that has been rebuilt _
would ``show off the kind of good things that happen when
Republicans get involved in cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Whitman, 53, is doing her best to sound content with her
role at this convention, and to appear relevant. She tried hard in
several early interviews to pump up the Republican ticket, minimize
the importance of its platform and change the subject from her
party's opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   During the convention, the governor noted, she will be appearing
on more than 20 television programs. And she says she takes solace
from her continued cachet as a talking head.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having been the co-chair, to then speak on Monday
afternoon at 3:30 holds no great attraction,'' Whitman said. ``If
you're not speaking in prime time, it's better to do the kinds of
things I'm doing. And the fact that they've asked me to do so much
of that is, to me, an indication that there's still something that
goes along with my name.''

BUSH'S WARM-UP SPEAKERS ROAST CLINTON, GORE AT RALLY 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE ASH, Ohio _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush may want his convention to present a positive message to the
nation, but the warm-up speakers at his rally Sunday fired up the
crowd with old-style, red-meat rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who thought you'd see Microsoft split up and the Clintons
stick together,'' U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, told the crowd of
2,000 at a replica of the Cincinnati Reds former stadium, Crosley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Area radio host Bill Cunningham of WLW-AM in Cincinnati told the
crowd to ignore a heavy rain as they waited for Bush to arrive at
the rally. He hammered repeatedly on President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore with references to the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. Gore is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years of Clinton/Gore, America needs a bath, and
we're getting one right now,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham likened Bush to former President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago a governor road out of the West on a mighty
steed and he scoured those damn Democrats out of the White House,''
Cunningham said. ``Let's elect another governor from the West to
scour out the White House of the filth and degradation. God bless
America!''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Ash Mayor Jim Sumner told the crowd that it is time for a
change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready for your daughter to serve as an intern?''
Sumner said, referring to the White House job Lewinsky held when
she had an affair with the president. ``Are you ready for a return
of integrity and morals to the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, Cunningham and Sumner set a tone that gave a harsh edge
to Bush's standard stump speech conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put my hand on the Bible, January 2001, I will swear
not only to uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the
honor and the integrity of the office to which I have been elected,
so help me God,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is touring some key battleground states on his way from
Texas to Philadelphia, the site of the Republican National
Convention. Bush is spending Sunday and today in Ohio, a state that
has voted for every presidential winner since 1948 and has not gone
to a Republican presidential candidate since Bush's father won in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's arrival was delayed for about 30 minutes when a
73-year-old woman collapsed in the audience. Helen Geiger of
Cincinnati later died.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's bus rolled onto the baseball field, the theme from
``Chariots of Fire'' played while fireworks burst in the sky. As
Bush walked from the bus to the podium before the Crosley Field
scoreboard, the loudspeakers blared the theme from the baseball
movie, ``The Natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush from 1989-99 was one of the owners of the Texas Rangers
baseball team. He spent the night at the home of his former team
partner, financier Bill DeWitt of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to Philadelphia, and we're on our way to
victory,'' Bush said, referring to the Republican National
Convention where he will secure the GOP presidential nomination
this week.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and family continued their vacation under cloudy
skies on the North Carolina coast, the Democratic National
Committee kept the pressure on Bush by releasing a new 30-second ad
attacking running mate Dick Cheney's voting record from two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ad says, ``Cheney was one of only eight members of Congress
to oppose the Clean Water Act, one of the few to vote against Head
Start (a preschool program for low-income children). He even voted
against the School Lunch Program ... against health insurance for
people who lost their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney appeared on all five national television talk shows
Sunday morning, criticizing the Democrats for focusing on
``trivia'' from his past, and defending his record. ``They're
spending all of their time poring over my voting record from 20
years ago,'' Cheney told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did not apologize Sunday for his votes, though he now
concedes he might vote differently than he did in the 1980s. Cheney
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he frequently voted against
legislation in those big deficit years because he thought the
requested funding was excessive.

REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TRYING FOR A SOFTER IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The anointing of Texas Governor George W. Bush as
his party's standard-bearer begins Monday as Republicans gathered
at their quadrennial convention attempt to stamp an inviting smile
on their candidate and their party over four days of highly
scripted proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love filled to capacity Sunday as
thousands of protesters marched in the streets, an alternative
``shadow'' convention booed Senator John S. McCain's warm words for
Bush, and hundreds of delegates from around the nation welcomed the
presumptive vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney also was the subject of far less flattering attention
Sunday as the Democrats launched a 30-second ad blasting the former
Wyoming congressman for extremist views and for votes cast in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Democratic commercial, airing in 17 battleground
states, Cheney is attacked for opposing the Clean Water Act, Head
Start, the school lunch program, and health insurance for workers
who lost jobs. He also has been taken to task for voting against a
resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela while Mandela
was imprisoned in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, secretary of defense under President Bush, spent much of
the day defending himself from the onslaught of criticism from
Democrats, appearing on all three major television networks' Sunday
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back and looking at 2,000 votes, I might find a couple I
would do differently,'' Cheney conceded on CBS's ``Face The
Nation.'' ``But I don't have any apologies for, nor do I plan to
change my position on, those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bush campaign quickly attacked Vice President Al Gore
for what it called his love of negative politics as several recent
national polls show him trailing Bush in the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a sign of desperation that Al Gore would distort
a good man's record, and I think it'll backfire,'' Bush spokesman
Scott McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush held a single public event Sunday, speaking to
several hundred supporters in a ballpark on the outskirts of
Cincinnati. It was a remarkably light schedule even by his own
standards; Bush aides said he was blocking out time to write two
short speeches he plans to deliver to the Republican convention via
satellite, including one Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the massive First Union Center will be the setting
for speeches by Bush's wife, Laura, and Colin L. Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Also briefly featured Monday will be Conna Craig, a Boston-area
woman who was abandoned at birth, put in foster care, and later
adopted. Craig heads the Institute for Children, which promotes
adoption for children in foster care and serves as an example of
what Bush likes to call compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the convention will feature people who are either
helping society, like Craig, or who will praise Bush's character,
like Jan Bullock, whose late husband worked closely with Bush even
though he was the Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The point, according to GOP operatives, is to soften the
Republican edges and reach out to voters who have been turned off
to the party in the past. In particular, Bush is determined to
avoid the pitfalls that his father, President Bush, experienced at
the 1992 convention in Houston. Then, delegates hissed and hooted
at journalists, and strident speeches by Patrick J. Buchanan and
several Christian conservative ministers created a climate that
damaged the reelection hopes of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to the base is, when you're talking about Bush,
talk this way,'' said John J. Pitney, a political science professor
at Claremont McKenna College in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitney said the Republicans risk overdoing the gentle tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger if they try too hard is that it's not going to look
inclusive; it's just going to look phony,'' said Pitney.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Card, the former Massachusetts state lawmaker who is
running the convention, is resolute that the party and its
candidate are on the right course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People complain when there's too much hardball, too many
hatchets out there,'' Card said. ``This is a significant departure
from the past. It's important we show America exactly what Governor
Bush wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats have their way, voters will look at his record
in Texas to decide how he would govern as president.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that effort comes in the form of a self-described
``Truth Squad,'' 20 Texans _ teachers, parents, educators, and
elected officials who arrived here Sunday saying they plan to warn
America of what they consider George Bush's failed leadership and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Paul Reveres of the 21st century,'' said state
Represenative Lon Burnam of Fort Worth. ``Bush has a five-year
record that shows he doesn't care anything about the working
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, sponsored by the Democratic National Committee,
contended that Bush failed on environmental protection and on
providing for the health and well-being of children. Under Bush,
according to the group, Texas ranked 48th on the list of best
states in which to raise a child. They criticized the governor for
fighting efforts to expand coverage for the Children Health
Insurance Program, as well as opposing an increase in the national
minimum wage _ although the state has more than 1 million workers
who would benefit from such an increase.
</P>
<P>
   While the four-day convention and accompanying festivities are
set up to honor and scrutinize Bush, McCain, the Arizona senator
who gave the Texan a hard run in the primaries, is receiving his
share of the spotlight as well.
</P>
<P>
   After a ballyhooed bus trip on his ``Straight Talk Express''
from Washington to Philadelphia on Saturday, McCain continued to
keep a high profile. He began with a television appearance, a less
than smooth speech at the ``shadow convention,'' a book signing,
and a reception for the delegates he won in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, McCain maintained, as he has for weeks, that his
tightly packed, interview-heavy convention schedule was not about
himself, but about Bush, to whose election McCain has vowed to
devote himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has declared his support for Bush continually over the past
two days. But at the shadow convention, organized by conservative
commentator Arianna Huffington, Common Cause, and other watchdog
groups, McCain's audience ranged from loyal Republicans to
advocates for legal marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   There, McCain's advocacy of campaign finance reform was quite
popular with the audience, most of whom greeted him with a standing
ovation. But when he launched into his list of what he said were
Bush's considerable talents, he was jeered for bringing party
politics to the event. People yelled ``Get him off!'' and ``Gong!
Gong! Gong!'' when McCain said he salutes Bush ``for challenging
his opponent to run a positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever McCain goes these days, the events of this year's
primary contest, and the question of his future ambitions, follow.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that McCain was asked about his comment during the
primaries that Bush was a ``Pat Robertson Republican,'' and his
claims that Christian conservatives were hijacking the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   He was sorry for what he said about Bush, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I meant,'' he said, ``was, I am the superior candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the convention progresses this week, police are expecting
more and more protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a mass of demonstrators representing at least a dozen
disparate causes took to the streets. Police shepherded a parade of
hundreds marching through downtown under banners supporting
abortion rights, relaxed drug laws, the elimination of racism, the
destruction of military weapons, and militant feminism.
</P>
<P>
   There were elaborate floats, papier-mache characters and a loud
protester who seized on an incident here earlier this month by
bellowing over a bullhorn, ``Philadelphia ain't free; stop police
brutality!''
</P>
<P>
   In their midst, a lonely man walked the same streets on stilts,
carrying a placard that declared, ``I have no political agenda.''

FLEISHER CONTINUES SENIOR TOUR DOMINANCE
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ It was an exaggeration, but it made a point. All
through the rain and the slop of the final day of the Lightpath
Long Island Classic Senior PGA tournament Sunday, it was a battle
between Bruce Fleisher, Dana Quigley and Allen Doyle. They started
the day as the leaders, were put together as a threesome, and
finished 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three guys,'' Quigley said, ``when we all turned 50 we were
pretty much broke, and now we're out there competing for millions
of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher's status as the Senior Tour's top money winner was
enhanced with Sunday's $225,000 winner's check thanks to his
closing 3-under 69, which gave him a three-day total of 198 and the
victory at the Meadow Brook Club. His 18-under total _ a record for
the Lightpath _ gave him two strokes on Quigley (who shot a 67
Sunday) and three on Doyle (69).
</P>
<P>
   This continuing senior saga of second chances spotlighted those
three _ but it has also been a boon for many others on the Tour.
Fleisher, though, personifies what this tour has done for an
assortment of players. He played on the regular PGA Tour for almost
30 years and won one tournament. He joined it after winning the
U.S. Amateur title but then had limited success as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, though, he was a rookie sensation with seven
victories last year. And with four victories this season, he has
vaulted to the earnings lead with more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three guys without any pedigree _ without any credentials,
certainly _ were competing for all that money,'' Quigley said. ``I
guess you can call us Larry, Curly, Moe.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley never earned $40,000 on the regular tour but has just
passed the million-dollar mark for the third consecutive year as a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Fleisher, there was a tiredness about him after it was
over. He said he had not been home for 10 weeks and had been
looking forward to ending this tournament as soon as it began. He
admitted that last year's seven victories _ bringing most of the
$2.5 million he earned _ had taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was not fun,'' he explained. ``I won today with my
heart. I'm tired. I don't want to be overwhelmed by it, controlled
by it, as I was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher may have been playing down how well he performed in
successfully defending the title he won as a rookie. But neither
Quigley nor Doyle was having any of it. For Quigley, who entered
the final round four strokes behind and said he planned to charge
from the beginning, there was a disappointment on the par-5 first
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out real aggressive _ I hit a great drive over the
trees on 1 and knocked it on the green in two _ and three-putted,''
he said. ``That kind of took a little sting out of the way I
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, meanwhile, eagled the par-5 third hole. His lead was
never fewer than two strokes, and he was steady, if disappointing
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wet, kind of sloppy, and when you're leading you have
to prove to somebody you can do it,'' Fleisher said. ``These are
the demons you deal with, thousands of people watching, people at
home, all armchair quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, though, who started the day three back, saw none of that
in Fleisher's game. Rather, he said: ``He's tough when he's in
front. You knew you couldn't shoot 3 under and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, like Quigley, never won on the regular tour. But like
Quigley, he will pass $1 million for this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   And why do players like these become such instant hits when they
turn 50 and join the seniors? Quigley joined the group in 1997 and
Doyle was a rookie last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we have a little more fire in the belly,'' Doyle said.
``Maybe the more famous players don't work as hard as we do. The
three of us, when we were in our 40s, we were scrambling for places
to play.''

POWELL TO CALL DELEGATES TO JOIN CRUSADE FOR YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ATTN: News Analysis
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The idea that retired General Colin L. Powell is
addressing the Republican National Committee Monday night makes
most of the delegates here deliriously happy. The actual words he
will speak may make many of them immensely uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   For General Powell _ the self-made man of destiny who had the
courage, character, and, above all, the stubbornness to defy
expectations and insist on his own destiny _ has come to town to
tell the delegates what they do not want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, reared in South Bronx by parents from Jamaica, is a
Republican by choice, not by birth. He is, moreover, that most
unusual breed of partisan: He believes in the big concepts that
have animated the party throughout its history, but he is skeptical
of many of the small, contemporary ones that have won it office and
power in contemporary times.
</P>
<P>
   And so Monday night he will tell the delegates that he believes
in affirmative action, that he believes in abortion rights, that he
disapproves of some of the harsh words and harsh actions that often
issue forth from the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not come here merely to scold, which a lesser man
could do. He has come here to challenge, which is what only a hero
can do.
</P>
<P>
   In a convention with no plot lines, no antagonists, no
confrontations, and, of course, no drama, the GOP scriptwriters
nonetheless found room for a hero. Powell, a graduate of New York
City's public schools and of City College and a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will challenge the party, every bit as
vigorously as he has challenged the barriers that he did not permit
to contain him and the stereotypes that he did not permit to define
him.
</P>
<P>
   He will tell the party that it needs to live up to its heritage
as the party of Abraham Lincoln. He believes, according to those
closest to him, that he has a special role: conscience of the
party. But he believes that he must play that role differently from
the way the Democrats' conscience, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, plays
his.Jackson has sought votes. Powell never has.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is known by the role he has chosen _ and the one that he
has refused.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be president, or vice president. (Maybe secretary of
state, but that is another story.) He will, however, be a symbol of
American opportunity and achievement, of American military prowess,
of integrity not only in theory but also (and this is the
difference the military made in Powell's life) in action.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who oversaw American military response to 28 crises
including the Persian Gulf War of 1991, believes above all in the
idea of leadership, and he believes that the responsibility of a
leader is to challenge the accepted tenets of his time, and of his
party. It would be easy to talk about voluntarism _ one of his
biggest themes _ and say that voluntarism is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will say that prosperity is not enough, especially
when it is unevenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as head of a service organization called America's Promise,
he is pursuing action in a different sphere. He has concluded that
young people _ you can expect to hear this very line Monday night _
are ``America's promise,'' and he's said that American society owes
children the presence of caring adults in their lives, safe places
for non-school hours, healthy starts, marketable skills, and
opportunities to serve.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be done by government alone. It can't be done by
charitable organizations or faith-based organizations alone.
</P>
<P>
   He has borrowed the metaphor Dwight D. Eisenhower used for war _
``crusade'' _ and has applied it to a war of a different sort. In a
season in which all the parties are talking about children and the
future, Powell has undertaken what he calls ``a crusade for
youth,'' and he's brought to it the passion that George W. Bush and
Al Gore have applied to politics.
</P>
<P>
   It has placed him where Bush and Gore (and Ralph Nader and
Patrick J. Buchanan) would like the voters to believe they are:
above politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin is a soldier, but he is also a statesman,'' said Kenneth
Duberstein, a onetime White House chief of staff under Ronald
Reagan and a close friend of Powell's.
</P>
<P>
   So Powell will be a soldier in the Republican army; he believes,
after all, in less government and less taxation, which plants him
firmly in the embrace of the GOP. But he will also be a statesman;
his rhetoric will be firm but gentle. He will not let the delegates
feel above reproach. And he will not let them conclude that the
hard work of helping the poor and the striving is beneath them.

ABRAHAM PAIS, PHYSICIST AND SCIENCE HISTORIAN, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.M., Ill., N.J., Texas, Mass.)   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abraham Pais, a physicist who helped build the conceptual
foundations of the modern theory of elementary particles, then
became a science historian and wrote one of the most acclaimed of
all biographies of Einstein, died Friday in Copenhagen. He was 82
and was a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his son, Joshua Pais, who is
an actor in New York. Pais said his father generally spent part of
the year in Copenhagen, where his wife, Ida Nicolaisen, is a
research fellow at the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Pais (pronounced PICE), born to Jewish parents in the
Netherlands, received his Ph.D. in Amsterdam on July 9, 1941, just
days before the Nazis banned the awarding of academic degrees to
Jews. He eventually went into hiding and managed to survive the war
even after his capture by the Gestapo in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Working at institutions in Denmark and the United States after
the war, Pais counted among his immediate colleagues some of
history's most famous scientists, including Einstein, Niels Bohr
and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Pais' own theoretical work plumbed some
of the profound implications of the numerous particle discoveries
made in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But he became best known for the book he published in 1982, ``
`Subtle Is the Lord' The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein.''
The title referred to a remark by Einstein on his personal creed:
``Subtle is the Lord, but malicious he is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pais wrote that when asked to explain the remark, Einstein had
replied: ``Nature hides her secret because of her essential
loftiness, but not by means of ruse.''
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly easy to read with its mixture of scientific
equations and biographical narrative, the book won critical acclaim
and became an instant classic among scientists, who said they felt
that it captured the essence of their intellectual culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the best biography of Einstein ever written,''
said Hans Bethe, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at Cornell, who
also praised the biography of Bohr that Pais later wrote. ``He had
the ability to really think himself into the minds of these two
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weinberg, a physicist at the University of Texas, who
also won a Nobel Prize, called the Einstein book a masterpiece and
said Pais had both chronicled and participated in some of the most
important scientific currents of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of a generation of European physicists who came to
the United States in the 1930s and 1940s and really changed
American science, bringing from Europe a kind of worldliness and
sophistication,'' Weinberg said. ``That was a great generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Pais was born on May 19, 1918, to Jeseja and Kaatje
Pais, both elementary school teachers. In a memoir, Pais described
his childhood as carefree and wrote, ``At school I became a smart,
rather arrogant kid, always learning fast, especially arithmetic.''
He was generally at the top of his class, doing poorly only in
physical education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he had little interest in physics until being captivated by
two lectures on the subject given by a visitor to the University of
Amsterdam, George E. Uhlenbeck, a Dutch-American physicist who had
been a co-discoverer of a crucial property of the electron called
spin.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Abraham Pais was busy with theoretical research on
subatomic particles and fields. After receiving his doctorate, he
worked at teaching jobs, but went into hiding in March 1943 after
the Nazis began deporting Dutch Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Partly with the help of a non-Jewish friend, Tineke Buchter,
Pais hid in a series of houses in the city, narrowly escaping
capture at one point as he crouched in an attic behind a secret
panel that would not close properly. A Gestapo member, searching
the attic, shone a bright flashlight directly against the panel.
``I could see the light through the crack,'' Pais later wrote. ``I
can still see that light even as I write these lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A close friend arrested along with him died at the hands of the
Nazis, as did his sister, Annie, but he and his parents survived.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he worked briefly in Copenhagen at what is now
called the Niels Bohr Institute, then was recruited to the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., by Oppenheimer,
its director. In 1963, he moved to Rockefeller University, where he
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Although as a physicist Pais showed few signs of his later
interest in history, ``he was always a literary and literate man
and expressed himself well in various languages,'' said Francis
Low, a retired physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who knew Pais in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Pais proposed a concept called ``associated
production'' to explain why certain particles lived for
unexpectedly long times before decaying. The particles, he
suggested, were produced rapidly in pairs, but neither could decay
quickly on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The particles did turn out to be produced in slowly decaying
pairs, though for reasons that were not fully explained until later
work by Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, a
Nobel Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   Pais collaborated with Gell-Mann in a theoretical paper in 1955
showing that what seemed to be a single particle could actually be
a sort of superposition of two different particles, each with a
different lifetime and decay mode.
</P>
<P>
   A consequence of the strange laws of quantum mechanics, the
prediction eventually led to an experiment by James Cronin and Val
Fitch in 1964 that won them both a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the finest theoretical papers ever written,''
Cronin, who is at the University of Chicago, said in an interview.
``It kind of gives you goose bumps, like a fine piece of music.''
The paper, Cronin said, was remarkable for ``the simplicity of the
arguments and the immensity of the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pais' early recognition that all of the apparently different
particles in nature might be arranged in a sort of periodic table,
like chemical elements, is often cited as one of the first clear
glimpses of the direction that elementary particle theory would
eventually take in the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are like pickpockets,'' Pais once said of his
philosophy of research. ``Nature is the way it is, and you had
better be smart enough to get a little glimpse.''
</P>
<P>
   After becoming fascinated by some research into old scientific
papers that he happened to undertake in the 1970s, he shifted his
interests to the history of science. His first book, `` `Subtle is
the Lord' '' opened with a walk he had taken with Einstein in
Princeton. Pais wrote that Einstein ``suddenly stopped, turned to
me, and asked me if I really believed that the moon exists only if
I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to a discussion of the nature of reality as seen
through the prism of quantum mechanics and the theory of
relativity, and from there to a biographical narrative on
Einstein's science and life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book on Einstein is not only a biography of a great
scientist, but it really set an example of how the history of ideas
should be handled,'' said Nicola Khuri, a professor and head of the
laboratory of theoretical physics at Rockefeller University, in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ferris, reviewing the book in The New York Times, wrote
that it ``emerges as a monument to sound scholarship and graceful
style,'' adding that ``it is a work against which future scientific
biographies will be measured.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ferris and reviewers of Pais' later books acknowledged
that a heavy dose of technical material often made them challenging
reading. Richard Rhodes, one of those reviewers, wrote that Luis
Alvarez, the Nobel laureate, once mentioned that he had read
``Subtle,'' an American Book Award winner, but had ``skipped the
hard parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pais later wrote ``Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the
Physical World'' (1986); ``Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics,
Philosophy, and Polity'' (1991); ``Einstein Lived Here: Essays for
the Layman'' (1994); ``A Tale of Two Continents: A Physicist's Life
in a Turbulent World'' (1997); and ``The Genius of Science: A
Portrait Gallery of Twentieth Century Physicists'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; his son; a stepson from a previous
marriage, Daniel Via; and a grandson, Zane Abraham Pais.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Pais by his nickname, Bram, Tsung Dao Lee, a Nobel
laureate at Columbia University, said in a statement transmitted
through Khuri: ``Bram Pais is the best of us. He has made history
of physics.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to portray her opponent in the Senate race as
out of touch with mainstream voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton
described Rep. Rick Lazio on Sunday as beholden to the
pharmaceutical industry for taking contributions from drug makers
and voting against a bill to subsidize prescription drugs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Sunday afternoon in the courtyard of the
Municipal Building, Clinton voiced her support for the Democrats'
prescription-drug bill. She reiterated her own proposal to legalize
the importing of medicine from abroad, where drugs are frequently
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent is on the side of drug companies and the
Republican leadership,'' said Clinton, who was ringed by a small
group of elderly and disabled New Yorkers assembled by a consumers
group, Citizen Action. ``Time and time again he has demonstrated
where his heart and his allegiance really rests.''
</P>
<P>
   As she has in several recent appearances, including an address
to an enthusiastic audience of churchgoers in Harlem on Sunday
morning, Clinton tried to draw _ sometimes with tart sarcasm _ a
sharp line between herself and Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conservative Republican opponent often says he's
mainstream,'' she said. ``But it's neither compassionate nor
mainstream to leave millions of your fellow citizens without the
guarantee of affordable prescription-drug coverage, especially when
you're a member of Congress and you get top-of-the-line medical
coverage, including prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lazio voted for a Republican prescription-drug plan
that looked to private business to provide new coverage. Under that
measure, federal subsidies would be used to encourage insurance
companies to offer drug coverage to the elderly and offer Medicare
beneficiaries a choice of two drug plans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lazio's spokesman, Bryan Flood, denounced the
Democrats' plan as a ``one size fits all'' approach that did not
offer consumers a choice. He scoffed at Clinton's suggestion that
donations from drug makers had colored Lazio's views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desperate charge by an increasingly desperate
campaign,'' Flood contended. ``As a legislator, Congressman Lazio
votes in the best interests of New Yorkers. It's absurd to suggest
that his votes are related to who gives him campaign
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign aides did not try to refute Clinton's charge
that he had benefited from $30,000 in donations from the
pharmaceutical industry. They simply pointed out that his campaign
had raised over $9 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   They also used Clinton's comments on prescription drugs to
recall her unsuccessful bid for universal health coverage in the
early years of President Clinton's administration. ``Hillary
Clinton doesn't have a record on very much; she does have a record
on this,'' Flood said. ``It wasn't too long ago she was trying to
socialize our nation's health-care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that drug prices and the need for
prescription-drug coverage are major concerns of many voters. And
Clinton, joined Sunday by elderly New Yorkers angered by steep
monthly increases in prescription-drug expenses, has a potentially
huge base among senior citizens, an important voting bloc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clinton's attack on her opponent's position on
prescription drugs appeared to be part of a larger effort to cast
him as a far-right Republican concealed in moderate garb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of talk about compassionate conservatives,'' she
said sarcastically on Sunday at Metropolitan AME Church in Harlem.
``I guess that means somebody who feels really bad when your doctor
doesn't give you the treatment you need because he's been told he
can't by the HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks like this one got her a good response from the crowd.
There were shouts of ``Amen!'' and loud murmurs of affirmation. And
every time her name was mentioned by a speaker, the people in the
pews rose for a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Her audience included several members of the city's black
Democratic leadership, from Bill Lynch, vice chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, to U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassion without action is not enough,'' Clinton bellowed,
as the crowd erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hear the real tune that's being played,'' she
added.

CHAVEZ RIDES A VOW OF CHANGE TO REELECTION IN VENEZUELA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, whose promise of a
social revolution appeared to outweigh concerns over rising crime
and a severe economic crisis, won a resounding reelection victory
Sunday, exit polls indicated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polls, released soon after voting ended,
Chavez, 46, won 54 percent of the vote, while his closest rival,
Francisco Arias, won 34 percent. Arias, 49, a former governor of
Zulia state, once helped Chavez in a failed 1992 coup attempt but
broke away in February amid concerns the president was accumulating
too much power and alienating the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls, released by El Nacional, one of the country's
leading newspapers, showed a margin of victory similar to that
which many preelection opinion polls had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The result seemed less clear, however, over the makeup of the
165-member National Assembly, and whether Chavez's leftist
coalition would have enough seats to secure a majority to pass
future proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``mega-election,'' as it was known among voters and
media, was part of a new constitution that Chavez pushed through
last year. It was also the latest step in his attempts to overhaul
Venezuela's corrupt political system, as he had promised after
winning the presidency in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the coastal town of La Guaira, about 40 miles north of the
capital, voters lined up outside St. Peter the Apostle Church to
cast ballots under a blazing sun. Seven months ago, the white
church and most of the hillside town were covered with mud during
several days of torrential rains that killed thousands and left
nearly half the town's families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was left nearly naked, and the government gave us a
new home and a new beginning, so I feel obligated to come vote,''
said Julio Ortiz, 30, a policeman who traveled three hours by bus
to the polls. ``The problems today are from past politicians, but
Chavez will solve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in this impoverished town agreed. Carrying a bag of
groceries as she walked along a row of abandoned brick houses where
her friends once lived, Maritza Vallejo criticized the government
for not doing enough to help those who survived last December's
floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been tricked into thinking things will change,'' Vallejo
said, looking around at the rubble and idle tractors that
surrounded her. ``Some people get gifts from the government, but we
all need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Electoral officials acknowledged some irregularities in Sunday's
voting. The biggest problem was with the automated system, which
had difficulty tabulating some of the ballots. The glitches created
delays at several polling places, where voters were forced to wait
in line for as long as seven hours. Officials kept the polls open
an additional two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout appeared to be heavier than the 50 percent expected,
although there were no official estimates immediately available
Sunday night. As part of the revised constitution, members of
Venezuela's military branches were, for the first time, also
allowed to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Venezuela have acted democratically and in an
orderly manner, and for this we should be proud,'' said Cesar
Penas, director of the National Electoral Council. Sunday's vote
was also monitored by about 300 international observers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chavez appeared relaxed as he cast his ballot in
Caracas and, later, as he played in his regular baseball game with
aides at the Miraflores presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is quiet,'' Chavez told reporters between innings.
``All is quiet except for the people who are voting today and
strengthing our revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sunday's apparent victory, Chavez's movement appears
to be weaker than the one that began with so much fervor when he
was swept into office 18 months ago. Despite record-high prices for
the country's top export, petroleum, Venezuela's economy shrank by
7 percent last year, and investors pulled billions of dollars from
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, crime has risen sharply throughout the country of 23
million, but most dramatically in the capital and along the
Venezuelan-Colombian border.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chavez continues to enjoy strong support among
Venezuela's poor, who have not yet grown tired of his tirades
against the old political ``oligarchy,'' and who do not fear that
he is more concerned with gaining more power than managing the
country's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years of corrupt democracy created many problems for
this country,'' said Luis Rodriguez, a 63-year-old machinist who
lives in Sierra Maestra, one of the many hillside slums that skirt
the capital. ``It will take Chavez a while to clean up that mess,
but he's got the nerve and the passion to do it.''

FESTIVAL PROMOTES ABSTAINING FROM ANIMAL PRODUCTS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER HAMM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meditation booths, henna body art and plenty of
vegan vittles _ such as bamboo burgers _ helped draw thousands to
the first-ever WorldFest Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The solar-powered music, environmental and animal festival at
Woodley Park in Van Nuys was aimed at promoting social
consciousness, organizers said. Setting the event in the San
Fernando Valley _ more widley known as L.A.'s bourgeois bastion
than as an embracer of change _ surprised some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in the Valley,'' said Pat
Collins, 43, of Pacoima, who held his dread-locked hair back with a
rubber band. ``To me, the Valley is a giant work camp. To see
something like this is a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures reached 96 degrees but that didn't keep more than
4,000 people from enjoying the bands, celebrity guests or food at
the free festival.
</P>
<P>
   Some ate vegan hotdogs while others danced to a wide variety of
music, including soul-filled Brazilian rhythms from Ana Gazzola and
Sonia Santos with the Brasil Brazil Band.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities Alicia Silverstone, Woody Harrelson and Kevin Nealon
were on hand to promote veganism, which means avoiding foods which
contain any animal products including meat, dairy and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   John Robbins, author of the best-selling ``Diet for a New
America,'' and Howard Lyman, co-defendant with Oprah Winfrey in the
libel lawsuit brought by a Texas cattleman, also spoke at the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, who has been a vegan for two years, said she sticks
to the diet because she wants to help animals and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard-core vegan who wants everybody to be vegan,'' said
Silverstone, who starred in ``Clueless.'' ``It's a healthier,
happier way to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people attending the festival seemed to agree. By
mid-afternoon, the All Natural Vegan Express Cafe booth had a long
line.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ciervo, who wore a blue T-shirt that read ``VEGAN,'' said
it was a thrill to attend an event that served only vegan food.
Since becoming a vegan more than a year ago, Ciervo, 22, of
Riverside, Calif., still eats all the delicious foods he used to
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to give up all the food you like,'' he said.
``You just find a substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were meat lovers to be found in the crowd. Raymond Hsu
said he came from San Gabriel, Calif., to enjoy the bands that
played throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to eat healthy,'' said Hsu, 23, who admitted he enjoys
eating hamburgers. ``I'm not sure how vegan that is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message Sunday was clear _ eating anything made with
animals or animal products is cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people know in their hearts it's not right to eat
animals,'' said Sangeeta Kumar, one of the festival organizers.
``In the nine hours of WorldFest, 9 million animals will be
slaughtered. It's an animal holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pro-animal efforts, the festival was also used to
promote other traditionally liberal political causes. One booth,
for example, distributed leaflets on human rights violations in
war-torn Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to promote compassion,'' Kumar said.
``Compassion is cool. It's in.''

CALIFORNIA'S DELEGATION TO REPUBLICN CONVENTION DIVERSE, BUT
LEADERLESS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To Reagan revolutionaries like Lancaster insurance
broker Frank Visco, the trip to the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia feels like the good old days: a party united, a
front-running candidate and high hopes of retaking the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Visco, a former chairman of the state GOP, is attending his
seventh convention and sees similarities between conventions that
nominated Ronald Reagan in 1984 and 1988 and this year's, where
Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be anointed by the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely as together as the party has been,'' Visco
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting people excited and dealing with some of our
internal issues. I think what we're doing is taking a pragmatic
approach and not letting issues like choice on abortion divide us.
We are looking for areas of common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   With the convention's opening today, veteran California
delegates say the national party is more unified than it has been
in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   California, the largest contingent at the convention with 162 of
the 2,066 delegates, is also bringing the most diverse group with
83 women and at least 20 percent minority.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, the delegation is seen as having the
least influence in a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most inconsequential delegation
California has ever sent,'' said Republican consultant Allan
Hoffenblum. ``This is a state that sent delegations lead by a
Reagan, a (Pete) Wilson, a (George) Deukmejian. We have no
Republican governor, no Republican senator to lead it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is the most diverse _ I understand there are even two
or three members from the (gay) Log Cabin Club _ there is no real
leader. I guess if you can't send the most powerful, you send the
most diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The California GOP was routed in the elections two years ago,
holding on to only two statewide offices. And it lost one of those
with the resignation of Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
because of the scandal involving settlements by insurance companies
from the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. That leaves Secretary of State
Bill Jones as the top Republican in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity is seen as important to members of the delegation
as the GOP attempts to rebuild and as Bush has attempted to reach
out to Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Grieg, a longtime activist who is going to her sixth
convention, said it was important for the state party to send a
message to minorities that they are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has a message he wanted to bring people together,
regardless of where they stand,'' Grieg said. ``And the Hispanic
community is one of the largest and it's about time it was
recognized for its tremendous heritage and the work we have done in
this country. I'm pleased with the delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Becerra, who works for Southern California Edison Co.,
said he sees the party as heading toward the ``big tent'' theory
advanced by Lee Atwater, the political strategist who engineered
the first campaign of former President George Bush. The convention
is the first for Becerra, who said he is looking at it as a chance
to participate in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is monumental,'' he said. ``And I have a sense the party
at every level is coming together. We will agree to disagree, but
be united in backing George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP activist, Bruce Bialosky, a certified public
accountant and real estate broker, is attending his third
convention and sees the party as more unified than it has been in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Houston in 1992, a lot of people were upset with the way
the campaign was being run and then Pat Buchanan stood up and made
that divisive speech,'' Bialosky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, four years ago in San Diego, no one was very
enthusiastic and there was so much infighting. You don't sense that
going into this convention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Schmidt, a spokesman for the San Fernando Valley
Industry and Commerce Association, his first convention is an
opportunity to get involved and rebuild the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``While conventions seemingly become less and less important
since we know who will be nominated, it's still an opportunity to
deal with policy issues and let people see the diversity of our
delegation,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (San Fernando) Valley delegation alone, we have several
Asian, Jewish and Latino members as well as two from the Log Cabin
Club. This is the direction that the Republican Party has to go.''

<P>
   BLUE ASH, Ohio _ As he rides toward his moment of triumph,
George W. Bush speaks with extra punch. He belts out his speeches
now, his face flushing, arms waving. Yet once off the stage, he is
unusually introspective, talking of family. History. Legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of the Adams family factor,'' he said on his
campaign plane this past weekend, bringing up unprompted the last
father and son in American history to both win the presidency: John
Adams and John Quincy Adams, so very long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So confident is he that he jokes fondly about his new running
mate's flat campaign style, calling it with notable understatement
``a little more laid-back than mine.'' And though usually allergic
to psychobabble, Bush does not brush off questions about his
relationship with his father, former President George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't all that long ago that he himself was the president
of the United States, which will make the story unique and
different,'' Bush mused.
</P>
<P>
   There is poignancy to this conversation on the plane. At his
rallies, Bush speaks of his popular mother. He revels in telling
the tale of his courtship of his wife, Laura. But the only
acknowledgment of his father is oblique.
</P>
<P>
   It comes when he bellows, ``I understand that the last two
presidential elections haven't gone well,'' and promises to change
that for Republicans come November. Left unmentioned is that one of
those defeats was his father's.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bush clan is gathering once again, just as it did to
watch the father's triumphant nomination by two Republican National
Conventions. This time it is the eldest son who will take his
moment on the stage, capping a remarkable 17-month transformation
from a governor with less than two full terms in office to his
party's great hope for reclaiming the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be there, sure, I think all of my brothers and
sister,'' Bush said. ``I can't think of any boycotters.''
</P>
<P>
   Day after day as Bush gets ever closer to Philadelphia, the
pyrotechnics become more elaborate. On Sunday he stole a technique
from his primary rival John McCain and showed up on a campaign bus
for a rally here at the replica of the historic Crosley Field.
Fireworks shot into the sky to dazzle the crowd of 2,000, who had
waited for hours on the open field despite several rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   In a blue shirt and no jacket, dancing on his heels, Bush spoke
of himself in the third person. ``You got to understand about
George W.,'' he said. ``I don't take polls to tell me what to
think. I do what I think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems serene, though at times emotional too. At the
governor's mansion in Austin late last week, he almost choked up
when he said he would recognize his wife, his daughters and his
parents in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush is at his side at rally after rally, beaming, as he
weaves her into his stump speech by promoting her own convention
speech, which is planned for Monday night. ``The first speaker will
be the first lady of the state of Texas,'' he tells his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He gives them a thumbnail history of the public school librarian
from dusty Midland, Texas. ``I said, `Would you marry me?''' he
says. ``She wasn't particularly interested in politics and
politicians. She said, `I will, except don't ever make me give a
speech.' I said, `OK.''' He pauses and then adds, to rising
laughter from his audiences, ``It's the only political promise I've
ever broken.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Republican convention will be about Bush and the Bush
family and the Bush platform, beginning in prime time on Monday
with Laura and ending Thursday night with Bush's acceptance speech.
``That puts the Bush family arms around the convention,'' said
Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Republican officeholders _ the ones who remind the
public of the the hard-edged Gingrich years _ have been pushed
offstage or to nonprime time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the edge is gone completely. Revving up the drenched
crowd before Bush's arrival on Sunday, Bill Cunningham, the host of
a local radio talk show, asked, ``Are we going to permit an eighth
of an inch of rain to keep us from scouring out the White House
from the filth and degradation of Clinton-Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' the audience thundered back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, who served on the House Judiciary Committee
during the impeachment of President Clinton, wondered jokingly who
would have expected to see ``Microsoft split up and the Clintons
still together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speeches by contrast have few hard edges, except for his
promise to restore ``honor and dignity'' to the presidency, and the
dig at President Clinton that is implicit when he says that Dick
Cheney ``understands what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the speeches is the concept of family, a soft
and subtle way to appeal to his party's conservatives yet also
sound right to suburban soccer moms. ``Love your children all the
time,'' he croons. ``Tell them you love them.'' Or else he shouts,
``I got a kind of special feeling for moms _ if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he sounds more like a revivalist preacher than a
politician. Before 5,000 people in Joplin, Mo., on Friday night,
Bush thundered: ``My administration will rally what I call the
armies of compassion, the decent, kindhearted souls that act not
because of government, that act because they hear our call to
people all across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the confetti and the balloons, and on outdoor stages, Bush
throws out his arms maniacally to give oomph to the old familiar
stump speech. He gets help in looking animated from the contrast
with his new running mate.
</P>
<P>
   On his one day of campaigning with Bush last Friday, Cheney
shook hands fast along the receiving line waiting to greet the Bush
plane. Then he stood alone at the waiting car. Bush was still
working the line, grabbing a hand here, a shoulder there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different campaigning style,'' Bush said the next
day. ``That's the way it is. He's going to be a great partner. He's
warming up.''
</P>
<P>
   And if these are glory days, well, Bush says he learned
something else from his father, who watched his sky-high approval
ratings after the Gulf war collapse, leaving him unable to stave
off defeat in 1992 by a young, untested governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get overconfident,'' said this year's
governor of the moment. ``You know why? I know what can happen. I
have seen poll numbers crumble. I have seen defeat firsthand.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney, the Republican choice for vice
president, arrived here on the eve of the party's national
convention after trying on several television interviews Sunday
morning to smooth the more conservative edges of his House voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on the morning talk shows, Cheney called some of
the Democratic criticism of his votes ``trivial'' and ``irrelevant
to the important issues of the day.'' But while he defended some of
his actions, like his vote in 1986 against freedom for Nelson
Mandela, he seemed to back away from his votes opposing action
against ``cop-killer'' bullets and plastic guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meanwhile, continued their incessant assault on
Cheney's record, releasing a television advertisement Sunday
attacking his votes against Head Start, the Clean Water Act, the
school lunch program and health insurance for people who lost
coverage when they lost their jobs, and for praising OPEC for
cutting oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive presidential
nominee, and Cheney, the ad asked: ``What are their plans for
working families?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush continued his slow march toward Philadelphia,
campaigning Sunday at the replica of the historic Crosley Field in
the suburbs of Cincinnati. Several thousand people withstood a
driving rain to see him. Fireworks popped as he drove up in a
campaign bus emblazoned with the slogan, ``Renewing America's
Purpose,'' the theme of his five-day tour through several
battleground states. He told the Republican members of Congress
sharing the stage with him, ``Be patient. Help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has made only a few campaign stops since being
selected as Bush's running made, made a brief appearance here
Sunday afternoon, promising ``most of all to make America proud
again by giving them a president they can respect.'' He spoke for
only four minutes at the hotel where he will be joined by Bush on
Wednesday, and he seemed overwhelmed by his reception from a crowd
organized by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's more important task came on the morning talk programs.
He defended his vote in 1986 against freedom for Mandela because he
believed the African National Congress was a ``terrorist'' group.
</P>
<P>
   He said his votes opposing action against cop-killer bullets and
plastic guns that could pass metal detectors were caused by the
no-amendment procedure under which they were considered. In each
case, he said now that he would be ``happy to entertain'' such
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he voted against Head Start and the Older Americans
Act because they were costly. On both subjects, he said his
position was different today.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and Cheney also sought to generate support, Bush's
primary-season nemesis, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also made a
pitch for the ticket. Appearing before the ``shadow convention,''
an event ranging from reformist to radical, he gamely asked the
audience to vote for Bush and was soundly booed for his troubles.
Then he went before his own delegates and formally released them
from commitments to vote for him. Many groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush camp's plans for a conflict-free convention
chugged along without serious difficulty. Abortion-rights advocates
insisted they were working to find the required six states to
support new language in the platform acknowledging diverse views on
the subject, but they had yet to find them. One minor rules
squabble was shaping up _ over an effort to make all 165 members of
the Republican National Committee automatic delegates at the next
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   There was no formal convention business Sunday beyond the
arrival of 2,066 delegates _ mostly middle-aged white men and
generally more conservative than the voters who gave Bush the
nomination _ assembled in the city where Republicans have nominated
five previous candidates, from John C. Fremont in 1856 to Thomas E.
Dewey in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But it became increasingly clear that despite the shadow
convention and occasional minor demonstrations like Sunday's
peaceful march by 7,000 for a variety of causes, the four-day show
beginning Monday is all about Bush and Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The party's congressional wing gets barely an hour at center
stage, yet Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who, as chairman of the
House Republican Campaign Committee, is striving mightily to retain
control of the House, pronounced himself happy with the time given
House candidates at the podium: two segments of fifteen one-minute
speeches during the day Tuesday. Nor did the senators complain at
the opportunity for six four-minute speeches around lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said, ``This convention is about electing George W. Bush.
It's not about the House and Senate.'' He said Republican hopes of
retaining the House, where they hold a 13-seat majority, would be
aided by Bush's ``creating an updraft that our candidates can take
advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that the campaign has settled on a strategy
for dealing with the problems it obviously did not anticipate from
Cheney's voting record. On one television show after another, he
said the votes did not matter, but that he was not wedded to them
today.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week,'' Cheney complained of ``so much time and
energy and effort devoted to this kind of trivia'' and ``the
trivial aspect of the debates that rage in Washington now.''
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' he said, ``The campaign that
Governor Bush and I will run is very much oriented towards the
future, it's focused on trying to restore a degree of civility in
Washington, to end the kind of partisan backbiting that has been so
much a part of the tone and tenor in this city for all too many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' he said, ``I think the American
people want to hear about the future, not about the past.'' That
choice of phrase recalled what Bill Clinton, then a candidate for
president, said on Jan. 26, 1992, about accusations that he had
conducted an affair with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Cheney said, ``I hope the Democrats
spend the next three months going after my voting record; I'll be
happy to defend it. But in the meantime, we're going to talk about
the future of the country, and we're going to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   His argument about how his pro-gun votes were dictated by House
procedures banning amendments was also consistent from one program
to the next. He put it this way on ABC:
</P>
<P>
   ``Debate was limited. No amendments were allowed. And I often
voted against measures that I thought deserved more serious
coverage and debate than was permitted when the majority brought it
up under the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gave different answers when asked what he would do now on
the measure attacking bullets that can penetrate policemen's
bullet-proof vests. He told CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``It would
depend.'' When NBC's Tim Russert asked him, ``Would you authorize
money to ban cop-killer bullets and ban plastic weapons?'' Cheney
replied ``Ah, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC he said he voted in 1987 against the Older Americans Act,
which provided $1.6 billion for programs including health centers,
Meals on Wheels and Alzheimer's research by saying, ``Probably
because it was excessive in terms of the funding.'' He said, ``When
we had big deficits I voted against bills that I thought either
authorized or appropriated too much fund.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' but was not
asked about his House votes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He continued the anti-Washington theme here, saying ``For the
last five years, I've been outside Washington, I've been out in the
real world where people are building companies, creating jobs,
inventing new technologies that are transforming our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been the chairman and chief executive of the
Halliburton Co., a large oil services company based in Dallas,
said, ``When I look back at Washington, I scratch my head and ask
what the hell are they doing back there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult day for McCain. Ariana Huffington, the
commentator who is the chief organizer of the shadow convention,
which is focused on the overhaul of campaign financing, lingering
poverty and a drug war seen as aimed mostly at filling up prisons,
had to intervene to quiet the booing crowd. When the catcalls
continued, intermittently, McCain canceled a promised
question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   One participant, Emily Hagopian of Los Angeles, who came with a
group called Youth Vote 2000, said, ``Everybody saw him as our hope
for change, and then he came in here with that endorsement. He
disgusted us. He betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then tears came to McCain's eyes when he met with his own
delegates. ``I need every one of you to give this campaign the same
amount of enthusiasm and participation you did for our primary
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, by way of warning, ``American doesn't like sore
losers.''

HERITAGE OF GOLD TRIUMPHS IN DUEL AMID PUDDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They staggered back toward the winner's
circle, splattered with mud, in a cleansing drizzle. One mare,
Beautiful Pleasure, had been crowned a champion in 1999. The other,
Heritage of Gold, had just run Beautiful Pleasure down to validate
her intention to take that crown. The crowd rose to its feet and
thundered applause for the two rivals' effort in a duel down the
stretch at Saratoga which splashed drama as well as puddles all the
way to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The bare facts are that for the second time this year, Heritage
of Gold bested Beautiful Pleasure, ran her victory record for the
year to 5 of 5 and poured $150,000 more into her owner's coffers by
capturing the $250,000 Go For Wand Stakes. That, however, does not
reflect the anguish that the trainer Tom Amoss and the owner Jack
Garey muddled through trying to decide whether Heritage of Gold
might have a chance to duel.
</P>
<P>
   Garey, who is from Texas, told Amoss two days ago that if the
track turned sloppy by Sunday's race, he wanted to wait to take on
Beautiful Pleasure, last year's champion older filly, some other
day.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 career races and 14 victories, Heritage of Gold, a
5-year-old daughter of Gold Legend, had run on turf and dirt, long
and short, on at least seven tracks. But she never puddle-jumped on
a soggy track. Amoss stalled his owner. Wait and see, he told him,
for most of the afternoon. Finally after the fourth race, it was
time to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is something about Saratoga and being here,'' Amoss
said. ``If he was back at home in Austin, I'm sure he wouldn't have
run. He got all caught up in it and said to me, `What do you want
to do?' I told him I was speaking very subjectively, but I want to
take her on.''
</P>
<P>
   When the gates popped open on the 1 1/8-miles-race, Amoss
admitted, he thought he should have listened to his boss. Beautiful
Pleasure, who in winning three previous races on wet tracks looked
as if she had webbed feet, torpedoed to the rail and built what
appeared to be an insurmountable seven-length lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were in trouble,'' Amoss said. ``All of a sudden,
we were back so far and you start to wonder if the race is over. I
turned to my family and said, `At least we're starting to pick her
up.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did not really believe it, however, until the jockey Shane
Sellers hustled Heritage of Gold around the turn and subtracted
four lengths from Beautiful Pleasure's lead. Sellers said he knew
that he had Beautiful Pleasure in trouble when her rider, Jorge
Chavez, turned back and looked him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Choppy look back,'' said Sellers, referring to the
nickname the Peruvian rider has developed for his short whip
strokes. ``He still had us. But my mare was moving easy and I had
the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 58,584 sensed it and bounced to its feet as
Heritage of Gold collared Beautiful Pleasure, the heavily bet 1-5
favorite, at the quarter pole. Sellers and his mare ran in stride
with Beautiful Pleasure for 30 yards until Heritage of Gold
catapulted ahead in the middle of the track for a one-length
victory that paid $7.90 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fair and square; no excuses,'' Beautiful Pleasure's
trainer, John Ward, said of his mare, who has earned more than $2.2
million in purses. ``We'll get a rematch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It will probably not come until November, however, and the
Breeders' Cup Championship at Churchill Downs in Kentucky. But for
an afternoon at least, Amoss overruled his owner and got away with
it. He was at once gracious and relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who really appreciates horse racing, no matter who the
horses were involved, saw a super race,'' Amoss said.
</P>
<P>
   Garey agreed but could not help beating his chest a bit.
</P>

   ``She didn't get any respect coming into this race, and didn't
get any respect from the bettors either,'' Garey said. ``We proved
that we have the best dirt female in the country.''

CHENEY GRILLED ON RECORD; BUSH SEEKS UNITY AT EVENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney went on the griddle about his
government record Sunday as Republicans and Gov. George W. Bush's
campaign tried setting the tone for a harmonious, soft-sell
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   After engaging in a battle of wits with the hosts of TV's
morning political talk shows, Cheney came here in his still-fresh
role as Bush's vice-presidential running mate. He was welcomed by a
joyous Republican rally, complete with a confetti shower.
</P>
<P>
   It was a preview of GOP celebrations to come in the four-day
convention that starts Monday and culminates in the nomination that
will let the Texas governor make a run at the White House, whose
last Republican occupant was his father. In the spirit of Bush's
``compassionate conservative'' pitch, the convention is programmed
to showcase minorities and appeal to moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make Americans proud again by giving them a
president that they can respect,'' Cheney told supporters _ a
reference to President Clinton's moral failings. Cheney's last
government stint, as President Bush's defense secretary, ended when
Clinton took over the presidency in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV programs, Cheney said some questions about his
conservative voting record as Wyoming's representative in the House
are ``kind of trivia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about his votes against funding for the Head Start
preschool program and a ban on armor-piercing bullets, Cheney
remarked, ``I might find a couple I would do differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions also exposed a policy rift between the running
mates.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, retiring as chairman and CEO of Halliburton, an oil
industry engineering and construction firm that does business with
Middle East countries, said U.S. trade sanctions against Iran and
other countries have been ineffective. He acknowledged that Bush
thinks it's premature to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might go in and argue a different point of view with him,
but I'll do it privately,'' Cheney said. ``And when he's made his
decision, then I'll salute smartly and support the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reveled in the latest voter surveys, which show that
Bush has widened his lead over Vice President Al Gore since picking
Cheney less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led 49 percent to 37 percent in an ABC-Washington Post poll
made public Sunday. The same survey of 1,028 registered voters
showed Bush with an edge of five percentage points a week ago. The
poll has a margin of error of three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the Bush campaign's play for unity at the convention,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona told the nominating delegates whom he
had won in primaries against Bush that they should vote during the
convention for the Texas governor's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who will deliver a speech to the convention Tuesday
night, choked with emotion as he formally released the more than
200 delegates he won in the Republican battles of winter.
</P>
<P>
   With campaign finance reform as his hot issue, McCain won over
independent voters and defeated Bush in the primaries of New
Hampshire and six other states.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's show of support for Bush on Sunday ran into
resistance on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his delegates said they couldn't stomach voting for
Bush's nomination. And earlier Sunday, McCain's praise of Bush was
interrupted by hisses and boos from some of those attending a
Shadow Convention highlighting campaign finance reform and
alternative issues.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Texas delegation applauded the party platform,
which the convention is scheduled to adopt Monday, because it
supports a total ban on abortion and calls for local control of
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some Texans were unhappy over plans to have
Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay Republican member of
Congress, talk to the convention Tuesday night about trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, a delegate from Dallas and president of the Texas
Eagle Forum, called on the Bush campaign to remove Kolbe from the
program. And some conservative Texas delegates said they were
thinking about boycotting the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be embarrassing to the Bush team,'' Kolbe said.
``They could uninvite him.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said another delegate suggested that Texas delegates pray
during Kolbe's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Chairwoman Susan Weddington said a walkout
would not be productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the majority of people (delegates) don't see it
(Kolbe's address) as an endorsement of the gay rights agenda,''
Weddington said. ``But they feel like it doesn't advance our
purpose here in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said Kolbe was selected to address
convention delegates because of his expertise on foreign trade, not
because of his sexual orientation. One of a group of gay Republican
activists who met with Bush in April for a discussion of gay issues
had recommended Kolbe as a convention speaker.
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, Bush reaffirmed his opposition to gay
marriages and to tougher penalties for crimes motivated by hate of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Philadelphia, a few miles north of the convention
site, a crowd police estimated at 5,000 marched in favor of causes
that clash with many philosophies of Bush and the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Unity 2000 group demonstrated against capital punishment,
the health care system and nuclear weapons and in favor of the
environment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The event, whose organizers hoped would turn out many more
people than the number police counted, was virtually free of
skirmishes with police and counter-demonstrators, such as a group
who chanted: ``More guns, less people.''
</P>
<P>
   The daytime cries for social justice gave way to evening
socializing as state convention delegations attended parties. At
the top of the party agenda was a bridge lighting, boat parade and
fireworks display over the Delaware River, which runs between
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's scheduled convention events, under the theme ``Leave
No Child Behind,'' include speeches by Bush's wife, Laura, and
retired Army Gen. Colin Powell.

HOUSTON PASTOR TO PLAY KEY ROLE AT CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When party officials called the Rev. Kirbyjon
Caldwell recently about appearing at the Republican National
Convention here, Houston's influential black pastor thought it
would be a minor deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed I was being asked to appear at a prayer breakfast,''
said Caldwell, minister of the Windsor Village United Methodist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Caldwell is scheduled to make what is among the most
high-profile appearances on the convention podium: introducing
Texas Gov. George W. Bush to accept the GOP presidential nomination
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called back and said the governor wanted me to
introduce him the night he accepts the nomination, I almost dropped
the phone,'' Caldwell said. ``In fact, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell's relationship with Bush, which he describes as
``resonant,'' made accepting the invitation easy.
</P>
<P>
   But as pastor to a predominantly African-American congregation
of 14,000 and growing, the decision to make his national convention
debut on behalf of the Republican presidential nominee was a move
he said he prayed over.
</P>
<P>
   Although closely aligned over the years with Democratic causes
and candidates, the high-profile former stockbroker said he is
politically independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 18 years I have never publicly supported a person running
for office, so this is a major move for me,'' Caldwell said. ``I
expect to catch some heat for it, and if I do it won't be the first
time. But I am not going to be defensive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Caldwell does catch heat for supporting Bush, it will likely
be delivered to him in private. On Sunday, several Democrats
questioned about his role at the convention declined to criticize
the move.
</P>
<P>
   As to the relationship, Caldwell met Bush five years ago at a
reception in downtown Houston after Bush had read a newspaper
article about the faith-based community programs with which
Caldwell was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Various local organizations launched by Caldwell and his
southwest Houston church provide housing, job training, counseling,
outreach and other services to low- and middle-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   They are the same types of faith-based solutions that Bush
advocates in his campaign. But there is more in Caldwell's appeal
for Bush, who also shares his Methodist faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirbyjon represents a new type of pastor from a black church,
in that his involvement in Houston is as much at the corporate
board level as it's been at the pulpit,'' said state Rep. Garnet
Coleman, D-Houston, a longtime friend of the Caldwell family.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a successful developer, investor, author and more, is
a graduate of Carleton College with an MBA from the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and a master's in
theology from Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, working to reach out to ethnic minorities and
diversify the party, Caldwell is a comfortable fit. Although he's
not involved in politics, Caldwell moves easily among the powerful
and affluent because he is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Caldwell said he appreciates what Bush is doing in
his campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look at his plan for America, it is absolutely awesome,''
Caldwell said. ``Because here we have a governor running for
president, regardless of his label, who is being very intentional
and bold by casting the net out farther and deeper than any
president has ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since they met, Caldwell and Bush have stayed
in touch. For the governor's 1999 inauguration, he asked Caldwell
to coordinate a private worship service for family and friends on
the day he was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he is not ``a big lever-puller'' affiliated
with either political party, Caldwell said he is supporting Bush
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Key to that support for Caldwell are Bush campaign proposals on
homeownership, financial savings, faith-based initiatives,
education and more.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy on Caldwell's mind as he prepares to head to
Philadelphia are some key differences he has with Bush politically,
notably on the death penalty and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   On issues such as affirmative action, which Bush opposes and
Caldwell supports, the latter said increases in state contracts for
minority businesses during Bush's term are more relevant than his
political statements on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while the GOP struggles to diversify from its
historically Anglo base, Caldwell said he is impressed with Bush's
record on appointing women and minorities to key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Murray, University of Houston political scientist and
pollster, said Caldwell is not likely to bring in the black vote
for Bush, but that giving the influential pastor a role at the
convention helps both men to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush wins, there won't be many African-American clergy Bush
has been helped by in getting there,'' Murray said. ``And if he
loses, well, he's still the governor of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, giving Caldwell such a prominent slot on the
podium signals to black voters that Bush is not someone they should
fear, Murray added.
</P>
<P>
   What Caldwell may risk with his congregation, whom he said he
assumes is predominantly Democratic, and the rest of the city's
black leadership, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he doubts there will be a downside to Caldwell's
appearance. Despite the pastor's protestations about staying out of
politics, he is in many ways a deft politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is symbolism in this, because everything that
anyone does in politics these days has to do with image,'' Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic, sure. But I don't think there's a problem in
that at all.'' &QL;

LONG ISLAND SOUND LOBSTERMEN BLAME PESTICIDE FOR DEATHS OF
LOBSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWALK, Conn. _ John Makowski is a fourth-generation lobsterman
_ at least he was until the mysterious death of most of the lobster
population in western Long Island Sound last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And though he does not have a degree in marine biology,
Makowski, like many of his former colleagues, said he believed that
millions of lobsters were killed by the pesticide spraying last
September to kill mosquitoes that could potentially carry the West
Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   It is a suspicion some scientists are taking seriously, saying
there are plausible indicators _ but not definitive proof _ that
the pesticides could have played a role in the lobster kill. On
July 25, just hours after New York City concluded pesticide
spraying in Central Park, Makowski and about a dozen other
lobstermen were in the offices of the Norwalk Seaport Association
submitting paperwork to get federal disaster money authorized by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The lobstermen said they were skeptical about theories last year
that a micro-organism, a paramoeba, could have killed the lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of talk about this paramoeba,'' Makowski
said. ``But paramoeba is in the water all the time. It's not
something that in 200 years has ever wiped out a fishery.''
</P>
<P>
   Like insects, lobsters are arthropods and susceptible to
pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's die-off, marine scientists say, was the worst ever
to hit the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Game officials estimate that about 11 million lobsters, more
than 90 percent of the full-sized population, died in the Sound
last fall, putting hundreds of lobstermen out of business in
Connecticut and New York. The Sound is the nation's third-largest
lobster source, after Maine and Massachusetts, generating $45
million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsters, like other crustaceans, are vulnerable to many things,
including changes in water temperature and oxygen content and the
effects of dredging and sewage treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobstermen said believe that the pesticide spraying last
September and the die-off were not a coincidence. They theorize
that the pesticides were washed into the Sound by heavy rain,
including Tropical Storm Floyd, and that those chemicals combined
with chlorine and sewage from water treatment plants weakened the
lobsters' immune systems, allowing the paramoeba to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists regard the theory as plausible and worth
researching.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in marine life last year included other crustaceans
like crabs and starfish.
</P>
<P>
   Richard French, a veterinary pathologist at the University of
Connecticut, who identified the paramoeba in the dead lobsters,
said investigators had ruled out several known causes of lobster
deaths, including bacterial, viral and fungal agents. He said
researchers have been collecting lobsters since June 1 to test the
pesticide theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any concerns, it would be that there are
concentrations that could affect the animals in a way that makes
them more susceptible to other causes of mortality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Seaport Association, Jeff Samson, 44, brought
documentation to the declining lobster catch: 50,989 pounds caught
in 1997; 53,792 pounds caught in 1998; 18,496 pounds caught in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I might get 1,000 if I'm lucky,'' Samson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobstermen are questioning whether politicians overreacted
to the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they really overdid it,'' said Anthony Coviello, 56, a
lobsterman who lives in Rowayton. ``If you are going to spray to
protect lives and it's going to protect lives, then pay me for my
damages because I'm out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Long Island Sound Lobster Association has hired its
own researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress has authorized $13.9 million in response to
the lobster deaths. Half will go to unemployed lobstermen and half
will go to research. And Friday, federal the Environmental
Protection Agency announced it will conduct a separate six-month,
$125,000 environmental study of the Sound, not focused on
pesticides, to help determine what killed the lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bayer, the director of the Lobster Institute at the
University of Maine, which is testing the effects of pesticides,
said the situation in the Sound is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are other pollutants that could fit into the
picture and it's hard to define what those might be in Long Island
Sound when you have got the megalopolis around it, which actually
could affect the way lobsters respond to many things, including
pesticides,'' Bayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Beckwith, the chief of the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection's marine fisheries division, was more
cautious. He said there was also evidence suggesting the pesticides
were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have proven anything yet,'' he said. ``We had
lobsters dying in places where we didn't have spraying going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine scientists say it will take at least five to seven years
for the lobster population to recover, if it recovers at all.
Makowski has put his boat up for sale and plans to sell his house.
He has two daughters, one about to start college. To pay bills, he
has taken a job on land.

JOSE ANGEL VALENTE, 71, SPANISH POET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Calif)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jose Angel Valente, a cerebral Spaniard who believed that
writing poetry should begin with the word and not with the
real-life world, died on July 18 in a hospital in Geneva. He was
71.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The poet, who was also a critic and translator, wrote his poetry
in Spanish and in Galician, a regional tongue in Spain's northwest,
where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that he was one of the principal figures of
Spanish poetry'' in the 20th century, Carlos Casares, a man of
letters who is president of the Galician Cultural Council, said
after the poet's death.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass M. Rogers, a retired professor of Spanish at the
University of Texas, said: ``Jose Angel Valente was one of the
earliest Spanish poets to reveal a clear and promising departure
from the rhetorical excesses of the poetry of social realism
dominant in post-Civil War Spain by the 1950s. His work retains
recurring notes of critical protest, but these are driven less by
the conditions of life in postwar Spain than by general ethical and
philosophical preoccupations.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing concept of that day was of poetry as
communication, but Rogers said: ``Valente, both in his critical
writing and his poetic works, reveals the conviction that poetry
starts with the word, rather than external reality. His tendency
toward metapoetry _ or poetry as its own subject matter _ rapidly
became a signal characteristic of his generation of poets'' in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Valente declared: ``The poet must continue in his
task, in spite of the inherent ambiguities, inconsistencies and
imperfect approximations that language entails. It is within the
context of these difficulties that the reader's role becomes
paramount. Both poet and reader must approach the language of
poetry as a starting point: poet, word, idea and reader all
participate in the ongoing process of the creative act.''
</P>
<P>
   His seemingly unenigmatic poem ``Night Falls,'' which is in a
1960 volume of his poems, is said to illustrate the gravity and
even the pessimistic tone of much of his early poetry:
</P>
<P>
   ``night falls.
</P>
<P>
   One's heart descends
</P>
<P>
   infinite steps,
</P>
<P>
   enormous galleries
</P>
<P>
   until it encounters sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   There it rests, lying,
</P>
<P>
   there, vanquished,
</P>
<P>
   lies its own being.
</P>
<P>
   Man can
</P>
<P>
   bear it on his shoulders in order to ascend anew
</P>
<P>
   toward the light sorrow-
</P>
<P>
   fully: he can walk forever,
</P>
<P>
   walk ...
</P>
<P>
   Thou who art able,
</P>
<P>
   give us our daily resurrection!''
</P>
<P>
   His first poems were published in 1947. In the first of his
books of poetry, ``In the Manner of Hope'' (1955), he pondered the
meanings of loss and death but included other, less somber themes.
Years later, the Oxford Companion to Spanish Literature (1978) said
his main preoccupations were ``exile, deprivation, death and
contemporary Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   The last book of his poetry came out in 1996. He wrote more than
two dozen books, all told, and won a number of prestigious Spanish
literary prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Orense in Galicia, he received a degree in romance
philology at the University of Madrid and a master's degree at
Oxford, where he taught in the 1950s. He also taught at the
University of California at Irvine for a time. He was a translator
for the World Health Organization in Geneva for two decades, worked
for UNESCO in Paris and moved to the city of Almeria in
southeastern Spain in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He was married twice and had four children, two of whom died
early in life. His survivors include his wife, Cora.

MAGNIFICENT WELLESIAN FLOP TO BE REMADE AS MINISERIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ind.)  By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ When Orson Welles completed ``The Magnificent
Ambersons'' in 1942, he considered the film superior to his
previous movie and masterpiece, ``Citizen Kane.'' But a disastrous
preview screening before a teen-age audience led RKO Studios to
take ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' out of Welles' hands and delete
more than 40 minutes of the saga of a wealthy Midwestern family at
the turn of the century. Welles said he never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They destroyed `Ambersons,' '' Welles remarked years later.
``And it destroyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the studio's editing of the film shattered Welles'
career or whether he himself contributed to his downfall, the event
remains a turning point in the elusive career of a director, actor
and writer who was, like ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' brilliant
and flawed. The outtakes of the film were left in vaults and either
turned to dust or were burned because of a shortage of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen the film the way Welles intended it to be
seen, and there's always been a sense of loss here about those 40
minutes,'' said Ted R. Hartley, chairman of RKO Pictures. ``What we
now want to do is complete our homage and obligation to Welles.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the original 131-minute shooting script is
being made into a four-hour miniseries on the A&AMP;E cable network
(the additional material will come from the Booth Tarkington novel
of the same name, on which the film was based). The miniseries,
directed by Alfonso Arau (``Like Water for Chocolate''), will be
released as a film in Europe, where Welles is probably even more
popular than in the United States. Production of the remake starts
in Dublin in August, and the television series and film are to be
released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about this plan is that television rarely if ever
seeks to remake a film that failed commercially like ``The
Magnificent Ambersons.'' Recently, George Clooney was the executive
producer for and acted in a CBS remake of the 1964 drama
``Fail-Safe,'' about a U.S. bomber accidentally ordered to attack
Moscow with a nuclear weapon. But that original movie was a
success. ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' on the other hand, was
given only a modest release and lost $625,000 at the box office,
making it a big commercial flop.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the edited film is viewed by some film scholars as
a dazzling but sometimes odd work. Other scholars say that the
film's main interest is as an integral piece of the puzzle in the
long decline of Welles, who was 27 when he made ``Citizen Kane''
and 29 when he completed ``The Magnificent Ambersons.''
</P>
<P>
   He died at age of 70 in 1985, a tragic artist who spent his
final years appearing in television commercials, narrating
documentaries, appearing as a guest on comedy shows hosted by Dick
Cavett and Merv Griffin and struggling in vain to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   What led to the remake of ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' was a
meeting that Hartley held in his office in Beverly Hills with two
of the three producers of the miniseries, Norman Stephens and James
Kirkwood. The third producer is Jonas Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley told them that RKO, by then virtually dormant, was
looking in its archives to remake some of its classic films for
television and movie theaters. Among the films owned by the studio
are ``Suspicion,'' ``Gunga Din'' and ``Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,''
as well as ``The Magnificent Ambersons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked to see the complete script of `Ambersons,' ''
Stephens said. ``They dug it out. We fell in love with it. Then we
went back to the book, which the original screenplay tracks very
closely. We added scenes from the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1942 film starred Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, Dolores Costello,
Anne Baxter and Agnes Moorehead. It was based on the 1918 Pulitzer
Prize-winning Tarkington novel about a patrician Midwestern family
facing decline and despair with the arrival of the automobile.
Welles' Mercury Theater had initially adapted the novel as a radio
play.
</P>
<P>
   Arau took over the miniseries project recently when the original
director, Herbert Ross, dropped out because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is tentatively set to include Madeleine Stowe, Jennifer
Tilly, James Cromwell, Jonathan Rhys-Myers and Thora Birch.
Contracts are expected to be signed in the next few days. The cost
of the production is about $14 million, relatively high for a
television drama. Most of the financing comes from an Italian
company, the DeAngelis Group as well as A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original film was mutilated, but we have the original
script,'' Arau said. ``That script was very faithful to the novel.
The challenge is to make the film based on that script.''

 HOLLYWOOD: that script. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arau said the notion of remaking an Orson Welles movie ``was not
very attractive to me.'' He added: ``It's almost like a lack of
respect. But at the same time it's based on screenplay by Welles,
not the movie. It's a great, great family drama. And I look at it
as if I were doing a classic like `Romeo and Juliet' or `The
Miser.' I don't feel as if I'm stepping in Shakespeare's shoes or
Moliere's.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the producers, Arau said he believed that ``Ambersons'' was
not dated and hoped that it would stir contemporary audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel and film were a critical and intelligent view of the
upper class at the turn of the century,'' he said. ``It showed how
all these huge fortunes, which they thought of as their divine
right, collapsed with the advent of the automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well look what's happening now at the millennium: new fortunes
are being made because of the Internet and computers. Old fortunes
are dying. The world is changing radically. Values are changing.
Just like 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Welles viewed ``The Magnificent Ambersons''
_ that is, his original version _ as his masterpiece. In ``This Is
Orson Welles'' (First Da Capo Press), a series of interviews with
the director Peter Bogdanovich, Welles said he had once reluctantly
seen the edited film in Paris with Andre Gide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was most unpleasant,'' Welles said. ``I would have been
happier never to know and just hear what they had done to it. For
five or six reels things weren't so bad. I thought: `Well, that
isn't so bad. They didn't do too many things _ only a few stupid
little cuts.' And then all hell broke loose. It was a much better
picture than `Kane.' If they had just left it as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley, the RKO chairman, said that the company initially
considered turning the drama into a feature film. But this would
have meant making a three-hour film costing $50 million to $60
million. ``It would not be a good investment,'' he said. ``The odds
are you would not find a big enough audience to make a feature film
set in this period.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, making television films is much
cheaper than producing feature films _ partly because of lower
salary and production costs. Moreover, the films can be played
numerous times on A&AMP;E to recoup the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley said that when he joined RKO nine years ago, the staff
there began searching through vaults for footage from various
films. They found a film can that was thought to be the footage
from ``Ambersons.'' ``There was this momentary thrill,'' Hartley
said. ``But when we opened the can the film was unrecognizable. It
had fallen apart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert L. Carringer, author of ``The Magnificent Ambersons:
A Reconstruction'' (University of California Press, 1993) said that
outtakes of the film were burned because of a shortage of storage
space.
</P>
<P>
   In his authoritative book on the film, Carringer said that
Welles himself shared considerable blame for the outcome of the
edited film. ``It was a string of questionable judgments and rash
actions on his part that paved the way to the film's undoing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This included Welles' decision to accept a proposal by the
government's Office of Inter-American Affairs, run by Nelson
Rockefeller and John Hay Whitney, to make a film in Brazil to
foster relations with Latin America. Welles left ``The Magnificent
Ambersons'' in the hands of subordinates. ``When serious
difficulties did arise, there was no one to take charge on Welles'
behalf, and his surrender of the right of final cut left the studio
free to act as it chose.''
</P>
<P>
   RKO took over the editing of the film while Welles was in Rio.
This was after a devastating preview in Pomona, Calif., before a
largely teen-age audience that had just seen the wartime musical
``The Fleet's In.'' Welles himself had ordered cuts and editing
changes before the preview _ including an almost explicit Oedipal
relationship in the movie. So what the audience members saw was a
slow-paced period drama that bored them.
</P>
<P>
   RKO's studio president, George Schaefer, gave Robert Wise, who
edited ``Citizen Kane,'' the responsibility of cutting ``The
Magnificent Ambersons.'' Wise later directed such classics as ``The
Sound of Music.'' Forty-three minutes of the Welles film were cut.
The film was tested again and virtually abandoned by the studio.
Schaefer was soon deposed as studio chief, and Welles' contract
with RKO was dropped. ``It soon became clear that he would never be
entrusted with a major production again on his own terms,'' said
Carringer.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Wise said he still recalled the first
preview. ``It was a disaster _ the audience laughed at the wrong
places,'' he said. ``It was terribly long.'' Wise, editor of the
original version, said that the studio asked him to trim the movie.
``We previewed it again, and it still wasn't right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After further cuts, and the addition of one scene that Wise
himself directed while Welles was in Brazil, the film was played
before another preview audience. ``There were no bad laughs,'' Wise
said. ``And that's the film that went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise said it was absurd that Welles felt ```Ambersons'' had
destroyed his career. ``All wrong,'' he said. ``It was just a bad
time for that film. War had been declared. And audiences were not
interested in the problems of the Amberson family in Indianapolis
at the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sabinson, senior president for programming at A&AMP;E, said he
hoped that the cable network's largely adult audience would turn to
the new version of a film that may only stir vague memories now.
``It's been more than 50 years since the edited film was
released,'' Sabinson said. ``And there's a tragic story behind that
film. `The Magnificent Ambersons' was truly the passion of Orson
Welles. And his version was never released.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush knows that he cannot be elected president
unless he gets votes from many people who do not agree with him or
the Republican Party platform on issues such as abortion, gun
control, capital punishment and the privatization of Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   That is why today is gear-shifting day in Philadelphia. The
selection of Richard Cheney as his running mate and the
deliberations of the platform committee all emphasized the
conservative part of Bush's background and core vote. Once the
first session of the Republican National Convention opens Monday
evening, the nation will see four nights devoted to what Frank
Luntz, a Republican pollster, calls the politics of pleasantry.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat paradoxically, Bush has imposed what he calls an
``iron-fist rule'' to make sure that ideology does not trump his
preferred themes of tolerance and inclusion. That means most of the
party's hard-line orators will be kept away from the microphones
inside First Union Center, site of a convention that is, in
essence, a $65 million exercise in recruiting the moderate swing
voter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan for this convention reflects the lessons of 1992,
when his father's lax campaign team gave Pat Buchanan and other
polarizing speakers prime-time roles. By way of contrast, Bill
Clinton used his party's 1992 convention to play down the
Democrats' liberal tradition and to emulate the Republicans'
emphasis on fiscal responsibility and welfare reform. In
Philadelphia, Bush will attempt to borrow the positive imagery long
associated with such Democratic issues as education and the saving
of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Given the blunt, contrary language of much of the Republican
platform, this will require some serious spinning and deft
television imagery. The effort began Sunday with such figures as
Govs. Tommy Thompson and George Pataki giving the platform a decent
burial by declaring it basically irrelevant to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the restrictive language on abortion. According to
Pataki, what matters more is Bush's vision. In fact, whereas former
President George Bush stumbled over the vision thing, his son is
determined to make it a central theme. His emphasis will be on
positive evocative language about character, principles,
leadership, faith, hope, love, rather than on the Republican policy
positions that could make him appear authoritarian, elitist or
hostile to the interests of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the sparse minority representation, convention
planners have given starring roles to Bush's most prominent black
advisers, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and included a large
number of Hispanic Republicans. The prominence of entertainment
figures and musical numbers also bespeaks an effort to steer this
convention away from wedge issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his role of the Democrats' uber-strategist, tried to
blow the whistle Saturday on what he sees as Bush's desire to make
this a campaign about good feelings rather than hard issues.
``That's the message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur,'' the president
complained. Such critiques are not likely to dent the faith that
Bush and his advisers have in polls showing that voters prefer
lofty, positive generalities to bitter partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``iron-fist rule'' imposed by Bush is that there should
be no prolonged attacks on Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or
Hillary Rodham Clinton. The campaign will try to be more deft in
invoking Clinton fatigue. Cheney has taken to depicting the
president as a tragic figure. In a television commercial, Bush
speaks of the Clinton years as bringing a budget surplus, but a
deficit in values.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans agree with these soft tactics and the gauzy
approach summed up in Bush's slogan of compassionate conservatism.
But suppose he succeeds this week in having undecided voters focus
on his soothing, positive statements about education, health care,
Social Security and taxes, rather than on the harsh and often
unfair policy positions espoused by the platform and the Republican
congressional majority. Then Bush will be able to count this
convention a success, and Gore can count on having his hands full
this fall.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   Equatorial Guinea is a poor Central African nation that is
hoping to become a rich Central African nation. In 1996, American
companies began to pump major oil deposits from the waters around
Equatorial Guinea and production has been rising steadily. If the
new oil revenue is managed well, it can educate, heal and provide
jobs for the country's half-million people.
</P>
<P>
   But oil brings risks as well as opportunities. Rarely have
developing countries used oil money to improve the lives of the
majority of citizens or bring steady economic growth. More often,
oil revenues have caused crippling economic distortions and been
spent on showy projects, weapons and Paris shopping trips for
government officials. The people of misgoverned Equatorial Guinea
may see few benefits from their nation's oil.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum helps a nation most when its government already has
democratic accountability, fiscal discipline and a bureaucracy that
is based on merit and is relatively free of corruption. Norway,
which first struck oil in the North Sea in 1969 and started getting
substantial income from it 10 years later, has managed its
resources wisely. Norway used oil money as a catalyst to broaden
the country's manufacturing base. It required oil investors to put
money into other industries as well. Thanks to oil, Norway now
sends three times as many people to college as it did in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Most oil producers, however, do not have Norway's advantages. In
many cases, such as Nigeria, oil revenue has simply disappeared
into the overseas bank accounts of dictators and their cronies. Oil
is particularly corrupting because it is hard to keep track of and
easy to turn into cash. It is tempting to spend the sudden windfall
on pharaonic works or arms. OPEC countries spend more of their GNP
on weapons than other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Oil-producing countries also score lower in health and education
than many poorer nations. Kuwait has twice the per capita income of
Barbados, for example, but people in Barbados live better. The
biggest problem is that even though petroleum provides few jobs,
fluctuates wildly in price and will some day run out, the sudden
profits can lead to a reliance on oil and a withering of the rest
of the economy. Norway was cautious because it studied the
experience of the Netherlands, which suffered in the 1960s when
natural gas revenues were allowed to hide problems in other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, oil allowed the central government to hire huge
numbers of unneeded workers, finance inefficient state enterprises
and obtain large loans. Oil exports also led the government to set
exchange-rate policies that made the rest of its exports
uncompetitive, which reinforced its dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, when other Latin American countries were carrying
out needed economic reforms, Venezuela's oil cushion sapped the
political will for needed austerity programs. Many Venezuelans
believe that oil has also undercut the importance of personal
initiative by offering wealth without work.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Equatorial Guinea say they are determined not to
make the mistakes of oil-rich but still-impoverished Cameroon,
Gabon and Nigeria. But even leaders aware of the pitfalls of oil
will not be able to avoid them if corruption and mismanagement are
endemic.

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Every Sunday after the 11 a.m. Mass ends at St.
Daniel of the Prophet Church, the pews immediately begin filling up
again - this time with Latinos who have come to worship in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sanchez, the church's Spanish-speaking deacon, pulls back
curtains at the rear of the sanctuary, making space for an
additional 100 seats as parishioners stream into the south
Scottsdale church.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, hundreds of Latinos, the majority young couples
with children, have packed the 12:30 p.m. Mass, filling the
900-seat church.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of Hispanic Catholics - fueled by
immigration and large families - is one of the biggest challenges
facing the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese, which covers Maricopa, Coconino, Mohave, and
Yavapai counties, is home to one of the fastest-growing Latino
populations in the nation. And the majority of Latinos, between 65
and 85 percent, are Catholic, said Alejandro Aguilera-Titus,
associate director for the Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs at the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops concluded that the Phoenix Diocese ranks ninth among
the dioceses nationwide with the fastest-growing Latino
populations. That report was based on U.S. Census Bureau estimates
which show the Latino population in the Phoenix area grew from
113,075 to 163,385, or 44.5 percent, between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming, the number of monolingual Spanish-speaking
people. They seem to be coming out of the woodwork,'' said the Rev.
Thomas Zurcher, vicar of priests for the Phoenix Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of Hispanic Catholics is reinvigorating many older
parishes where numbers had been declining. But a serious shortage
of Hispanic leaders, especially bilingual Latino priests, is making
it difficult to minister to the new parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials fear that some newcomers will drift away from
the Catholic Church or to Protestant sects working hard to reach
Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   So they're reaching out. More than half of the 86 parishes that
make up the Phoenix Diocese have added at least one weekly Mass in
Spanish. Several have added two or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years alone, the Phoenix Diocese has added
nine Spanish Masses, bringing the total per week to 60, church
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the Spanish Masses are celebrated by
White, non-Latino priests. And the Masses themselves have created
additional challenges: They allow Hispanic Catholics to maintain
their own identity and culture, but they create a divided community
within the same parish, one largely White that worships in English,
the other largely Latino that worships in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great pastoral concern. How do you bring two diverse
groups together to form one community?'' Zurcher said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, diversity within the Latino community also poses
a challenge for the church, Zurcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Hispanics have been here generation after generation, and
others have just arrived from Mexico, so you've got multiple
concerns within the same community,'' Zurcher said.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS
</P>
<P>
   St. Daniel the Prophet Parish, at Hayden Road and Roosevelt
Street in Scottsdale, was formed in the early 1960s to serve
Motorola employees who lived and worked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But south Scottsdale is now home to a majority of the estimated
12,490-plus in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Latinos attending St. Daniel's Church grew, the
parish added a Mass in Spanish, first monthly, then weekly. In the
past five years, attendance at the Spanish Mass has skyrocketed,
and it now draws Latinos from neighboring Tempe and east Phoenix,
said Sanchez, the deacon, who has been attending St. Daniel's for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Colombia, Sanchez, 59, is fluent in English and
Spanish, and is an ordained deacon. Dressed in a long white robe
and sash, he plays a key leadership role during the 12:30 p.m. Mass
at St. Daniel's each Sunday, standing behind the pulpit to deliver
the homily in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hispanic leadership that St. Daniel's enjoys is
something missing at many Roman Catholic churches around the
Valley, capped by a severe shortage of Latino priests, church
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 247 priests serving in the Diocese of Phoenix, only 14
are Latinos. And only six of the 26 seminarians studying to become
priests in the diocese are Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The growing pool of male Hispanic newcomers is a potential
source of new Latino priests, according to recent report by the
National Council of Catholic Bishops in Washington, D.C. But
education, language and cultural barriers work to limit their entry
into the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of family in the Hispanic community has such a
strong attraction to Hispanic men that it's difficult for them to
forgo that value for celibate priesthood,'' Zurcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, Irish and other immigrant groups in the 19th and early
20th centuries brought their own clergy to the United States, but
that hasn't happened with newer waves of Latino immigrants, Zurcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of Hispanic Catholics is not isolated to border
states such as Arizona, said Armando Contreras, executive director
for the National Council for Hispanic Ministry. It is a national
issue for the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is being fueled at two levels: migration, both legal
and illegal, from Mexico and other parts of Latin America; and the
children of earlier arrivals, Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of Latinos coming from Mexico or Central
America happen to be Catholics,'' Contreras said. ``That's part of
their culture. It's pretty much a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the number of Hispanic Catholics is greater than church
registration numbers indicate, church officials say.
</P>
<P>
   There are 440,226 registered Catholics in the Phoenix Diocese,
but the majority of new parishioners coming from Mexico and Central
America don't register.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials hesitate to estimate the number of unregistered
Latinos attending Masses in the Phoenix Diocese, but Jose Robles,
outreach coordinator for the Phoenix Hispanic Ministry, guesses
it's between 80,000 and 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a different worldview and I suspect a lot of them
don't register because they are fearful of difficulties with
immigration and the like,'' said Father R. Clements, pastor at St.
Mary's Catholic Church in Chandler, where one-third of the
parishioners are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   He fears that the church will lose many of the new parishioners,
who are accustomed to a more charismatic style of worship than that
found in the United States, and bring with them a different
worldview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been my sense that they will drift away from the
(Catholic) Church or into Protestant sects that have been making
great efforts to reach this population,'' Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an issue of considerable import and gravity.
Because this influx has occurred so suddenly, the diocese has not
been able to keep up as well as we would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clements is trying. He added a second Mass in Spanish
last October and is considering a third. He learned Spanish in the
seminary and uses it extensively in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of Phoenix, like many Catholic dioceses across the
country, now requires all seminarians studying for the priesthood
to learn Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's standard operating procedure in the seminary,''
Clements said. ``You study Latin, you study biblical Greek and you
study Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Folz Sr., 69, has seen the positive side of the influx of
Catholic Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   A semiretired executive of an office equipment supplier, Folz
has been attending St. Francis Xavier Church on North Central
Avenue in Phoenix since 1941. The number of people attending Mass
on Sunday had been decreasing, but that's changing as more
Hispanics arrive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the church added a noon Sunday Mass to
accommodate the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to church on Sunday and you hear children crying
again,'' Folz said. ``Which to me is invigorating. We had gotten to
be a church of old people.''

TECHNOLOGY GETS REAL: 3D AND VIRTUAL INNOVATIONS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Peter Braccio bent to look inside the work area of
a three-dimensional printer, as though peering through an oven
window. Inside, things were baking nicely.
</P>
<P>
   A cube slowly slid back and forth along a track and each time it
passed over the small model it was creating, the printer spewed a
thin layer of wax in just the appropriate spots. Layer by layer,
like sheets of phyllo dough on a streudel, the sculpture that had
been designed on a nearby desktop computer gradually took shape.
</P>
<P>
   All around the room, hundreds of people were hard at work _
waiting their turn at the 3D printer or designing posters for an
enormous printer that could disgorge canvas sheets as big as a
garage door.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of these people's only opportunity to play with
some of this high-end equipment,'' said Braccio, part of the
volunteer staff helping put together this year's Siggraph
convention. Siggraph _ derived from the show's original name,
Special Interest in Computer Graphics _ is the most important
annual gathering for computer graphics and interactive
technologies, drawing everyone from industrial designers to serious
video artists to Hollywood special-effects wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which ended its five-day run on Friday at the
riverfront convention center here, is a trade show where the
biggest names in the industry and many hopeful start-up companies
unveil their newest products for computer animation, data
compression, virtual reality, three-dimensional imaging and other
high-technology tasks.
</P>
<P>
   But besides showing what is currently available, the annual
gathering also allows researchers to share prototypes from emerging
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there was a sense at this year's Siggraph that the
time was ripe for three-dimensional, interactive animation on the
Internet. And there was also a sense that many other technologies
were pushing hard against their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two-dimensional technologies yearned to be three-dimensional,
such as a figurine printer that 3D Systems was offering.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the three-dimensional technologies yearning
to be four.
</P>
<P>
   Holoscape, a project of Zebra Imaging and the University of
Texas at Austin, was a series of what researchers called ``digital
holographic stereograms.'' Instead of a two-dimensional picture
contained within a frame, the images were three-dimensional
holograms that appeared to protrude from the frame. The images
changed as the viewer moved from side to side, like scenes from a
3D movie.
</P>
<P>
   To a viewer standing in front of it, one 3D image appeared to be
a husband and wife smiling sweetly. But as the viewer moved from
left to right, the image sprang to life and the wife turned, hugged
her husband and leaned her head on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   One word on the lips of many people at the show was
collaboration _ devices and software designed to nudge people into
working in a more collaborative way, either in cyberspace or at the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're around here long enough, you'll get sick of hearing
the word collaboration,'' said Dan Wright, president of Fakespace
Systems, a company that makes three-dimensional imaging devices for
commercial and industrial uses. The company was showing a concave
monitor that looked like the inside of a steel hemisphere in whose
cavity images assumed three-dimensional life. Another company,
Elumens, was showing a similar monitor that allowed viewers to move
through three-dimensional landscapes and architectural models.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Siggraph trade floor was peppered with virtual
workbenches and virtual tunnels, all designed to allow several
workers to experience an image _ and interact with it _ at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get people working together,'' said Scott Ross,
president of Digital Domain, one of Hollywood's leading
special-effects houses. Ross said he had long recognized that good
ideas do not always bubble up unless people are forced to interact
_ especially computer people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, many of these people are conflict avoidant and don't
have great interpersonal skills,'' he said. ``That's one of the
reasons they gravitated to a career where they work with a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another theme that seemed to envelop Siggraph this year was
renewed interest in virtual reality _ not so long ago a virtual
dirty word because of its failure to deliver on the promises of the
early 1990's. In particular, researchers seemed to be struggling
with ways to throw off the cumbersome goggles and gloves that early
virtual reality devices utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, immersive technologies have let us down,'' said
Robert Stone, scientific director at Muse Technologies. ``At one
time, people said, `Put on a headset and it's a different world,
your dreams can come true.' Instead, you were always aware you had
this thing on your head and some people came out feeling nauseous
and disoriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality devices were in evidence on the Siggraph floor
that allowed users to dispense with goggles and add some other
senses for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo Institute of Technology was showing a Virtual Rubik's
Cube. The user could insert his hands into an empty metal frame
that contained rings with strings attached into which he could fit
his fingers. A video monitor above the frame showed his hands and a
three-dimensional cube that did not actually exist. As the user
twisted and turned the imaginary cube, the tension on the strings
was altered to give the user the sensation of manipulating the cube
he could see twisting and turning on the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kurzweil, the convention's keynote speaker and the author of
``The Age of Spiritual Machines,'' said he foresaw a world just a
few decades away when computers would disappear, information would
be displayed directly onto the retina and nano-tubes implanted at
nerve endings would allow people to flip in and out of totally
immersive and totally convincing virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   Such science-fiction peeks into the future are also a Siggraph
staple, but there were tiny indications that the technology was at
least moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is not flat,'' said David Hague, senior director of
3D technology at Immersion. ``It's not a two-dimensional computer
screen. It's real and it's full of interesting things to
experience. It's full of things to experience with all of your
senses.''

FAILED TRADE FORCES YANKS TO LOOK WEST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ After working on another blockbuster three-team
deal that fell apart, the New York Yankees moved closer to
completing a trade with San Diego for pitcher Matt Clement and
outfielder Eric Owens, according to baseball officials.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's 4 p.m. trade deadline looming, Yankees officials
were considering proposals that would improve this year's team _ at
the expense of more prospects _ as it tries to become the first
team since the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics to win three consecutive
World Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks for a three-team trade with San Diego and Baltimore
that would have sent B.J. Surhoff to the Yankees broke down Sunday,
and the chances for a two-team deal including Surhoff also ended.
But the Yankees were continuing to explore a deal for Milwaukee
outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, after another proposed three-way deal
that included Montreal's Rondell White fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   This is the deal the Yankees seemed poised to make Sunday night:
Clement and Owens from San Diego for the Yankees' top prospect,
infielder Alfonso Soriano, middle reliever Jason Grimsley and a
minor league pitcher, Brandon Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a 29-year-old right-handed hitter, would play left field
for the Yankees; he is hitting .304 with four home runs and 32 runs
batted in with 20 stolen bases in 32 attempts, and is considered to
have average skills on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What getting a left fielder would mean to us is freeing up
David Justice to DH a little bit more,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``Otherwise, he'd play the outfield a little more than you'd
want him to, and that would be OK, too. That's what I mean, it's
not an emergency where you have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees would do with Clement is unclear. He is a
highly touted young starting pitcher who has struggled lately,
surrendering nine earned runs in 3 1/3 innings to Pittsburgh on
Friday, with a Yankees scout in attendance. The Yankees could
insert Clement into their rotation immediately and bump the
struggling David Cone, or they could try to use Clement as a middle
reliever now and put him in the rotation next year. Adding Clement
would also give the Yankees the depth and flexibility to trade
Ramiro Mendoza, who is becoming more expensive to keep each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-team deal with San Diego and Baltimore that was
considered, San Diego would have served as the conduit _ a
necessity because the Orioles have repeatedly rejected Yankees
offers for Surhoff. The Padres would have shipped Owens, catcher
Carlos Hernandez and a minor league outfielder, Jeremy Owens, to
the Orioles for Surhoff and the veteran catcher Greg Myers.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego then would have relayed Surhoff to the Yankees, along
with Clement _ a hard-throwing sinkerballer with a 9-10 record and
a 5.62 earned run average _ and Donne Wall, a serviceable
right-handed reliever. The Padres would have received the Yankees'
two best Triple-A prospects, Soriano and pitcher Adrian Hernandez,
as well as Grimsley and a minor league outfielder, Marcus Thames.
</P>
<P>
   But late Sunday, the Orioles began to have reservations about
the deal _ possibly because Soriano, whom they had hoped to extract
from the Yankees in return for Surhoff, would end up in San Diego.
Yankees officials also have long suspected that Baltimore would
have difficulty making a deal with a division rival.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff has been a trade target of the Yankees since early May.
His hitting style fits in perfectly with that of the other Yankees:
He is a line-drive hitter who makes a lot of contact, and like
Justice, is a left-handed batter who hits left-handed pitchers as
well or better than right-handers. That quality presents matchup
problems for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres want Soriano, hoping he will realize his potential to
be a top-flight offensive shortstop. The Yankees have held Soriano
out of many proposed trades because they did not want to swap a top
commodity for an outfielder. Rather, they wanted to wait until they
could acquire a good pitcher for Soriano, and the inclusion of
Clement in the trade would fill that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Hernandez, 25, defected from Cuba, signed a $4.5 million
contract with the Yankees this summer and has ascended quickly
through the farm system. He pitched a one-hitter for Triple-A
Columbus last week, with the San Diego executive Ted Simmons in
attendance to watch Soriano play shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have also explored a trade for Burnitz, but once the
Brewers scuttled a proposed three-way deal with Montreal and the
Yankees because of White's history of injuries, the Yankees turned
to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal for Burnitz, who is batting .218 with 22 home runs
and 61 RBI, remained a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees discussed and dismissed the possibility of trading
the Triple-A pitcher Randy Keisler to Oakland for outfielder Matt
Stairs and have known all along that if other larger deals fall
through, they can make a trade for the Rangers' Chad Curtis, a
former Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis left the Yankees in the off-season convinced that his
strong religious beliefs and his clash with Derek Jeter might have
contributed to his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Sunday: ``We're concerned about winning, and the
whole makeup of our team is that way. If someone fits
professionally on the team, that's what we concern ourselves
with.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the various stories about their relationship
that Laura and George W. Bush like to tell, not one gets a more
frequent and thorough workout than this: She married him only after
they had reached an agreement that she would never have to make a
political speech on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   She must have been skeptical. It was the end of 1977, and Bush
was gearing up for what would turn out to be an ill-fated campaign
for a congressional seat from west Texas, and his father was laying
the groundwork for his own ill-fated presidential bid in 1980.
These were the Bushes _ politics was in their plasma. Her vow of
silence was doomed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's appearance at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia on Monday night will be the latest _ and by far the
most nerve-frazzling _ illustration of that. She is scheduled to
deliver the first major address of the event, with thousands of
people spread out before her, the invisible eyes of a national
television audience on her, and the responsibility for properly
jump-starting a four-day jubilee in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get butterflies a little bit, thinking about it,'' she said
in a recent interview, adding that she remained a bit baffled by
how she got from there to here, from a placid career as an
elementary school librarian in the 1970s to the turbulent reality
of a presidential campaign that put her on a national stage,
whether she wanted to be there or not.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, too, marveled at that trajectory. ``If I'd have
said, `Honey, you'll be the kickoff speaker at the Republican
convention in the year 2000,' she would have said, `You've totally
lost your mind, and I'm not marrying you,''' he told several
reporters at the governor's mansion last week.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's remarks point to one of the most intriguing aspects
of Laura Welch Bush, a trait that sets her apart from many of her
predecessors on this path: She never aspired to it, never planned
it, never looked across the broad expanse of the future and saw
herself in a wash of light, with a microphone under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, several of her friends and acquaintances say, she
could trade it all for long afternoons of reading or mornings of
gardening and be utterly happy _ perhaps even happier.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, friends and relatives say, she has adapted to her role
in the limelight and her part as a political spouse with relative
ease and remarkable vigor, drawing on a serious (albeit quiet)
intellect to become an active first lady in Texas and to develop a
public voice and style more mellifluous than her husband's, and
maybe even more assured.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voters who take note of Laura Bush for the first
time on Monday night will undoubtedly be surprised and impressed by
that, and will get little sense of the reluctance she openly
expressed before Gov. George W. Bush launched his campaign for the
White House last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, the former first lady, said in a recent interview
that her daughter-in-law adhered to ``a great philosophy in life _
you can either like it or not, so you might as well like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her convention speech was, in fact, a
harbinger of more activity and a higher profile for her. With the
couple's twin 18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, heading for
college around Labor Day and leaving the Bushes with an empty nest,
Laura Bush plans to hit the campaign trail full-time, at her
husband's side and on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unbelievable life experience,'' she called it in one of
four interviews over the last two months. ``An unbelievable
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were ever-present hints, in her words and gestures and
the observations of those who know her best, that her attitude
about this whole crazy pageant was much more complicated than that.
After her husband literally got choked up when he talked about her
during an event in Greensboro, N.C., three months ago, he explained
in an interview, ``I know she's making a huge sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush made it clear that her interest was in helping
him, not promoting herself, and that she was not offering voters
two for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for office,'' said Laura Bush, 53. ``George is
running for office. I don't really even want to talk about issues
that much. I'm not that knowledgeable about most issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about education,'' she added, mentioning the topic of
her convention speech. ``I know about things that I've worked on.
But you know, most other issues I don't know that much about. And
just to put in my 2 cents to put in my 2 cents _ I don't think it's
really necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference from four years ago, when Elizabeth Dole,
roaming among the delegates at the Republican convention with a
mobile microphone and Oprah-esque panache, was not simply singing
the praises of her husband, Bob Dole, the party's presidential
nominee, but also strutting her own political stuff. It turned out
to be a prelude to her short-lived bid for the presidency last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle hovered Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
first lady who had never been shy about throwing in her thoughts,
and who also had a candidacy in her future.
</P>
<P>
   But their counterparts this time, Tipper Gore and Laura Bush,
seem to be more ambivalent recruits, as content in the background
as in the foreground, yanked by their husbands' desires into races
and places that they might never have chosen for themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, an intensely private woman, shares none of her
husband's showmanship or garrulousness; toward the end of an
interview with her aboard his campaign plane, when the governor
exuberantly jumped in to compete for the attention of the reporter
seated beside her, she promptly turned away, pulled out several
pieces of stationery and began writing thank-you notes to
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is always bouncing off the walls,'' observed Anne
Johnson, who has known the couple for decades and whose husband,
Clay, is the chief of staff in the governor's office. ``Laura is so
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush says that contrast is one reason that their union,
both personally and politically, works well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I temper that personality,'' she said, referring to
her husband's brashness, ``but I also think that he makes life much
more exciting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But both she and her husband's advisers seem unsure at times of
how exactly to cast Laura Bush's degree of reserve.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they clearly see her detachment from the
messier, more vainglorious dimensions of politics as an advantage:
evidence to support her husband's assertion that he, too, is a
grounded, down-to-earth person not driven by an insatiable ego or a
partisan blood lust. The way Bush praised her in a recent interview
was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cuts right through, through the posturing and
positioning,'' Bush said proudly. ``America's starved for
something. I'm telling you: They're starved for something real. And
that's what she brings. She's a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Bush campaign also does not want to
present her as a bashful, timid throwback or blandly dutiful
helpmate _ an inaccurate portrait that might not play well with
female swing voters and that decidedly sells Laura Bush short.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with other journalists in the past, Laura Bush
readily called herself shy, but she now emphatically rejects that
label. Some of her friends go out of their way to do likewise. It
is as if they all received the same memo.
</P>
<P>
   And an expression of distaste swept over her face recently when
this reporter brought up a story, which had appeared elsewhere in
print, that she had once answered a question from George W. Bush's
paternal grandmother about what she did with her life, by saying,
``I read, I smoke and I admire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally made up,'' Laura Bush said. ``I'm sure I said
`I read.' But I certainly didn't say `I admire.''' (As for smoking,
Laura Bush eventually quit.)
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Bush said in a recent interview that she remembered
both her daughter-in-law's three-part answer and her
mother-in-law's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush darn near collapsed,'' Barbara Bush said, recalling
the reaction of the former president's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Laura Bush had a busy professional life as an
elementary school teacher and librarian for a decade before she
began dating George W. Bush, and she remained single, without pangs
of worry, longer than any of her close female friends. She was 31
when she and Bush married in November 1977, three months after they
met.
</P>
<P>
   Her avidity for reading is really an abiding love of literature,
and when she and Bush were living in Dallas and raising their two
daughters in the 1980s, Mrs. Bush, who had given up her career
around the time of her wedding, used her spare time to take classes
on William Faulkner, Greek tragedy and other literary topics.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican primaries earlier this year, she was on a
Truman Capote binge, but had to interrupt it because she found
herself in the middle of ``In Cold Blood'' around the time that
Bush lost the New Hampshire contest to Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so foreboding,'' Laura Bush said of Capote's masterwork,
``and I was reading it during the most anxiety-provoking time, and
I had to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name her favorite book, she cited part of one: the
``Grand Inquisitor'' section of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' by
Dostoevsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said that she moved into the first lady's office in
Austin in 1995, after her husband was first elected governor, with
the expectation that ``cobwebs would grow on the phone,'' she did
not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Right away she became a driving force behind the inception of
the annual Texas Book Festival, which has raised about $900,000 for
the state's public libraries, and in 1998 and 1999 she helped
write, lobby for, and secure the passage of legislation that
allocated $17 million a year to improve programs to teach preschool
children in Texas to read.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush also has a sassy streak that gets scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, George W. Bush occasionally joked in public speeches
that his wife had a librarian's narrow concept of oratory, and it
amounted to a single syllable: ``Shhhh!'' Laura Bush was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a speech, to kid him, to get back at him, I said he was a
gregarious businessman who thought that a bibliography was the
biography _ the story _ of the person who wrote the Bible,'' she
recalled. She laughed heartily at the memory of her little act of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   And she has an adventurous impulse: For her 40th and 50th
birthdays, she went river-rafting with four close female friends,
including a Democratic state senator from Kansas and a midwife from
San Francisco who recently visited Indonesia to teach classes on
childbirth. Around Austin, Laura Bush maintains a similarly
eclectic mix of social acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say that the governor often solicits her
advice, asking for her intuition about people and situations, and
she serves as his filter for much of what gets written about him in
newspapers and magazines, which she seems to monitor more closely
than he does. He often tells reporters not what he thought of their
articles but what she did.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear that she shares his positions on
sensitive issues. He opposes abortion; she declines to elucidate
her feelings. He has presided over more executions than any other
governor; she does not comment on the death penalty either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in so many ways, she has followed his lead. He ran for
governor despite her expressed fears about the privacy that their
family would lose. Then he upped the ante by running for president,
even though she had talked publicly about her trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say to George, for something that he really
wanted to do, that he couldn't do that,'' Laura Bush said, adding
that he, too, would never deny her something that she deemed
important. People who know the couple well have said that his
decision to quit drinking 14 years ago was partly a response to her
entreaties and to a growing worry that he was endangering his
marriage and family life, which he cherished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said that her own family life had been a stable and
deeply loving one. She grew up as an only child in Midland, where
her father, Harold B. Welch, was a successful home builder and her
mother, Jenna Welch, kept his books. Although neither of her
parents finished college, they let Laura know early that they
expected her to do so, and she was a conscientious, excellent
student who never got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   She was acutely aware of her mother's other failed attempts to
have a child, several of which ended in premature babies who died
within days, and, perhaps as a result, she said: ``I felt very
obligated to my parents. I didn't want to upset them in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   She and George W. Bush, who also grew up in Midland, went to
different elementary schools but were in the seventh grade together
at the same middle school, although neither of them remembers
knowing the other well. She stayed in Midland while he went to
Philips Academy in Andover, Mass. She and her friends described her
high school years as happy and generally uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   But one day in 1963, when she was 17, she drove through a stop
sign and hit another car. Its occupant, a boy who happened to be a
close friend, was killed in the collision, which was deemed an
accident; no charges were filed against her. Laura Bush said that
she was steeled for the incident to come up during her husband's
presidential campaign, as it did earlier this year, but she
nonetheless tensed at the mention of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, terrible thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1964, she headed to Southern Methodist University
in Dallas, where her major was education. It was a conventional
choice, and one that she briefly doubted in the years after her
graduation in 1968. Feminism had come into vogue; she was reading
some of the books that the movement had spawned, and she said she
told her father that he should not have ``programmed'' her to be a
teacher when she could have been a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Daddy almost immediately pulled out his wallet,'' she
recalled, ``and said, `I'll send you to law school.' He would have
loved to.''
</P>
<P>
   But she remembered: ``I had to admit, when he did that, that I
didn't want to be a lawyer. I wanted to be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She taught in inner-city elementary schools in Dallas and
Houston for three years, living at one time in the same apartment
complex in Houston as her future husband, who was then a pilot in
the Texas Air National Guard. But her place was on the quiet wing,
and his was on the rowdy one, and they never crossed paths.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a master's degree in library science from the
University of Texas in 1973, she settled in Austin, where she
worked as an elementary school librarian. She said that she never
lacked for dates but did not find the right man until, in the
summer of 1977, she visited Midland, where Bush was making his way
in the oil business. A couple who knew them both invited them for a
backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked and talked. Laura Welch listened and listened. The
next night, he took her out for a game of miniature golf. And three
months later they married.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments were necessary. She was persuaded to make her first
political speech the next year, when he waged his unsuccessful
campaign for Congress. He learned to conform to her standards of
tidiness and order, which were so high that one of her friends, Jan
O'Neill, recalled that Laura Bush organized the books in the
couple's bedroom in accordance with the Dewey decimal system.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush family gatherings, she made an unusual addition to the
sometimes rambunctious clan. Her husband recalled his parents and
siblings sitting around the table in Kennebunkport, Maine, their
plates clean, while they watched and waited patiently for his wife
to pick her way through her meal.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wanted a large family of their own, tried for several
years without success, and had already begun the adoption process
when she finally learned that she was pregnant with fraternal
twins.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the outlook was uncertain; she developed toxemia, and
her doctor told her that she would be lucky to deliver one healthy
child. Laura Bush said that whenever she went to the grocery store,
she avoided the aisle with diapers and baby-related items, because
she did not want to stoke her hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she has been a fiercely devoted mother. They also
say she has been an integral part of her husband's success, not
because she is a second engine of his ambition but because she is a
shock absorber, keeping him calm and stable, and occasionally
keeping his mischievous and arrogant streaks in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rein it in, Bubba,'' she told him one day on his campaign
plane, as he held forth at length in front of reporters. Privately,
when she catches him ribbing people mercilessly or strutting
shamelessly, she simply murmurs, ``Bushieee,'' her voice rising at
the end. He knows what that means.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has not given extensive thought to what kind of
first lady she might make, but her mother-in-law has some ideas.
Barbara Bush said her daughter-in-law would be different from
Hillary Clinton because she would ``not get into foreign affairs or
controversial subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would rather make a positive impact on the
country,'' Barbara Bush said. ``And I'm not criticizing Mrs.
Clinton. But it's like oil and water. We're talking about two
different subjects. They're two different people. I think Laura
thinks of others.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said her daughter-in-law would be ``better, much
better'' in the role than she was. ``She won't be a fat,
white-haired old lady,'' Barbara Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   She would also be less voluble, and in many ways less
accessible, because there are tight boundaries around what Laura
Bush is willing to offer for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last September, when she accompanied her
husband to an outdoor memorial service for the seven people killed
by a gunman at a church in Fort Worth. She wore sunglasses, which
she never took off. But every so often, she lifted a tissue to her
face, delicately tucked it behind her dark lenses and then quickly
put it away.

Campaign or no campaign, Laura Bush was not about to share her

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ At a time when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
sought to portray the Republican Party as increasingly moderate,
the majority of delegates assembling here Sunday to nominate him
for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit,
according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   On a host of important issues, from affirmative action to
environmental concerns to abortion, the poll found that delegates
stand significantly to the right of much of the nation, and even of
rank-and-file Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a majority of the 2,066 delegates described themselves
as somewhat or very conservative, and their views on a variety of
topics reflected that.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates by and large supported large tax cuts and school
vouchers, and oppose gun control, restrictions on trade,
environmental safeguards, abortion rights, prescription drug
subsidies for the elderly and campaign finance regulation. In one
notable example of the contrast between the delegates and
Republican voters, the Times/CBS poll found that fewer than half
the delegates said they supported mandatory child safety trigger
locks on guns, a measure that was supported by eight out of 10
registered Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has sought for much of this year to distinguish
himself from his party's conservative wing and history, most
delegates interviews Sunday viewed him as conservative, if not
necessarily as conservative as they considered themselves. They are
also, overwhelmingly, enthusiastic about the qualifications and
political skills of the man they will nominate for president on
Thursday night, and confident about his chances against Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has a conservative wing and a moderate wing and both
sides are comfortable with him,'' Eric Melgren, a delegate from
Kansas, said of Bush. ``Republicans are hungry enough that there
is, to at least some degree, things that all are willing to
overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding in the Times/CBS poll, as well as in follow-up
interviews conducted Sunday with delegates, suggested one of the
tasks Bush faces this week: convincing independents and moderate
Democrats, in particular, that his is the face of the Republican
Party, rather than of the delegates who will be celebrating his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of the delegates was conducted by The New York Times
and CBS News by telephone, mail, fax, e-mail and over the Internet
from June 26 through July 28. Of the 2,066 Republican delegates,
1,055 responded to the questionnaire. &UR;  &LR; The poll had a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates who began arriving here this weekend are, the poll
found, overwhelmingly white _ almost 90 percent _ and mostly male
and middle-age. By profession, they are more likely to be lawyers
and executives than teachers or farmers. They are relatively
wealthy: one in five put their net worth at $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in five said they belonged to the National Rifle
Association, and over half said they or someone in their house
owned a gun.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this campaign, Bush has sought to draw some distance
between himself and conservatives in the party _ and, it seems, he
has paid little price for that among the Republicans here. In
contrast to surveys of rank-and-file Republican voters, the poll of
the delegates found that they were more apt to describe Bush as
conservative. Indeed, in a tribute to Bush's political skills,
delegates who described themselves as moderate viewed Bush as one,
too, while self-described conservatives called him conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Buxton, a delegate from Maine who described herself as
moderate, offered this description of the governor on Sunday: ``I
see him as a moderate with some conservative areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But another delegate from Maine, Elaine Bridge, who described
herself as conservative, challenged the description almost as soon
as it left Buxton's mouth. ``I think he's a conservative,'' she
said. ``More so than his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, people who attend political conventions tend to be
more informed and more partisan, and past polls have noted similar
differences in views between the delegates and the public. Still,
this year's poll suggested a wide disparity between voters and
delegates at a time when Bush has been trying to pull the party to
the center as Republicans seek to win the White House for the
Republican Party, which has lost the last two presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a conservative party,'' Mike Davis, an alternate
delegate from South Carolina, said Sunday afternoon as he sat on a
bench outside Independence Hall. ``We want lower taxes. Less
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the prevailing national sentiment found in other
polls, the delegates said they believed that the nation's budget
surplus should go to cutting taxes, rather than assuring the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   They overwhelmingly opposed a ban on the kind of largely
unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money. They also
opposed a proposed plan to help make prescription drugs more
affordable to the elderly by having the federal government pay
subsidies to insurance companies, allowing insurers to pass the
cost savings along to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 delegates said they believed the federal
government was doing too much when it came to regulating the
environmental and safety practices of business.
</P>
<P>
   And the delegates were also more likely to support the death
penalty, and oppose life in prison without parole, as an
appropriate punishment for convicted murderers. Nearly 80 percent
of the delegates said their views on the death penalty had not been
changed by reports of people on death row who later were found to
be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delegates were overwhelmingly opposed to abortion
rights, only two in 10 said that Bush would consider the issue when
nominating judges to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Howard, 48, a California delegate, said that Bush's views of
government closely hewed to her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes in less government and more individual
responsibility,'' Howard said. ``He probably leans toward the
conservative side, but he's accepting of people and he doesn't
focus on areas where we disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush sees a lot of potential and wants to keep government out
of the way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reflecting the spirit of the occasion, the delegates
viewed Bush's candidacy with enthusiasm _ indeed, with more
enthusiasm than had been voiced by registered Republicans.
Forty-two percent of Bush's supporters across the nation said they
supported him with reservations. Only 4 percent of the delegates
said they felt the same way.

   In a lead-lined room down the hall, technicians prepped the

<P>
   Chang later said even he was a little surprised by the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, in public I'm pretty good,'' Chang said. ``I can't
remember getting that emotional in public since 1989 when I won the
French Open. Usually I'm pretty tough. But right before I started
crying I could actually kind of feel it coming up. I started
thinking about other things so I wouldn't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they showed up: Considering all the star power the
tournament lost - the biggest blows were top-seeded Andre Agassi's
injury-related withdrawal and third-seeded Marcelo Rios' default in
his first match because of profanity - attendance wasn't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament drew 76,987 over the seven days, 7,027 on Sunday.
Last year Agassi and Pete Sampras played in the final, and the
tournament drew 81,433 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the crowds were pretty good actually, considering all
the players we lost for injuries and other reasons,'' spokesman
Toby Zwikel said. ``The people who did attend saw some really good
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Striking the iron: Chang, who grew up in Orange County, won't
have much time to whoop it up with old friends. He's scheduled to
compete in the Tennis Masters Series in Toronto this week. He'll
probably start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting the fire: Gambill became very angry at the officials in
the first-set tiebreaker over a disputed call.
</P>
<P>
   The point gave Chang a 3-2 lead in the tiebreaker, but Gambill
was inspired. He won the next five to take the set, including four
aces.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket power: In the first set Gambill's serve was a monster. He
registered 12 aces - the most Chang has given up in recent memory -
compared to Chang's two.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill finished with 16 aces in two sets. He said he purposely
gave his serves everything he had because his sore knee hampered
his mobility.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone was wondering: Considering Gambill wasn't able to
finish the Chang match because of a sprained ankle, there was no
way he was going to compete in the evening doubles championship
with partner Scott Humphries against Paul Kilderry and Sandon
Stolle. The match was forfeited.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Chang, who entered the tournament ranked No. 34
in the ATP, probably will move up to 22 today, according to
officials. Gambill, who entered at 32, figures to be ranked 25th
today.
