IMF chief calls for forgiveness of Honduran debt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The director of the International
Monetary Fund said he will recommend that member nations forgive
the full dlrs 110 million IMF debt of hurricane-stricken Honduras.
	   ``That is my pledge and it is to build a new Honduras,'' Michel
Camdessus said in an interview Thursday evening on Honduran
television station Canal 5. ``The foreign debt will not be an
obstacle for the reconstruction of this country.''
	   Honduras was the country worst-hit by Hurricane Mitch, which
Central American officials say killed about 10,000 people in the
region. It has a total international debt of about 4.3 billion and
faces enormous costs as it tries to rebuild schools, bridges, and
roads and provide food, water and health care to its citizens.
	   The Paris Club of creditor nations holds about dlrs 1.2 billion
of Honduras' debt and is prepared to forgive 80 percent of that
amount, Camdessus said.
	   He said the IMF is evaluating reconstruction costs and will
develop a financial program to rebuild the country.
	   In visits to Nicaragua and Panama this week, Camdessus has
spoken of the need to provide debt relief to Honduras and
Nicaragua, which was also badly damaged by the hurricane.
	   Nicaragua has a foreign debt of more than dlrs 6 billion.
	   On Thursday, Nicaraguan president Arnoldo Aleman announced that
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardosos has agreed to
forgive Nicaragua's dlrs 179 million debt, subject to approval by
the Brazilian congress. There was no immediate confirmation from
the Brazilian government.
	   The United States, Cuba and France are among other countries
that have agreed to forgive part or all of the debt of countries
affected by the hurricane.

 &UR; Indonesian opposition figure meets East Timorese rebel leader

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent opposition figure on
Friday met the jailed rebel chief of East Timor and said he favored
a vote on independence in the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   Amien Rais, who is considered a key contender for the presidency
in elections next year, visited Xanana Gusmao at Jakarta's Cipinang
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting the
Indonesian military.
	   Rais, one of the most vocal critics of the government, offered
to mediate in U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the former Portuguese
colony between Portugal and Indonesia.
	   Under former President Suharto, Indonesia invaded East Timor in
1975 and annexed it a year later. The United Nations does not
recognize Indonesian rule in the half-island territory.
	   Rais said East Timor had a right to choose whether to part ways
with Indonesia, but stressed the importance of laying the
groundwork for a fair vote.
	   ``The referendum should be set up gradually. It should be held
when the East Timorese people are mentally ready,'' said Rais, who
has founded a political party, the National Mandate Party, to run
in parliamentary elections next year.
	   ``If the majority of East Timorese people are willing to
integrate with Indonesia, Xanana will be respected,'' he said after
meeting Xanana. ``But if most of the East Timorese people want to
be independent or separate, then we have to respect that as well.''
	   Rais quoted Xanana as saying he hoped military operations in
East Timor would not jeopardize the peace talks. There have been
scattered incidents of fighting between soldiers and rebels in
recent weeks.
	   Xanana also said political turmoil in Jakarta, including riots
and clashes between students and the military last week, would not
benefit his struggle for independence in East Timor.

New Jersey Devils win 3-2 over Carolina Hurricanes.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Jay Pandolfo scored on a
backhander in close with 1:23 left in overtime to give the New
Jersey Devils a 3-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.
	   The game winner came just 10 seconds after the Hurricanes killed
off the Devils' eighth power play of the game and gave New Jersey
its fifth straight victory at home Thursday night and seventh in
the last nine overall.
	   Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer had forced the overtime when
he put his own rebound past Arturs Irbe with 4:03 to play in
regulation.
	   Jason Arnott also scored for New Jersey while Ray Sheppard and
Jeff O'Neill scored power-play goals for Carolina.
	   Irbe made 38 saves, but was defenseless on the final two goals.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Panthers 5
	   In Boston, Scott Mellanby, Mark Parrish and Robert Svehla scored
third-period goals as the Florida Panthers rallied from a
three-goal deficit to tie the Boston Bruins.
	   It was the Bruins' third overtime game in their last five
outings. The Bruins are 0-1-4 in overtime games this season.
Florida is 0-0-3 in overtime contests.
	   Boston goaltender Byron Dafoe turned away 40 shots, including
two in overtime. Carolina's Sean Burke made 24 saves.
	   Dmitri Khristich and Anson Carter both scored two goals for the
Bruins.
 &UR; Canadiens 4, Flames 3
	   In Montreal, Eric Houde and Jonas Hoglund each scored his first
goal of the season in the third period to lift the Montreal
Canadiens over the Calgary Flames.
	   The goals erased a 3-2 Calgary lead and gave goaltender Jeff
Hackett the win in his first start with Montreal, which had lost
four in a row.
	   Vladimir Malakhov and Benoit Brunet also scored for the
Canadiens, who have not lost at home to the Flames in four games
since Nov. 6, 1993.
	   Clarke Wilm, Andrew Cassels and Jason Wiemer scored for Calgary,
which began a four-game road trip.
 &UR; Penguins 5, Lightning 1
	   In Tampa, Florida, Stu Barnes scored twice during a five-goal
second period and Martin Straka added a goal and two assists as the
Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   The Penguins scored four times, including both Barnes goals,
during the opening 10:51 of the second period. Pittsburgh outshot
the Lightning 11-0 during the goal-scoring spree.
	   It was the eighth time the Lightning have allowed five goals in
a period, matching a team record.

Cabinet minister attacked by students as military announces deaths

inquiry

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto has
ordered an investigation into whether Indonesian soldiers fired
live rounds at student demonstrators last week in street clashes
that left as many as 16 people dead, a report said Friday.
	   Meanwhile angry students punched and kicked a Cabinet minister
after invading a provincial airport where government officials were
holding a meeting, the newspaper Kompas reported.
	   It said bodyguards rescued Agriculture Minister Soleh Salahudin
from a mob of students in Padang, about 1,000 kilometers (600
miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The minister later met with the students, who demanded the
military be removed from government and that Wiranto resign.
	   A military team will determine how shooting deaths in Jakarta
occurred despite live ammunition being banned, said Wayan Karya, a
spokesman for the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
Affairs.
	   ``The investigation aims to find out exactly what went wrong,''
Karya was reported in The Indonesian Observer newspaper as telling
journalists.
	   ``We want to find out why, despite the fact that live ammunition
was expressly prohibited by military commanders,'' he said. ``One
postmortem (examination) did locate a bullet embedded in the body
of a victim.''
	   Human rights groups say as many as 16 people, including eight
students and several soldiers, were killed in confrontations after
demonstrators, seeking faster democratic change, tried to march on
the national Parliament. Police say 13 people died.
	   Hundreds of people were injured.
	   Opposition figures and students claim the military provoked much
of the violence and have demanded that Wiranto resign.
	   The military has insisted that security personnel were issued
only plastic bullets and blank ammunition. But Cabinet Minister Adi
Sasono said this week that autopsies on the bodies of some of the
eight students who died showed some had been killed by live
ammunition.
	   President B.J. Habibie has accused some opposition groups of
orchestrating the protests as part of a plot to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   Police have charged 10 activists with sedition. More charges are
expected to be filed soon.
	   Despite the crackdown, big student protests have continued this
week.
	   Habibie has warned that further civil unrest could threaten
national unity.
	   Jakarta police spokesman Edward Aritonang said Friday 70 people
would be tried on charges related to looting which was triggered by
last week's student clashes.
	   On Thursday, about 3,000 students demanded that autocratic
ex-President Suharto be hanged and his wealth seized after soldiers
stopped them from marching on his house.
	   Troops forced the students to a halt outside the home of the
U.S. ambassador, a few blocks from Suharto's house in an exclusive
Jakarta suburb.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark the bloody May riots
which helped forced Suharto out and in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   Kompas reported Friday that offices and cars were burned in two
separate two riots in South Sumatra province, northwest of Jakarta.
	   The PT Central Pertiwi Bahari shrimp hatchery near Bandar
Lampung was ransacked by about 1,000 people, while 2,500 more
rampaged through the PT Wachyuni Mandira hatchery in nearby Mesuji,
Kompas quoted local police and company officials as saying.

Daly crashes at World Cup

 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ John Daly had a quadruple bogey
eight Friday during a horror run which sent the United States team
plunging from the lead at the World Cup of Golf.
	   Daly and teammate Scott Verplank were in front at 10-under after
10 holes of the second round after starting the day 4-under and six
behind overnight leader Japan. They dropped 11 shots in eight holes
and finished 1-over, six behind leaders Nick Faldo and David Carter
of England.
	   The U.S. players were not the only ones to struggle, as the
winds gusted in from Hauraki Gulf, but their crash was the most
spectacular.
	   None of the 32-nation teams were able to dominate Friday and New
Zealand Presidents Cup player Greg Turner was livid about the
course design after he and partner Frank Nobilo shot 5-over Friday
to be 4-over for the tournament.
	   ``Frank got screwed on a number of occasions, I got screwed on a
couple and people are going to get screwed all week,'' Turner said.
``It's annoying and frustrating.''
	   Faldo had a serene round, almost unaffected by the problems. He
had a 2-under 70 with two birdies and no bogeys, in contrast to
Carter whose 71 included 4 birdies and three bogeys.
	   ``It's very difficult out there but we both played solid,
smart,'' Faldo said. ``I missed only two greens.''
	   He went to the top of the individual leaderboard at 6-under
after Japanese pacesetter Yasuharu Imano fell from 9-under after 15
to 5-under with consecutive double bogeys. Imano followed his
8-under 64 from round one with a 75 while partner Mitsutaka
Kusakabe also had a torrid day with 80.
	   Daly started well enough, picking up two shots on the opening
nine to move his own score to 2-under, while Verplank had an eagle
at the easy par-5 second and a birdie at six.
	   Verplank started the slide when he was forced to drop on the
straightforward 11th and had a bogey. At the next, a 309-meter
(340-yard) par-4, Daly got a gust behind him and his tee shot
cleared the green, running into thick grass under a tree. Daly's
drop meant a bogey at the same hole where he lost a ball Thursday.
	   Verplank added another bogey with a poor chip after missing the
green of the par-3 13th, but worse was to come.
	   Daly's tee shot at the 14th speared off to the left and was
stuck deep in tough, wiry grass. Daly's first hack failed to budge
the ball and although his second spooned it just 10-meters
(30-feet) it took eight people scouring the general area to find
it. Daly just cleared the grass with his next then found a bunker
and failed to keep his wedge on the green. Daly had two more bogeys
before pars at 17 and 18.
	   Daly refused to comment after his 77 but Verplank (72) said the
course was not unfair.
	   ``The course if fine, if it stays like this it will just play
more difficult and that's good for us,'' Verplank said. The strong
winds made the last six holes ``just brutal,'' but Verplank said
the team still had a winning chance.
	   Australia and South Africa were equal second at 4-under after
ending with a flurry of bogeys, while Scotland's Colin Montgomerie
had a 3-under 69 to put his team in fourth at 3-under.
	   Canada's Ian Leggatt followed his 69 with a 70 to share second
place on the individual standings with Italy's Costantino Rocca
(65-74) and Imano.

New Zealand prime minister optimistic about APEC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite limited progress in trade
liberalization at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
earlier this week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said
Friday she remains confident APEC will eventually succeed in
creating more open markets.
	   ``In seeing the pressure mounted over recent weeks for a good
trade outcome, some commentators have questioned whether APEC has
lost its way,'' Shipley told a gathering of businessmen in
Singapore.
	   But the Pacific Rim grouping should be able to achieve its goals
within about five years, said Shipley, who will chair next year's
APEC summit in Auckland, New Zealand.
	   Meeting in Malaysia earlier this week, leaders from the 21
countries delayed action on what was to have been its centerpiece
to boost trade _ slashing tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion of goods
under the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization package.
	   Instead, APEC has sent the contentious plan to the 124-nation
World Trade Organization for resolution following Japan's
opposition to two key sectors of the pact.
	   Shipley played down the disappointing development on Friday,
arguing that taking the package to the WTO may broaden the number
of countries acceding to the trade plan.
	   She also stressed that APEC's most pressing concern this year
was the regional economic downturn and how to rebuild sustainable
growth. She said the conclusions reached at the Malaysian meetings
strengthened APEC's worth.
	   At next year's gathering in Auckland, Shipley said her country
wants greater attention placed on APEC activities relating to
competition and regulatory policies, and hopes to ``carry forward
APEC work aimed at developing shared policy principles for
strengthening markets.''
	   The Asia-Pacific grouping ``faces some challenging issues in the
coming years, the more so as we seek to reassure and explain to our
populations that the benefits of global markets outweigh the
risks,'' she added.
	   New Zealand will focus on four key objectives at the Auckland
meetings, said Shipley: substantive progress in trade and
investment liberalization; a more useful response to the regional
downturn; stronger economic institutions in the Pacific Rim; and a
broader base of support for APEC.
	   She said APEC activities next year will also include more
hard-core business meetings, including the ministerial meeting on
small and medium enterprises in April, a businesswomen's symposium
in June, and a private sector gathering of chief executive officers
in September.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States has declared
its greatest enemy is ``a man without sin,'' Afghanistan's hard
line Islamic Taliban militia declared on Friday, saying the case
against Osama bin Laden was closed.
	   A three-week inquiry headed by Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor
Mohammed Saqib into allegations that bin Laden is waging a war of
terror against the United States ended Friday.
	   ``It's over and America has not presented any evidence,'' Saqib
told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court
building in the Afghan capital.
	   ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is
a free man,'' he said. Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for
years with the permission of the Taliban, who control most of the
country.
	   A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden in connection with the Aug.
7 bombings of the two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed 224
people. Two weeks ago Washington offered a dlrs 5 million reward
for the capture of bin Laden, something the Taliban said was
tantamount to encouraging terrorist activity inside their
war-shattered country.
	   Saqib said he waited in vain in his cavernous office, stark but
for a large ornately carved wooden desk and a bouquet of brightly
colored plastic flowers, for American officials to provide evidence
of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity.
	   ``It is their shame that they have been silent,'' said Saqib.
``America is wrong about bin Laden. . . Anything that happens now
anywhere in the world they blame Osama, but the reality is in the
proof and they have not given us any.''
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian who was thrown out of his homeland
for advocating the ouster of the Saudi royal family, is believed by
the United states to be using bases in Afghanistan to train and
finance Islamic terrorist groups worldwide who target U.S.
interests and U.S. citizens.
	   In August the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan against suspected terrorist training camps.
Twenty six people were killed, but bin Laden was unhurt.
	   The Taliban have refused to hand over bin Laden to the United
States saying they will withstand anything the U.S. directs at
them, including more Tomahawk cruise missiles.
	   Bin Laden first came to Afghanistan in the 1980s, enraged by the
Soviet invasion of the Islamic country. He fought alongside
anti-communist Afghan guerrillas that the United States also
supported.
	   After the war, he returned home and then moved to Sudan. The
Saudi government, fearing his brand of militant Islam, stripped him
of his citizenship in April 1994. With Western pressure mounting on
Sudan, he was forced to leave in 1995, returning to Afghanistan,
reportedly with more than 100 followers.
	   Bin Laden's self-declared war against the United States was
launched following the 1990 Gulf war to protest the presence of U.S
troops in Saudi Arabia, where two of Islam's holiest sites _ Mecca
and Medina _ are located.
	   Taliban commanders who know bin Laden say he is living in
mountain camps outside the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar along
with his three wives, children and a handful of bodyguards.
	   The Taliban religious army espouse a strict brand of Islamic law
that has barred women from working, girls from school and outlaws
most forms of light entertainment. Their harsh brand of Islam has
generated an international outcry.
	   Since taking control of the capital of Kabul in 1996, the
Taliban have gradually consolidated their hold over much of the
country.
	   The remaining 10 percent, mostly north of the capital, is ruled
by forces loyal to ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his
once powerful military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.

Dutchman struggles with clubs, greens and credit card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ His golf game fell apart, but
Dutch pro Ruben Wechgelaer proved a master of understatement Friday
when he declared ``I've had a rough two days.''
	   As he walked from the 18th, 34 shots adrift of Nick Faldo after
two rounds at the World Cup of Golf, the doughty player refused to
blame his borrowed clubs.
	   His Ping set went missing from his luggage at London's Heathrow
Airport as he flew out to New Zealand.
	   ``I don't blame (my poor performance) on my clubs. That would be
the easy way,'' Wechgelaer said.
	   While the borrowed clubs had been good enough in the practice
rounds, under the pressure of tournament play they ``had a very
different feel.''
	   Wechgelaer's luck didn't improve with the swirling and
persistent winds at this seaside peninsula course in the Hauraki
Gulf, where the America's Cup sailing regatta will be staged in a
year's time.
	   He admitted that winds, around the greens in particular,
resigned him to rounds of 90 and 81, pushing him to 28 over par.
	   The greens, Wechgelaer said, ``are difficult to read because the
wind does a lot. The lines are different.''
	   With partner Hayo Bensdorp recording an eight-over 80 Friday,
the Netherlands team slumped to a total 37 over par after two of
the four rounds.
	   ``Today was probably one of the worst rounds'' he had played as
a professional with a mediocre record _ even though it was better
than his first-round 90.
	   ``I also lost my credit card and Bensdorp almost lost his
caddie,'' said Wechgelaer, whose card was chewed up by a cash
machine. ``But worse things can happen.''

Puerto Rican singer cancels Indonesian show because of civil unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Puerto Rican pop singer Ricky Martin
has canceled a charity concert because of protests and riots in the
Indonesian capital, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
	   Promotor Adrie Subono said it would be insensitive for Martin to
go ahead with next Tuesday's show at a time of tense social and
political conditions.
	   ``We realize that Indonesians are now going through a very
difficult and vulnerable situation. So we canceled the concert
because we felt it would be inappropriate to stage the show,''
Adrie was quoted as saying.
	   Martin, 26, is best known for his France '98 World Cup theme
song, ``The Cup of Life,'' which became an international hit in
Spanish, English and French.
	   He is the second international singer to cancel plans perform in
Jakarta since deadly clashes between student protesters and
soldiers erupted last week, killing as many as 16 people.
	   Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias called off the Jakarta leg of a
promotional tour last week.

Stability crucial to foreign investment: Japanese official tells
</HEADLINE>
Habibie

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Maintaining political stability in
Indonesia is crucial to attracting foreign investment, a Japanese
legislator told President B.J. Habibie Friday.
	   Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the Indonesia-Japan Parliamentarians
League, met with Habibie as part of a two-day business conference
which opened less than one week after violent clashes in Jakarta's
streets between student demonstrators and police.
	   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yamasaki said Habibie
told him the Indonesian cabinet has been working to improve the
stability in the country and to improve democracy.
	   Habibie said he hoped the government's reform plans would
attract investors to Indonesia, said Yamasaki, who is a member of
Japan's lower house of Parliament.
	   Japan is the largest single foreign lender and investor in
Indonesia, and a significant contributor to the International
Monetary Fund's multi-billion-dollar bailout package for its ailing
economy.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. It has
been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Discontent over inflation and joblessness helped spark bloody
riots in May which helped force Habibie's predecessor and mentor
Suharto out and in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Another round of violence erupted last week. Up to 16 people
were killed after student demonstrators, seeking faster democratic
change, tried to march on the national Parliament. Police say 13
people died.
	   The IMF's top official in Asia Hubert Neiss said this week that
continued civil unrest could threaten Indonesia's chances of
recovery.
	   The exchange rate would be affected and capital would flow out
of Indonesia if there was ``a prolonged period of instability,''
Neiss told Dow Jones Newswires.

Daly crashes at World Cup

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end of play. ADDS quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ John Daly had a quadruple bogey
eight Friday during a horror run which sent the United States team
plunging from the lead at the World Cup of Golf.
	   Daly and teammate Scott Verplank were in front at 10-under after
10 holes of the second round after starting the day 4-under and six
behind overnight leader Japan. They dropped 11 shots in eight holes
and finished 1-over, six behind leaders Nick Faldo and David Carter
of England.
	   The U.S. players were not the only ones to struggle, as the
winds gusted in from Hauraki Gulf, but their crash was the most
spectacular.
	   None of the 32 national teams were able to dominate Friday and
New Zealand Presidents Cup player Greg Turner was livid about the
course design after he and partner Frank Nobilo shot 5-over Friday
to be 4-over for the tournament.
	   ``Frank got screwed on a number of occasions, I got screwed on a
couple and people are going to get screwed all week,'' Turner said.
``It's annoying and frustrating.''
	   Faldo had a serene round, almost unaffected by the problems. His
2-under 70 was built on two birdies and no bogeys, in contrast to
Carter whose 71 included four birdies and three bogeys.
	   ``It's very difficult out there but we both played solid,
smart,'' Faldo said. ``I missed only two greens.''
	   He went to the top of the individual leaderboard at 6-under
after Japanese pacesetter Yasuharu Imano fell from 9-under after 15
to 5-under with consecutive double bogeys. Imano followed his
8-under 64 from round one with a 75 while partner Mitsutaka
Kusakabe also had a torrid day with 80.
	   Daly started well enough, picking up two shots on the opening
nine to move his own score to 2-under, while Verplank had an eagle
at the easy par-5 second and a birdie at six.
	   Verplank began the Americans' slide when he was forced to drop
on the straightforward 11th and had a bogey. At the next, a
309-meter (340-yard) par-4, Daly got a gust behind him and his tee
shot cleared the green, running into thick grass under a tree.
Daly's drop meant a bogey at the same hole where he lost a ball
Thursday.
	   Verplank added another bogey with a poor chip after missing the
green of the par-3 13th, but worse was to come.
	   Daly's tee shot at the 14th speared off to the left and was
stuck deep in tough, wiry grass. Daly's first hack failed to budge
the ball and although his second spooned it just 10-meters
(30-feet) it took eight people scouring the area to find it. Daly
just cleared the grass with his next then found a bunker and failed
to keep his wedge on the green. He had two more bogeys before pars
at 17 and 18.
	   Daly refused to comment after his 77 but Verplank (72) said the
course was not unfair.
	   ``The course if fine, if it stays like this it will just play
more difficult and that's good for us,'' Verplank said. The strong
winds made the last six holes ``just brutal,'' but Verplank said
the team still had a winning chance.
	   Australia and South Africa were equal second at 4-under after
ending with a flurry of bogeys, while Scotland's Colin Montgomerie
had a 3-under 69 to put his team in fourth at 3-under.
	   Canada's Ian Leggatt followed his 69 with a 70 to share second
place on the individual standings with Italy's Costantino Rocca
(65-74) and Imano.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States has declared
its greatest enemy is ``a man without sin,'' Afghanistan's hard
line Islamic Taliban militia declared on Friday, saying its case
against Osama bin Laden is closed.
	   A three-week inquiry headed by Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor
Mohammed Saqib into allegations that bin Laden is waging a war of
terror against the United States ended Friday.
	   ``It's over and America has not presented any evidence,'' Saqib
told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court
building in the Afghan capital.
	   ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is
a free man,'' he said. Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for
years with the permission of the Taliban, who control most of the
country.
	   A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden in connection with the Aug.
7 bombings of the two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed 224
people. Two weeks ago Washington offered a dlrs 5 million reward
for the capture of bin Laden, something the Taliban said was
tantamount to encouraging terrorist activity inside their
war-shattered country.
	   Saqib said he waited in vain in his cavernous office, stark but
for a large ornately carved wooden desk and a bouquet of brightly
colored plastic flowers, for American officials to provide evidence
of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity.
	   ``It is their shame that they have been silent,'' said Saqib.
``America is wrong about bin Laden. . . Anything that happens now
anywhere in the world they blame Osama, but the reality is in the
proof and they have not given us any.''
	   The United States does not recognize the Taliban government and
has no diplomatic representative in Afghanistan.
	   Speaking in Tokyo, White House National Security Council
spokesman David Leavy said, ``Without commenting on the rigor of
the Taliban judicial system, it is clear that Mr. bin Laden is a
proven threat to U.S. national interests and will remain a focus of
our diplomatic and legal efforts to take down his terrorist network
and bring him and his associates to justice.''
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian who was thrown out of his homeland
for advocating the ouster of the Saudi royal family, is believed by
the United states to be using bases in Afghanistan to train and
finance Islamic terrorist groups worldwide who target U.S.
interests and U.S. citizens.
	   In August the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan against suspected terrorist training camps.
Twenty six people were killed, but bin Laden was unhurt.
	   The Taliban have refused to hand over bin Laden to the United
States saying they will withstand anything the U.S. directs at
them, including more Tomahawk cruise missiles.
	   Bin Laden first came to Afghanistan in the 1980s, enraged by the
Soviet invasion of the Islamic country. He fought alongside
anti-communist Afghan guerrillas that the United States also
supported.
	   After the war, he returned home and then moved to Sudan. The
Saudi government, fearing his brand of militant Islam, stripped him
of his citizenship in April 1994. With Western pressure mounting on
Sudan, he was forced to leave in 1995, returning to Afghanistan,
reportedly with more than 100 followers.
	   Bin Laden's self-declared war against the United States was
launched following the 1991 Gulf war to protest the presence of U.S
troops in Saudi Arabia, where two of Islam's holiest sites _ Mecca
and Medina _ are located.
	   Taliban commanders say he lives in mountain camps outside the
Taliban stronghold of Kandahar with his three wives, children and a
handful of bodyguards.
	   Bin Laden settled in Afghanistan when the Taliban's opponents,
led by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, ruled the capital of
Kabul.
	   The Taliban religious army espouse a strict brand of Islamic law
that has barred women from working, girls from school and outlaws
most forms of light entertainment. Their harsh brand of Islam has
been criticized by many countries.
	   Since taking Kabul in 1996, the Taliban have consolidated their
hold over much of the country.
	   The remaining 10 percent, mostly north of the capital, is ruled
by forces loyal to Rabbani and his once powerful military chief
Ahmed Shah Massood.

	   The pullback, which will give the Palestinians full or partial

	   In Inglewood, California, Alexei Kovalev scored his first two
goals of the season, the last one set up by Wayne Gretzky in his
Forum farewell, as the New York Rangers beat Los Angeles and handed
the Kings their sixth consecutive loss.
	   The Kings' second sellout crowd of the season turned out to
watch Gretzky make his final appearance in the same building where
he broke Gordie Howe's career goal-scoring record with his 802nd
goal on March 23, 1994 as a member of the Kings.
	   The NHL's all-time leading scorer and nine-time MVP played
almost eight seasons with Los Angeles, leading the franchise to its
only trip to the Stanley Cup finals in 1993. The Kings will move
next season to the Staples Center, which is under construction
about 12 miles away in downtown Los Angeles.

JENIN: border markers.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Two percent of the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44
square miles), were being transferred from sole Israeli control to
joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400
square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint jurisdiction
to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. At that time,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will have full or partial control
of 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   In anticipation of the pullback, the Palestinian Authority on
Thursday staged a jubilant parade in the northern West Bank town of
Jenin, which has been under full Palestinian control since 1995.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were more concerned about whether jailed relatives
would be among some 250 prisoners to be released by Israel on
Friday as part of the Wye River peace accord.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``What is the meaning of peace? It is
the release of prisoners,'' he said. It was not clear whether his
son would be among those freed Friday.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two. If Netanyahu's coalition
unravels, he could be forced to new elections.
	   In an attempt to reassure Jewish settlers, Netanyahu on Thursday
visited the Yafit settlement in the West Bank's Jordan Valley.
Netanyahu declared that Israel would never relinquish the valley.
``It will always be part of the state of Israel,'' he said. ``There
is no uncertainty.''
	   However, according to Israeli media reports, parts of the valley
will be handed to partial Palestinian control in one of the next
pullbacks.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying 18 settlements that will
become increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.

that is to be completed by the end of January. At that time,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will have full or partial control
of 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   In anticipation of the pullback, the Palestinian Authority on
Thursday staged a jubilant parade in the northern West Bank town of
Jenin, which has been under full Palestinian control since 1995.
	   Hundreds of Palestinian police officers in camouflage uniforms,
their AK-47 assault rifles hoisted, marched in formation through
the town's soccer stadium to the cheers of the crowd. Tractors
draped with Palestinian flags circled the arena.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin,
most residents were more concerned about whether jailed relatives
would be among some 250 prisoners to be released by Israel on
Friday as part of the Wye River peace accord.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``What is the meaning of peace? It is
the release of prisoners,'' he said. It was not clear whether his
son would be among those freed Friday.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a woman in the
Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will be
surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two. If Netanyahu's coalition
unravels, he could be forced to new elections.
	   In an attempt to reassure Jewish settlers, Netanyahu on Thursday
visited the Yafit settlement in the West Bank's Jordan Valley.
Netanyahu declared that Israel would never relinquish the valley.
``It will always be part of the state of Israel,'' he said. ``There
is no uncertainty.''
	   However, according to Israeli media reports, parts of the valley
will be handed to partial Palestinian control in one of the next
pullbacks.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying 18 settlements that will
become increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.

Pakistani batsmen hits record 262

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pakistani batsman Masood Jan scored a
record 262 in the seven-nation tournament of blind cricketers being
held in New Delhi, organizers said.
	   It was the first double century in the history of blind cricket,
and came as Pakistan defeated South Africa by 63 runs in an early
round match Thursday. A double century is also a rare feat in
sighted cricket.
	   Pakistan's Blind Cricket Council announced a cash award of 1,000
rupees (about dlrs 24) for Jan, who has had four centuries in
domestic league play this year, the Time of India reported Friday.
	   In addition to Pakistan and South Africa, Australia, England,
New Zealand, Sri Lanka and host India _ all countries with teams
among the international elite of the sighted cricket world _ were
competing for the Kanishka Trophy. The tournament started Tuesday
and the championship will be played Nov. 28.
	   Players who range from the partially sighted to the totally
blind use special balls that emit a rattle to help batsmen direct
their bats and fielders determine where the catch can be made.
Bowlers shout ``ready?'' and wait for a ``yes'' from batsmen before
responding with a shouted ``play'' and flinging the ball.
	   Blind cricket tournaments were being played in Sri Lanka as
early as the 1940s.

Taliban clear bin Laden of terrorist charges

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States has declared
its greatest enemy is ``a man without sin,'' Afghanistan's hard
line Islamic Taliban militia declared on Friday, saying its case
against Osama bin Laden is closed.
	   A three-week inquiry headed by Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor
Mohammed Saqib into allegations that bin Laden is waging a war of
terror against the United States ended Friday.
	   ``It's over and America has not presented any evidence,'' Saqib
told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court
building in the Afghan capital.
	   ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is
a free man,'' he said. Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for
years with the permission of the Taliban, who control most of the
country.
	   Speaking in Japan, where he was traveling U.S. President Bill
Clinton, White House National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy said the U.S. will continue its efforts to dismantle bin
Laden's ``terrorist network and bring him and his associates to
justice.''
	   ``Without commenting on the rigor of the Taliban judicial
system, it is clear that Mr. bin Laden is a proven threat to U.S.
national interests,'' he said.
	   A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden in connection with the Aug.
7 bombings of the two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed 224
people. Two weeks ago Washington offered a dlrs 5 million reward
for the capture of bin Laden, something the Taliban said was
tantamount to encouraging terrorist activity inside their
war-shattered country.
	   Saqib said he waited in vain in his cavernous office, stark but
for a large ornately carved wooden desk and a bouquet of brightly
colored plastic flowers, for American officials to provide evidence
of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity.
	   ``It is their shame that they have been silent,'' said Saqib.
``America is wrong about bin Laden. . . Anything that happens now
anywhere in the world they blame Osama, but the reality is in the
proof and they have not given us any.''
	   The United States does not recognize the Taliban government and
has no diplomatic representative in Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian thrown out of his homeland for
advocating the ouster of the Saudi royal family, is believed by
Washington to be using bases in Afghanistan to train and finance
Islamic terrorist groups worldwide who target U.S. interests and
citizens.
	   In August the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan against suspected terrorist training camps.
Twenty six people were killed, but bin Laden was unhurt.
	   Bin Laden first came to Afghanistan in the 1980s, enraged by the
Soviet invasion of the Islamic country. He fought with
anti-communist Afghan guerrillas that the United States also
supported.
	   After the war, he returned home and then moved to Sudan. The
Saudi government, fearing his brand of militant Islam, stripped him
of his citizenship in April 1994. With Western pressure mounting on
Sudan, he was forced to leave in 1995, returning to Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden's self-declared war against the United States was
launched following the 1991 Gulf war to protest the presence of U.S
troops in Saudi Arabia, where two of Islam's holiest sites _ Mecca
and Medina _ are located.
	   Taliban commanders say he is living in mountain camps outside
the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.
	   Bin Laden settled in Afghanistan when the Taliban's opponents,
led by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, ruled the capital of
Kabul. Taliban officials now ask why the United States didn't
demand the extradition of bin Laden when Rabbani ruled.
	   ``Why not say then that he was a terrorist and ask for him then?
Why now when the Taliban are successful?'' said Mullah Mohammed
Haqzar, deputy interior minister.
	   The Taliban religious army espouse a strict brand of Islamic law
that has barred women from working, girls from school and outlaws
most forms of light entertainment.

	   The launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed

	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya was launched by a three-stage
Proton booster rocket to put the module into orbit less than 10
minutes after blastoff. Zarya is designed to serve as a space

Graf winning as easy as 1-2-3
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Since recovering from her latest surgery, Steffi
Graf has been winning matches as easy as 1-2-3.
	   On Thursday night, it was No. 6.
	   She beat No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport on Sunday to win the
Philadelphia tournament. That was two days after Graf beat No. 2
Martina Hingis and a week after she won the title at Leipzig,
Germany.
	   In her first two matches at this week's Chase Championships,
Graf has defeated No. 3 Jana Novotna and No. 6 Monica Seles.
	   ``The past 2{ weeks have been amazing,'' said Graf, whose world
ranking has skyrocketed from No. 91 on June 15 to No. 12 this week.
``It has been amazing, really.
	   ``I am just sitting there and I can't believe it. It has just
been amazing. That is all I can say.''
	   Graf reached the semifinals of this season-ending tournament by
outlasting Seles 1-6, 6-4, 6-4. It was one for the record book.
	   It was her 12th consecutive singles victory since undergoing
wrist surgery in September. She is 19-1 since winning a tournament
in New Haven, Conn., in August. And in her last five matches, Graf
has defeated four of the top six players in the world.
	   ``I don't like to compare victories,'' Graf said. ``Leipzig was
great. Philadelphia was great. It's just been great to be able to
keep on playing well after my injury.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Graf will play the winner of tonight's
quarterfinal match between Davenport and No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat of
France.
	   ``Right now I am in the semis and I have a pretty tough opponent
next up,'' Graf said. ``So that is all I am worried about right
now. I mean, I have survived this far, so we will see what comes up
next.''
	   Tonight's other quarterfinal will pair Hingis against No. 6 Mary
Pierce of France, with that winner meeting Romania's Irina Spirlea
on Saturday. Spirlea advanced Thursday by beating Dominique Van
Roost of Belgium 6-2, 6-3.
	   Graf's trip to the semis wasn't an easy one. She had to survive
a nearly perfect start by Seles.
	   ``In the first set, she just overwhelmed me,'' Graf said. ``She
overpowered me. I couldn't get a return in. My serve wasn't really
effective at all.
	   ``That is what I was trying to focus on in the beginning of the
second set, just let her play a little more and try to find a
little length in my shots. And finally the return started to come
in.''
	   The first set took just 24 minutes, and as she walked to her
chair, she muttered aloud to herself in German.
	   ``I really wanted to come out strong. I obviously played some
clean tennis, wasn't making many mistakes and everything. It
definitely was one of the better ones I have played this year,''
Seles said.
	   Graf solved Seles' serve for the first time in the third game of
the second set, breaking her with a patented Graf forehand that
landed deep in the corner.
	   Seles broke right back, and the two traded service breaks again
in the seventh and eight games.
	   But Seles made a few errors in the ninth game, and that was all
Graf needed. Soon, the two were even at one set apiece.
	   Graf fought through four deuces to hold serve in the fourth game
of the third set. Seles held from deuce in the next game.
	   On the changeover following the fifth game of the final set,
Graf called for a trainer and had a blister on her right foot
treated.
	   But in the ninth game, Graf finally got the crucial break.
	   It started when Seles buried a forehand in the net. Then Graf
hit a forehand that Seles thought was long. Seles returned it into
the net and looked at umpire Leanne White, seeking an over-rule.
There wasn't one, and Graf had a love-30 lead.
	   Two more errors by Seles gave Graf the break, and the German
served for the match.
	   Seles refused to surrender, fighting off four match points
before Graf finally hit a forehand winner for the spot in the
semifinals.
	   ``Steffi was more consistent and she was willing to stay in some
points longer, while I just went for too many shots,'' Seles said.
``I missed them because I was trying not to get into a long rally,
and that I felt turned it around.''
	   Although Novotna won last year's Championships, Graf is
currently riding a 10-game winning streak at Madison Square Garden.
She won the Championships in both 1995 and '96 before missing last
year while recuperating from knee surgery.
	   Spirlea had her entire repertoire of shots working against Van
Roost, who made her Garden debut this year.
	   After Van Roost held to start the match, Spirlea won five
straight games. The second set was more even, but by then it was
too late for Van Roost, who dropped her serve at love in the third
game and at 15 in the eighth game.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.

<TEXT>
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that
will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment, the
cargo and control module Zarya (Sunrise), was repeatedly postponed
mainly because the chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't
afford to complete another part of the station that is to go up
later.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to
blast off next July or August.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for
the new station, said at a news conference earlier this week.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware.''
	   Russian officials were more cautious.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which is
rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a
deputy chief of the Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department, before the launch.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said the new station is the only hope
for the once-mighty Russian space industry, whose funding has
disintegrated since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow
Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
	   Russia is expected to retire the Mir sometime next year,
although some officials have talked about trying to keep it aloft
longer.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

Japanese fair trade watchdog says Microsoft violated law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ordered Microsoft
Corp., the world's largest software maker, to stop engaging in
unfair business practices which violate the country's anti-monopoly
laws, a commission spokesman said Friday.
	   The warning, which came after an investigation began in January
when officials raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices, came as the
Redmond, Wash.-based company faces similar allegations against it
in a high-profile case in the United States.
	   If Microsoft contests the finding announced on Friday, the
government trade commission may take legal action against the
company to enforce the ruling, said FTC spokesman Kanichiro
Nakanishi.
	   The FTC found Microsoft and its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary
had bundled software pre-installed in personal computers in a way
that put competitors at a disadvantage, the spokesman said.
	   Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the basic
functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.

Israel begins troop pullback in West Bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with Israeli and Palestinian
commanders meeting, Palestinian vigilante released by Israel &QL;

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Friday began pulling
out of parts of the northern West Bank, with army trucks deploying
large black-and-yellow cement road markers at intersections to
delineate the new boundaries, the Israeli army spokesman said.
	   The pullback, which will give the Palestinians full or partial
control of an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, came a day
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government
reluctantly approved stage one of the new Mideast peace accord.
	   The withdrawal marks a point of no return for Netanyahu who
since coming to power in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace
process and now faces the loss of support of key allies and
possibly early elections.
	   Unlike previous Israeli pullbacks, this one held little promise
of drama. No Israeli army bases were dismantled, and the thousands
of Palestinians who came under full Palestinian control are already
used to a limited Palestinian police presence in their villages.
	   At 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt), Israeli army trucks loaded with border
markers began pulling out of the Dotan army base near the
Palestinian town of Jenin, said the Israeli army spokesman, Lt.
Col. Sharon Grinker. Soldiers were to deploy the 130 markers at
road junctions throughout the morning.
	   At the same time, the Israeli West Bank commander, Maj. Gen.
Moshe Yaalon, and the commander of the Palestinian forces, Brig.
Gen. Ismail Jaber, reviewed the redeployment plans at an
Israeli-Palestinian liaison office near Jenin.
	   Two percent of the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44
square miles), were being transferred from sole Israeli control to
joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400
square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint jurisdiction
to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will have full or partial control of 40
percent of the West Bank and will have moved a significant step
closer to establishing an independent state.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel also pledged to release 750
Palestinian prisoners, with the first group of 250 to be freed
later Friday.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin
that was coming under full Palestinian control Friday, most
residents were more concerned about jailed relatives than about the
arrival of the Palestinian Authority forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``What is the meaning of peace? It is
the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   One of those freed quietly by Israel was Jamal Abu Rub, 35, a
former leader of the Palestinian vigilante group Black Panthers and
a resident of Qabatieh. Abu Rub was arrested nine months ago for
holding two Israeli soldiers hostage. Abu Rub was released Thursday
evening from Israel's Megiddo prison. It was not immediately clear
whether he was freed as part of the peace agreement.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two. If Netanyahu's coalition
unravels, he could be forced to new elections.
	   In an attempt to reassure Jewish settlers, Netanyahu on Thursday
visited the Yafit settlement in the West Bank's Jordan Valley.
Netanyahu declared that Israel would never relinquish the valley.
``It will always be part of the state of Israel,'' he said. ``There
is no uncertainty.''
	   However, according to Israeli media reports, parts of the valley
will be handed to partial Palestinian control in one of the next
pullbacks.
	   Israeli troops also began fortifying 18 settlements that will
become increasingly isolated. At the Psagot settlement near the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, troops built cement trenches, to be
used as shooting positions.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla hideouts after attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Friday following attacks on
Israeli outposts in the volatile region, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jet fired two air-to-surface missiles on a valley
between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 7 a.m. (5:00
GMT) air raid on the area, which is believed to be used by Lebanese
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen occupying a border enclave in the south.
	   The strike came shortly after guerrillas of the Syrian-backed
Amal group launched attacks on Israeli and allied positions, the
officials said. No casualties were reported.
	   Friday's air raid was the latest in a series of attacks launched
by Israeli warplanes almost daily on suspected bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group in the south since Nov. 8.
None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   The attacks come at a time of heightened tension following a
Hezbollah roadside bombing near the border Monday which killed
three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The
casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two strong earthquakes hit a rural area in
southwestern China and injured 303 people, the Central Seismology
Bureau reported Friday.
	   A quake measuring 5.0 struck the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County
in southwest China's Yunnan province and neighboring Yanyuan County
in Sichuan province at 7:31 p.m. (1131 GMT) Thursday, followed by a
stronger 6.2 quake seven minutes later.
	   Among the injured, 63 suffered serious injuries, said a bureau
spokesman who gave only his surname, Tan. No deaths were reported.
	   The quake destroyed the houses of 230 families and three
schools, and a landslide blocked a river, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Ninglang is a poor area where 80 percent of the people receive
food relief, Xinhua said.
	   Quakes measuring 5.3 and 5.2 hit the same area, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Oct. 2 and 27.

	   The launch went smoothly, with the giant rocket soaring into the
cloudy sky above the central Asian steppes.
	   The mood at the launch pad had been tense before the launch,
with space officials and workers anxiously making last minute
checks to ensure there were no problems.
	   Solar power panels on the module were successfully deployed
shortly after it reached its first orbit and all systems appeared
to be working normally, officials said.
	   The launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed
for more than a year, ushers in a new era of cooperation among
former space race rivals.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya or Sunrise was launched by a
three-stage Proton booster rocket to put the module into orbit less
than 10 minutes after blastoff. Zarya is designed to serve as a
space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing
propulsion, power and communications.
	   Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the
liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under cloudy
skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40
seconds after lift-off.

Pakistani batsmen hits record 262

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pakistani batsman Masood Jan scored a
record 262 in the seven-nation tournament of blind cricketers being
held in New Delhi, organizers said.
	   It was the first double century in the history of blind cricket,
and came as Pakistan defeated South Africa by 63 runs in an early
round match Thursday. A double century is also a rare feat in
sighted cricket.
	   Pakistan's Blind Cricket Council announced a cash award of 1,000
rupees (about dlrs 24) for Jan, who has had four centuries in
domestic league play this year, the Time of India reported Friday.
	   In addition to Pakistan and South Africa, Australia, England,
New Zealand, Sri Lanka and host India _ all countries with teams
among the international elite of the sighted cricket world _ were
competing for the Kanishka Trophy. The tournament started Tuesday
and the championship will be played Nov. 28.
	   Players who range from the partially sighted to the totally
blind use special balls that emit a rattle to help batsmen direct
their bats and fielders determine where the catch can be made.
Bowlers shout ``ready?'' and wait for a ``yes'' from batsmen before
responding with a shouted ``play'' and flinging the ball.
	   Jan, a 21-year-old student from Peshawar, is partially sighted
and has been playing cricket for a decade, scoring some 10
centuries in his career.
	   Blind cricket tournaments were being played in Sri Lanka as
early as the 1940s. The Indian tournament is the first
international championship for the blind.

<TEXT>
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that
will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment was
postponed repeatedly mainly because the chronically broke Russian
space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the
station that is to go up later.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to
blast off next July or August.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for
the new station, said at a news conference earlier this week.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware.''
	   Russian officials were more cautious.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which is
rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a
deputy chief of the Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department, before the launch.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said the new station is the only hope
for the once-mighty Russian space industry, whose funding has
disintegrated since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow
Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
	   Russia is expected to retire the Mir sometime next year,
although some officials have talked about trying to keep it aloft
longer.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

 &UR; Indonesian opposition figure meets East Timorese rebel leader
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with situation in East Timor, last six grafs

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent opposition figure on
Friday met the jailed rebel chief of East Timor and said he favored
a vote on independence in the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   Amien Rais, who is considered a key contender for the presidency
in elections next year, visited Xanana Gusmao at Jakarta's Cipinang
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting the
Indonesian military.
	   Rais, one of the most vocal critics of the government, offered
to mediate in U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the former Portuguese
colony between Portugal and Indonesia.
	   Under former President Suharto, Indonesia invaded East Timor in
1975 and annexed it a year later. The United Nations does not
recognize Indonesian rule in the half-island territory.
	   Rais said East Timor had a right to choose whether to part ways
with Indonesia, but stressed the importance of laying the
groundwork for a fair vote.
	   ``The referendum should be set up gradually. It should be held
when the East Timorese people are mentally ready,'' said Rais, who
has founded a political party, the National Mandate Party, to run
in parliamentary elections next year.
	   ``If the majority of East Timorese people are willing to
integrate with Indonesia, Xanana will be respected,'' he said after
meeting Xanana. ``But if most of the East Timorese people want to
be independent or separate, then we have to respect that as well.''
	   Rais quoted Xanana as saying he hoped military operations in
East Timor would not jeopardize the peace talks. There have been
scattered incidents of fighting between soldiers and rebels in
recent weeks.
	   Xanana also said political turmoil in Jakarta, including riots
and clashes between students and the military last week, would not
benefit his struggle for independence in East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, the situation in the East Timor village of Alas, was
tense Friday following a clash between Indonesian soldiers and
rebels, military sources said.
	   A village chief was killed by the military during Tuesday's
violence about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Dili, East
Timor's provincial capital.
	   The military had earlier accused the chief of leading a Nov. 9
attack against a military post, in which three soldiers and one
rebel were killed.
	   Rebels took 13 soldierscaptive during that raid and continue to
hold two captive.

Israel begins troop pullback in West Bank

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Friday began pulling
out of parts of the northern West Bank, with army trucks deploying
large black-and-yellow cement road markers at intersections to
delineate the new boundaries, the Israeli army spokesman said.
	   The pullback, which will give the Palestinians full or partial
control of an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, came a day
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government
reluctantly approved stage one of the new Mideast peace accord.
	   The withdrawal marks a point of no return for Netanyahu who
since coming to power in May 1996 had zigzagged on the peace
process and now faces the loss of support of key allies and
possibly early elections.
	   At 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT), Israeli army trucks loaded with border
markers began pulling out of the Dotan army base near the
Palestinian town of Jenin, said the Israeli army spokesman, Lt.
Col. Sharon Grinker. Soldiers were to deploy the 130 markers at
road junctions throughout the morning.
	   At the same time, the Israeli West Bank commander, Maj. Gen.
Moshe Yaalon, and the commander of the Palestinian forces, Brig.
Gen. Ismail Jaber, reviewed the redeployment plans at an
Israeli-Palestinian liaison office near Jenin.
	   Two percent of the West Bank, or 110 square kilometers (44
square miles), were being transferred from sole Israeli control to
joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the land, or 400
square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint jurisdiction
to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will have full or partial control of 40
percent of the West Bank and will have moved a significant step
closer to establishing an independent state.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel also pledged to release 750
Palestinian prisoners, with the first group of 250 to be freed
later Friday.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians just south of Jenin
that was coming under full Palestinian control Friday, most
residents were more concerned about jailed relatives than about the
arrival of the Palestinian Authority forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed was sentenced to 16 life terms in an
Israeli military court in 1993 for killing Palestinians accused of
collaborating with Israel. ``What is the meaning of peace? It is
the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a woman in the
Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will be
surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The beginning of the withdrawal was expected to give new impetus
to government hard-liners to try and topple Netanyahu. ``Early
elections are in the air,'' said Emanuel Rosen, a political
commentator on Israel TV's Channel Two. If Netanyahu's coalition
unravels, he could be forced to hold new elections.

Palestinian land confiscated for Jewish settlement roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YITMA, West Bank (AP) _ Twenty years ago, Khalil Eid planted
rows of olive trees on a rocky plot of land in his West Bank
village.
	   As the trees flourished, so did Eid's livelihood. He took the
olives to family presses and sold bottles of oil.
	   On Thursday, the 58-year-old Palestinian farmer watched from a
wind-swept hillside while Israeli bulldozers and mechanical shovels
rip a swath of village land and uproot his olive grove.
	   The bulldozers, guarded by Israeli troops, were clearing land
for 13 bypass roads crisscrossing the West Bank and linking Jewish
settlements that eventually will be surrounded by Palestinian
territory.
	   Israel says the roads are necessary for settlers' security.
After agreeing to hand over some West Bank land, it announced last
week it would confiscate thousands more acres (hectares) of
Arab-owned land for highways.
	   Palestinians say the roads will reinforce Israel's hold over the
area and make it nearly impossible to divide the land for a future
Palestinian state.
	   ``I look at the West Bank in the year 2005 and I see that it
will look like Swiss cheese,'' said Khalil Tufjaki, chief
cartographer for the Palestinian Authority. Most of the West Bank,
home to 1.6 million Palestinians and 150,000 Israelis, will be
sliced-up for bypass roads under the Israeli plan, he said.
	   Palestinian official Nabil Amr called the land expropriations
``provocative,'' and correctly predicted violence.
	   In the village of al-Khader near Bethlehem, Israeli troops
clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers last weekend clearing began
there for a road connecting Jerusalem with the Jewish settlement of
Efrat.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon is expected to ask U.S.
officials in meetings next week to help pay for the staged troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, estimated to cost
anywhere from dlrs 500 million to dlrs 1.2 billion. An American
official in Israel said, however, said Sharon would be well-advised
not to bring up bypass roads.
	   ``As a rule, the United States is not interested in funding
bypass roads ... to sustain settlements,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear whether the U.S., which opposes settlement
expansion, would place restrictions on any aid package it approves,
the official said.
	   For residents of Yitma, the construction at the height of
olive-picking season came as a shock. No one had notified them.
	   ``I went to complain to the Palestinian Authority yesterday, but
I was told this is part of the peace agreement,'' Eid said.
``Without olive oil, how can I live?''
	   His neighbor, Ahmed Najjar, a 28-year-old just starting out in
the olive oil business, lost his 50 trees.
	   ``We are in favor of peace, but what kind of peace is this?'' he
asked. ``We are paying the price.''

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ A Russian Proton booster rocket
carried the first part of the international space station into
orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international
space colonization.
	   Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control
announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket
and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
above the Earth.
	   ``Success,'' shouted one exultant official some 10 minutes after
the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit.
	   The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in
the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5
kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had
prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning
by the highly toxic rocket fuel.
	   The launch went smoothly, with the giant rocket soaring into the
cloudy sky above the central Asian steppes. The huge roar of the
rocket reverberated for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the
empty plain around the base.
	   The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with
space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to
ensure there were no problems.
	   Solar power panels on the module were successfully deployed
shortly after it reached its first orbit and all systems appeared
to be working normally, officials said.
	   The launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed
for more than a year, ushers in a new era of cooperation among
former space-race rivals.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya or Sunrise was launched by a
three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve as a
space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing
propulsion, power and communications.
	   Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the
liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under cloudy
skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40
seconds later.
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that
will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment was
postponed repeatedly mainly because the chronically broke Russian
space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the
station that is to go up later.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to
blast off next July or August.
	   ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the
millennium with women and men living and working in space
permanently,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for
the new station, said at a news conference earlier this week.
	   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we are
about to launch hardware.''
	   Russian officials were more cautious.
	   ``It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with
... advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which is
rather common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a
deputy chief of the Russian Space Agency's manned flight
department, before the launch.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million to complete the segment.
	   Agency chief Yuri Koptev said the new station is the only hope
for the once-mighty Russian space industry, whose funding has
disintegrated since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow
Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
	   Russia is expected to retire the Mir sometime next year,
although some officials have talked about trying to keep it aloft
longer.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

Japanese stocks close sharply higher, dollar falls against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices: ADDS new trader quote in 5th graf.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose sharply Friday amid optimism
the government may announce fresh stimulus steps _ including a
possible sales tax cut _ to boost the sagging economy. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average soared 425.48
points, or 2.96 percent, to close at 14,779.94. On Thursday, the
average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.46 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 1.18
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 119.99 yen overnight.
	   Share prices soared after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party sealed a political alliance late Thursday
with the minority Liberal Party, which has pushed hard for a
temporary suspension of the national sales tax.
	   ``Expectations are getting widespread that there will be more
stimulus measures,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, chief strategist at Daiwa
Securities Co.
	   The two parties agreed to a ``radical revision'' of the
unpopular sales tax, which was raised to 5 percent last year from 3
percent, as part of a set of tax relief measures. The tax hike was
widely blamed for tipping the economy back into recession after a
brief spurt of growth.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section climbed 26.74 points, or 2.42 percent, to 1,130.74. The
TOPIX closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, the day before.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, optimism about the impact
of a possible reduction in the so-called consumption tax led
players to bid up the yen and sell dollars, traders said.
	   The dollar weakened after Yoshiro Mori, Secretary-General of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters that U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers encouraged Tokyo to consider
various options in regard to reform of the consumption tax, they
said.
	   It also fell on speculation about a possible resurgence of trade
friction between the United States and Japan and rumors that
unspecified U.S. hedge funds might dump Deutsche marks for yen,
traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.890 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.850 percent, driving its price down to 108.02 yen from 108.40.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla hideouts after attacks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli army comment in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Friday following attacks on
Israeli outposts in the volatile region, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jet fired two air-to-surface missiles on a valley
between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 7 a.m. (5:00
GMT) air raid on the area, which is believed to be used by Lebanese
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen occupying a border enclave in the south.
	   The strike came shortly after guerrillas of the Syrian-backed
Amal group launched attacks on Israeli and allied positions, the
officials said. No casualties were reported.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said all the planes
returned safely to base after hitting targets in the south.
	   Friday's raid was the latest in a series of attacks launched by
Israeli warplanes almost daily on suspected bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group in the south since Nov. 8.
None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   The attacks come at a time of heightened tension following a
Hezbollah roadside bombing near the border Monday which killed
three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The
casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Indonesia supports extension of OPEC production cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia wants the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend agreed production cuts
through the end of next year, the country's energy minister said
Friday.
	   Speaking to reporters, Kuntoro Mangusubroto said Indonesia,
Asia's only OPEC member, doesn't see the need for further
production cuts before then.
	   ``Indonesia prefers to roll over the existing system rather than
opt for new cuts,'' Kuntoro said.
	   The minister was speaking ahead of next week's OPEC ministerial
meeting Nov. 25 in Vienna.
	   OPEC has been split in the last few months between proponents of
another round of production cuts to boost flagging oil prices and
those who simply want to extend existing cuts another six months
through the end of 1999.
	   Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico, two members of the troika which
initiated the 3.1 million barrels a day of OPEC and non-OPEC output
cuts earlier this year, have said they won't cut any further.
Venezuela has said it might not even support an extension of
existing cuts.
	   The third troika member, Saudi Arabia, has been unwilling to cut
without the other two because of concerns about its U.S. market
share.
	   At its June meeting, Indonesia agreed to cut it production by
100,000 barrels per day to 1.28 million barrels per day.
	   Kuntoro said the country was sticking to this quota.

Parliament deputy cautiously optimistic on START II ratification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the international affairs committee of
the Russian State Duma expressed cautious optimism Friday that the
START II arms control treaty would be ratified, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The treaty, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to 3,500 warheads each. The U.S. Senate
ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led opposition in the
Russian parliament has balked, claiming that dismantling strategic
weapons would harm Russia's security and be too expensive.
	   Earlier this month, the Duma leadership gave committees in the
lower chamber 10 days to prepare documents for ratifying the
treaty.
	   Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Duma international affairs
committee, said Friday that his committee had prepared draft
legislation on ratification in close cooperation with the Foreign
and Defense Ministries, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``That does not mean that we were unanimous; however, our
positions are close,'' Lukin was quoted as saying.
	   He said his forecast for ratification was ``moderately positive.
	   ``I believe there is a certain chance to have it ratified,''
Lukin said.

U.N. weapons teams in field for third day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors went into the field
for the third consecutive day Friday, usually a day of rest in the
Muslim world.
	   ``We're going to be working seven days a week,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
the inspections. ``We want to get on with things and get as much
done in as short a period of time as possible.''
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts.
	   The inspectors refused to talk with reporters, and Ms. Cross
would not say where they were going.
	   Neither side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons
inspectors returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been
evacuated last week amid fears of a U.S. missile strike.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''
	   The United States and Britain had threatened military action if
Iraq did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the
work of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging
full cooperation with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will
lift the punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the
council of its compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to
an easing or lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales
and crippled the economy.
	   But the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter Burleigh,
made it clear earlier this week that the United States does not see
the review as leading automatically to an end of the sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruling
Baath Party, on Friday quoted an unidentified Information Ministry
official as saying Burleigh was being provocative.
	   ``This illegal and unethical position toward the comprehensive
review was the reason behind the latest crisis, and the American
insistence on bringing the issue to the surface again means they
are still working to create crises with Iraq,'' the official was
quoted as saying.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the U.N. inspectors, told the official Iraqi News Agency that seven
sites were visited on Wednesday and even more on Thursday.
	   The teams to date have been going to previously designated
weapons sites. In the past, they have taken Friday off.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said in New York on Thursday that he
had begun assembling teams for surprise visits, which in the past
have been the most contentious. Butler also said he sent three
letters to the Baghdad government seeking documents, but hadn't yet
received a reply.
	   ``We will test the whole spectrum of our work'' before reporting
back to the Security Council in three to four weeks, Butler said.

Greek police being squeezed by vice crackdown

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The young woman's world was closing in
around her.
	   She left Russia with the promise of a job in Greece, authorities
say. It turned out to be prostitution. Then she was stashed in a
stifling apartment bordello in the port of Salonica. She and the
other women there were rarely allowed to leave. Clients visited at
all hours.
	   The anguish for Irini Penkina ended last month, in the
apartment's narrow bathroom. She tied black pantyhose around a pipe
above the toilet. The other end was knotted around her throat.
	   There was no suicide note. But the 20-year-old woman's death has
become a rallying cry for investigators and activists seeking to
understand the extent of illegal prostitution in Greece.
	   What the inquiries have uncovered has staggered the nation:
claims of sexual slavery, accusations of corruption _ including
alleged police protection for the groups. The revelations suggest
Greece has become a European Union foothold for prostitution rings
with links throughout the former Soviet bloc.
	   A series of raids have led to dozens of arrests. A policeman and
a retired officer were arrested Thursday after a public prosecutor
staked out an alleged hideout for prostitutes.
	   Last week, police charged 33 people with running a network of 13
brothels that had hundreds of prostitutes from former Soviet
republics.
	   Nearly all the alleged pimps and enforcers for the prostitution
rings are Greeks _ a disturbing disclosure in a nation inclined to
make foreigners the scapegoats for most social ills.
	   The situation also energized Greece's weak feminist movement.
	   ``The collapse of communism has been good for Greece's
`promoters' in the prostitution racket,'' said Georgia Doussia, a
member of a newly formed group opposing forced prostitution.
	   An estimated 20,000 foreign women work as unregistered
prostitutes in Greece, which has a small and tightly regulated
legal sex-for-sale industry. Before the fall of the Iron Curtain,
Greece had no more than 2,000 illegal prostitutes, police say.
	   The huge increase is not unique. Eastern European women have
been migrating to wealthier countries for years, and end up working
as prostitutes _ some willingly, but most lured by ads for work in
nightclubs or as dancers, investigators say.
	   But researchers believe Greece may be one of the commercial hubs
of the sex trade.
	   ``It's a processing center for prostitutes,'' said Gregoris
Lazos, a professor at Athens' Panteion University who has led a
decade-long study of prostitution trends.
	   ``Girls are brought here. They have no money and their passports
are taken away. They become the property of the rings. Within a few
years they are full-time prostitutes. They say they are
`processed.' And then they are sold to other rings in Europe or the
Middle East.''
	   Greece's proximity to the poorest Eastern European nations
contributes to its role in the regional networks, Lazos suggested.
	   ``But the main factor is the corruption. You can't operate
illegal enterprises this big and this complex without corrupt
officials,'' he said.
	   Prosecutors refuse to speculate on the size of the illegal
prostitution operations in Greece. But the anti-corruption drive
has already reached high officials.
	   The public order minister was dismissed last month in a
government shuffle. Less than a week later, the former head of the
national police and 15 others were charged with corruption,
including allegations of taking kickbacks to issue residency
permits to foreign women. There was speculation that prosecutors
could eventually link the permits and the prostitution rings.
	   Some police officers also are under investigation for allegedly
offering protection to pimps.
	   The new police chief, Gen. Yiannis Georgakopoulos, ordered a
complete overhaul of the vice squad in the Athens area and vowed to
champion a ``relentless'' campaign to ferret out rotten cops.
	   The reformist attitudes have even spilled over to the media.
Prosecutors have ordered newspapers not to publish thinly veiled
sex ads such as those for escort and massage services.
	   Some newspapers have raised free speech objections. But many
media commentators praised the emphasis on ethics and wondered
whether it could launch a more thorough housecleaning _ such as the
way low-level kickback probes in Italy led to a wide-ranging
crusade that implicated top politicians and business figures.

Monica the topic conversation among Japanese during Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Asia
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mariko Iwanami shivered as she strained to see past
the crowd and barricade of police officers.
	   She and a friend had spent most of their lunch hour on this
bright, chilly Friday waiting with about 1,000 other Tokyoites in
hopes of catching a glimpse of visiting President Bill Clinton.
	   ``I saw him on TV last night,'' explained the 23-year-old office
worker. ``But I would rather have seen Hillary. She probably didn't
want to come.''
	   Even without sharply worded trade disputes to roil emotions,
many in Japan remained as transfixed as ever with visiting U.S.
leader _ and only partly because of his stature in world affairs.
	   Like many Americans, the Japanese public has had a morbid
fascination with the details of Clinton's relationship with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Newspapers rushed translations of prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation. The release earlier this week of Lewinsky's taped
phone conversations with Linda Tripp was a lead item on Tokyo news
broadcasts.
	   Adultery was the biggest topic of conversation among those who
turned out Friday in Tokyo's posh Ginza district, where Clinton
shared a private lunch of tempura with his host, Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
	   ``It's so American to get upset about an extra-martial affair,''
said Kenichi Shinzaki, a 40-year-old salesman who said he was
happily married.
	   ``I'm sure all Japanese politicians have mistresses,'' he said.
	   But not all Japanese are as sympathetic. In a televised town
meeting Thursday night, one housewife from Osaka told Clinton she'd
never forgive her husband if he had an affair.
	   The Japanese media have been more discrete during Clinton's
whirlwind two-day visit, focusing on other issues, such as the
economy.
	   Just days before Clinton arrived, Obuchi unveiled a nearly dlrs
200 billion stimulus package, meant in part to appease U.S.
impatience with Japan's inability to end its long recession.
	   Most important to many here may have been the fact that Clinton
showed up at all. After rising tensions in Iraq forced Clinton to
cancel his appearance at a summit of Asian and Pacific leaders this
week in Malaysia, some had speculated he would call off his visit
to Tokyo as well.
	   While shortening his stay here by a day, Clinton's trip is
important to many Japanese, who are particularly sensitive to their
country's treatment by the United States.
	   Clinton's next stop is Seoul, South Korea, where he will stay
until Monday, when he returns to Washington.

Candidates kick off Taiwanese mayoral campaigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TPE101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The races may already be well under way,
but mayoral candidates in Taiwan's top two cities officially
launched their campaigns Friday, two weeks ahead of polls that
could carry great significance in the 2000 presidential elections.
	   In Taipei, incumbent opposition Mayor Chen Shui-bian and ruling
Nationalist challenger Ma Ying-jeou formally began their battle to
run the capital, amid the blasts of firecrackers and cheers of
supporters.
	   Voters in Taipei appear more concerned about how their votes
could affect national politics than mundane issues such as drainage
ditches or street lamps. The mayoral race has stolen the spotlight
from national legislative elections that also will be held Dec. 5.
	   Chen, leader of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, has
vowed not to run for president if he wins re-election, hoping to
convince voters they won't have to worry about electing a part-time
mayor.
	   But Chen still is widely viewed as the most likely opposition
candidate when Taiwanese choose a successor to President Lee
Teng-hui 16 months later. Whether or not Chen changes his position
on running, his supporters are counting on his re-election to help
bring the 12-year-old party to power.
	   The long-ruling Nationalists are adamant about preventing such a
damaging result _ at a time when they have been wounded in public
opinion by a corrupt image.
	   The key to the race could be the showing by the tiny New Party,
a group that broke away from the Nationalists because they believed
the leadership was too lax about sticking to its doctrine of
eventual reunification with mainland China.
	   Four years ago, the New Party won 30 percent of the votes _
taking nearly all of them from the Nationalists _ to help push Chen
to victory.
	   Many New Party supporters are believed to secretly back Ma, a
former justice minister respected for his clean image, out of fear
that a victory by Chen could lead the island into declaring formal
independence from China. Many Taiwanese worry that such a move
could lead to an invasion by the mainland Communists.
	   But New Party candidate Wang Chien-shien rejected an appeal by
the Nationalists for him to drop out, saying it would spell the
party's death.
	   According to a survey by the United Daily News conducted between
Monday and Wednesday, 40 percent of those polled said they would
vote for Ma, 32 percent for Chen and 9 percent for Wang. The rest
was undecided.
	   The poll of 1,043 citizens had a margin of error of plus and
minus 3 percent, the newspaper said.
	   Although the issue of Taiwan's future status vis-a-vis China
looms in the race, candidates have shunned ideological debates
because most voters prefer the status quo.

Howell, Price in two-man show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ English golfer David Howell and
Australian Terry Price are threatening to turn the Australian PGA
championship into a two-man battle.
	   The first-round co-leaders busted clear of the field with
exceptional scoring as a brisk morning breeze continued to sweep
the New South Wales course, though not to the extent of Thursday's
blasts.
	   The 23-year-old Howell, playing the best golf of his pro career,
led at 9-under-par 135 after a six-under 66 Friday containing seven
birdies. Price, 37, finished two shots back with a 68.
	   There was a gap of four strokes back to the nearest chaser,
Trinidad and Tobago's Stephen Ames, who returned a 71 in easier
afternoon conditions.
	   It was a measure of Howell and Price's quality that the halfway
cut was set at an unusually high eight over par.
	   Among players to miss the weekend's play will be pre-tournament
favorite Peter Lonard of Australia, missing only his sixth cut in
his last 40 home tour events, and playing partner Rodger Davis.
	   Both men limped badly with scores of 79 Friday to be nine over,
the same mark as Scotland's Raymond Russell.
	   Howell finished 32nd in his third season on the European tour
this year but has yet to win as a professional, through he was
second to Lee Westwood in the high-class Loch Lomond International
last year.
	   ``I'd rate these two rounds as the best two I have put together
as a pro, to be nine under in these conditions,'' said Howell.
	   He showed his mastery of the low punch shots required under the
wind as he started at the 10th and went through the harder back
nine in 4-under 32.
	   Price got fired up in the middle of his round with a birdie on
the 18th, a chip in from 20 meters for eagle on the par-4 first
hole after driving the green and seeing the ball roll back off the
front.
	   Still in the hunt are Englishman Anthony Wall (72) and
Australian Paul Marantz (69) who were both one under and one clear
of New Zealander Michael Campbell and Australian Robert Willis.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ English golfer David Howell and
Australian Terry Price are threatening to turn the Australian PGA
championship into a two-man battle.
	   The first-round co-leaders busted clear of the field with
exceptional scoring as a brisk morning breeze continued to sweep
the New South Wales course, though not to the extent of Thursday's
blasts.
	   The 23-year-old Howell, playing the best golf of his pro career,
led at 9-under-par 135 after a six-under 66 Friday containing seven
birdies. Price, 37, finished two shots back with a 68.
	   There was a gap of four strokes back to the nearest chaser,
Trinidad and Tobago's Stephen Ames, who returned a 71 in easier
afternoon conditions.
	   It was a measure of Howell and Price's quality that the halfway
cut was set at an unusually high eight over par.
	   Among players to miss the weekend's play will be pre-tournament
favorite Peter Lonard of Australia, missing only his sixth cut in
his last 40 home tour events, and playing partner Rodger Davis.
	   Both men limped badly with scores of 79 Friday to be nine over,
the same mark as Scotland's Raymond Russell.
	   Howell finished 32nd in his third season on the European tour
this year but has yet to win as a professional, through he was
second to Lee Westwood in the high-class Loch Lomond International
last year.
	   ``I'd rate these two rounds as the best two I have put together
as a pro, to be nine under in these conditions,'' said Howell.
	   He showed his mastery of the low punch shots required under the
wind as he started at the 10th and went through the harder back
nine in 4-under 32.
	   Price got fired up in the middle of his round with a birdie on
the 18th, a chip in from 20 meters for eagle on the par-4 first
hole after driving the green and seeing the ball roll back off the
front.
	   Still in the hunt are Englishman Anthony Wall (72) and

Korean president says he will discuss North Korea with Clinton
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung said Friday
there is no conclusive evidence that North Korea is building an
underground facility to construct nuclear weapons.
	   The South Korean leader said he opposed risking confrontation
with North Korea by pushing the communist state too hard to open up
the underground site for outside inspections.
	   That was the message Kim said he will deliver when he meets with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seoul on Saturday.
	   ``We need patience when dealing with North Korea,'' Kim said in
a news conference after returning home from a regional economic
summit in Kuala Lumpur. ``Without any conclusive evidence, it is
not a good idea to blow up the problem.''
	   U.S. officials say they have enough evidence to warrant an
inspection of the underground project, located northeast of the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
	   North Korea insists it's a civilian project, and demands dlrs
300 million for the right to inspect the site. It says compensation
is necessary because Washington has ``slandered'' its reputation.
	   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman said the United
States had ``compelling'' evidence that the project northeast of
Pyongyang was nuclear-related, and rejected the North Korean demand
for compensation.
	   Kartman had a 12-hour talk with North Korean officials in
Pyongyang earlier this week but failed to persuade them to open up
its facility.
	   Both sides will meet again in New York in late November, the
South Korean president said.
	   Kim urged North Korea to grant unconditional access to the
facility.
	   But at the same time, Kim called on the Clinton administration
to support his ``sunshine'' policy that stresses a gradual,
reconcilatory approach towards the North.
	   Before Kartman headed for Pyongyang, a senior Clinton
administration official said the United States is ready to drop a
1994 U.S.-North Korea agreement if the North Koreans don't permit
inspections.
	   The 1994 agreement required Pyongyang to replace its
plutonium-producing nuclear reactors with safer models financed
largely by Japan and South Korea.
	   The deal led North Korea to freeze activity at Yongbyon, its
main nuclear complex. The newly detected underground site is
located in a mountainside at Keumjongri, about 40 kilometers (25
miles) northeast of Yongbyon.

U.N. weapons teams in field for third day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors went into the field
for the third consecutive day Friday, usually a day of rest in the
Muslim world.
	   ``We're going to be working seven days a week,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
the inspections. ``We want to get on with things and get as much
done in as short a period of time as possible.''
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts.
	   The inspectors refused to talk with reporters, and Ms. Cross
would not say where they were going.
	   Neither side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons
inspectors returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been
evacuated last week amid fears of a U.S. missile strike.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''
	   The United States and Britain had threatened military action if
Iraq did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the
work of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging
full cooperation with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will
lift the punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the
council of its compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to
an easing or lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales
and crippled the economy.
	   But the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter Burleigh,
made it clear earlier this week that the United States does not see
the review as leading automatically to an end of the sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruling
Baath Party, on Friday quoted an unidentified Information Ministry
official as saying Burleigh was being provocative.
	   ``This illegal and unethical position toward the comprehensive
review was the reason behind the latest crisis, and the American
insistence on bringing the issue to the surface again means they
are still working to create crises with Iraq,'' the official was
quoted as saying.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the U.N. inspectors, told the official Iraqi News Agency that seven
sites were visited on Wednesday and even more on Thursday.
	   The teams to date have been going to previously designated
weapons sites. In the past, they have taken Friday off.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said in New York on Thursday that he
had begun assembling teams for surprise visits, which in the past
have been the most contentious. Butler also said he sent three
letters to the Baghdad government seeking documents, but hadn't yet
received a reply.
	   ``We will test the whole spectrum of our work'' before reporting
back to the Security Council in three to four weeks, Butler said.

Spokesman for FedEx pilots say they're ready to talk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WOODY BAIRD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ A union for pilots at Federal Express
Corp. said Thursday that it wants to resume contract talks with the
world's largest air cargo delivery company and that it will hold
off on any strike plans for two months.
	   Union spokesman Bob Clement said early Friday that the union's
president, vice president and a representative from Federal Express
Corp. met and agreed to restart negotiations Monday.
	   Clement said the union's board of directors agreed unanimously
to take no action on a strike for 60 days.
	   FedEx and its pilots have been haggling over a contract since
July. Negotiations broke off Oct. 30 and last week pilots began
refusing to work overtime.
	   The union also mailed strike authorization ballots to its
members and had agreed to count them on Dec. 3. If two-thirds
approved, the union leaders had planned to call a walkout.
	   Clement said Thursday night the union has agreed to work
overtime.
	   ``We want the customers to understand and absolutely know that
their packages will be their during the peak season in December,''
Clement said.
	   The company had no comment Thursday night.
	   The union's action comes on the heels of an angry e-mail that
FedEx founder Frederick Smith sent to pilots this week.
	   He expressed disappointment in the union and warned them that
the may lose their jobs in a strike. He also rescinded the
company's last contract offer, which was a 17-percent raise over
five years.
	   The union, however, wanted 5 percent retroactive to a negotiated
date and 19 percent more over four years.
	   Memphis-based Federal Express, owned by FDX Corp., is the
world's largest air cargo delivery company with 326 cargo jets. It
has 3,500 pilots and more than 140,000 employees worldwide.
	   Customers and management insisted that a strike might hurt the
company's reputation and bottom line, but wouldn't have the same
impact on businesses that use the service as last year's walkout at
United Parcel Service.
	   A strike would disrupt express deliveries by FedEx, but the vast
majority of the company's workers would stay on the job, shipping
packages by truck and on other companies' aircraft.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England defended its decision not to
utilize floodlights to make up for lost time as controversy
overshadowed an impressive bowling effort by England's pace quartet
on the opening day of the Ashes cricket series Friday.
	   Australia, batting first and reduced to 106 for four before tea,
recovered to 246 for five at stumps at the Gabba with vice-captain
Steve Waugh leading the way with an unbeaten 69.
	   England's day was compounded by three dropped catches, two in
the closing overs of the day when both Waugh and Ian Healy (46 not
out) were dropped with the second new ball.
	   Nasser Hussain was the villain, dropping two catches, including
Steve Waugh in the last over of the day off Darren Gough at second
slip.
	   Bad light stopped play with one over remaining of the scheduled
90 overs. Earlier, play was temporarily halted for 35 minutes soon
after the tea break.
	   An experimental International Cricket Council (ICC) rule has
provision for use of floodlights, but both sides must agree before
the start of a series, and England backed out because they have
never played under them in a test.
	   ``We felt we may be disadvantaged because we have never played
under them in this country,'' coach David Lloyd said. ``A test
match is serious stuff, and it would be unfair to ask us to play in
those conditions.''
	   Any lost time during the five-matches series will be made up
with an early start and late finish, adding 30 minutes to either
end.
	   Waugh once again came to the rescue of his side with a fighting
half century, surviving a controversial run-out decision in the
process.
	   Responding to Ricky Ponting's call for a second run, Waugh was
caught short of his ground when a relayed Darren Gough throw by
wicketkeeper Alec Stewart hit the stumps at the non-striker's end.
	   Umpire Darrell Hair's call for a television verdict saw
inconclusive replays as to whether the stumps were broken by Allen
Mullally's hand or the ball.
	   Waugh, then on 29 and Australia at 149 for four, was allowed to
escape by television umpire Peter Parker.
	   Waugh, at 50, completed 17,000 first-class runs in his 257th
match. His innings has so far lasted eight minutes over three hours
and included 10 boundaries off 131 balls.
	   Waugh and Ponting (21), figured in a 72-run fifth-wicket stand
after Australia lost skipper Mark Taylor (46) and Mark Waugh (31)
in the space of three balls 45 minutes before tea.
	   Taylor and Waugh rescued the innings with a 47-run third wicket
stand after opener Michael Slater (16) and No. 3 Justin Langer
(eight) had been dismissed with 59 runs on the board.
	   On a wicket perfect for batting, the Australian top order fell
to some inspired and disciplined bowling led by left-arm seamer
Mullally.
	   Mullally claimed Slater and Waugh while Dominic Cork removed
Taylor and Ponting, who was brilliantly caught by Mark Butcher at
extra cover to end a threatening stand.
	   Waugh and Ian Healy, who are accustomed to rescuing the innings
from top- order disasters, once again rose to the occasion with a
forceful 68-run stand for the sixth wicket.
	   Mullally and Cork took two wickets apiece costing them 64 and 56
runs respectively. (ik/djp)

Sports minister criticized for boxing ban failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Sports Minister Jackie
Kelly was criticized at a sports ministers conference Friday by
Australia's peak doctors' group for failing to support a ban on
children's boxing.
	   Instead of banning children's boxing _ a move supported by the
Australian Medical Association (AMA) and New South Wales Sports
Minister Gabrielle Harrison _ the federal, state and territory
ministers instead formed a group to look into the issue of combat
sports.
	   Under the agreement, states will review regulations on
professional combat sports, rules and age restrictions on amateur
boxing and will provide a detailed analysis of the situation in
other combat sports.
	   It's understood if states are unable to come to a final
agreement on the regulations, then national legislation could be
imposed by the federal government.
	   The decision, which follows controversy about the Australian
Amateur Boxing League's championships last week in Queensland
state, was taken when a seconder could not be found for a
resolution by Harrison to impose a national ban on boxing for
children under 14.
	   The championships were moved to Queensland from Sydney because
New South Wales bans boxing for all females and males under the age
of 17.
	   ``I think it is a pathetic effort by Jackie Kelly who has
completely abrogated her role to look after the health of
children,'' medical association president Dr. David Brand said.

<TEXT>
	   GUJRANWALA, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan spinners Saqlain Mushtaq
and Shahid Afridi shut down Zimbabwe for 237 in the opening one-day
international of their three-match series Friday.
	   Off-spinner Mushtaq claimed two wickets each in his two spells
to finish with four for 35. Afridi, the leg-spinner, chipped in
with three wickets for 45 as Zimbabwe failed to cash in on a good
start and was dismissed for 237 in 49.3 overs.
	   Neil Johnson and Grant Flower gave the visitors a flying start
of 75 runs off 80 deliveries after Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail
won the toss and elected to field.
	   Flower departed in the 14th over off a doubtful caught behind
decision after making 26 off 44 balls. TV replays showed that
paceman Shoaib Akhtar's delivery did not touch Flower's bat.
	   Mushtaq removed Craig Evans (5) and Andy Flower (4) in his third
and fourth overs as Zimbabwe innings failed to gain momentum after
the 20th over. In between these two wickets, Wasim Akram
brilliantly ran out Murray Goodwin, who scored 16.
	   Johnson kept one end intact and made a resolute career-best 74,
surpassing his previous best of 72 against Sri Lanka in last week's
Champions Trophy Tournament at Sharjah.
	   The 28-year-old left-hander hit four fours during his 99-ball
innings before he was smartly caught by Akram at backward square
leg off Sohail in the 32nd over.
	   Captain Alistair Campbell tried to lift the run-rate but
Zimbabwe managed to get 61 in the last 10 overs. Campbell made a
defiant 42 off 57 deliveries before being caught by Akram at covers
to become one of Afridi's three victims.
	   Saqlain then wrapped up the innings when he had last man Eddo
Brandes stumped by Moin Khan in the last over.
	   Sohail bowled a steady 10-over spell and conceded 37 for the key
scalp of Johnson.

Sudanese government, rebels agree to protect aid workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese officials and rebels signed a
pact guaranteeing better security to aid workers, including a
promise not to lay land mines in areas where they provide help, a
U.N. official said Friday.
	   The accord, signed in Rome on Wednesday, was forged to allow
food to reach people caught in a 15-year civil war in the south.
	   ``The agreement will provide greater safety and security for our
workers,'' said David Fletcher, acting coordinator of the United
Nation's Operation Lifeline Sudan.
	   Aid workers estimate about 1.5 million people are facing food
shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal, as a result
of drought and fighting.
	   In October, both sides extended by three months a three-month
cease-fire to speed the flow of humanitarian aid.
	   Fletcher said the new agreement will allow aid workers much
fuller use of communications equipment, including radios and
satellite telephones, which are critical for security.
	   For example, if an attack occurs in an area where U.N. staff
members are based, they could call for an evacuation, he said.
	   Both sides agreed for the first time not to lay land mines on
humanitarian corridors or airstrips used by Operation Lifeline
Sudan, Fletcher said.
	   In areas where mines already have been laid, those who were
responsible must inform U.N. security personnel of safe corridors,
under the agreement.
	   The warring parties also agreed to expedite the release of aid
workers, if they are taken hostage.
	   Also, the pact outlines procedures for humanitarian aid workers
to cross front lines, if deemed necessary. ``It's a good thing to
have with the way front lines can change,'' Fletcher said.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, pitting
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the
government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1.5 million people have
died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

Japanese stocks close sharply higher, dollar falls against yen

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rallied on Friday, fueled by hope
fresh stimulus measures such as a possible sales-tax cut will help
put the economy back on track for recovery. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 425.48
points, or 2.96 percent, to close at 14,779.94. On Thursday, the
average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The dollar bought 120.16 yen in late afternoon trading, down
0.48 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, but slightly above its late
New York level of 119.99 yen overnight.
	   Share prices soared after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party sealed a political alliance late Thursday
with the minority Liberal Party, which has pushed hard for a
temporary suspension of the national sales tax.
	   ``Expectations are getting widespread that there will be more
stimulus measures,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, chief strategist at Daiwa
Securities Co.
	   The two parties agreed to a ``radical revision'' of the
unpopular sales tax, which was raised to 5 percent last year from 3
percent, as part of a set of economic relief measures. The tax hike
was widely blamed for tipping the economy back into recession after
a brief spurt of growth.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section climbed 26.74 points, or 2.42 percent, to 1,130.74. The
TOPIX closed down 9.42 points, or 0.85 percent, the day before.
	   Advancers exceeded decliners 960 to 215, with 124 issues closing
unchanged. An estimated 500 million shares changed hands on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 515.6 million
issues the previous day.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, optimism about the impact
of a possible reduction in the so-called consumption tax led
players to bid up the yen and sell dollars, traders said.
	   ``Obviously, any hint that the consumption tax might be lowered
would have implications for the economy,'' said Yuhiko Kaji, vice
president of foreign exchange and international treasurys at Sakura
Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar weakened after Yoshiro Mori, Secretary-General of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters that U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers encouraged Tokyo to consider
various options in regard to reform of the consumption tax, they
said.
	   The dollar dipped below 119 yen earlier on speculation about a
possible resurgence of trade friction between the U.S. and Japan
and rumors that unspecified U.S. hedge funds might dump Deutsche
marks for yen, traders said.
	   In Tokyo trading, the dollar rose as high as 120.90 yen and fell
as low as 118.85 yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.900 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.850 percent, driving its price down to 107.92 yen from 108.40.

Doctors confirm bullet pieces found in Indonesian protest victims

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doctors have found metal bullet
fragments in the bodies of students shot to death by Indonesian
troops during bloody street protests last week, a forensic expert
confirmed Friday.
	   The finding comes as the military is reportedly investigating
allegations that soldiers disobeyed top-level orders and opened
fire on pro-democracy protesters with live rounds instead of only
plastic bullets.
	   Fragments from ``high-velocity type'' bullets were found in the
bodies of seven students killed during protests and rioting in
which up to 16 people died, said Dr. Mun'im Idries of state-run
Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, where post mortem examinations were
carried out.
	   ``We found that the seven students were killed because of the
high velocity of the bullets that hit them,'' Idris told The
Associated Press.
	   He was quoted in the Jakarta Post earlier as saying: ``The
bullets are small in diameter but produced fatalities.''
	   Budi Sampurna, head of the hospital's forensic department, said
the fragments had been handed over to military investigators.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto ordered an investigation to
determine how the deaths occurred despite live ammunition being
banned during last week's clashes, said Wayan Karya, spokesman for
the political and security affairs minister.
	   ``The investigation aims to find out exactly what went wrong,''
Karya was quoted in The Indonesian Observer newspaper as saying.
	   ``We want to find out why, despite the fact that live ammunition
was expressly prohibited by military commanders,'' he said. One
postmortem examination found a bullet embedded in the body one
victim, he said.
	   Earlier this week Cabinet minister Adi Sasono said autopsies
showed some of the students had been killed by live ammunition.
	   Meanwhile angry students punched and kicked a Cabinet minister
after invading a provincial airport where government officials were
holding a meeting on Thursday, the newspaper Kompas reported.
	   It said bodyguards rescued Agriculture Minister Soleh Salahudin
from a mob of students in Padang, about 1,000 kilometers (600
miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The minister later met with the students, who demanded the
military be removed from government and that Wiranto resign.
	   Students have kept up their protests in the wake of the
killings.
	   On Friday several hundred students and members of Muhammidiyah,
Indonesia's second largest Muslim group, entered the compound of
the National Monument and were marching toward the presidential
palace.
	   The park has been sealed off for weeks by armed troops and tanks
guarding public buildings. The marchers chanted slogans demanding
greater democratic change.
	   Earlier at Atma Jaya Catholic University, the scene of the worst
violence last Friday, about 500 students, families and staff held a
Mass for the dead.
	   A group of about 30 members of the Front of Indonesian Women
Action were blocked by soldiers more than 100 meters (yards) from
the Defense Ministry.
	   With cries of ``save Indonesia from the military's hand,'' the
women demanded Wiranto's resignation and the removal of the
military from politics.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 16 people, including eight
students and several soldiers, were killed last week in
confrontations after demonstrators tried to march on the national
Parliament. Police say 13 people died. Hundreds of people were
injured.
	   Opposition figures and students claim the military provoked much
of the violence and have demanded that Wiranto resign.
	   President B.J. Habibie has accused some opposition groups of
orchestrating the protests as part of a plot to overthrow his
6-month-old government. Police have charged 10 activists with
sedition. More charges are expected to be filed soon.
	   Despite the crackdown, big student protests have continued this
week.
	   On Thursday, about 3,000 students demanded that autocratic
ex-President Suharto be hanged and his wealth seized after soldiers
stopped them from marching on his house.
	   Troops forced the students to a halt outside the home of the
U.S. ambassador, a few blocks from Suharto's house in a exclusive
Jakarta suburb.
	   A source close to the former president said he remained at home
Friday. ``He won't run away,'' the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three
decades. Discontent over inflation and joblessness helped spark the
May riots that killed 1,200 people and helped drive Suharto from
power.

Federal Express pilots, management to resume contract talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with spokesman saying two sides agreed to meet
Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By WOODY BAIRD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Federal Express Corp. and its pilots
union agreed Friday to resume contract negotiations and the union
lifted its threat to strike during the busy year-end holiday
season, a union spokesman said.
	   The president and vice president of the Fedex Pilots Association
and a representative from FedEx, the world's largest air cargo
delivery company, met and agreed to restart negotiations Monday,
spokesman Bob Clement said.
	   Clement also said the union's board of directors agreed
unanimously to take no action on a strike for 60 days.
	   FedEx and its pilots have been haggling over a contract since
July. Negotiations broke off Oct. 30 and last week pilots began
refusing to work overtime.
	   The union also mailed strike authorization ballots to its
members and had agreed to count them on Dec. 3. If two-thirds
approved, the union leaders had planned to call a walkout.
	   Clement said Thursday night the union has agreed to work
overtime.
	   ``We want the customers to understand and absolutely know that
their packages will be their during the peak season in December,''
Clement said.
	   The company had no comment Thursday night.
	   The union's action comes on the heels of an angry e-mail that
FedEx founder Frederick Smith sent to pilots this week.
	   He expressed disappointment in the union and warned them that
the may lose their jobs in a strike. He also rescinded the
company's last contract offer, which was a 17-percent raise over
five years.
	   The union, however, wanted 5 percent retroactive to a negotiated
date and 19 percent more over four years.
	   Memphis-based Federal Express, owned by FDX Corp., is the
world's largest air cargo delivery company with 326 cargo jets. It
has 3,500 pilots and more than 140,000 employees worldwide.
	   Customers and management insisted that a strike might hurt the
company's reputation and bottom line, but wouldn't have the same
impact on businesses that use the service as last year's walkout at
United Parcel Service.
	   A strike would disrupt express deliveries by FedEx, but the vast
majority of the company's workers would stay on the job, shipping
packages by truck and on other companies' aircraft.

Report: Russia in danger of becoming oil importer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is in danger of becoming an oil importer
after years of being one of the world's largest oil producers, a
top official was reported as saying Friday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is in charge of
economic policy, said oil production has been falling for the past
10 years and urgent action was needed to reverse the decline,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The situation in the oil sector is critical,'' Maslyukov said,
adding that the government must take ``serious measures'' to
resolve the industry's problems.
	   Russian oil production is likely to fall to 270 million metric
tons in 1999, and to 220 million metric tons in 2000, Maslyukov
warned during a meeting with officials of Transneft, the operator
of Russia's oil pipeline network.
	   In 1997, Russia's crude oil production totaled 297 million tons.
	   The oil industry, like much of the Russian economy, is plagued
by old and inefficient equipment, corruption and lack of funds for
developing existing and new oil fields. Oil is one of the country's
few hard currency exports.

Primakov criticizes predecessors for not improving productivity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will ask the International
Monetary Fund for new terms to repay the country's debt to the
lending organization, its top economic policymaker announced
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov blamed his
reform-minded predecessors for the West's skepticism about Russia's
economic recovery plan. In an interview published in the Izvestia
daily on Friday, Primakov said western officials were getting all
their information on developments in Russia from Russia's liberal
reformers who lost power earlier this year.
	   ``Reformers did not develop production and the (financial
collapse of) August 17 is their fault,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August, when the
government defaulted on its domestic debt and devalued the ruble.
The IMF has been insisting that it will not release any more money
until the government comes up with a comprehensive plan to combat
the economic crisis and prove that Moscow is taking steps to
implement the plan.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov was due to meet later
in the day with the head of an IMF mission to Moscow, Jorge Marquez
Ruarte, to discuss the possible resumption of the fund's lending
program to Russia.
	   Maslyukov said he would be discussing possible new terms for
Russia to repay its loans from the International Monetary Fund, the
Interfax news agency reported. Russia is scheduled to pay dlrs 4.6
billion next year, but has already defaulted on many of its other
debts.
	   The government reached tentative agreement Thursday with a group
of private creditors. In a joint statement, the Russian Finance
Ministry and Deutsche Bank announced that they had agreed in
principle on repayment of the government's debts.
	   The announcement came after three days of talks in London
between a Russian delegation and creditors holding Russian Treasury
bills and bonds that were due to mature between Aug. 19, 1998, and
Dec. 31, 1999.
	   The Russian government owes approximately dlrs 10 billion to
foreign banks, while Russian banks owe about dlrs 6-7 billion.
	   In the Izvestia interview, Primakov blamed the reformers around
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his successor Sergei
Kiriyenko for the nation's economic crisis. He said they had failed
to boost the nation's productivity, and that their ability to
stabilize the economy had been based on high world prices for oil,
Russia's biggest export earner.
	   When oil prices fell, the reformers suffered ``a spasm of
fear,'' Primakov was quoted as telling Izvestia. But now the West
regards them as ``oracles,'' Primakov complained.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ordered Microsoft
Corp., the world's largest software maker, to stop engaging in
unfair business practices which violate the country's anti-monopoly
laws, a commission spokesman said Friday.
	   The warning, which came after an investigation began in January
when officials raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices, came as the
Redmond, Wash.-based company faces similar allegations against it
in a high-profile case in the United States.
	   If Microsoft contests the finding announced on Friday, the
government trade commission may take legal action against the
company to enforce the ruling, said FTC spokesman Kanichiro
Nakanishi.
	   The FTC found Microsoft and its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary
had bundled software pre-installed in personal computers in a way
that put competitors at a disadvantage, the spokesman said.
	   Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the basic
functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Maintaining political stability in
Indonesia was crucial to attracting foreign investment, a Japanese
official told President B.J. Habibie Friday.
	   Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the Indonesia-Japan Parliamentarians
League, met with Habibie as part of a two-day business conference
which opened less than one week after violent clashes in Jakarta's
streets between student demonstrators and police.
	   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yamasaki said Habibie
told him the Indonesian cabinet has been working to improve the
stability in the country and to improve democracy.
	   Habibie said he hoped the government's reform plans would
attract investors to Indonesia, said Yamasaki, who is a member of
Japan's House of Representatives.
	   Japan is the largest single foreign lender and investor in
Indonesia, and a significant contributor to the International
Monetary Fund's multi-billion-dollar bailout package for its ailing
economy.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. It has
been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nikko Securities Co., a top Japanese brokerage
which became a unit of Citigroup Inc. in June, will effectively
withdraw from several overseas markets as part of a broad
restructuring effort, a local report said Friday.
	   Nikko will close or scale-back 11 of its 14 foreign subsidiaries
by year's end, including those located in New York and Hong Kong,
the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Japan's largest daily said an
official announcement was expected as soon as later Friday.
	   A Nikko spokesman said he was unaware any such decision had been
made.
	   The report comes as just the latest signal of a full-scale
retreat from overseas markets by recession-hit Japanese financial
institutions.
	   Other firms which have announced plans to close their foreign
branches include Mitsui Trust and Banking Co., Daiwa Bank Ltd. and
the recently nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   Travelers Group Inc., which later merged with Citicorp to create
Citigroup, stunned Japan's financial industry earlier this year
when it bought a 25 percent stake in Nikko Securities, the
country's third-largest broker, for dlrs 1.6 billion.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia wants the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend agreed production cuts
through the end of next year, the country's energy minister said
Friday.
	   Speaking to reporters, Kuntoro Mangusubroto said Indonesia,
Asia's only OPEC member, doesn't see the need for further
production cuts before then.
	   ``Indonesia prefers to roll over the existing system rather than
opt for new cuts,'' Kuntoro said.
	   The minister was speaking ahead of next week's OPEC ministerial
meeting Nov. 25 in Vienna.
	   OPEC has been factionally split in the last few months between
proponents of another round of production cuts to boost flagging
oil prices and those who simply want to extend the duration of
existing cuts another six months through the end of 1999.
	   Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico, two members of the troika which
initiated the 3.1 million barrels a day of OPEC and non-OPEC output
cuts earlier this year, have said they won't cut any further.
Venezuela has said it mightn't even support an extension of
existing cuts.
	   The third troika member, Saudi Arabia, has been unwilling to cut
without the other two because of concerns about its U.S. market
share.
	   At its June meeting, Indonesia agreed to cut it production by
100,000 barrels per day to 1.28 million barrels per day. Kuntoro
said the country was sticking to this quota.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's finance minister has said economic
performance in the recession-hit city-state should be better than
expected next year, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``The outlook for 1999 is not as gloomy as we originally
thought,'' Finance Minister Richard Hu was quoted as saying by The
Business Times.
	   Hu said Singapore's falling interest rates, combined with
regional economies beginning to bottom out, had started to take the
pressure off the island republic's vulnerable economy.
	   ``But anything can happen, we don't know,'' he warned.
	   The most recent forecasts from Singapore's economic planners
have estimated slight overall growth this year, but a more
uncertain performance next year.
	   The government has predicted gross domestic product in 1999
somewhere between a one percent contraction and one percent
expansion compared to this year.
	   But on Thursday, Hu pointed to the general easing of credit in
Singapore over the last few months, and said this trend ``seems
likely'' to continue, ``which I think is fortunate for everyone.''
	   The latest round of rate cuts has led to a prime rate at major
banks of around 6 percent, down 1.5 percentage points since
mid-September. Analysts expect prime rates to slide below 5 percent
by the middle of next year.

Israel begins troop pullback in West Bank

and Palestinian officers, prisoner releases starting &QL;

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops withdrew without ceremony
from parts of the northern West Bank on Friday, a day after Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet narrowly approved
stage one of the new Mideast peace accord.
	   The pullback will give Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full or
partial control of an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, or
510 square kilometers (204 square miles) and take him a step closer
to his final goal _ statehood.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by erstwhile hawkish allies who oppose
land concessions and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu
reportedly is considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy
heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The pullback began quietly and without ceremony.
	   Israeli army trucks loaded with 130 black-and-yellow border
markers left the Dotan army base south of the Palestinian town of
Jenin and drove to road junctions to demarcate the new borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   In nearby Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians, hundreds of
residents lined the main road to await the arrival of Palestinian
police.
	   Khalil Abu Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby
coffee shop, was skeptical about benefits of the redeployment.
``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what
will change?'' he said.
	   The withdrawal had little of the drama of previous withdrawals.
No Israeli army bases were dismantled and thousands of Palestinians
who came under full Palestinian Authority control are already used
to a limited Palestinian police presence in their villages.
	   As part of the Wye River peace agreement, Israel also pledged to
release 750 prisoners, with 250 to be freed in the first stage
Friday. A first busload of prisoners arrived Friday at the Nahal Oz
crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
	   However, Palestinian officials were angry that among those freed
were 150 criminals. The Palestinians had demanded that all of those
released by political activists and security prisoners.
	   ``It's a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' said
Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs. Abdel Razek said he would stay home and
not greet the returnees.
	   In Qabatieh, most residents were more concerned about jailed
relatives than about the arrival of the Palestinian forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed is serving 16 life terms in Israel for
killing suspected Palestinian collaborators. ``What is the meaning
of peace? It is the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the
land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint
jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had a difficult time keeping his hard-line allies on
board.
	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   The vote was even narrower than the Cabinet's slim approval of
the overall peace accord last week, which had eight ministers
voting in favor.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.
	   In his newspaper article Friday, Mordechai appealed to the
government's critics. ``We knew that there is apparently no other
way than compromise and accommodation with the Palestinians in
order to avoid confrontation,'' he wrote.
	   However, Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused the
government of approving ``an act of desperation.''
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Domb wrote in Yediot.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said Friday that North
Korea discussed ``completely unacceptable'' conditions for
inspecting a large underground facility suspected of being used to
construct nuclear weapons.
	   North Korea has asked the United States to pay $300 million for
the right to inspect the site, a senior U.S. official said in
Washington on Thursday.
	   Clinton did not describe the offer but said at a news conference
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, ``It is true that when I
sent a team into North Korea to talk about inspecting sites, there
were some discussion of conditions that were completely
unacceptable for such inspections.''
	   Clinton said he is concerned by some news reports out of North
Korea, saying they present ``disturbing signs.''

	   ``No one can be absolutely sure whether the North Korean
position is simply a product of economic difficulties, so they're
attempting to get more money out of various countries for doing
what they ought to be doing anyway, or whether they really are
moving toward a more hostile posture,'' he said.
	   Clinton has asked former Defense Secretary William Perry to
review U.S. policy toward North Korea. He said he expects Perry to
report back to the White House and Congress soon.
	   ``I still believe we are doing the right thing to pursue the
agreed framework,'' Clinton said, referring to an agreement by the
United States, Japan and Korea to provide Korea with nuclear power
plants in exchange for its abandoning any nuclear weapons program.
	   Obuchi said the recent firing of a North Korean missile over
Japan ``was a very shocking experience for us'' and there are
doubts about the underground facility under construction north of
Pyongyang.
	   ``We are looking forward to the surveys and investigations that
will be conducted by the United States at the underground nuclear
facilities that the North Koreans have,'' he said.
	   North Korean officials made the unusual request for payment as
compensation for inspections during 12 hours of talks with U.S.
officials who were in the communist country for talks this week.
They rejected the proposal.
	   The $300 million figure was first reported by a South Korean
news agency. It was confirmed by a senior official here who asked
not to be quoted by name.
	   Without discussing specific numbers, State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin earlier called the North Korean demand for
compensation ``ridiculous.''
	   The administration says a North Korean effort to develop nuclear
weapons would be a violation of a 1994 U.S.-North Korean agreement.
	   ``We're not going to pay compensation to confirm that they are
living up to their obligations under this important nuclear
agreement,'' Rubin said.

Japanese fair trade watchdog issues warning to Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS lead; UPDATES thruout with comments from Microsoft
lawyer, details and background; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ruled that
Microsoft Corp. violated the country's anti-monopoly laws by
promoting software in a way that put competitors at a disadvantage,
the commission said Friday.
	   The trade watchdog issued a warning to Microsoft and its
Japanese subsidiary against engaging in unfair business practices
following an investigation, which began in January when officials
raided the company's Tokyo offices.
	   The admonition came as the Redmond, Washington-based software
giant faces anti-trust allegations in a high-profile case in the
United States.
	   The trade commission said Microsoft attempted to unfairly
restrict competitors' access to the market by bundling
pre-installed word-processing and spreadsheet software, said FTC
spokesman Kanichiro Nakanishi.
	   Microsoft officials in Tokyo were unavailable for immediate
comment.
	   But a Microsoft lawyer said the commission's action was only
targeted at old contracts. He also noted the FTC decided not to
pursue allegations involving access to the market for Internet
services.
	   Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at
Microsoft's headquarters, said the ruling in a way was positive for
the company because the Japanese FTC dropped the Internet browser
issue _ which is central to the U.S. Justice Department's case
against Microsoft.
	   ``It's certainly ironic that the Japanese government has dropped
all of the browser allegations, but our own government is
continuing its attack on one of America's leading exporters,''
Smith said.
	   The Japanese ruling has no bearing on the U.S. case, in which
the Justice Department and 20 states contend Microsoft has used its
dominance in PC operating systems to quash competition.
	   Microsoft had contracts in Japan whereby companies offering
Internet access were promoted via a list linked to its Windows
software. In return, these service providers had agreed to promote
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
	   Those contracts were criticized for being exclusionary, and
Microsoft modified them earlier this year, the Microsoft lawyer
said.
	   In January, agents from the commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo
offices, confiscating information about Microsoft's Windows
operating system and Internet Explorer browser software. It also
collected information about Microsoft's word processing program
Word and spreadsheet Excel.
	   If Microsoft were to formally contest the finding announced on
Friday, the government trade commission could take legal action
against the company, the FTC spokesman said.
	   Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the basic
functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.

Cyprus to charge Two Israelis with spying, officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean
island on suspicion of spying would be formally charged with spying
for a foreign country when they appear in court later Friday in
this southern coastal town, court officials said.
	   Speaking under customary anonymity, the officials said the two
would also face a separate charge of illegally possessing wireless
equipment for use in espionage work.
	   Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were arrested Nov. 6 in the
coastal fishing village of Ziyi. Police found surveillance
equipment and recording devices in the apartment the two men had
rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman paid the first ever visit to the island by an Israeli head
of state.
	   The two men were brought to Larnaca from the capital Nicosia,
where they are held, in two separate cars. Their hands cuffed
behind their backs, they were guarded by armed members of the
Police anti-terrorist squad.
	   Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the
courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
	   The spying charge, according to the court officials, states that
the two men collected information linked to the defense of Cyprus
and transmitted this to a ``foreign state'' through a computer.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was widely interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the
two worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' said the
statement, which followed a meeting between Netanyahu and the
Cypriot ambassador in Israel.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides told Weizman in Nicosia
earlier this month that his government was concerned by the growing
military ties between Israel and Turkey.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
also the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served
as one of the main theaters of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games
last month.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops withdrew without ceremony
from parts of the northern West Bank on Friday, a day after Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet narrowly approved
stage one of the new Mideast peace accord.
	   The pullback will give Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full or
partial control of an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, or
510 square kilometers (204 square miles) and take him a step closer
to his final goal _ statehood.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by allies who oppose land concessions
and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu reportedly is
considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy
heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The pullback began quietly.
	   Israeli army trucks loaded with 130 black-and-yellow border
markers left the Dotan army base south of the Palestinian town of
Jenin and drove to road junctions to demarcate the new borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   In nearby Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians, hundreds of
residents lined the main road to wait for Palestinian police.
	   Khalil Abu Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby
coffee shop, was skeptical about benefits of the redeployment.
``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what
will change?'' he said.
	   As part of the Wye River peace agreement, Israel also pledged to
release 750 prisoners, with 250 to be freed in the first stage
Friday. A first busload of prisoners arrived Friday at the Nahal Oz
crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
	   In Qabatieh, most residents were more concerned about jailed
relatives than about arriving Palestinian forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed is serving 16 life terms in Israel for
killing suspected Palestinian collaborators. ``What is the meaning
of peace? It is the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had a difficult time keeping his hard-line allies on
board.
	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.

stage one of the new Mideast peace accord.
	   The pullback will give Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full or

	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy

Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The pullback began quietly and without ceremony.
	   Several hours into the withdrawal, Israeli officials said there
was a last-minute holdup over maps. Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan said Israel had made several changes in the redeployment
plan, but that the quantity of land handed over was the same.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the pullback process was
being halted. Israel's army commander in the West Bank, Maj. Gen.
Moshe Yaalon, and a senior Palestinian commander, Brig. Gen. Ismail
Jaber, flew by helicopter to the West Bank town of Hebron to show
the maps to Arafat.

Two more complaints against Pinochet on behalf of French victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two more complaints been filed in a French court
against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on charges he is
responsible for the disappearances of two French citizens.
	   The new complaints bring to five the number of cases filed in
France against Pinochet. He was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a
Spanish extradition warrant citing charges of genocide, torture and
kidnapping following the coup d'etat that toppled Salvador Allende
in 1973.
	   The families of Yves Alain Domergue, who was kidnapped,
sequestered and disappeared Sept. 20, 1976, and Gabriel
Longueville, who was kidnapped tortured and killed on July 18,
1976, were filed in a Paris court Wednesday. The move was made
public Thursday.
	   French authorities on Nov. 12 officially asked Britain to
extradite Pinochet so he can face charges related to the
disappearance of French citizens.
	   A report by Chile's government says about 3,000 people were
killed or disappeared at the hands of secret police under Pinochet,
who took power in 1973 after ousting Allende.
	   Britain's highest court will announce Nov. 25 whether Pinochet
has immunity from arrest and can leave Britain.

Protection beefed up for U.S. envoy to Thailand

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have increased protection
around U.S. Ambassador William Itoh following the closure of the
American Embassy in Bangkok for three days over security concerns,
authorities said Friday.
	   The police contingent at the embassy had been reinforced, and
plainclothes police added, said a police spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Ambassador Itoh was visiting northeastern
Thailand, he said.
	   An embassy statement issued late Thursday night said that in
response to a Nov. 12 State Department ``worldwide caution''
against potential terrorist acts directed against American
interests, the embassy would be closed from Friday through Sunday.
	   An embassy spokesman declined Thursday to say whether there was
a specific threat against the embassy. The decision to close the
Bangkok mission was a local initiative and not a worldwide
directive, said the spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The State Department warning mentioned possible retaliatory
actions related to tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections, the August bombings of U.S embassies in East Africa
and the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, and the arrests
of suspects in the embassy bombings.
	   A political gossip column in Thursday's edition of the Bangkok
Post claimed that U.S. authorities had alerted their Thai
counterparts of the presence of ``three known Arab terrorists''
operating separately in Thailand for the past three months.
	   No one has confirmed the report.
	   In July, six Pakistanis suspected of terrorist links were
arrested in Bangkok in a joint operation by Thai police and the
FBI. They were not charged with any crimes, and were deported.
	   The Thai television station ITV on Friday reported that the U.S.
Consulate in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai has closed after
receiving anonymous bomb threats by telephone. Additional policemen
had been stationed there, the report said.

Kotonishiki keeps sole lead by beating Takanohana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Kotonishiki kept the sole lead at 12-1 by sending out yokozuna
(grand champion) Takanohana on Friday with two days left in the
15-day Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   No. 9 maegashira Tosanoumi stayed one victory behind Kotonishiki
at 11-2 by driving out yokozuna Wakanohana.
	   Takanohana and Hawaii-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru now are
10-3.
	   In the day's final bout at the Fukuoka Kokusai Center,
Kotonishiki bulldozed out Takanohana, who is seeking his 21st
tournament title and third in a row.
	   Tosanoumi drove out Wakanohana after fighting off Wakanohana's
attempt to twist him down at the ring's edge.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, charged No. 5 maegashira
Akinoshima with hand thrusts and pulled him down, leaving
Akinoshima at 7-6.
	   In other major bouts, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai
sent out ozeki Takanonami, who tried to pull him down. Chiyotaikai
is 9-4 and Takanonami 8-5.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, sent
out No. 15 maegashira Oikari from behind for his seventh victory
against six defeats. Oikari is 5-8.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was thrown out by No. 6-ranked Daizen (7-6) for his eighth defeat
against five victories.
	   Kyokutenho may be demoted from the present ranking before the
next tournament in January because of failing to win the majority
of his bouts.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
was sent out by No. 8-ranked Otsukasa, leaving both wrestlers at
6-7.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 5-ranked Hoshiandesu
(2-5), or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, was pushed out by No.
14-ranked Hokutoriki.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko (5-2), or Brazilian Luis go Ikemori, sent out No. 17-ranked
Tenichi.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Duma condemns Kalmyk call for autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of Russia's parliament on Friday
condemned a southern regional leader's call for greater autonomy
from Moscow.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, 36, the president of Kalmykia, said Tuesday
on Russian television that the federal government had failed to
deliver subsidies to his republic and that he would push for
secession.
	   Later in the week, he backpedaled, saying he did not mean a
political secession but was using the term loosely in an attempt to
draw attention to the region's economic woes.
	   Still, the response to Ilyumzhinov's call has been furious. On
Friday, by a vote of 355 to one, with one abstention, the State
Duma adopted a statement calling Ilyumzhinov's move
``provocative,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Duma called on President Boris Yeltsin and the government to
take measures to ``suppress anti-constitutional acts that create
the threat of spreading separatism in Russia.''
	   Earlier Friday, the liberal Yabloko party called on the Russian
government to impose a state of emergency in the republic, Interfax
reported. It said the state of emergency should be lifted only
after the rule of the Russian constitution was restored in
Kalmykia.

started. For just a little while, everybody could dream they were
somewhere else.
	   For thousands of Pristina's young people caught in a life of
ethnic divisions and fear, the concert of a popular Bosnian singer
Thursday evening was a rare opportunity to relax and forget.
	   ``This is a special event, a change, a rare chance to gather and
have fun,'' said 16-year-old Sandra Cosic, smiling as her eyes
scanned the packed hall of the Pristina sports center.
	   ``It's been a while since anybody famous came here to play for
us,'' added Milan Dobricevic, 19. ``I've never seen so many people
in one place.''
	   The popularity of Zdravko Colic, a Sarajevan singer, dates back
to the 1970s when his records sold widely throughout former
Yugoslavia. When the war started in Bosnia in 1992, Colic stopped
singing and left Sarajevo. This tour is his first since then.
	   With their hands high in the air, swinging, dancing, laughing,
thousands of happy teenagers living in this drab provincial capital
seemed to forget the reality around them - the sporadic clashes,
hundreds of dead and thousands of homeless, devastated countryside,
uncertain future.
	   Although Pristina hasn't directly experienced the conflict
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, the
tensions are present, bringing fear and depriving young people of
what should be a care-free time in their lives.
	   ``We are all aware what the situation is like, but there are a
lot of us young people in Pristina and more such events should be
organized,'' Dobricevic said.
	   Still, even Colic's music, which in the past was loved by all
ethnic groups in former Yugoslavia, seemed unable to bridge the
divisions.
	   The concert audience was overwhelmingly Serb, with only a few
Albanians. Asked about Albanian youths, the young Serbs said there
might be some in the crowd but certainly not many.
	   Why?
	   ``We have our cafes, they have theirs, we don't go to schools
together, we just don't mix,'' explained Janko Joksic, 20.
	   When Serbia deprived majority ethnic Albanians of their
self-rule in 1989, the two communities moved to two separate worlds
that rarely overlap. Teenagers brought up in such a society rarely
break the rule.
	   ``I didn't pay attention whether they are here or not,'' said a
high school student who identified himself only as Marko. ``Only
those who go out and are friends with the Serbs are here now.''
	   They are few.
	   A young boy standing in the group of young Serbs said he was an
ethnic Albanian who came to see the concert with his Serb friends.
But he refused to give his name. Asked about other
fellow-Albanians, he only smiled.

Paper: Cyprus watched suspected spies from the start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to
the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a
Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
	   Haaretz, citing a Cypriot source, said the two Israelis now in
police custody in Nicosia were under surveillance during a previous
visit to Cyprus in mid-October, but were allowed to leave because
of a lack of incriminating evidence.
	   On their next trip in early November, Cyprus monitored the two
Israelis as soon as they arrived at Larnaca airport on forged
passports, the paper said.
	   The surveillance led to their Nov. 6 arrest in the coastal
fishing village of Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and
recording devices in their rented apartment.
	   Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said the two had been
telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters
is in Tel Aviv'' shortly before the arrest, Haaretz said.
	   Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of
Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
	   Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an
intelligence operation near Ziyi.
	   A statement released this week by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's office was interpreted by Israeli media as a
confirmation that two worked for Israel's Mossad. There was no
indication from the statement that the two men could have worked
independently of the government.
	   Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men
in custody are Mossad agents. Israel's Foreign Ministry has said
only that reports that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey were
not true. A ministry statement added that the two were not acting
against Cyprus, but gave no further explanation.
	   The source cited by Haaretz said that the two men refuse to
cooperate with interrogators.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974,
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.

Report UEFA to bring youth tourney back to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ UEFA has reinstated the European Under-18
Championships qualifying tournament in Israel, one week after the
Gulf crisis prompted its cancelation last week, the Jerusalem Post
reported Friday.
	   UEFA told the Israel Football Association on Thursday that
tensions surrounding the Iraq crisis had diminished enough to hold
the tournament in Israel, the paper reported.
	   The English, Israeli, Andorran and Spanish teams will coordinate
new dates for the week-long tournament, the paper reported.
	   The finals are scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer.
	   UEFA canceled the events last Thursday after the English team
said it would not attend because of the tense situation in the
Gulf.
	   The threat of U.S. military action against Iraq was averted
Sunday when President Clinton accepted the Iraqi government's
pledge to lift its three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israeli cities.

Prince Charles to make a formal complaint about newspaper story on
</HEADLINE>
Harry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles plans to make a formal complaint
against a tabloid newspaper that refused to apologize for breaking
the story about a minor sports injury Prince Harry suffered at
school, his office said Friday.
	   ``The Prince of Wales has asked me to say that he is deeply
disappointed by the reaction of the editor of the Daily Mirror to
the simple and straightforward appeal for Prince Harry to be
allowed privacy at school,'' said the prince's spokeswoman,
speaking with customary anonymity.
	   She said Charles, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, would
make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, the
industry's self-regulatory body.
	   A letter from Charles' office, published by The Mirror on
Friday, revealed that the injury which occupied the front page of
the paper for two days straight, plus pages 6 and 7 on Friday, was
an incident of ``very minor bruising .''
	   The feud between Charles and the tabloid the Mirror began
Thursday when the newspaper ran a front-page editorial under the
headline ``Harry's had an accident'' that reproduced a palace
letter about the incident, with the details of the injury blacked
out at the insistence of Charles' office.
	   The palace letter said that Charles refused to give permission
to the media to publicize Harry's sport accident, claiming that
coverage was not in the public interest.
	   The tabloid reported that the accident was nothing serious.
``But we believe you are entitled to know if an heir to the throne
is involved in accident, however small, if it results in an
injury,'' it said in an editorial.
	   Charles' office demanded an apology on Thursday.
	   The Mirror remained defiant Friday, declaring in large type on
the front page, ``Sorry .. but we are unable to apologize for
something we weren't allowed to publish.''
	   Mirror editor Piers Morgan said the request from Charles' office
was ``a thinly disguised attempt to bully and censor the press.''
	   Since the death of Princess Diana in a car crash last year, the
media has generally kept to its promise to respect the privacy of
her two sons, Harry, 14, and Prince William, 16.

Children demand that politicians stop child labor
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 children demonstrated in
the Indian capital on Friday, calling on politicians running in
upcoming local elections to support their campaign against child
labor.
	   The children, aged four to 14, formed a human chain at a busy
intersection and distributed pamphlets to motorists and passersby
urging them to pressure politicians to eliminate child labor from
the state of New Delhi.
	   New Delhi has about half a million child laborers, said Kailash
Satyarthi, whose South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude organized
the demonstration. Among those marching were children the coalition
had rescued from jobs as maids and dishwashers in conditions near
slavery.
	   The voting next week in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh
and Mizoram and in New Delhi, which is governed as its own state,
is being projected by the opposition as a referendum on the
performance of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
eight-month-old government. If his Bharatiya Janata Party makes a
poor showing, other parties in his 19-member coalition may abandon
him.
	   Satyarthi's group and four other development organizations
jumped into the fray, urging voters to elect only those candidates
who sign a petition pledging to eliminate child labor and promising
free and compulsory primary education.
	   In New Delhi, 95 contestants from various political parties have
signed the petition and 18 declined, said Satyarthi. A similar
campaign has been launched in the three other states.
	   Last month, a position paper released jointly by 16 U.N. offices
in New Delhi said India had the largest number of child workers in
the world, with estimates by voluntary agencies ranging between 40
million and 100 million.
	   Many children work in agriculture, the carpet, brick- and
firework-making industries, stitching footballs, restaurants and
child prostitution.

Japanese fair trade watchdog issues warning to Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES 5th-7th grafs with company comments.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ruled that
Microsoft Corp. violated the country's anti-monopoly laws by
promoting software in a way that put competitors at a disadvantage,
the commission said Friday.
	   The trade watchdog issued a warning to Microsoft and its
Japanese subsidiary against engaging in unfair business practices
following an investigation, which began in January when officials
raided the company's Tokyo offices.
	   The admonition came as the Redmond, Washington-based software
giant faces anti-trust allegations in a high-profile case in the
United States.
	   The trade commission said Microsoft attempted to unfairly
restrict competitors' access to the market by bundling
pre-installed word-processing and spreadsheet software, said FTC
spokesman Kanichiro Nakanishi.
	   Microsoft Co., the wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of Microsoft
Corp., issued a statement in Tokyo late Friday saying it had
already voluntarily stopped the practices cited by the FTC and did
not anticipate having to make any additional changes in its
marketing activities in Japan.
	   Makoto Naruke, the president of Microsoft Co., said in the
statement that he welcomed the conclusion of the FTC's
investigation and was confident that his company had acted in
accordance with the law.
	   A company official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Microsoft does not plan to formally protest the ruling, but that
the company does not believe it violated any laws.
	   Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at
Microsoft's headquarters, said the ruling in a way was positive for
the company because the Japanese FTC decided not to pursue separate
allegations involving dominance over Internet services. Similar
allegations are central to the U.S. Justice Department's case
against Microsoft.
	   ``It's certainly ironic that the Japanese government has dropped
all of the browser allegations, but our own government is
continuing its attack on one of America's leading exporters,''
Smith said.
	   The Japanese ruling has no bearing on the U.S. case, in which
the Justice Department and 20 states contend Microsoft has used its
dominance in PC operating systems to quash competition.
	   Microsoft had contracts in Japan whereby companies offering
Internet access were promoted via a list linked to its Windows
software. In return, these service providers had agreed to promote
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
	   Those contracts were criticized for being exclusionary, and
Microsoft modified them earlier this year, the Microsoft lawyer
said.
	   In January, agents from the commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo
offices, confiscating information about Microsoft's Windows
operating system and Internet Explorer browser software. It also
collected information about Microsoft's word processing program
Word and spreadsheet Excel.
	   Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the basic
functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.

Singapore's latest trade figures look bleak as economy continues to

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Slumping demand pushed Singapore's non-oil
exports _ a barometer of the country's trade-driven economy _ down
4.8 percent in October from a year earlier, the government said
Friday.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, including crucial electronics
products, dropped to 8.01 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.93
billion), said Singapore's Trade Development Board, well below
analysts' forecasts.
	   ``The depressed global demand conditions for electronic and
related products, as well as fallen demand from Asian economies hit
by the financial crisis, continued to take its toll on Singapore's
external trade,'' said TDB, which is part of the Ministry of Trade
and Industry.
	   The slump hits Singapore as it is slipping into a technical
recession.
	   A vital component of Singapore's non-oil exports is electronics,
which plunged 6.2 percent in October compared to the same period
last year. Electronics are the country's biggest export item,
totaling nearly 70 percent of exports.
	   Low prices and an over-capacity of printed circuit boards,
integrated circuits, personal computers and printers were the
primary culprits in the sector's poor performance.
	   In September, Singapore's total non-oil domestic exports rose
1.7 percent from a year earlier, while electronics exports shrank
1.2 percent.
	   Meanwhile, oil exports in October plunged 21 percent from a year
before, after a 12.8 percent fall in September. Government
economists attributed the fall to depressed oil prices and weak
demand from major Asian markets.

China's army, police to give up businesses by year's end: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The vast business empires owned by China's
military and law enforcement agencies will be handed over to
civilians by the end of the year, the official newspaper China
Daily reported Friday.
	   Control of military businesses was being transferred to the
State Economic and Trade Commission, which would coordinate
restructuring of the enterprises, the report said.
	   It contradicted earlier comments by officials and analysts who
said they believed the process, if carried out, could not be
completed so quickly.
	   Beginning next year, the commission would reorganize, merge or
close down poorly managed companies, the report added.
	   In July, President Jiang Zemin ordered China's military to get
out of business to help curb its involvement in rampant corruption
and smuggling.
	   So far little seems to have been done. The military is
reportedly resisting efforts to wrest away the factories, hotels
and other businesses it has grown to depend on for much of its
livelihood.
	   PLA businesses fund an estimated one-third of the military's
operating expenses and are a pervasive force in China's commercial
life, from cellular phone networks to karaoke halls.
	   PLA morale is already sagging as bankrupt military businesses
lay off employees, including many officers' wives. The intricate
military-industrial complex also includes many firms that were once
PLA factories but are now ostensibly supervised by the State
Council, China's Cabinet.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
lower on profit-taking Friday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 79.94 points, or 0.8 percent, closing at 10,233.36. On
Thursday, the index had gained 99.88 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 8.46 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.08 billion), up from Thursday's 7.14 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 915 million).
	   Brokers said investors took profits following recent gains in
share prices, discounting an expected cut in local interest rates.
	   After the market closed, leading Hong Kong banks announced that
they were cutting their prime lending rates by 0.25 percentage
point to 9.50.
	   Brokers said the cut in local interest rates was expected after
U.S. interest rates were reduced on Tuesday.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.75 Hong Kong
dollars to 55.50, and Cheung Kong fell 1.50 dollars to 57.25.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 5.00 dollars to
186.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.00 dollar to 67.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.25 dollars to 55.25, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 50 cents to 35.00.

Boy showing signs of beating dies after military detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy who had been detained
by security officials in Indian-held Kashmir died Friday and his
body showed signs of a severe beating, a doctor said.
	   The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Shafat
Ahmad Rather was brought unconscious and badly bruised to Srinagar
Hospital by police Thursday. Relatives of the boy said had been
detained for questioning last week by military troops.
	   A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the boy had been held but said he was handed over to
police Thursday in ``good condition.'' He would not comment
further.
	   The death sparked a peaceful protest by about 1,000 people in
Srinagar Friday.
	   Troops sent to Kashmir to quell a militant Muslim uprising are
often accused of torturing detainees and of other human rights
abuses.
	   Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 in Kashmir,
saying predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state
should be independent or part of neighboring, officially Islamic
Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency, but
Pakistan says it lends the militants only moral support.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. Both claim all
of the Himalayan territory, which is divided between them.

Delon's wife, Rosalie, was quoted Friday as telling the Geneva
daily Le Temps.
	   Five-year-old Pouki, a Hungarian puli described as having ``Bob
Marley dreadlocks,'' went missing from the house in suburban Thonex
on Monday, according to notices posted in Geneva by Mrs. Delon.
	   She said the medium-sized black dog was a present to her on the
birth of her son, Alain-Fabien, four years ago. He and his sister
Anoushka, 8, miss the dog very much, said Mrs. Delon.
	   Heartthrob actor Delon, now 63, was the star of numerous films,
including ``Is Paris Burning?,'' ``Girl on a Motorcycle'' and
``Rocco and his Brothers.''
	   Earlier this week he lost a bid in France to block publication
of a biography which alleges links between him and shady
politicians, mob figures and mercenaries.

Report UEFA to bring youth tourney back to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ UEFA has reinstated the European Under-18
Championships qualifying tournament in Israel, one week after the
Gulf crisis prompted its cancelation last week, the Jerusalem Post
reported Friday.
	   UEFA told the Israel Football Association on Thursday that
tensions surrounding the Iraq crisis had diminished enough to hold
the tournament in Israel, the paper reported.
	   The English, Israeli, Andorran and Spanish teams will coordinate
new dates for the week-long tournament, the paper reported.
	   The finals are scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer.
	   UEFA canceled the events last Thursday after the English team
said it would not attend because of the tense situation in the
Gulf.
	   The threat of U.S. military action against Iraq was averted
Sunday when President Clinton accepted the Iraqi government's
pledge to lift its three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israeli cities.

Mayfield fastest in practice for Sunday's NASCAR race

	   MOTEGI, Japan (AP) _ Jeremy Mayfield was fastest Friday in
practice for the upcoming dlrs 1 million NASCAR Thunder Special
Coca-Cola 500, a season-ending exhibition race at the 1.5-mile Twin
Ring Motegi.
	   Mayfield, driving a Ford Taurus, marked the day's fastest lap of
35.692 seconds, followed by 35.817 seconds posted by Mike Skinner
circling the oval racetrack in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
	   Finishing third was Jeff Burton, whose best time was 35.911
seconds. He drove a Taurus.
	   Jeff Gorden, at age 27 the youngest racer to win three Winston
Cup championships, finished sixth in 36.011 seconds on a Monte
Carlo.
	   The field of 31 in Sunday's competition includes 14 Winston Cup
stars, 11 Winston Cup West competitors, four Japanese drivers and
one each from the Busch Grand National and the Craftsman Truck
Series.
	   Last year, Gorden canceled his trip to the 1.54-mile Suzuka
Circuitland due to sickness. The race at Suzuka was a second-year
event in a three-year contract that NASCAR has with the Japanese in
promoting the race worldwide.
	   Skinner, winner at Suzuka last year, leads a number of drivers
taking part for the second straight year. They include Michael
Waltrip, Kenny Wallace, Butch Gilliland, Scott Gaylord, Ron
Hornaday and Bobby Hamilton.
	   Wallace has an ace in the hole like he did last year, when he
drove his red, white and blue Monte Carlo to a seventh place
finish. He has had a unique preparation _ that is, interactive
video games.
	   ``I got ready for last year's race by competing on the Suzuka
track in the NASCAR 98 game from EA Sports,'' said Wallace.
``Before last year, I'd never had the opportunity to come to Japan
and race for real, so I did the next best thing by racing at Suzuka
in the video game. The track in the game was identical to the real
one in Japan, so it actually helped in my preparation.''
	   Among the racers are Dale Earnhardt, 47, ranked eighth in the
Winston Cup, and his son Dale Earnhardt Jr., 24, top-ranked in the
Busch Grand national.
	   For the first time ever, the father and the son will compete in
the same event.
	   ``When I was a little kid watching my father race, I sat there
and told myself I wish I would have a chance to race against him.
And that's why this means something different, special and
important,'' said the junior.
	   His father says it's exciting to enter the race with his son for
the first time.
	   ``I remember the first time I rode in a race car with my dad
(Ralph) and remember the first time I watched him race and also the
first time I raced against him on the same track. I won't really
call it a race. I could hardly keep up with him.''
	   The father had an eighth-fastest time of 36.064 seconds and the
son was next in 36.277 seconds. Both drove Chevrolet Monte Carlo
cars and they had no side-by-side races between them.
	   The event will include practice and qualifying Saturday and a
201-lap race Sunday.
	   The race Sunday offers a top prize of dlrs 105,000.

Television management shakeup stirs up censorship concerns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A real-life soap opera unfolded this week at
Hong Kong's second-biggest television station when a 9-year veteran
resigned and a property developer was appointed to replace him.
	   Feng Xaioping has little experience with broadcasting and his
extensive ties to mainland China have stirred concerns about
self-censorship at Asian Television Ltd.
	   Feng is the station's majority shareholder, but his move into
the chief executive's office capped a bizarre management succession
that began last year when ATV's then-chairman, Hong Kong
businessman Lim Por-yen, was detained in Taiwan on corruption
charges.
	   Kenneth Kwok resigned as acting chief executive Tuesday and ATV
appointed Feng to succeed him the next day. Feng is also executive
director of Crossprofit Development Ltd., a real estate company
with projects in China.
	   Staff at ATV have been left in the dark on why Kwok resigned _
he only cited ``personal reasons'' at a press conference on his
departure.
	   Kwok's resignation is also seen as the major reason behind chief
operating officer Bruno Wu's decision to step down. Although Wu's
departure has not been formally announced, he will only stay at the
station for another six months, ATV said.
	   Wu, a Chinese American who came to ATV only this year, had been
seen as someone who could pull the station out of its position as
Hong Kong's perennial second-place terrestrial network behind
Television Broadcasts in the words of one industry publication,
ASIAcom.
	   But some staff expressed concern that Feng could impose
censorship on coverage of sensitive mainland Chinese affairs, while
others were concerned about getting their year-end bonuses.
	   ATV denied that there would be any changes to broadcasting as a
result of the management shuffle.
	   When Hong Kong reverted to China from Britain last year, there
were widespread concerns about censorship or self-censorship in the
territory's free press, but media have continued to aggressively
report on sensitive issues, including corruption and social unrest
in China.
	   Appointing someone with little journalism background and strong
ties to the mainland aroused concerns over the editorial
independence of ATV, said Eric Ma, assistant professor of
journalism at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
	   The latest management shakeup is one of several recent hurdles
facing the station since the arrest of Lim, who was chairman of ATV
at the time but now has been given the title of honorary chairman.
	   Lim, also chairman of Hong Kong property developer Lai Sun
Development Co. Ltd., is not allowed to leave Taiwan, where he was
indicted in March on charges of paying 55.7 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 7 million) in bribes to a Taipei County official
to help Lim's Taiwan-registered company in a government land deal.
	   Kwok was appointed acting chief executive when Lim got into
trouble.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israel began withdrawing troops in the
West Bank on Friday, but the handover was held up after several
hours because the Palestinians raised questions about last-minute
Israeli changes in the redeployment map.
	   Once completed, the pullback would give Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat full or partial control of an additional 9.1 percent
of the West Bank, or 510 square kilometers (204 square miles) and
take him a step closer to his final goal _ statehood.

Cambodian opposition leader still fears arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Worried that party colleagues still
face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought
further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by
strongman Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he
was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly
on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurances were not
strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrested
upon their return to Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all
politicians' safety and their right to conduct political activities
``in accordance with the laws in force.''
	   Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's statement ``full of
loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining a promise
from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were free
from prosecution for their political activities during and after
last July's election.
	   Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was forced to take
refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen
accused him of being behind a plot against his life.
	   The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street
demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election. The opposition,
alleging widespread fraud and intimidation, refused to accept the
results of the polls.
	   Fearing for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince
Norodom Ranariddh led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of
Cambodia after parliament was ceremonially opened in late
September.
	   Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC party finished a close second in the
election, returned last week and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form
a coalition government. The agreement will make Hun Sen prime
minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
	   The two parties have formed three working groups to hammer out
details of the agreement, including the establishment of a Senate
to be the upper house of parliament.
	   Sok An, representing Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one
working group had completed its work on a joint political platform
to be implemented by the new government.
	   The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic and
judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying Hun
Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to the
National Assembly.

	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by erstwhile hawkish allies who oppose
land concessions and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu
reportedly is considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy

Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The pullback began quietly and without ceremony Friday morning.
	   About four hours into the withdrawal, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan said the process had been put on hold because the
Palestinians were concerned about last-minute changes introduced by
Israel in the redeployment maps.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with the commander of
Palestinian police and the Israeli troop commander in the West Bank
to review the changes in the maps.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he was hopeful the issue
could be settled before the start of the Jewish Sabbath at sunset
Friday.

Former Yeltsin bodyguard alleges Yeltsin got TV shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's former bodyguard said
Friday that he had received instructions from a controversial
financier to transfer the rights for more than one-quarter of the
shares in Russia's largest television station to Yeltsin, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   A hard-line Communist member of the parliament had alleged on
Wednesday that financier Boris Berezovsky had given the bodyguard,
Alexander Korzhakov, the power of attorney to give 26 percent of
shares in the ORT television station to Yeltsin in 1994. The member
of parliament, Viktor Ilyukhin, called the alleged transfer a
bribe.
	   The station is 51 percent government-owned, with the remainder
held by various private investors, including Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky confirmed Thursday that the shares were transferred,
but said that Korzhakov had forced the transaction.
	   Korzhakov, the former head of the presidential security service
and Yeltsin's confidant for 11 years, was ousted in a Kremlin power
struggle in June 1996.
	   The ORT station has meanwhile been fighting bankruptcy
proceedings against it. On Friday, its noon news broadcast, which
usually runs 15 minutes, was cut to just three minutes because the
company could not prepare video footage, ORT said.
	   Shortly after noon, court marshals announced they were
temporarily ending their attempts to confiscate ORT's company cars
as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The government had appealed
to law enforcement authorities to halt the threatened, forced sale
of the station's assets to pay its multimillion-dollar debt to
government-owned transmitters.
	   ORT officials say they've already cut costs, but that their
biggest source of income, advertising, has shrunk as a result of
the country's economic crisis.

Indonesian lawmakers chide Portuguese effort to extradite Suharto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian legislators on Friday
chided a Portuguese effort to extradite former President Suharto,
describing the proposal as impossible and unreasonable.
	   Portugal's attorney general's office is examining a request from
lawmaker Nuno Correia da Silva that Suharto be extradited for
alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor _ a former
Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said his
office was looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law.
	   Roestandi, a three-star general and chairman of the military
faction at Indonesia's Parliament, said such a handover would be
``impossible.''
	   ``Moreover, it is unreasonable because the East Timor issue is
an internal affair of Indonesia,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's
commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the
proposal.
	   ``The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but
the problem of the nation,'' she said.
	   Suharto, 77, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist from 1966 to last
May when he was forced to quit following a wave of protests and
riots in which 1,200 people died.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island territory in
return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
there.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after
invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal
colonizers left.
	   Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread abuses in East
Timor, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Correia da Silva of Portugal's rightist Popular Party likens the
bid to extradite Suharto with attempts in Britain to extradite
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges
that include genocide.
	   Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision
on whether to extradite him.

Heavy snow forces rerouting of aid convoys

	   PRISTINA, Yuogslavia (AP) _ A heavy overnight snowfall in Kosovo
forced the rerouting of aid convoys Friday amid concerns about
reaching refugees sheltered in remote villages.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees diverted three
aid convoys carrying food, blankets and mattresses, originally
destined for three distribution points west of Pristina, to
Podujevo, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital,
after a snowfall of between 20 and 50 centimeters (20 inches), said
the organization's spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.
	   Although UNHCR says there are no longer any refugees living out
in the open, many are sheltering in the homes of friends and
relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in their destroyed
houses and need aid supplies to survive the winter.
	   ``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain
areas,'' del Mundo said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are
sharing food with displaced people sheltering there. ... Until the
next harvest, they will need support.''
	   Up to 300,000 people in the Serbian province of Kosovo have been
left homeless since government forces cracked down on separatist
Albanian rebels in late February. Hundreds more, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, have been killed.
	   The crackdown ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes.
The separatist guerrillas have grudgingly accepted a cease-fire.
	   UNHCR has been sending out two to three relief convoys six days
a week, with large convoys consisting of about 20 trucks going to
the major distribution points three times a week.
	   From there, the aid is transported to villages, using smaller
vehicles. But heavy snowfall can cause many of the dirt tracks
leading to villages to become impassable.
	   Aid convoys were not the only ones affected by the snow. The
principal ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, failed to appear
at his scheduled news conference on Friday morning due to the bad
weather conditions.
	   The weather bureau forecast continued snowfall until Saturday.

Asian stock markets close sharply higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week sharply
higher Friday, with prices rebounding in Tokyo on hopes that new
stimulus measures such as a possible sales-tax cut will boost the
faltering Japanese economy.
	   In Indonesia, the key index surged 6.5 percent on reports that
the government will set up an investment fund to buy shares in
Indonesian companies and then sell them to ``targeted groups'' at
discounted rates.
	   The move is part of the government's plan to redistribute wealth
in Indonesia. The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite rose 24.533
points to 403.652.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 425.48
points, or 2.96 percent, to close at 14,779.94. On Thursday, the
average lost 244.77 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   Share prices soared after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party sealed a political alliance late Thursday
with the minority Liberal Party, which has pushed hard for a
temporary suspension of the national sales tax.
	   The two parties agreed to a ``radical revision'' of the
unpopular sales tax, which was raised to 5 percent last year from 3
percent, as part of a set of economic relief measures. The tax hike
was widely blamed for tipping the economy back into recession after
a brief spurt of growth.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.16 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 0.48 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, but
slightly above its late New York level of 119.99 yen overnight.
	   In Seoul, the main index surged 2.7 percent in reaction to the
stronger Japanese currency. A stronger yen boosts South Korean
shares because local exporters will gain a price edge against their
Japanese rivals in the global market.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 11.87 points to
452.93, with trading volume rising to a record 242.5 million
shares.
	   Bucking the trend was the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where prices
fell on profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 79.94 points, or 0.8 percent, closing at
10,233.36. On Thursday, the index had gained 99.88 points.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed sharply higher as foreigners
led buying in some blue chip sectors, dealers said. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index rose 13.37 points, or 3.7 percent, to
371.93.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher, fueled by falling
interest rates. The Straits Times Index rose 2.4 percent, or 31.35
points, to close at a six-month high of 1,347.90.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, boosted by overnight gains
on Wall Street. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose
80.19 points, or 1.1 percent, to 7,380.53.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher in subdued
trading. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 6.95 points, or 0.3
percent, to 1,976.23.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, buoyed by rumors, later
denied, that Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. was set to announce its
acquisition of a stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 22.68 points, or
1.2 percent, to 1,841.69.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, supported by a
late spurt in the banking and finance sector. The All Ordinaries
Index rose 23.0 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,703.6.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The
benchmark Composite Index rose 2.98 points, or 0.6 percent, to
461.56.

JENIN: sunset Friday.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``What we want to do is just to insure that Mr. Netanyahu honors
the agreements as they were signed,'' Erekat said in an interview
with the BBC.
	   Erekat also said the Palestinians were also upset that a
majority of the 250 Palestinian prisoners Israel had started
freeing Friday as part of the peace agreement were criminals, not
political activists.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs, said he would not greet the returnees
at the Nahal Oz crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. ``It's
a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' he said.
	   The pullback had begun Friday morning. Israeli army trucks
loaded with 130 red-and-yellow border markers left the Dotan army
base south of the Palestinian town of Jenin and drove to road
junctions to demarcate the new borders between Israeli- and
Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   In nearby Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians, hundreds of
residents lined the main road to await the arrival of Palestinian
police.
	   Khalil Abu Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby
coffee shop, was skeptical about benefits of the redeployment.
``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what
will change?'' he said.
	   The withdrawal had little of the drama of previous withdrawals.
No Israeli army bases were dismantled and thousands of Palestinians
who came under full Palestinian Authority control are already used
to a limited Palestinian police presence in their villages.
	   In Qabatieh, most residents were more concerned about jailed
relatives than about the arrival of the Palestinian forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed is serving 16 life terms in Israel for
killing suspected Palestinian collaborators. ``What is the meaning
of peace? It is the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were being transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of
the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from
joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had a difficult time keeping his hard-line allies on
board.
	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   The vote was even narrower than the Cabinet's slim approval of
the overall peace accord last week, which had eight ministers
voting in favor.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.
	   In his newspaper article Friday, Mordechai appealed to the
government's critics. ``We knew that there is apparently no other
way than compromise and accommodation with the Palestinians in
order to avoid confrontation,'' he wrote.
	   However, Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused the
government of approving ``an act of desperation.''
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Domb wrote in Yediot.

Russia puts first segment of international space station in orbit

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ A Russian Proton booster rocket
carried the first part of the international space station into
orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international
space colonization.
	   Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control
announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket
and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
above the Earth.
	   ``Success,'' shouted one exultant official some 10 minutes after
the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit.
	   The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in
the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5
kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had
prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning
by the highly toxic rocket fuel.
	   Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was ``flawless'' and
the module performed well during initial tests. They cautioned that
much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station
project up and working.
	   ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space
walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual
respect ... the international space station is going to be a
reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after
the launch.
	   His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch was a
vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving
it could play a major role in space operations.
	   ``Today we made a truly epoch-making step to carry out this
project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is
perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the
international space station,'' he said.
	   The launch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the
cloudy sky above the central Asian steppes. The huge roar of the
rocket reverberated for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the
empty plain around the base.
	   The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with
space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to
ensure there were no problems.
	   Solar power panels on the module were successfully deployed
shortly after it reached its first orbit and all systems were
working normally, officials said.
	   The launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed
for more than a year, ushers in a new era of cooperation among
former space-race rivals. Space officials expressed optimism that
cooperation would further promote world stability following the end
of the Cold War.
	   ``We still have some contradictions, we still have combat
missiles aimed at each other, but the predominant trend is the
state of cooperation and doing things together,'' said Yuri
Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched by a
three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve as a
space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing
propulsion, power and communications.
	   Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the
liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under cloudy
skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40
seconds later.
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that
will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment was
postponed repeatedly, mainly because the chronically broke Russian
space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the
station that is to go up later.
	   Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the
American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3
carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to
blast off next July or August.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing
the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having
lost hope of getting promised government funds, the Russian space
agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60
million to complete the segment.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   The vote was even narrower than the Cabinet's slim approval of
the overall peace accord last week, which had eight ministers
voting in favor.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.
	   In his newspaper article Friday, Mordechai appealed to the
government's critics. ``We knew that there is apparently no other
way than compromise and accommodation with the Palestinians in
order to avoid confrontation,'' he wrote.
	   However, Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused the
government of approving ``an act of desperation.''
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Domb wrote in Yediot.

England's Westwood takes two-stroke second round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Lee Westwood of England shot the day's
best score with a four-under-par 67 for a seven-under-par 135 total
and took a two-stroke, second-round lead in the 250 million yen
(dlrs 2 million) Dunlop Phoenix tournament.
	   Westwood, who won the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo masters last week
in Japan, carded five birdies and one bogey on the 6,846-yard,
par-71 Phoenix Country Club course.
	   ``I'm putting well at the moment and driving it OK. It's the bit
in the middle that's lacking,'' said Westwood.
	   ``As soon as I get a long iron in my hand it feels like I'm
going to hit (a poor shot). Some days you play below average and
you have to be professional and get it around in as a few shots as
possible,'' he said.
	   Darren Clarke of England also shot a 67 and moved into seocnd
place from 15th place with a total score of 137 along with two
Japanese, Kaname Yokoo and Ryoken Kawagishi.
	   Kawagishi is seeking his sixth Japan PGA Tour victory overall
and his first since 19	   Kawagishi 95. Yokoo shot 69 and Kawagishi had 71 Friday.
	   Three strokes off the lead at 138 were Brian Watts, David Ishii
and Fred Funk, all of the United States, and Ernie Els of South
Africa. Watts shot 67, Ishii from Hawaii and Funk each had 69 and
Els had 70.
	   Defending champion Tom Watson shot a 73 for a 148 total and tied
60th place with Dinesh Chand of Fiji and three Japanese _ Katsunori
Kuwabara, Nobuo Serizawa and Hirofumi Miyase.
	   ``My iron play was really poor and my putting wasn't very good
either, said the 49-year-old American, winner of eight major
championships.
	   The winner will receive 45 million yen (dlrs 375,000).

JENIN: sunset Friday.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``What we want to do is just to insure that Mr. Netanyahu honors
the agreements as they were signed,'' Erekat said in an interview
with the BBC.
	   Erekat also said the Palestinians were also upset that a
majority of the 250 Palestinian prisoners Israel had started
freeing Friday as part of the peace agreement were criminals, not
political activists.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs, said he would not greet the returnees
at the Nahal Oz crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. ``It's
a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' he said.
	   The pullback had begun Friday morning. Israeli army trucks
loaded with 130 red-and-yellow border markers left the Dotan army
base south of the Palestinian town of Jenin and drove to road
junctions to demarcate the new borders between Israeli- and
Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated.
	   In nearby Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians, hundreds of
residents lined the main road to await the arrival of Palestinian
police.
	   Khalil Abu Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby
coffee shop, was skeptical about benefits of the redeployment.
``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what
will change?'' he said.
	   The withdrawal had little of the drama of previous withdrawals.
No Israeli army bases were dismantled and thousands of Palestinians
who came under full Palestinian Authority control are already used
to a limited Palestinian police presence in their villages.
	   In Qabatieh, most residents were more concerned about jailed
relatives than about the arrival of the Palestinian forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed is serving 16 life terms in Israel for
killing suspected Palestinian collaborators. ``What is the meaning
of peace? It is the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were being transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of
the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from
joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had a difficult time keeping his hard-line allies on
board.
	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.

Hong Kong banks cut deposit rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong cartel that sets commercial
interest rates cut its savings deposit rate by a quarter percentage
point to 4.75 percent on Friday, following the U.S. Federal
Reserve's rate reduction this week.
	   The widely-anticipated decision by the Hong Kong Association of
Banks was followed by matching changes in the prime lending rates
at several big commercial banks.
	   Standard Chartered Bank PLC, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corp., and Bank of China, the territory's three currency-issuing
banks, lowered their best lending rates to 9.5 percent from 9.75
percent, effective Monday. HSBC affiliate Hang Seng Bank Ltd. also
lowered its rate to 9.5 percent.
	   The deposit rate was last changed on Oct. 16, when the
association reduced it by a quarter percentage point to 5.0
percent.
	   The association meets every Friday to discuss possible changes
to the deposit rates.
	   The territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, reduced its discount rate Wednesday in a move to match a
quarter-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Duma passes law guaranteeing Russians' savings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament approved legislation
Friday that would back all individuals' savings deposits in the
country's ailing commercial banks with a full government guarantee.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko immediately dubbed the
legislation ``populist,'' and said it contained ``empty promises.''
	   The revised draft law was passed overwhelmingly by the
Communist-led State Duma, with 362 deputies voting for and only two
against it.
	   The bill had already once been approved by the Duma, but was
rejected by the upper house, the Federation Council. After the
passage of the revised version in the Duma, the bill will go back
to the upper house for a vote.
	   Currently, the government guarantees only savings accounts in
the state-owned savings bank Sberbank, which holds around 80
percent of all household deposits.
	   Gerashchenko told the Duma that the government would need around
85 billion rubles (dlrs 5 billion) to pay private depositors should
they all decide to withdraw their savings from local commercial
banks at the same time.
	   Meanwhile, commercial banks' reserves at the central bank total
just 18 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion), Gerashchenko noted.
	   ``It's pointless to assume that the government has such money,''
Gerashchenko told deputies.
	   ``This law would force the central bank to print money,''
Gerashchenko warned, and said such a policy lead to the
impoverishment of the poorest, such as pensioners.
	   Most Russian commercial banks are on the verge of insolvency as
a consequence of the government's decision in August to default on
its domestic debt and devalue the ruble.

Search called off for two missing U.S. crew members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The search for two crewmen missing in a helicopter
crash off the coast of Sicily has been abandoned, the U.S. Navy
said Friday.
	   The CH-46 helicopter, deployed aboard the USNS Sirius, had been
bringing supplies to the USS Stump in the central Mediterranean
when it went down Thursday.
	   Two crew members were rescued unhurt after the crash, about 30
miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Augusta Bay, on Sicily's eastern
coast.
	   The search for the two other crewmen was called off when
darkness fell Thursday afternoon, said Petty Officer Beverly Allen,
spokeswoman for the 6th Fleet. She said they were awaiting word
from the port of Norfolk, Va., where the Sirius and Stump are
based, to release the names of the crewmen.
	   The Navy said it was still investigating the cause of the
accident.

Juba River floods southern Somalia for second straight year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED ABDI NUR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ For the second straight year, heavy
November rains over southern Somalia have caused the Juba River to
overflow its banks, flooding villages and farmland and destroying
vital food crops, radio reports from the area said Friday.
	   Mohamud Ahmed Gulu, chief of the telecommunications center in
Jilib, 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Mogadishu, said flooding
has displaced hundreds of families who are now on the move to seek
food and water.
	   Elders in Jilib who contacted journalists in Mogadishu by VHF
radio said flood waters have reached the roofs of many villages,
and people are being rescued by local boatowners or make-shift
rafts.
	   Last November, more than 1,300 people drowned, 227,000 were
displaced and thousands were trapped by rising waters that
inundated southern Somalia in the worst flooding since 1961.
	   The Juba, the largest river in Somalia, began to crest at the
beginning of the week.
	   Radio reports say at least 5,000 hectares (12,350 acres) of
farmland are under water, and grain stored in underground
containers has been destroyed.
	   Last year, international aid agencies spent millions of dollars
rescuing people caught by floodwaters in the middle and lower Juba
valley and ferrying in relief food by airplane and boat.
	   So far this year, local authorities have not mentioned
casualties due to the flooding.
	   Somalia has had no central government since 1991 when President
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted, and clan warfare ensued, dividing
the Horn of Africa nation into heavily armed fiefdoms.

Philippines accepts joint use of Chinese facilities on disputed
</HEADLINE>
reef &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines has accepted in
principle an offer by China for the joint use of Chinese facilities
on a disputed reef in the Spratlys, Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon said.
	   Siazon said the Chinese proposal was ``attractive'' but Manila
and Beijing still have to discuss details of the offer.
	   ``We are amenable to that concept,'' Siazon said. ``We've
accepted the offer in principle. That's a good concept, why reject
it?''
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met earlier this week in Malaysia and agreed to settle their
dispute over Mischief Reef peacefully.
	   They endorsed a proposal to form a group of experts who will
find ways to build confidence between the two nations. They also
agreed that natural resources in the area of the reef should be
used jointly by the two nations.
	   Siazon said Manila will host the experts' consultations on
confidence building measures in January.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing over the construction of buildings on the reef which the
Philippines believes could be used militarily.
	   The new construction violated a 1995 accord between Manila and
Beijing to build confidence and not to unduly stir controversy over
the Spratlys, Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said.
	   The Chinese have insisted that the structures were shelter for
Chinese fishermen that could also be used by Filipino fishermen.
	   The Philippines says the reef is well within its 200-mile
exclusive economic zone, and Siazon said that acceptance by the
Philippines of China's joint-use offer would not legitimize
Beijing's claims.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Estrada and Jiang were in Kuala Lumpur for meetings of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Officials: Freer world trade could ease economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The World Trade Organization should fight back
against global economic troubles by launching a new round of
broad-based free trade talks in 2000, officials said Friday.
	   ``Clearly, we've got to do more work on reducing the barriers to
trade,'' said New Zealand's international trade minister, Lockwood
Smith, after a brief session of informal trade talks between
representatives of more than a dozen nations.
	   Smith said some countries still imposes tariff barriers of up to
500 percent to protect their home-grown industries, but these
obstacles must be removed to allow for free economic growth.
	   Ministers who attended Friday's talks said afterward in a
statement they recognized ``that new negotiations would need to pay
particular attention to and take full account of the special
concerns of developing and least developed economies.''
	   In a news conference, Hong Kong's secretary for trade and
industry, Chau Tak-hay, was asked about China's bid to join the
WTO. Chau would say only that China needs to engage in bilateral
talks with its big trading partners _ the United States and the
European Union.
	   Other delegates came to the meeting from Argentina, Australia,
Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand,
Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand and Uruguay.

Heavy snow forces rerouting of aid convoys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yuogslavia (AP) _ A heavy overnight snowfall in Kosovo
forced the rerouting of aid convoys Friday amid concerns about
reaching refugees in remote villages.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees diverted three
aid convoys carrying food, blankets and mattresses, originally
destined for three distribution points west of Pristina, to
Podujevo, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital,
after a snowfall of between 20 and 50 centimeters (20 inches), said
the organization's spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.
	   Although UNHCR says there are no more refugees living outdoors,
many are sheltering in the homes of friends and relatives or have
managed to rebuild a warm room in their destroyed houses and need
aid supplies to survive the winter.
	   Up to 300,000 people in the Serbian province of Kosovo have been
left homeless since government forces cracked down on separatist
Albanian rebels in late February. Hundreds more, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, have been killed.
	   The crackdown ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes.
The separatist guerrillas have grudgingly accepted a cease-fire.
	   UNHCR has been sending out two to three relief convoys six days
a week, with large convoys consisting of about 20 trucks going to
the major distribution points three times a week.
	   From there, the aid is transported to villages, using smaller
vehicles. But heavy snowfall can cause many of the dirt tracks
leading to villages to become impassable.
	   The weather bureau forecast continued snowfall until Saturday.

Japan says Asian economies may return to high-growth track
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The days of double-digit growth may return to
troubled Asian economies, but it will probably take several years,
Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in a report issued Friday.
	   The agency's World Economic White Paper said economic
fundamentals remain strong in the five Asian countries hit hardest
by the recent slump _ Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand,
and the Philippines.
	   The report cited these nations' high savings rates, relatively
sound fiscal policies and well-educated citizens as reasons for
optimism about the outlook for the region.
	   ``The crisis hasn't caused factors such as these, which have
supported the strong growth in the Asian countries over a long
period of time, to change that much,'' the report said.
	   ``It's possible for the countries which were hit by the crisis
to return to a strong growth track after an adjustment period of
several years,'' it said.

Japanese defense chief resigns in widening corruption scandal

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's Defense Agency stepped down
Friday, one day after releasing an internal agency report that
exposed a cover-up at the highest levels in a growing corruption
scandal.
	   Fukushiro Nukaga handed his resignation to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi after a Cabinet meeting Friday morning.
	   Nukaga, who took office in July, was replaced by fellow ruling
party lawmaker Hosei Norota, a former agriculture minister, an
agency spokesman said.
	   Defense Agency officials are being investigated for allowing
Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. inflate defense contract bills
in exchange for cushy jobs for retiring bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted, as have a dozen
employees and former employees from NEC and two subsidiaries.
	   Nukaga first made public his intention to resign at a press
conference Thursday, where he released the results of an inquiry
into the scandal.
	   On Thursday, he also announced punishments such as temporary
paycuts for 31 officials in connection with the scandal.
	   Three high-ranking officials questioned by prosecutors in the
scandal, including the agency's top bureaucrat, Vice Defense
Minister Masahiro Akiyama, also resigned Friday, said the agency
official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   In a statement, NEC said it ``deeply regrets and offers a
heartfelt apology for the distress and disturbance it has caused.''
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
the Defense Agency totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 13.9
million).
	   Thursday's report, put together after an internal agency
investigation, said that officials throughout the agency conspired
to hide evidence from prosecutors.
	   The report follows an earlier internal inquiry into the scandal
released last month that absolved the agency of widespread
wrongdoing. The report was harshly criticized on the floor of
Japan's Parliament as a bureaucratic cover-up.
	   Nukaga pledged to take personal charge of a second
investigation, which produced Thursday's report.

Taiwanese family released by kidnappers: negotiator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) _ A Taiwanese grandmother, her Filipino
daughter-in-law, her 3-year-old granddaughter and a Filipino maid
were released unharmed Friday by their kidnappers, an official
said.
	   Wang Tau Chu Yang, 80, the mother of a Taiwanese businessman in
Zamboanga City north of Jolo, and her family were released in the
village of Sangali, 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Zamboanga by
their abductors who held them captive for 72 days.
	   Mrs. Yang, her daughter-in-law Gina, granddaughter Tza-Tza and
maid Joy Sagubay were unharmed. No Ransom was paid for their
release, said Abdulrahman Jamasali, interior undersecretary for the
Muslim autonomous government in the southern Philippines.
	   The Yangs were seized by armed men outside their home in
Zamboanga Sept. 9 as they were preparing to board the family van.
	   The kidnappers initially demanded 5 million pesos (dlrs 128,200)
in ransom. Mrs. Yang's son, Bien, said earlier he had paid an
amount he did not disclose as ``board and lodging'' for his family.
	   The kidnappers were believed to be former members of the Moro
National Liberation Front, the main Muslim rebel group which signed
a peace agreement with the government in 1996.
	   The Yang family was turned over late Friday afternoon by the
kidnappers to Julhambri Misuari, an aide of Nur Misuari, MNLF
chairman and governor of the Muslim autonomous government.
	   They were to be turned over to Misuari and police Chief
Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, chief of the presidential task force
against organized crime, Jamasali said.
	   The Yangs' release followed that of Italian missionary, the Rev.
Luciano Benedetti, who was abducted also on Sept. 8 from his parish
in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Treviso, was turned over late last Sunday to
leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, another rebel group
negotiating a peace accord with the government.
	   Jamasali is in Jolo, about 945 kilometers (590 miles) south of
Manila, to negotiate with members of the Muslim extremist Abu
Sayyaf, who abducted two Hong Kong cirtizens and one Malaysian also
in September.
	   There was no word on their immediate release.

More talks on Congo -- rebels attend, but not government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Thursday said they
wanted to bring their civil war to an end as they met with the few
countries in the region not involved in the conflict.
	   Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, did not send representatives
to this southern African country. Kabila has refused to meet with
the rebels, and blames Rwanda and Uganda for the war.
	   Those countries are backing the rebels; Namibia, Zimbabwe,
Angola and Chad have sided with Kabila.
	   ``We are determined to make (the talks) a success because we
want to end the war,'' said rebel leader Bizima Karaha, Kabila's
former foreign minister, according to South African Press
Association. But the chances were slim because the rebels are
demanding direct talks with Kabila.
	   The talks are being chaired by a Zambian official and included
representatives of Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania.
Officials representing the United Nations secretary-general, the
Organization of African Unity and the Southern African Development
Community also are taking part.
	   Botswana's Foreign Minister Mompati Merafe urged the rebels to
be prepared to compromise.
	   The talks were the latest in a long series of meetings since the
war broke out Aug. 2.

Israel begins troop pullback in West Bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian officials saying pullback to resume,
problem over maps resolved, COMBINES previous &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israel began withdrawing troops in the
West Bank on Friday, but the handover was held up after several
hours because the Palestinians raised questions about last-minute
Israeli changes in the redeployment map.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reviewed the map, and an aide,
Nabil Abourdeneh, said there was no reason to hold up the
withdrawal.
	   Once completed, the pullback gives Arafat full or partial
control of an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, or 510
square kilometers (204 square miles) and take him a step closer to
his final goal _ statehood.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by erstwhile hawkish allies who oppose
land concessions and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu
reportedly is considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy
heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The pullback began quietly and without ceremony Friday morning,
but about four hours into the process, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan there had been a holdup because the Palestinians were
concerned about Israeli changes in the maps.
	   Arafat met with the Israeli troop commander, Maj. Gen. Moshe
Yaalon to review the map. ``The Palestinian side looked at it,''
Abourdeneh said, adding that he expected the troop withdrawal to be
completed ``in the next few hours.''
	   ``What we want to do is just to insure that Mr. Netanyahu honors
the agreements as they were signed,'' Palestinian negotiator Erekat
said in an interview with the BBC.
	   Erekat said Israel and the Palestinians had also signed a
protocol on the opening of the Palestinian airport in the Gaza
Strip, clearing the way for flights to begin next Monday or
Tuesday.
	   Erekat also said the Palestinians were upset that a majority of
the 250 Palestinian prisoners Israel had started freeing Friday as
part of the peace agreement were criminals, not political
activists.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs, said he would not greet the returnees
at the Nahal Oz crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. ``It's
a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' he said.
	   The pullback began Friday morning.
	   Israeli army trucks loaded with 130 red-and-yellow border
markers left the Dotan army base south of the Palestinian town of
Jenin and drove to road junctions to demarcate the new borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   In nearby Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 Palestinians, hundreds of
residents lined the main road to await the arrival of Palestinian
police.
	   Khalil Abu Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby
coffee shop, was skeptical about benefits of the redeployment.
``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what
will change?'' he said.
	   The withdrawal had little of the drama of previous withdrawals.
No Israeli army bases were dismantled and thousands of Palestinians
who came under full Palestinian Authority control are already used
to a limited Palestinian police presence in their villages.
	   In Qabatieh, most residents were more concerned about jailed
relatives than about the arrival of the Palestinian forces.
	   ``Our happiness depends on the release of our son,'' said Awad
Ali Kamil, whose son Ahmed is serving 16 life terms in Israel for
killing suspected Palestinian collaborators. ``What is the meaning
of peace? It is the release of prisoners,'' he said.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``We moved here for peace and quiet, but if we don't feel safe,
we are wasting our time,'' said Miri Deutsch, 47, a house wife in
the Ganim settlement of 51 families which after the pullback will
be surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were being transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of
the land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from
joint jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had a difficult time keeping his hard-line allies on
board.
	   In Thursday's vote in the 17-member Cabinet, only Netanyahu and
six ministers voted in favor of the pullback, while five opposed it
and three abstained. Two ministers were abroad.
	   The vote was even narrower than the Cabinet's slim approval of
the overall peace accord last week, which had eight ministers
voting in favor.
	   Aware of the slipping support, Netanyahu is considering several
political options, including bringing the opposition Labor Party
into his coalition or calling early elections, media reports said.
	   In his newspaper article Friday, Mordechai appealed to the
government's critics. ``We knew that there is apparently no other
way than compromise and accommodation with the Palestinians in
order to avoid confrontation,'' he wrote.
	   However, Jewish settler leader Aharon Domb accused the
government of approving ``an act of desperation.''
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Domb wrote in Yediot.

	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government has summoned Norwegian
Ambassador John Lomoy to explain why his country is giving aid to
an organization supporting gay rights, officials said.
	   Lomoy has acknowledged funding gay rights through the Zambia
Independent Monitoring Team, a human rights group that has called
for recognition of the Lesbians, Gays and Transgender Association
(LEGATRA), the nation's first gay rights group formed earlier this
year.
	   The envoy declined to disclose how much was being channelled by
Norway to the human rights group.
	   ``I admit the Norwegian Embassy has been funding ZIMT projects
but as an embassy, we have no right to dictate how ZIMT uses the
money. If ZIMT is using the money to support the gays in the
country, then, it is up to ZIMT to continue doing so,'' Lamoy said
Tuesday.
	   Homosexual sex is illegal in Zambia.
	   Zambia, like neighboring Zimbabwe, has launched an outspoken
campaign against same-sex partners, arguing homosexuality is
against African values and was brought to the continent by
foreigners.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan rebels hacked to death nine women
who went to work in their fields, a radio station said Friday.
	   The Lord's Resistance Army killed them Thursday after they left
their army-protected village near Atiak town, 440 kilometers (275
miles) north of Kampala, said Central Broadcasting Service, a
privately owned radio service.
	   The rebels have fought a 12-year insurgency in northern Uganda
to oust President Yoweri Museveni. They usually attack defenseless
civilians, killing or abducting them for forced recruitments into
their ranks.
	   Rebel activities in two northern districts bordering Sudan have
driven more than 250,000 Ugandans from their homes.
	   --
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A senior West African intervention
force commander in Sierra Leone, Brig. Maxwell Khobe, has offered
to allow safe passage out of the country to key rebel leaders in
exchange for an end of fighting.
	   Khobe, a Nigerian who leads the West African force known as
ECOMOG, said the rebel leaders would be allowed to exit the country
if their followers agree to ``lay down their arms and end the
hostilities.''
	   Rebels and allied former junta gunmen have been holed up in
remote bases in eastern and northern Sierra Leone since they were
driven from the capital by ECOMOG troops earlier this year.
	   The rebels have been committed atrocities against unarmed
civilians in revenge for their ouster, and in response to the trial
of their leader, Foday Sankoh, who is awaiting an appeal of a death
sentence handed down last month.
	   __
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The secretary-general of a
leading local human rights group was detained earlier this week
after releasing a report critical of President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Christian Mounzeo was released after hours of interrogation
regarding information in the report, a police commander said
Friday.
	   Mounzeo's Congolese Human Rights Watch released a report
entitled ``The Consecration of Terror and Injustice'' earlier this
month.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officer said the report
accused the government of extra judicial killings and torture in
the capital, Brazzaville, and the port city of Pointe Noire.

Creditors win court order to liquidate former Chrysler affiliate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A company which once served as
DaimlerChrysler's main Thai affiliate was ordered liquidated so its
creditors could recover loans worth dlrs 40 million, a director of
Chrysler's new Thai unit said Friday.
	   A court-appointed receiver closed Thai Automotive Ltd. after a
majority of creditors voted Wednesday for liquidation, Vance
Peacock, director of Chrysler Sales and Services (Thailand) Ltd.,
said Friday in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Chrysler Sales and Services is DaimlerChrysler's wholly-owned
successor to Thai Automotive, whose obligations it has disavowed
despite owning a 30 percent stake. Locally-listed Swedish Motors
owns the remaining 70 percent.
	   Chrysler is involved in a battle with creditors over its
obligation to take responsibility for repayment of the dlrs 40
million syndicated loan made by 10 foreign banks to Thai Chrysler _
the former name of Thai Automotive.
	   In December, Thai Chrysler defaulted on payments on the loan
after the crash of the Thai baht pushed up the cost of servicing
foreign debt.
	   Thai Chrysler changed its name to Thai Automotive after its
creditors filed a lawsuit in May, but Chrysler maintained its 30
percent stake in the company.
	   Chrysler also terminated Swedish Motors' right to sell and
service its products in Thailand and earlier this year set up
Chrysler Sales and Services to take over those operations.
	   According to Han Tjan, Chrysler's vice president for public
relations in the Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. automaker is under
no obligation to repay Thai Automotive's loans as it is only a
minority shareholder in the firm.
	   A senior banker involved in the negotiations, however, told Dow
Jones Newswires that the dlrs 40 million loan was made to
Chrysler's Thai affiliate without collateral because it had the
U.S. company's name behind it.
	   Chrysler's Peacock said his company had agreed with Swedish
Motors in April to buy the assets of Thai Chrysler and assume any
outstanding debt but the deal fell through.
	   Since the breakdown of the asset purchase agreement, Chrysler
has distanced itself from Thai Automotive and says it is actually
the largest single creditor of its affiliate.
	   Peacock said Thai Automotive owes Chrysler dlrs 28 million for
vehicles and parts the U.S. auto maker supplied to the joint
venture with Swedish Motors.
	   Chrysler said Friday it will have to write off that investment
as a result of the liquidation. But according to Chrysler
Asia-Pacific's Tjan, the closure of Thai Automotive is good because
``customers now know where the official Chrysler network is.''

Far right leader will appeal assault conviction to highest court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on
Friday announced plans to appeal an assault conviction, a maneuver
that should allow him to skirt a ban on public office and let him
run in European parliamentary elections next year.
	   ``I confirm that I will be at the head of the list in European
elections'' in June 1999, Le Pen told a news conference. He added
that ``even the (French) presidential elections of 2002'' are not
beyond his ambitions.
	   Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration National Front party,
lambasted the Tuesday decision of an appeals court which upheld an
April assault conviction for attacking a Socialist politician
during a campaign rally.
	   But the appeals court reduced the punishment from a two-year ban
on voting or running for or holding elected office to one year.
	   The decision was ``laughable and persecuting,'' Le Pen told
reporters, saying he was taking his appeal to the Court of
Cassation, France's highest court, which ``can do nothing else''
but overturn the ruling.
	   Under French law, lodging such an appeal automatically suspends
the punishment until a new ruling on the case. Decisions by the
Court of Cassation are known to be drawn-out affairs. That leaves
him free to run for the European Parliamentary elections.
	   Le Pen had earlier said that if he could not run, he would put
up his wife in his stead even though she lacks political
experience, bypassing the National Front's No. 2 man Bruno Megret
who is on a political collision course with the party's leader.
	   The National Front is widely accused of racism and
anti-Semitism.

OSCE Ambassador receives a death threat.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international official in Albania
received an anonymous death threat, connected to an up-coming
constitutional referendum, media reported Friday.
	   Daan Everts, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe's Ambassador to Albania received an anonymous phone call
earlier this week, warning him to give up supporting the
constitution, or else he would be dead.
	   The threat is connected to Everts' support of the Sunday
referendum, when Albanians are to vote on the country's first
post-communist constitution, the papers said.
	   Everts refused to comment on the incident, but said he would
continue his work.
	   ``I know I can fully rely on the hospitality of the Albanian
people,'' Everts told the Associated Press by telephone Friday.
	   Everts has often come under attack from the opposition
Democratic Party, which has called on people to boycott Sunday's
referendum. The party leaders have publicly accused the ambassador
for siding with the ruling coalition, led by the Socialist Party.
	   Everts said his job is to represent the international community,
which condemns the boycott as undemocratic and leading to the
self-isolation of the opposition.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ After losing four diplomatic allies to
China this year, Taiwan scored a moderate coup Friday as it
established formal recognition from the South Pacific nation of
Marshall Islands.
	   Taiwan's Foreign Minister Jason Hu signed a communique with his
counterpart, Phillip Muller, saying the two countries have held
negotiations in secret for the past six months so China could not
disrupt the process.
	   China is now expected to sever its ties with Marshall Islands
because it regards Taiwan as a renegade province with no right to
international relations.
	   Hu said that is China's option, while Taiwan does not want to
play a ``zero-sum game'' in the diplomatic tug of war.
	   Although Taiwan will not confront China internationally, Premier
Vincent Siew said in a statement that Taiwan's 21 million people
``will adamantly reject any containment and suppression by the
Chinese communists.''
	   Taiwan has angrily attacked China for having pledged to cut its
small pool of diplomatic allies down to zero by the end of the
decade.
	   Marshall Islands became the 27th diplomatic ally of Taiwan,
which earlier this year lost its ties to South Africa, Central
African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Tonga as they switched sides to
China.
	   Hu said Taiwan did not offer any financial aid in securing the
new ties, but only promised to promote tourism and agricultural
cooperation to the nation with a population of around 60,000.
	   Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of Taiwan's government Mainland
Affairs Council, said Friday that China's diplomatic isolation will
only alienate more Taiwanese.
	   Taiwan is preparing to choose a successor to President Lee
Teng-hui in 16 months, and if China continues to deny the island a
place in the world, that might push more Taiwanese toward
supporting a candidate advocating independence, Lin told reporters.

Cyprus charges two Israelis with spying

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean
island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with
spying on Cyprus for a foreign country.
	   The two were also charged with the illegal possession of
wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other
to commit a crime.
	   The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged
during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of
Larnaca. Prosecutor George Papaioannou asked that the two face
trial before a three-judge criminal court.
	   Judge Tefkros Economou adjourned the hearing to consider whether
the evidence against the two Israelis warranted a trial. He was
expected to return to court later Friday to announce his decision.
	   The two men were arrested Nov. 6 in the coastal fishing village
of Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices
in the apartment the two men had rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an
Israeli head of state.
	   Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their
arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from the
capital Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the north, in two
separate cars. Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they were
guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
	   Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the
courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
	   The spying charge states that the two men collected information
linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign
state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two
worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a
main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doctors have found metal bullet
fragments in the bodies of students shot to death by Indonesian
troops during bloody street protests last week, a forensic expert
confirmed Friday.
	   The finding comes as the military is reportedly investigating
allegations that soldiers disobeyed top-level orders and opened
fire on pro-democracy protesters with live rounds instead of only
plastic bullets.
	   Fragments from ``high-velocity type'' bullets were found in the
bodies of seven students killed during protests and rioting in
which up to 16 people died, said Dr. Mun'im Idries of state-run
Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, where post mortem examinations were
carried out.
	   ``We found that the seven students were killed because of the
high velocity of the bullets that hit them,'' Idris told The
Associated Press.
	   Budi Sampurna, head of the hospital's forensic department, said
the fragments had been handed over to military investigators.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto ordered an investigation to
determine how the deaths occurred despite live ammunition being
banned during last week's clashes, said Wayan Karya, spokesman for
the political and security affairs minister.
	   ``The investigation aims to find out exactly what went wrong,''
Karya was quoted as telling reporters by The Indonesian Observer.
	   ``We want to find out why, despite the fact that live ammunition
was expressly prohibited by military commanders, one post mortem
(examination) did locate a bullet embedded in the body of a
victim,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile angry students punched and kicked a Cabinet minister
after invading a provincial airport where government officials were
holding a meeting on Thursday, the newspaper Kompas reported.
	   It said bodyguards rescued Agriculture Minister Soleh Salahudin
from a mob of students in Padang, about 1,000 kilometers (600
miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   The minister later met with the students, who demanded the
military be removed from government and that Wiranto resign.
	   Students kept up their protests on Friday.
	   Fresh flowers were laid in the street outside the Atma Jaya
university, the scene of the worst violence one week ago, during a
commemoration rally attended by about 1,500 students, families and
supporters.
	   Other protests, numbering several hundred students each, marched
peacefully elsewhere in Jakarta, demanding Wiranto's resignation
and greater political change. All protests were watched by police.
	   About 30 members of the Front of Indonesian Women Action were
blocked by soldiers more than 100 meters (yards) from the defense
ministry.
	   In Surabaya, the second largest city, several hundred protesters
marched on a government building demanding an inquiry into
Suharto's wealth.
	   A visiting U.S. official on Friday urged the government to push
ahead with reforms, including investigation of human rights abuses
and efforts to scale back the military's prominent role in
politics.
	   ``One way that a society can gain confidence in itself... is to
have a full and fair examination of (past) human rights abuses,''
said Harold Koh, U.S. assistant secretary for democracy, human
rights and labor.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 16 people, including students
and soldiers, were killed in last week's confrontations. Police say
13 people died. Hundreds were injured.
	   Opposition figures and students claim the military provoked much
of the violence.
	   President B.J. Habibie has accused some opposition groups of
orchestrating the protests as part of a plot to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   Police said Friday 70 people would be tried on charges related
to looting which was triggered by last week's student clashes.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three
decades. Discontent over inflation and joblessness helped spark the
bloody May riots which helped forced Suharto out and in which 1,200
people were killed.
	   Kompas reported Friday that offices and cars were burned in two
separate two riots in South Sumatra province, northwest of Jakarta.

Germany won't seek Kurdish rebel leader for trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will not ask Italy to extradite a
jailed Kurdish rebel leader sought by German authorities on
terrorism charges since 1990, the government announced Friday.
	   Germany is suspending its own international arrest warrant until
further notice, and broader Turkish charges against Abdullah Ocalan
have priority, government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   Italy itself should handle the case, which is ``a problematic
issue on many levels,'' he said.
	   The decision allows Germany to skirt a growing international
diplomatic controversy. Thousands of Kurds have already staged
protests in Germany since Ocalan's Nov. 12 arrest at Rome's airport
after he stepped off a flight from Moscow.
	   He has since asked for political asylum in Italy.
	   The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to extradite Ocalan,
whose guerrillas have fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy.
Turkish businesses are boycotting Italian products and a mob on
Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a market.
	   But Italian law forbids extraditing someone to a country where
they could face execution, as is the case with Ocalan.
	   EU countries can't agree on whether Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, is a terrorist organization. The United States is
pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan, whom it considers a terrorist.

Two major Japanese shipbuilders agree to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two major Japanese shipbuilders, Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines and Navix Line, said Friday they had reached an agreement to
merge in April next year to boost international competitiveness.
	   The new company, to be called Mitsui O.S.K., will be Japan's
biggest shipbuilder in terms of sales, even surpassing Nippon Yusen
K.K., which absorbed Showa Line Ltd. on Oct. 1.
	   The latest merger was reported Friday in Japan's major business
daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended
trading in both of the companies' stocks following the report. The
announcement came later in the day.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israel began withdrawing troops in the
West Bank on Friday, but the handover was held up for two hours
because the Palestinians raised questions about last-minute Israeli
changes in the redeployment map.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with the Israeli troop
commander in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, and reviewed
the map. Asked whether the problem was resolved, Arafat said:

UEFA monitoring tension ahead of Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it is monitoring
tension between Turkey and Italy over a Kurdish rebel leader jailed
in Rome to make sure a match between Galatasaray and Juventus goes
ahead safely.
	   The European body said it is gathering ``all information
needed'' to make sure the Champions League game, scheduled for next
Wednesday in Istanbul, can be played ``in accordance with the
regulations.''
	   UEFA will ``consider all matters in order to take a fair
decision no later than Monday,'' General Secretary Gerhard Aigner
said in a statement.
	   The Turkish government is pushing Italy hard to extradite
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year war
for Kurdish autonomy.
	   Turkish businesses are now boycotting Italian products and a mob
on Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a market. On
Thursday, the Turkish ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, said Ankara
would break off diplomatic relations if Ocalan isn't handed over.

	   The pullback began quietly on Friday morning, but was stopped

``Outside of town, there are still Israeli checkpoints. So what

Top Malaysian lawmaker rejects call for questioning on Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A top lawmaker summoned by police
for questioning in the case against dissident Anwar Ibrahim said
Friday he will not comply because the procedure is ``contrary to
law.''
	   Karpal Singh of the Democratic Action Party said the fact that
the police want to question him about Anwar implied their
investigation was incomplete even though the accused had been
arraigned and was being tried in court.
	   ``This is contrary to law, as a prosecution can only be launched
after completion of investigations,'' said a statement Friday by
Singh, one of the most outspoken critics of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Singh, a member of Parliament, is also one of the country's
leading defense attorneys.
	   Also Friday, the attorney general said a special team appointed
to investigate how Anwar Ibrahim got a black eye and bruises while
in police custody had completed its report.
	   Mohtar Abdullah said in a statement that he had received the
report Thursday. No mention was made on the contents of the report
or what would be the next move. Mohtar said he was studying the
report with senior prosecutors.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister on trial on charges of
sodomy and corruption, alleges he was blindfolded and beaten by
senior police officers after he was arrested on Sept. 20. He later
appeared in court with a black-eye and bruises.
	   U.S. Ambassador John Malott defended Vice President Al Gore's
criticism of Malaysia's handling of the Anwar case during the
summit of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
last week.
	   Malott, in an interview with The Star daily published Friday,
said he was ``shocked'' by the reaction of Malaysia's Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi, who said Gore's comments would incite
violence.
	   ``It's the first time I have heard anyone say that when you call
for democracy you are inciting people to violence,'' Malott said.
	   Malott said Malaysia could not be called a democracy just
because it held elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving
leader, has been in power for 17 years.
	   ``Democracy is not simply having elections,'' he said. ``Stalin
held elections. Even Hitler held elections. Democracy is a process
of allowing all views to be heard, of allowing the competition of
ideas.''
	   In the Singh case, Kuala Lumpur police summoned him on Thursday
to appear at their headquarters on Saturday, Singh said. He
described the summons as ``arbitrary'' and refused to comply.
	   Anwar's trial resumes Monday after a recess to avoid clashing
with the APEC summit.
	   Anwar's supporters have held massive demonstrations calling for
his freedom and Mahathir's resignation. Hundreds of the
demonstrators have been arrested and a dozen of Anwar's associates
have been detained for questioning.

Primakov criticizes predecessors for not improving productivity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more Primakov quotes in final 2 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will ask the International
Monetary Fund for new terms to repay the country's debt to the
lending organization, its top economic policymaker announced
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov blamed his
reform-minded predecessors for the West's skepticism about Russia's
economic recovery plan. In an interview published in the Izvestia
daily on Friday, Primakov said western officials were getting all
their information on developments in Russia from Russia's liberal
reformers who lost power earlier this year.
	   ``Reformers did not develop production and the (financial
collapse of) August 17 is their fault,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August, when the
government defaulted on its domestic debt and devalued the ruble.
The IMF has been insisting that it will not release any more money
until the government comes up with a comprehensive plan to combat
the economic crisis and prove that Moscow is taking steps to
implement the plan.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov was due to meet later
in the day with the head of an IMF mission to Moscow, Jorge Marquez
Ruarte, to discuss the possible resumption of the fund's lending
program to Russia.
	   Maslyukov said he would be discussing possible new terms for
Russia to repay its loans from the International Monetary Fund, the
Interfax news agency reported. Russia is scheduled to pay dlrs 4.6
billion next year, but has already defaulted on many of its other
debts.
	   The government reached tentative agreement Thursday with a group
of private creditors. In a joint statement, the Russian Finance
Ministry and Deutsche Bank announced that they had agreed in
principle on repayment of the government's debts.
	   The announcement came after three days of talks in London
between a Russian delegation and creditors holding Russian Treasury
bills and bonds that were due to mature between Aug. 19, 1998, and
Dec. 31, 1999.
	   The Russian government owes approximately dlrs 10 billion to
foreign banks, while Russian banks owe about dlrs 6-7 billion.
	   In the Izvestia interview, Primakov blamed the reformers around
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his successor Sergei
Kiriyenko for the nation's economic crisis. He said they had failed
to boost the nation's productivity, and that their ability to
stabilize the economy had been based on high world prices for oil,
Russia's biggest export earner.
	   When oil prices fell, the reformers suffered ``a spasm of
fear,'' Primakov was quoted as telling Izvestia. But now the West
regards them as ``oracles,'' Primakov complained.
	   ``Unfortunately, the criticism of our policies and actions based
on information that the West obtains from very specific sources _
our predecessors,'' Primakov said.
	   But those reformers ``ruined the Russian banking system, didn't
give a damn about their foreign liabilities and imposed a
moratorium on (foreign commercial debt) payments,'' he said.

Yamazaki takes one-stroke first round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MATSUYAMA, Japan (AP) _ Japanese veteran Chikayo Yamazaki shot a
five-under-par 67 and took a one-stroke first-round lead in the 65
million yen (dlrs 541,000) 54-hole Daio Seishi Elleair Ladies Open
golf tournament Friday.
	   The 34-year-old Yamazaki, seeking her first Japan LPGA victory
this season and eighth in her career, carded seven birdies and two
bogeys on the 6,352-yard, par-72 Elleair Golf Club Matsuyama course
in southwestern Japan.
	   One stroke off the lead at 68 were two Japanese _ Takayo Bandoh
and Yoko Inoue.
	   South Korea's Ku Ok-hee, seeking her third straight Elleair
Ladies victory, shot a 74 and tied for 33rd place with her fellow
country woman Kim Ai-sook, Huang Yueh-chyn and Tai Yu-chuan, both
of Taiwan, and 12 Japanese.
	   A total of 108 players, including 18 non-Japanese, teed off in
cloudy weather.
	   The winner will receive first prize money of 11.7 million yen
(dlrs 97,500).

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma appointed career
diplomat Anton Buteiko to be Ukraine's ambassador to the United
States and Mexico, the presidential press service said Friday.
	   The 51-year-old Buteiko has served as first deputy foreign

then-Soviet Ukraine, as well as at various international
organizations, including the United Nations.
	   Buteiko, who holds a degree in law, served as presidential
advisor and worked in Ukraine's parliament after the country became
independent in 1991.
	   His predecessor at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, Yuriy
Shcherbak, is moving to a new job, the press service said.

U.N. weapons teams in field for third day

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams went into the field for
the third consecutive day on Friday, usually a day of rest in the
Muslim world.
	   ``We're going to be working seven days a week,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
weapons inspections. ``We want to get on with things and get as
much done in as short a period of time as possible.''
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts.
	   The inspectors refused to talk with reporters, and Ms. Cross
would not say where they were going. The inspectors generally did
not work on Friday in the past.
	   Neither side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons
inspectors returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been
evacuated last week amid fears of a U.S. missile strike.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''
	   In sermons at Friday prayers, mosque preachers addressed the
standoff that almost led to the American attack.
	   ``We thank God that the crisis ended,'' said Imam Bakr
al-Samerai at the Abdel-Khader al-Gailani Mosque.
	   Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at the 14th of Ramadan Mosque,
urged Arabs to ``stand by Iraq and tell America that we will not
allow this oppression and aggression to continue.''

Israeli who allegedly wanted to attack premier brought to court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court on Friday extended by four
days the detention of an Israeli man suspected of planning to
attack Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Outside the magistrate's court in the northern town of Acre,
several ultra-Orthodox Jews chanted and read psalms to show support
for the suspect, Shabtai Bloch, 48, a member of the ultra-Orthodox
Chabad group.
	   Bloch allegedly plotted to attack Netanyahu during the prime
minister's visit to the town of Safed in northern Israel on
Thursday evening. Police gave no further details. Bloch's lawyer
told Israel radio that his client opposes violence.
	   Chabad members demonstrated against Netanyahu in Safed during
the visit, angry over last month's Israel-Palestinian agreement
that calls on Israel to hand over territory in the West Bank.
Israel radio said Bloch organized the protest.
	   At Chabad headquarters in New York, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a
spokesman for the movement, said ``Violence, even the threat of
violence, is anathema'' to Chabad.
	   Chabad supported Netanyahu in Israel's 1996 election, but
members feel Netanyahu has betrayed them by agreeing to hand over
West Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   On Friday, the Israeli court ruled that the police had
sufficient evidence to justify holding Bloch for another four days.
	   In 1995, a ultra-nationalist Jew assassinated Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, trying to stop Rabin's policy of trading West Bank
land for peace with the Palestinians.

Banks to pay out first part of Holocaust settlement Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's two largest banks will
pay out on Monday the first dlrs 250 million of a settlement with
Holocaust survivors and heirs, bank spokesmen said Friday.
	   In August, UBS AG and Credit Suisse agreed to pay Holocaust
survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   The money will be held in an escrow account in the United
States, where it will earn normal interest, UBS spokesman Christoph
Meier said.
	   It will remain there pending a final decision on how the money
is distributed, Credit Suisse spokesman Ulrich Pfister said. That
decision must be authorized by a U.S. judge before anything can be
paid out to recipients, he added.
	   The banks' first payment is being made 90 days after the
settlement, in accordance with the August agreement, Meier said.
	   The rest of the money will be paid out in three yearly
installments.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   Discussions on outside contributions to the cost are still in
progress, Meier said. The Swiss National Bank, the central bank,
has refused to pay into the settlement.
	   For now UBS, the biggest bank, will pay two-thirds and Credit
Suisse the remaining one-third of the sum.

Russia, China to sign declaration on border during summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will sign a statement on border demarcation
during talks in Moscow next week, the Chinese ambassador said
Friday.
	   The summit _ Jiang's sixth meeting with Yeltsin _ will begin
Sunday and will focus on broad issues of expanding the
Russian-Chinese cooperation, the Kremlin has said.
	   Yeltsin and Zemin will also release a declaration that will
define some stretches of the border and call for talks on the rest
of the frontier, Chinese Ambassador to Moscow Wu Tao was quoted as
saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   During his visit, Jiang will also meet with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and other officials, and visit the Siberian city
of Novosibirsk.
	   After decades of friction, relations between Moscow and Beijing
have improved dramatically in recent years. China has become a
major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's defense
industry.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, and no more are planned at least until
the end of this year, but he continues to receive foreign leaders
in Moscow.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two strong earthquakes hit a rural area in
southwestern China, killing one person and injuring 1,383, 210 of
them seriously, the Central Seismology Bureau reported Friday.
	   A magnitude-5.0 quake struck the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County
in southwest China's Yunnan province and neighboring Yanyuan County
in Sichuan province at 7:31 p.m. (1131 GMT) Thursday, followed by a
stronger 6.2 quake seven minutes later.
	   Of the injured, 1,173 were slightly hurt, while 210 people
suffered serious injuries, said a bureau spokesman who gave only
his surname, Wu. He gave no other details.
	   The quake destroyed the houses of 230 families and three
schools, and a landslide blocked a river, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported. Wu, the bureau spokesman, said the full number of
destroyed homes was still being calculated.
	   Ninglang is a poor area where 80 percent of the people receive
food relief, Xinhua said.
	   Quakes measuring 5.3 and 5.2 hit the same area, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Oct. 2 and 27.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week sharply
higher Friday, with prices rebounding in Tokyo on hopes that new
stimulus measures such as a possible sales-tax cut will boost the
faltering Japanese economy. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent, to close at
14,779.94. The U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.16 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 0.48 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, but
slightly above its late New York level of 119.99 yen overnight. In
Seoul, the main index surged 2.7 percent in reaction to the
stronger Japanese currency. A stronger yen boosts South Korean
shares because local exporters will gain a price edge against their
Japanese rivals in the global market. In Indonesia, the key index
surged 6.5 percent on reports the government will set up a fund to
buy shares in companies and sell them to ``targeted groups'' at
discounted rates to help redistribute wealth. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ordered Microsoft
Corp., the world's largest software maker, to stop engaging in
unfair business practices that violate the country's anti-monopoly
laws, a commission spokesman said Friday. The warning, which came
after an investigation began in January when officials raided
Microsoft's Tokyo offices, came as the Redmond, Washington-based
company faces similar allegations against it in a high-profile case
in the United States. The FTC found Microsoft and its wholly owned
Japanese subsidiary had bundled software pre-installed in personal
computers in a way that put competitors at a disadvantage, the
spokesman said. Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the
basic functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.
(JAPAN-MICROSOFT)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will ask the International
Monetary Fund for new terms to repay the country's debt to the
lending organization, its top economic policymaker announced
Friday. IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August, when
the government defaulted on its domestic debt and devalued the
ruble. The IMF has been insisting that it will not release any more
money until the government comes up with a comprehensive plan to
combat the economic crisis and prove that Moscow is taking steps to
implement the plan. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
blamed his reform-minded predecessors for the West's skepticism
about Russia's economic recovery plan. In an interview published in
the Izvestia daily on Friday, Primakov said western officials were
getting all their information on Russia from Russia's liberal
reformers who lost power this year. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton pressed Japan Friday to
take aggressive measures to end its deepest recession since World
War II and said open markets are critical to its recovery.
``Protectionism is a no growth strategy that offers no way out of
the current economic crisis,'' he said. Joining Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi at a news conference after two days of talks, Clinton
praised Japan's efforts to repair its faltering economy with tax
cuts and public investment to stimulate the economy. He praised the
Japanese prime minister particularly for his plan to reform his
country's banking system. ``The United States wants, needs and
believes in a strong Japan,'' Clinton said. (CLINTON-ASIA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament approved
legislation Friday that would back all individuals' savings
deposits in the country's ailing commercial banks with a full
government guarantee. Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko
immediately dubbed the legislation ``populist,'' and said it
contained ``empty promises.'' The bill had already once been
approved by the Duma, but was rejected by the upper house, the
Federation Council. After the passage of the revised version in the
Duma, the bill will go back to the upper house for a vote.
Currently, the government guarantees only savings accounts in the
state-owned savings bank Sberbank, which holds around 80 percent of
all household deposits. (RUSSIA-BANK DEPOSITS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nikko Securities Co., a top Japanese brokerage
which became a unit of Citigroup Inc. in June, will effectively
withdraw from several overseas markets as part of a broad
restructuring effort, a local report said Friday. Nikko will close
or scale-back 11 of its 14 foreign subsidiaries by year's end,
including those located in New York and Hong Kong, the Yomiuri
newspaper reported. Japan's largest daily said an official
announcement was expected as soon as later Friday. A Nikko
spokesman said he was unaware any such decision had been made. The
report comes as just the latest signal of a full-scale retreat from
overseas markets by recession-hit Japanese financial institutions.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israel began withdrawing troops in the
West Bank on Friday, but the handover was held up for two hours
because the Palestinians raised questions about last-minute Israeli
changes in the redeployment map. Once completed, the pullback gives
Arafat full or partial control of an additional 9.1 percent of the
West Bank, or 510 square kilometers (204 square miles) and take him
a step closer to his final goal _ statehood. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand, faces a mounting challenge
by allies who oppose land concessions and threaten to topple the
government. Netanyahu reportedly is considering calling early
elections. ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a
heavy heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ A Russian Proton booster rocket
carried the first part of the international space station into
orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international
space colonization. Russian space officials and others cheered as
ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its
booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) above the Earth. The heads of the space agencies of 16
nations participating in the project watched the lift-off. The
launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed for more
than a year, ushers in a new era of cooperation among former
space-race rivals. (RUSSIA-SPACE STATION)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States has declared
its greatest enemy is ``a man without sin,'' Afghanistan's
hard-line Islamic Taliban militia declared on Friday, saying its
case against Osama bin Laden is closed. A three-week inquiry headed
by Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib into allegations
that bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States
ended Friday. ``It's over and America has not presented any
evidence,'' Saqib said. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man
without sin ... he is a free man,'' he said. Bin Laden has been
living in Afghanistan for years with the permission of the Taliban,
who control most of the country. (AFGHANISTAN-BIN LADEN)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House impeachment inquiry is moving beyond
President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, after an
opening hearing produced a heated clash between accuser Kenneth
Starr and the president's personal lawyer. Independent Council
Starr made a 12-hour nationally televised appearance before the
committee Thursday, as it opened only the third presidential
impeachment inquiry in U.S. history. No president has been removed
from office by the process. The House Judiciary Committee is
expected to conduct several days of hearings. Before exhausted
lawmakers went home after midnight Friday morning, they extended
the inquiry into the case of Kathleen Willey, who has publicly
accused Clinton of sexual misconduct with her in the White House.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doctors have found metal bullet
fragments in the bodies of students shot to death by Indonesian
troops during bloody street protests last week, a forensic expert
confirmed Friday. The finding comes as the military is reportedly
investigating allegations that soldiers disobeyed top-level orders
and opened fire on pro-democracy protesters with live rounds
instead of only plastic bullets. Fragments from ``high-velocity
type'' bullets were found in the bodies of seven of the 16 students
killed. Meanwhile angry students punched and kicked a Cabinet
minister after invading a provincial government meeting Thursday,
the newspaper Kompas reported. Agriculture Minister Soleh Salahudin
later met with the students, who demanded the military be removed
from government. Students kept up their protests on Friday.

Official: Unemployment in Moscow to rise to 10 percent by year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis will bring a surge of
unemployment in Moscow, the most prosperous city in the country,
and the number of people out of work may reach 500,000, an official
said Friday.
	   That would constitute 10 percent of the work force in this city
of some 9 million people, said Alexander Zhdanov, the head of the
Moscow employment committee, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since the crisis began in mid-August, many people have been laid
off or had their salaries cut by as much as half because many
businesses have closed or tried to reduce their expenses.
	   However, many people do not register as unemployed, apparently
because they don't want to waste time on paperwork for the sake of
negligible benefits.
	   Still, the number of people officially registered as unemployed
in Moscow has reached 45,000, up 10,000 from August, Zhdanov said.
The number is likely to rise to 50,000 by the end of the year, he
said.
	   However, other officials estimate that the real number would be
much higher.

Kurdish rebel leader freed from custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Ocalan statement; Germany suspending arrest
warrant, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court Friday freed Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan from detention but ordered him to remain in Rome.
	   Ocalan has been held in a military hospital since he was
arrested last week upon arrival on a flight from Moscow.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition, while Ocalan has asked
Italy for political asylum.
	   The asylum request is under study but Italy's law prohibits it
from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the death
penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey, which considers him
a terrorist.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' Italian Premier
Massimo D'Alema told reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Germany announced Wednesday that it would not seek the
extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany on
charges of terrorism since 1990.
	   In a written statement, Ocalan appealed to the thousands of
Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity to return
home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic
means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior which might
reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a
Kurdish spokesman in Rome, Akif Hasan.
	   Turkey has been furious over Italy's refusal to turn over
Ocalan. Turkish businesses have begun boycotting Italian goods in
response.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Ocalan heads a guerrilla movement which has fought a 14-year war
for autonomy in predominantly southeastern Turkey. Nearly 37,000
people have been killed.

Condemned dog, supported by Brigitte Bardot, wins reprieve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Woofie, the dog under a death
sentence for chasing and barking at a postman, won a reprieve
Friday from an appeal court.
	   French actress and animal rights campaigner Brigitte Bardot was
among the dog's supporters at a brief hearing in the Court of
Session.
	   ``I am very happy. I think that this is the right justice. I was
here to give support and would come back again if it was for
another Woofie,'' Miss Bardot told reporters.
	   Woofie, a three-year-old collie-boxer mix, got into trouble for
chasing and barking at a postman in Peterhead, 30 miles (50 kms)
north of Aberdeen. Postman Andrew Ainsley testified that it was not
the first time Woofie had barked at him.
	   Woofie's owner, Terry Swankie, pleaded guilty to violating the
Dangerous Dogs Act and admitted that the dog was out of control in
a public place.
	   He said he expected to pay a fine, and was shocked when a
Sheriff's Court ruled in September that the law left no alternative
but the destruction of the dog.
	   ``The whole picture is of a good natured family pet who fell out
of a window and became excited in that situation,'' the Swankies'
barrister, Gordon Jackson, argued in court.
	   ``She growled, barked and even bared her teeth but it is not
without significance that she did not actually bite,'' Jackson
said.
	   The two appeal judges accepted Jackson's argument Swankie had
not understood the proceedings in the Sheriff's Court and had
missed his opportunity to present evidence about the dog's
character.
	   A delighted Swankie told reporters that he had telephoned his
wife Anne with the news, and ``she was absolutely over the moon.''

Police say homemade bomb thrown on grand prix circuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A homemade bomb was thrown on the Macau Grand Prix
circuit during practice races Friday, but no one was injured,
police said.
	   The bomb exploded after several cars ran over it, sending nails
flying and damaging the tires of two vehicles.
	   Witnesses said the bomb was hurled by one of two people riding
on a motorcycle.
	   Officials closed off the 6.8-kilometer Guia Circuit for 30
minutes. During a search of the circuit, police also found a
Russian-made grenade, which taken away for examination by bomb
exports.
	   The motive of the explosion was not known.
	   Macau, a popular gambling and tourist spot at the tip of south
China, has been hit recently with gangland-style shootings, arson
and other attacks.
	   Police have blamed the violence on Chinese gangs who are
fighting over payoff from casinos, whose profits have been
shrinking because of Asia's economic downturn. The Portuguese
enclave returns to Chinese rule next year.
	   The two-day 45th Macao Grand Prix races begin on Saturday. The
highlight of the event will be Sunday's Formula 3 race in which 30
drivers will be competing.

Palestinian land confiscated for Jewish settlement roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 3 to fix tense, graf 9 to restore dropped word. &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YITMA, West Bank (AP) _ Twenty years ago, Khalil Eid planted
rows of olive trees on a rocky plot of land in his West Bank
village.
	   As the trees flourished, so did Eid's livelihood. He took the
olives to family presses and sold bottles of oil.
	   On Thursday, the 58-year-old Palestinian farmer watched from a
wind-swept hillside while Israeli bulldozers and mechanical shovels
ripped a swath of village land and uprooted his olive grove.
	   The bulldozers, guarded by Israeli troops, were clearing land
for 13 bypass roads crisscrossing the West Bank and linking Jewish
settlements that eventually will be surrounded by Palestinian
territory.
	   Israel says the roads are necessary for settlers' security.
After agreeing to hand over some West Bank land, it announced last
week it would confiscate thousands more acres (hectares) of
Arab-owned land for highways.
	   Palestinians say the roads will reinforce Israel's hold over the
area and make it nearly impossible to divide the land for a future
Palestinian state.
	   ``I look at the West Bank in the year 2005 and I see that it
will look like Swiss cheese,'' said Khalil Tufjaki, chief
cartographer for the Palestinian Authority. Most of the West Bank,
home to 1.6 million Palestinians and 150,000 Israelis, will be
sliced-up for bypass roads under the Israeli plan, he said.
	   Palestinian official Nabil Amr called the land expropriations
``provocative,'' and correctly predicted violence.
	   In the village of al-Khader near Bethlehem, Israeli troops
clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers last weekend clearing when
began there for a road connecting Jerusalem with the Jewish
settlement of Efrat.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon is expected to ask U.S.
officials in meetings next week to help pay for the staged troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, estimated to cost
anywhere from dlrs 500 million to dlrs 1.2 billion. An American
official in Israel said, however, said Sharon would be well-advised
not to bring up bypass roads.
	   ``As a rule, the United States is not interested in funding
bypass roads ... to sustain settlements,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear whether the U.S., which opposes settlement
expansion, would place restrictions on any aid package it approves,
the official said.
	   For residents of Yitma, the construction at the height of
olive-picking season came as a shock. No one had notified them.
	   ``I went to complain to the Palestinian Authority yesterday, but
I was told this is part of the peace agreement,'' Eid said.
``Without olive oil, how can I live?''
	   His neighbor, Ahmed Najjar, a 28-year-old just starting out in
the olive oil business, lost his 50 trees.
	   ``We are in favor of peace, but what kind of peace is this?'' he
asked. ``We are paying the price.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines reported a net
loss of 6.1 billion pesos (dlrs 152.5 million) in the first half of
the fiscal year Friday, citing the Asian financial crisis and
costly labor strikes.
	   The airline said the loss was much worse than the 2.1 billion
pesos (dlrs 52.5 million) it registered in the same period last
year. The fiscal year begins on April 1.
	   PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and the two airlines are drawing up a
comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
	   Revenue for the period totaled 11.74 billion pesos (dlrs 293.5
million), a 33 percent drop from the 17.58 billion pesos (dlrs
439.5 million) it earned in the same period a year ago.
	   Operating expenses exceeded the company's revenue at 12.67
billion pesos (dlrs 316.75 million), but it was 31 percent lower
than 18.44 billion pesos (dlrs 461 million) spent during the same
period last year.
	   Financing charges nearly tripled to 2.71 billion pesos (dlrs
67.75 million) from 1.04 billion pesos (dlrs 26 million). Foreign
exchange losses surged to 517.9 million pesos (dlrs 12.94) from
93.2 million (dlrs 2.33 million).
	   The airline has been incurring net losses in most of the past 15
years. It posted a net loss of 8.08 billion pesos (dlrs 202
million) in its fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, its biggest loss
so far in its 57-year history.
	   Financial difficulties caused Philippine Airlines to seek relief
from payment of dlrs 2.1 billion in debts in June due to cash flow
problems, which it attributed to financial losses from operations
and costly workers strikes.
	   Mainly as a result of a pilot's strike that forced Philippine
Airlines to downsize its operations, the company's revenue dropped
by 53 percent in the second quarter while operating expenses fell
50 percent. The airline didn't disclose the actual figures.
	   Philippine Airlines' total assets stood at 98.4 billion pesos
(dlrs 2.46 billion) in end-September compared with 91.2 billion
pesos (dlrs 2.28 billion) in end-March, mainly due to the
acquisition of new aircraft mid-year.
	   The airline said its liabilities has risen by 13.6 billion pesos
(dlrs 340 million) at end-September compared to its end-March
level. The airline didn't disclose the actual figure for
end-September. In June, however, the airline said its liabilities
totaled 85.1 billion pesos (dlrs 2.127 billion).
	   The additional liabilities resulted from foreign exchange
adjustments, lease payments, payables to the International Air
Transport Association, and other accrued expenses.
	   Due to the losses incurred in the six months to September,
Philippine Airlines' stockholders' equity fell 98 per cent to 138.6
million pesos (dlrs 3.4 million) at end-September compared with
274.4 million pesos (dlrs 6.86 million) at end-March.

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The touring West Indies
recovered from the loss of two early wickets _ including that of
captain Brian Lara _ to be 101 for two wickets at lunch Friday
against the Free State provincial team.
	   On the first day of their four-day match, West Indies won the
toss and elected to bat. An early slump to 45 for two was redeemed
by Clayton Lambert, who was undefeated on 57, and Shivnarine
Chanderpaul on 29 by lunch.
	   Big-hitting opener Philo Wallace was the first to go for 11,
giving the young Victor Mpistsang his first international wicket.
Lara got the faintest of edges, caught behind by Morne van Wyk off
the bowling of Herman Bakkes for 10.
	   The partnership to lift the West Indies from their precarious
position was a brisk one, with Lambert slowly increasing the pace.
Chanderpaul started briskly, but then retreated into a more
defensive mode.

Indonesian lawmakers chide Portuguese effort to extradite Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting of Lisbon mayor and Jakarta governor,
grafs 6-10

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian legislators on Friday
chided a Portuguese effort to extradite former President Suharto,
describing the proposal as impossible and unreasonable.
	   Portugal's attorney general's office is examining a request from
lawmaker Nuno Correia da Silva that Suharto be extradited for
alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor _ a former
Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said his
office was looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law.
	   Roestandi, a three-star general and chairman of the military
faction at Indonesia's Parliament, said such a handover would be
``impossible.''
	   ``Moreover, it is unreasonable because the East Timor issue is
an internal affair of Indonesia,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, city officials for the two countries said they hoped
a plan to make the capitals ``sister cities'' would thaw diplomatic
relations.
	   After meeting with Lisbon Mayor Joao Soares, Jakarta governor
Sutioso said Friday the planned sister-city relationship could
``become the cornerstone for Indonesian-Portuguese diplomatic
relations.''
	   On an official trip to Jakarta, Soares on Thursday visited East
Timor rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in a prison.
	   Some Portuguese politicians and East Timorese exile groups in
Lisbon severely criticized Soares for his visit, saying he was
cooperating with a malevolent regime and accusing him of seeking
political gain.
	   Soares is the son of former President Mario Soares and is an
influential member of the Portuguese Socialist Party.
	   Earlier, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's
commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the
extradition proposal.
	   ``The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but
the problem of the nation,'' she said.
	   Suharto, 77, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist from 1966 to last
May when he was forced to quit following a wave of protests and
riots in which 1,200 people died.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island territory in
return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
there.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after
invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal
colonizers left.
	   Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread abuses in East
Timor, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Correia da Silva of Portugal's rightist Popular Party likens the
bid to extradite Suharto with attempts in Britain to extradite
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges
that include genocide.
	   Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision
on whether to extradite him.

China punishes company in large fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's stock market regulator said
Friday it has punished a government-run firm, its lawyers,
underwriters and accountants in one of the largest cases of stock
market fraud ever disclosed in China.
	   The China Securities Regulatory Commission suspended the shares
of Chengdu Hongguang Industrial Co. and said its managers are under
investigation for possible criminal activities related to reporting
false profits, speculating in stocks and over-reporting
underwriting commissions.
	   It also banned Hongguang's top managers from the securities
industry for life and suspended the credentials of a host of
lawyers, accountants and underwriters, saying all parties played a
role in cheating investors out of millions.
	   The move is one of the more severe punishments ever given to a
listed firm, and the first time the market regulator extended such
fines and punishments to underwriters, accounts and lawyers that
abetted a market scam.
	   Analysts said the action underscored China's efforts to root out
widespread irregularities in its markets before they lead to a
broader crisis that could send asset prices tumbling and wipe out
the savings of millions of investors.
	   China's stock markets have grown rapidly since their
introduction in 1990, with the number of listed companies rising
from just 10 to more than 800. Market capitalization has surged to
some dlrs 240 billion from just dlrs 200 million. The number of
stock investors has soared to nearly 40 million from around
100,000.
	   But growth in market irregularities has been equally swift. A
national securities law aimed at better regulating the industry has
been repeatedly rejected by legislators, and market oversight has
been enforced through a series of temporary rules and regulations
issued by the commission, local regulatory offices and the stock
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Cyprus charges two Israelis with spying, trial begins Dec. 8

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean
island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with
spying on Cyprus for a foreign country and will go on trial next
month.
	   The two were also charged with the illegal possession of
wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other
to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus
and Israel.
	   The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged
during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of
Larnaca. Judge Tefkros Economou, after retiring to consider the
evidence against them, returned to the court to announce that their
trial will begin Dec. 8.
	   He adjourned proceedings for a second time to look into a
defense request for bail.
	   Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides said the Israeli Embassy in
Cyprus would keep the two men inside its premises in the capital
Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Larnaca, until the trial
begins. Hergov and Damary have been held in the Nisosia Central
Prisons since their arrest Nov. 6.
	   Prosecutor George Papaioannou objected to the bail request,
arguing that the two faced ``serious spying charges.''
	   The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of
Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in
the apartment the two men had rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an
Israeli head of state.
	   Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their
arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia
in two separate cars. Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they
were guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
	   Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the
courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
	   The spying charge states that the two men collected information
linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign
state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two
worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a
main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.

Germany won't seek Kurdish rebel leader for trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, background on Kurds in Germany. Adds

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany said Friday it will not ask Italy
to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader sought by German authorities on
terrorism charges, skirting a growing political controversy.
	   Abdullah Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport off a
flight from Moscow and has asked for political asylum in Italy. A
Rome court freed him from detention Friday but ordered him to
remain in the capital.
	   Germany has now put off action on a 1990 arrest warrant to allow
Italian authorities to handle the case and because broader Turkish
terrorism charges against Ocalan should have priority, government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said in Bonn.
	   ``In view of these facts and developments, the government is
deferring a German extradition request,'' he told a news
conference.
	   With 500,000 Kurds living here, Germany has a clear stake in
Ocalan's fate. Already, thousands of Kurds have staged protests in
Germany since his arrest.
	   Germany banned Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in 1993
as an extremist organization after a series of terrorist attacks on
Turkish and German targets, an extension of the rebels' 14-year war
for autonomy from Turkey.
	   In 1996, Ocalan changed his strategy, renouncing violence in
Germany in hopes of getting the ban on legal PKK activity lifted.
	   Some 11,000 PKK activists are based in Germany despite the ban,
according to the country's domestic security agency.
	   German relations with its NATO partner Turkey are also strained.
The Turkish government accused former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
blocking the country's bid to join the European Union last year
because he wanted to keep it a Christian club.
	   Heye denied that fears of unrest in Germany influenced the
government's decision.
	   The case ``is in good hands'' in Italy, he said.
	   The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to extradite Ocalan.
Turkish businesses are boycotting Italian products and a mob on
Thursday trampled Italian food for sale in a market.
	   But Italian law forbids extraditing someone to a country where
they could face execution, as is the case with Ocalan.
	   Germany also wants to avoid influencing a Turkish debate about
scrapping the death penalty to clear the way for Ocalan's
extradition, Heye said.

Far-right leader to appeal conviction in move to skirt ban

	   SAINT CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
said Friday he will appeal his assault conviction, a maneuver that
should allow him to skirt a one-year political ban and run in
European parliamentary elections next year.
	   ``I will be at the head of the list in European elections'' in
June 1999, a defiant Le Pen told a news conference. ``And even the
(French) presidential elections of 2002.''
	   Le Pen, the flamboyant leader of the anti-immigrant National
Front, lambasted an appeals court decision Tuesday upholding his
April assault conviction for attacking a Socialist politician
during a campaign rally.
	   He called the decision ``laughable,'' ``derisory'' and ``without
any foundation.''
	   Although it upheld the conviction, the appeals court reduced the
punishment from a two-year ban to a one-year ban on voting, running
for office or holding office.
	   Now, the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court, will
consider the decision _ a process that usually takes at least a
year. Until then, the decision is suspended.
	   ``This makes me completely eligible'' for the 1999 European
elections, Le Pen said.
	   However, the move could backfire on him.
	   The Cour de Cassation could prolong the process until less than
a year before presidential elections in 2002, then uphold the ban,
rendering him ineligible for that race. Or, it could decide to
reimpose the original two-year ban, also rendering him ineligible.
	   Le Pen's legal problems had put him on a collision course with
his party's No. 2 man, Bruno Megret, who opposed Le Pen's plan to
put his wife, Jany, in his place at the top of the list for
European elections if he couldn't run.
	   Megret has said repeatedly that he, not the politically
inexperienced Mrs. Le Pen, should be the top candidate.
	   Le Pen said Friday that he still might place his wife somewhere
on the list.
	   The National Front has won about 15 percent of the vote in
recent national and regional elections. It blames immigrants,
especially from North Africa, for high unemployment and crime. It
has been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   On Tuesday, in addition to imposing the one-year ban, the
appeals court upheld a three-month suspended prison sentence and
ordered Le Pen to pay a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs
900).
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in southern France.
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift his
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   The charges came from his repeated comments that Nazi gas
chambers were a ``detail'' of history.

IAAF refers Sri Lankan's doping case to arbitration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ World track and field's governing
body on Friday referred Sri Lankan sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe's
doping case to arbitration.
	   The decision does not affect Jayasinghe's current eligibility,
meaning she remains free to compete in next month's Asian Games in
Bangkok. However, her results in Bangkok could be wiped off the
books retroactively if she is found guilty.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation accepted the
recommendation of its doping commission that Jayasinghe's case be
sent to an arbitration panel for a final ruling.
	   No date was immediately set for the hearing, and the process
could take several months.
	   Jayasinghe, who won the silver medal in the 200 meters at the
1997 World Championships in Athens, tested positive in March for
the steroid Nandralone-19.
	   Jayasinghe was later cleared by the Sri Lankan federation after
maintaining that she only took a drug to control her menstrual
cycle. She claimed she was set up by frustrated Sri Lankan sports
officials and government ministers after she resisted their amorous
advances.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, is Sri Lanka's best hope in the 100- and
200-meter races in Bangkok.
	   If she wins medals in Bangkok, she faces the possibility of
having them stripped if the IAAF arbitration panel finds her guilty
of a doping offense.
	   Under IAAF rules, drug sanctions take effect from the date of
the positive test. If found guilty, all her results from last March
could be annulled.

Japanese brokerage to withdraw from several overseas markets

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nikko Securities Co., one of Japan's biggest
brokerages, announced Friday it will withdraw from several overseas
markets, the latest such retreat by recession-hit Japanese
financial institutions.
	   Nikko Securities, which became a unit of Citigroup Inc. in June,
said it will close 19 overseas branches, keeping scaled-down
branches in New York, London and Singapore, as part of a broad
cost-cutting effort.
	   ``As Nikko, we will totally withdraw from the securities
brokerage business overseas,'' said Takashi Yamamoto, Nikko senior
managing director.
	   Nikko workers will be cut by 2,000 from the current 11,000 by
next April, mainly by slashed hiring and early retirement, Kyodo
News agency said. Overseas staff will drop to 300 people from
1,160, Nikko said.
	   The local hires will be dismissed, and Japanese sent abroad will
be brought back, Nikko said.
	   At home, Nikko will merge a computer systems subsidiary with a
clerical unit by next March.
	   The changes, expected to cut costs 30 percent, will likely
result in a special parent loss of about 131 billion yen (dlrs 1.1
billion) for this fiscal year ending next March, it said. But Nikko
hopes to post a profit for the next fiscal year.
	   Recently, Mitsui Trust and Banking Co., Daiwa Bank and the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan have also announced plans to close
their foreign branches.
	   Travelers Group Inc., which later merged with Citicorp to create
Citigroup, stunned Japan's financial industry earlier this year
when it bought a 25 percent stake in Nikko Securities, the
country's third-largest brokerage, for dlrs 1.6 billion.

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ A Russian Proton booster rocket
carried the first part of the international space station into
orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international
space colonization.
	   Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control
announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket
and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
above the Earth.
	   ``Success,'' shouted one exultant official some 10 minutes after
the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit.
	   The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in
the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5
kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had
prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning
by the highly toxic rocket fuel.
	   Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was ``flawless'' and
the module performed well during initial tests. They cautioned that
much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station
project up and working.
	   ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space
walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual
respect ... the international space station is going to be a
reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after
the launch.
	   His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch was a
vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving
it could play a major role in space operations.
	   ``Today we made a truly epoch-making step to carry out this
project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is
perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the
international space station,'' he said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin sent a telegram to Koptev and his
colleagues, saying he was proud that Russia had launched the first
module of the new station.
	   ``The Russian rocket and space industry has again showed its
tremendous potential,'' Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The launch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the
cloudy sky above the central Asian steppes. The huge roar of the
rocket reverberated for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the
empty plain around the base.
	   The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with
space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to
ensure there were no problems.
	   Solar power panels on the module were successfully deployed
shortly after it reached its first orbit and all systems were
working normally, officials said.
	   The Russian and foreign space officials gathered at the
cosmodrome celebrated the successful launch with a sumptuous buffet
lunch.

KARACHI: civil rights.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``The step has been taken because the terrorists were becoming
more and more powerful,'' he said. ``We want to get Karachi out of
this hell.''
	   Sharif had accused his former ally, the Muttahida Qami Movement
(MQM), of most of the bloodletting in Karachi including last
month's murder of former governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM is comprised of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at
independence from Britain in 1947 and their descendants.
	   The MQM, which changed its name to Muttahida Qami Movement from
the Mohajir Qami Movement, is locked in a bloody conflict with its
dissident faction called the MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have
died in tit-for-tat killings by the militants of these two factions
in recent months. The party broke into two groups several years
ago.
	   The government has arrested 490 people for involvement in
terrorist activities since the imposition of governor's rule,
Sharif said.
	   Sharif said military courts are needed in Sindh because
``terrorists threatened the witnesses, judges and their families,''
	   ``It is also a part of Islamic justice which says speedy justice
should be provided at the door step. These courts will be a lesson
for the criminals and terrorists,'' he said.
	   Sharif asked the MQM to support government programs to stop the
violence in Karachi, but it refused. His party dismissed the Sindh
government on Oct. 30 and imposed federal rule _ a decision
bitterly criticized by opposition parties.
	   Senator Iqbal Haider, a member of the main opposition Pakistan
People's Party, said the decision was in total violation of the
constitution.
	   ``The government does not have any justification for this harsh
decision. It is a mini-martial law,'' he said.
	   A MQM spokesman Shoaib Bukhari said there won't be any justice
in the military courts.
	   ``The courts will decide cases in haste and will not provide any
speedy justice,'' he said.

	   MACAU (AP) _ A homemade bomb was thrown on the Macau Grand Prix
circuit during practice races Friday, but no one was injured,
police said.
	   The bomb exploded after several cars ran over it, sending nails
flying and damaging the tires of two vehicles.
	   Witnesses said the bomb was hurled by one of two people riding
on a motorcycle.
	   Officials closed off the 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) Guia Circuit
for 30 minutes. During a search of the circuit, police also found a
Russian-made grenade, which taken away for examination by bomb
exports.
	   The motive of the explosion was not known.
	   Macau, a popular gambling and tourist spot at the tip of south
China, has been hit recently with gangland-style shootings, arson
and other attacks.
	   Police have blamed the violence on Chinese gangs who are
fighting over payoffs from casinos, whose profits have been
shrinking because of Asia's economic downturn. The Portuguese
enclave returns to Chinese rule next year.
	   The two-day 45th Macao Grand Prix races begin Saturday. The
highlight of the event will be Sunday's Formula 3 race in which 30
drivers will be competing.

Pope takes tough line with Austrian bishops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II took a tough line Friday
with visiting bishops from Austria, dampening any hopes for change
in church policy demanded by an active Austrian reform movement.
	   ``The church is not a democracy, and no one from below can
decide on the truth,'' the pope told his bishops.
	   Lay people, he said, must not consider priests and bishops ``an
obsolete model'' with which the church can do without.
	   The Austrian church has been rocked by a sex scandal and demands
for reforms by a group called We are the Church, which has gathered
hundreds of thousands of signatures and has the support of some
bishops.
	   John Paul repeated church prohibitions against women priests,
divorce and abortion, positions he has indicated often he had no
intention of changing.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican.
	   Tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the country's
top church leader, acknowledged the conflicts within the church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.''
	   The traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by accusations that
a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican+'s handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of Austria's 8 million
people are Catholics, but only 20 percent attend church regularly
and 40,000 leave the church each year.

Kabila's stronghold, threat to overthrow him unless his gov't meets

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Congolese rebels, continuously snubbed
at peace talks by President Laurent Kabila, said Friday that unless
he comes to the negotiating table there will be no alternative to
his overthrow.
	   Rebel leader Bizima Karaha said the insurgents have enough
weapons to keep fighting until Kabila's government is toppled and
were ready to move on Kabila's traditional stronghold, the
southeastern Congolese town of Lubumbashi, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, made his comments to
reporters in Gabarone, where he and other rebel leaders were
meeting with officials from the few countries in the region not
involved in the three-month-long Congo war.
	   The rebels are demanding direct talks with Kabila, who did not
send representatives to the meeting.
	   Kabila came to power last year after leading a rebellion that
overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a
rebel force composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians who accuse Kabila of
corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   ``If Kabila continues to refuse to have direct talks with us, we
have enough capacity to simply do unto him what we did to Mobutu,''
Karaha said.
	   Kabila blames Rwanda and Uganda, who are backing the rebels, for
the war. Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad have sided with Kabila.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla hideouts after attacks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three guerrillas reported killed, Amal's denial,
Hezbollah bomb attack. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Friday following attacks on
Israeli outposts. Three guerrillas were reported killed.
	   Guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Amal group carried out the
attacks on Israeli and allied positions in the Israeli-occupied
border enclave early Friday, Lebanese security officials said.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said three guerrillas
were killed in the fighting. He did not identify their group. Amal,
however, denied any of its fighters were slain.
	   In response to the attacks, two Israeli jets fired two
air-to-surface missiles on a valley between the villages of Toulin
and Kabrigha, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Tyre, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 7 a.m. (5:00
GMT) air raid on the area, which is believed to be used by Lebanese
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said all the planes
returned safely to base after hitting targets.
	   Also Friday, Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb by
remote control as an Israeli infantry patrol traveled near the
Sojod outpost in Iqlim al-Tuffah, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Israeli troops and their allied militiamen retaliated by
shelling Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied zone. No casualties were reported in either attack.
	   Friday's air raid was the latest in a series of attacks launched
by Israeli warplanes almost daily on suspected Hezbollah bases in
the south since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   The attacks come at a time of heightened tension following a
Hezbollah roadside bombing near the border Monday which killed
three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The
casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Polish parliament begins NATO ratification debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament on Friday opened a debate on
ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty, a necessary legal step that
will allow Poland to join NATO next year.
	   The government-proposed resolution that would authorize
President Aleksander Kwasniewski to ratify the 1949 treaty,
received support from all political parties in parliament.
	   Speaking to reporters during a break, Kwasniewski stressed that
all NATO membership plans receive support from all major political
forces in Poland.
	   ``This is a guarantee that our entry into NATO is based on
strong political agreement and widespread social backing,'' said
Kwasniewski.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, has been
invited to join NATO on the pact's 50th anniversary in April, but
Polish leaders and NATO officials have hinted the new nations could
become members even earlier.
	   Presenting the draft, Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister in
the Solidarity-led government, said membership in the western
military alliance will give Poland a feeling of security and power.
	   Geremek stressed that NATO expansion will mean an end to the
Cold War era division of Europe established by the Allied
Conference in Yalta at the end of World War II, which put eastern
Europe under Soviet domination.
	   He also expressed hope that NATO will keep its door open for
other former communist nations in eastern Europe.
	   Ever since toppling the communists in 1989, Solidarity has
pushed for integration with Western security and economic
structures.
	   Poland is also among six nations currently negotiating
membership terms with the European Union.
	   Parliament is expected to take action on the bill during one of
its next sittings

U.N. repatriates Ethiopian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Friday it has
started flying about 5,000 Ethiopian refugees in Kenya to their
home country.
	   The refugees are being returned from Dadaab camp to Moyale in
Ethiopia, from where they will continue to their places of origin,
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said in Geneva.
	   Among them are older men and women who first fled Ethiopia for
neighboring Somalia in 1977.
	   In 1991, they joined thousands of Somalis in fleeing to Kenya.
Many of their children are now seeing their homeland for the first
time, Janowski said.
	   From now until the beginning of Ramadan, expected Dec. 20, the
United Nations plans to fly the 2,500 Ethiopians home, he said. The
remainder will be flown home after the month-long Muslim fast.
	   Each of the returnees will be given nine months of food aid and
dlrs 60 to assist with transport to their home villages or towns.
	   The agency said Kenya currently has about 186,000 refugees, down
from 420,000 in 1992 _ mostly from Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and
Uganda.

Kurdish rebel leader freed from custody

	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court Friday freed Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan from detention but ordered him to remain in Rome.
	   Ocalan has been held in a military hospital since he was
arrested last week upon arrival on a flight from Moscow.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition, while Ocalan has asked
Italy for political asylum.
	   The asylum request is under study but Italy's law prohibits it
from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the death
penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey, which considers him
a terrorist.
	   ``I am amazed,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, told
the AGI news agency. ``The head of a terrorist organization, a
notorious assassin is treated by your country like a welcome
guest.''
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insists he won't be intimidated
by Turkey.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told
reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Germany announced Wednesday that it would not seek the
extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany on
charges of terrorism since 1990.
	   In a written statement, Ocalan appealed to the thousands of
Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity to return
home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic
means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior which might
reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a
Kurdish spokesman in Rome, Akif Hasan.
	   Turkey has been furious over Italy's refusal to turn over
Ocalan. Turkish businesses have begun boycotting Italian goods in
response.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Ocalan heads a guerrilla movement which has fought a 14-year war
for autonomy in predominantly southeastern Turkey. Nearly 37,000
people have been killed.
	   Friday's court decision said Ocaalan will be free to move around
Rome but he will have to notify authorities of any plans to leave
his residence.

Swiss banks to pay out first part of Holocaust settlement Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's two largest banks will
pay out the first dlrs 250 million of a settlement with Holocaust
survivors and heirs on Monday, bank spokesmen announced Friday.
	   In August, UBS AG and Credit Suisse agreed to pay Holocaust
survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   The money will be held in an escrow account in the United
States, where it will earn normal interest, UBS spokesman Christoph
Meier said.
	   It will remain there pending a final decision on how the money
is distributed, Credit Suisse spokesman Ulrich Pfister said. That
decision must be authorized by a U.S. judge before anything can be
paid out to recipients, he added.
	   The banks' first payment is being made 90 days after the
settlement, in accordance with the August agreement, Meier said.
	   The rest of the money will be paid out in three yearly
installments.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   Discussions on outside contributions to the cost are still in
progress, Meier said. The Swiss National Bank, the central bank,
has refused to pay into the settlement.
	   For now UBS, the biggest bank, will pay two-thirds and Credit
Suisse the remaining one-third of the sum.

Israel begins troop pullback, held up by map problems

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Despite last-minute glitches, Israel
withdrew troops from parts of the northern West Bank on Friday,
fulfilling the first step of the new Mideast peace accord and
moving the Palestinians a step closer to statehood.
	   The withdrawal was already well under way when Palestinians
raised questions about last-minute changes Israel made in the
redeployment map. The pullback was put on hold and only resumed two
hours later, after a meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and the Israeli troop commander in the West Bank.
	   The map incident was only the lasted hiccup in the
implementation of the Wye River peace agreement which has been
marred by delays and bitter disputes. ``We have to exert maximum
efforts to build the trust required between the two of us,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The pullback gives Arafat full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, or 510 square kilometers
(204 square miles) and takes him a step closer to his final goal _
statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by erstwhile hawkish allies who oppose
land concessions and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu
reportedly is considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy
heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners, including 150
criminals, drawing complaints from the Palestinians who demanded
that all those freed be security prisoners.
	   ``It's a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' said
Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs. Abdel Razek stayed home, instead of
greeting returnees arriving by bus at the Nahal Oz crossing between
Israel and Gaza.
	   Mahmoud Obeid, a TV cameraman, was filming the arrivals when he
recognized one of the prisoners as his brother Ahmed, whom he had
last seen 11 years ago. Obeid dropped his camera, ran to his
brother, a security prisoner, and hugged and kissed him.
	   Israel and the Palestinians also signed a protocol for the
operation of the Palestinian international airport in Gaza. Arafat
said the airport would open Tuesday with a flight from Cairo
carrying Egyptian government officials, the Palestinian news agency
Wafa said. Planes from Morocco, Jordan, Spain and Holland were to
follow, Wafa said.
	   The Israeli redeployment began Friday morning.
	   Israeli army trucks loaded with 130 red-and-yellow border
markers left the Dotan army base south of the Palestinian town of
Jenin and drove to road junctions to demarcate the new borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   At the end of the withdrawal, an additional 36 smaller towns and
villages had come under full Palestinian control, said Palestinian
police commander Brig. Gen. Ismail Jaber.
	   The Palestinian Authority already has full control over the
seven West Bank cities and has joint jurisdiction with Israel in
some 400 villages.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000, Palestinian police made a
triumphant entry Friday afternoon. A convoy of more than a dozen
police cars drove through the main street and officers shot their
Kalashnikov assault rifles in the air.
	   Thousands watched the arrival, but the despite the momentary
festiveness, many remained skeptical. ``Outside of town, there are
still Israeli checkpoints. So what will change?'' said Khalil Abu
Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby coffee shop.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``If life becomes intolerable and dangerous, and there is even a
chance that a child will be killed or injured, I think we should
seriously consider leaving, provided the government will compensate
us,'' said Ovadia Yaacov, 48, a retired army officer and father of
three who lives in the Ganim settlement which after the pullback
was surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the
land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint
jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, or
about the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had difficulties keeping his hard-line allies on board.
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Jewish settler leader Aharon
Domb, a former Netanyahu supporter, wrote in Yediot.

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The touring West Indies
recovered from the loss of two early wickets _ including that of
captain Brian Lara _ to be 101 for two wickets at lunch Friday
against the Free State provincial team.
	   On the first day of their four-day match, West Indies won the
toss and elected to bat. An early slump to 45 for two was redeemed
by Clayton Lambert, who was undefeated on 57, and Shivnarine
Chanderpaul on 29 by lunch.
	   Big-hitting opener Philo Wallace was the first to go for 11,
giving the young Victor Mpistsang his first international wicket.
Lara got the faintest of edges, caught behind by Morne van Wyk off
the bowling of Herman Bakkes for 10.
	   The partnership to lift the West Indies from their precarious
position was a brisk one, with Lambert slowly increasing the pace.
Chanderpaul started briskly, but then retreated into a more
defensive mode.

Opposition likely winner in the second round of Senate elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The second round of the Senate
elections began Friday, with one third of 81 seats at stake and the
opposition a likely winner.
	   The opposition Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus
advanced 22 out of 27 candidates to the second round, the most of
any party competing.
	   The governing Social Democrats are in runner-up position with 15
candidates in the second round, a showing they called
dissapointing.
	   A coalition of four opposition center-right parties led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union finished third with 14
candidates, while the Communists made it in three districts.
	   Turnout in the first round was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than
in the first Senate elections in 1996.
	   Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to win the election
outright last Friday and Saturday or face a run-off between the two
top finishers.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent in the
first-round vote, meaning runoff elections were necessary in all 27
districts.
	   Unofficial results were expected late Saturday.
	   Before the vote, the conservative Civic Democratic Party
controlled 29 seats in the Senate. Twelve of those seats are up for
grabs in the current vote.
	   The Social Democrats had 26 Senators, with six up for
re-election.
	   The rest of the seats were held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, The Freedom Union and the
Communists.
	   The Senate vote is in part considered a test of support for the
minority Social Democratic Cabinet of Premier Milos Zeman.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general elections in June produced a one-party minority government
which only survived in Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the
runner-up, the Civic Democratic Party.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopeted
by the lower chamber.
	   It was created as a safety mechanism to ensure the country could
function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can pass laws,
except laws on budget and constitution, should the 200-seat lower
chamber be dissolved.
	   Since its formation in 1996, the Senate has been criticized by
all members of the political spectrum for not being effective
enough.
	   Several parties, including the Communists and the
ultra-nationalist Republican, have evn called for its abolition.

	   FLESQUIERES, France (AP) _ Archeologists unearthing a World War
I British tank discovered under a vegetable patch scraped and
shoveled for a second day Friday, pulling canned goods, wine
bottles and other vestiges of the Great War from its rusty carcass
	   Dozens of young and old crowded around the site on the edge of
this northern French town to witness the slow, meticulous removal
of red earth from the war machine abandoned by the British in 1917,
then turned into a bunker by the Germans.
	   By Friday, it was fully exposed, though still sitting in a hole.
	   Rusty and twisted from its 81 years underground, the Mark IV
tank is a chilling reminder of the Battle of Cambrai, near this
farm town by the Belgian border, one of the bloodiest conflicts of
World War I.
	   British troops abandoned the tank on Nov. 20, 1917. German
soldiers then buried it for use as a bunker.
	   As the dig progressed, details of the lives of soldiers at war
emerged: a corroded can of corn beef, a bullet-ridden water
canteen, a whisky flask and wine bottles.
	   Archeologists stacked flat British helmets atop rounded German
ones.
	   On Thursday, they uncovered British and German silverware, lamps
and helmets, as well as unexploded grenades.
	   ``World War I can often feel distant to us,'' said Alan Venthon,
48, an accountant, who made the trip here from his home in Redhill,
Britain, to witness the dig.
	   ``But to find a mechanical device like this makes the war much
easier to imagine late in the 20th century.''
	   A ceremony featuring bagpipers was planned later Friday to
commemorate British war dead. A military attache from the British
Embassy was to preside. A British cemetery is perched on a hill
here.
	   Cambrai was the battle that proved the potential of the tank as
an effective military weapon. The Germans took over abandoned
British tanks and used them to develop their own tanks before the
end of the war.
	   This tank is Philippe Gorczynski's reward for his tireless
scouring and digging across northern France.
	   Gorczynski, a 38-year-old hotel owner from Cambrai, discovered
the tank Nov. 5 under 2.5 meters (8 feet) of soil after years of
talking to residents, pouring over battle maps and aerial photos.
He had dug in about 20 places before finally sinking his spade in
the right spot.
	   ``The tank will be the most effective kind of monument because
it comes from the battle field. There are monuments to the war all
over France, but they aren't from the battle field.''
	   The team of blue-helmeted archaeologists was expected to
officially raise the tank, using a crane, on Nov. 20, to mark the
day the tank changed hands.

Pope takes tough line with Austrian bishops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct category code &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II took a tough line Friday
with visiting bishops from Austria, dampening any hopes for change
in church policy demanded by an active Austrian reform movement.
	   ``The church is not a democracy, and no one from below can
decide on the truth,'' the pope told his bishops.
	   Lay people, he said, must not consider priests and bishops ``an
obsolete model'' with which the church can do without.
	   The Austrian church has been rocked by a sex scandal and demands
for reforms by a group called We are the Church, which has gathered
hundreds of thousands of signatures and has the support of some
bishops.
	   John Paul repeated church prohibitions against women priests,
divorce and abortion, positions he has indicated often he had no
intention of changing.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican.
	   Tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the country's
top church leader, acknowledged the conflicts within the church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.''
	   The traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by accusations that
a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican+'s handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of Austria's 8 million
people are Catholics, but only 20 percent attend church regularly
and 40,000 leave the church each year.

Egyptian share prices caught in a 22-month downward trend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Despite government attempts to calm jittery
investors, Egypt's fledgling stock market has been caught in a
downward trend that shows no signs of ending.
	   Touted as a showcase of the country's shift to market economy
after decades of socialism, Egypt's market enjoyed a seven-month
rally. It ended in February 1997 after prices surged by as much as
150 percent. An overdue correction movement then set in, but nearly
two years later prices are down by a staggering 45 percent.
	   Speaking to The Associated Press, market traders and analysts
blamed a host of reasons for the market's doldrums: the financial
turmoil in Asia, the November 1997 massacre of 58 tourists in
southern Egypt, lower oil prices and institutional investors
avoiding emerging markets after the Russian and Asian contagions.
	   ``It is all psychological,'' said Amr Dabous, a technical
analyst with market consultants Momentum Wavers. ``But many people
have lost their faith in the market.''
	   Dabous, like others, say they are somewhat puzzled by the
market's behavior in view of Egypt's impressive macroeconomic
performance, the profitability of listed companies and the smooth
progress of the government's ambitious privatization program.
	   Investors who have put their money in the large flour-milling
industry, for example, have seen up to 70 percent of their
investments wiped out since February 1997. Ironically, the same
investors have received dividends of up to 12 percent, three
percentage points above interest rates given by banks.
	   ``The market is still good for long-term investors,'' said Radi
El-Hilow, a trader with the Cairo-based brokerage Trust Securities.
	   The traders and analysts said it was difficult to gauge the
impact of the turmoil in emerging markets on the Egyptian stock
market except in very general terms.
	   They all, however, suspect that there has been some flight of
foreign funds as part of institutional investors' policies to
reduce exposure in emerging markets worldwide. But the government
says foreign investments in the market rose by dlrs 800 million in
the past nine months to reach dlrs 1.9 million.
	   Official figures show that 21 percent of buyers and 23 percent
of sellers in the market during the first half of 1998 were
attributed to foreign investors.
	   ``There has not been an exodus of foreign funds, but there has
certainly not been an influx of fresh money,'' countered Khaled
Ikram, the World Bank's representative in Egypt.
	   There are no official figures available on the size of foreign
funds in the stock market, which lists 700 stocks of which 50 to
100 are considered by leading brokerages to be actively traded.
	   Market capitalization stood at 74 billion pounds (dlrs 21.7
billion) at the end of July this year.
	   ``This is just a cycle,'' said Dabous of Momentum Wavers. ``I
assure you that one year from now the picture will be different.''
	   Not everyone agrees.
	   ``We need to see reforms in the financial sector and higher
economic growth,'' said David Shelby, an analyst with major
brokerage and investment bankers EFG-Hermes.

	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court Friday freed Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan from detention but ordered him to remain in Rome.
	   Ocalan has been held in a military hospital since he was
arrested last week upon arrival on a flight from Moscow.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition, while Ocalan has asked
Italy for political asylum.
	   The asylum request is under study but Italy's law prohibits it
from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the death
penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey, which considers him
a terrorist.
	   ``I am amazed,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, told
the AGI news agency. ``The head of a terrorist organization, a
notorious assassin is treated by your country like a welcome
guest.''
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insists he won't be intimidated
by Turkey.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told
reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Germany announced Wednesday that it would not seek the
extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany on
charges of terrorism since 1990.
	   In a written statement, Ocalan appealed to the thousands of
Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity to return
home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic
means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior which might
reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a
Kurdish spokesman in Rome, Akif Hasan.
	   Turkey has been furious over Italy's refusal to turn over
Ocalan. Turkish businesses have begun boycotting Italian goods in
response.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Ocalan heads a guerrilla movement which has fought a 14-year war
for autonomy in predominantly southeastern Turkey. Nearly 37,000
people have been killed.
	   Friday's court decision said Ocaalan will be free to move around
Rome but he will have to notify authorities of any plans to leave
his residence.

Former head of Austrian nationalized industries is found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hugo-Michael Sekyra, the former head of
the Austrian nationalized industries, Friday was found dead in his
downtown apartment. Police said they are virtually certain it was
suicide.
	   Sekyra, 57, was found dead, ``sitting on his sofa, with a
hunting rifle next to him,'' Michael Edelbacher, a senior police
official told The Associated Press.
	   He said Sekyra , who headed or was partner in several companies,
had financial problems, adding he had told two different people he
would put an end to his life if one of the companies, which is in
trouble, would go bankrupt.
	   Among his functions, Sekyra headed the supervisory board of
Boehler-Uddeholm, an engineering enterprise. He was director
general of OIAG, the holding company of the nationalized
industries, in the 1986-93 period.

Munich to stage 1999 IAAF Grand Prix Final; Qatar favorite for 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Munich was selected Friday to stage
next year's IAAF Grand Prix Final, the culminating event of the
lucrative Golden League series.
	   Munich was chosen by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation at its annual Council meeting in Monaco. The event will
be staged on Sept. 11 or Sept. 12.
	   The Golden League, which was introduced last season, will return
in 1999 with meets in Oslo (June 30), Rome (July 7), Monte Carlo
(Aug. 4), Zurich (Aug. 11), Brussels (Sept. 1) and Berlin (Sept.
8).
	   All six Golden League meets will take place on Wednesday nights
in order to make the events easier to package for television.
	   Just as last year, a dlrs 1 million jackpot is on offer for any
athlete or athletes winning their event at all Golden League meets
and the Grand Prix final.
	   The jackpot was shared last season by American sprinter Marion
Jones and distance runners Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia.
	   The IAAF said Friday that Qatar is a ``strong candidate'' to
stage the Grand Prix Final in 2000.
	   The Doha meet was elevated to Grand Prix status for 1999
following this year's historic meet in which, for the first time,
women were allowed to compete in an international track and field
competition in the Gulf region.
	   No final decision was taken, meanwhile, on proposals to
downgrade the status of Britain's only two IAAF outdoor meets.
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the Grand Prix commission
recommended demotion of the Gateshead and Sheffield meets ``because
the level of results and organization was very low last year.''
	   But British organizers promised improvements and IAAF president
Primo Nebiolo said he would monitor the situation before a final
decision was made.
	   In other developments, the IAAF council decided to set mininum
qualifying standards for women's pole vault and women's hammer
throw at next year's World Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   The events are being introduced at the worlds for the first
time. The IAAF had previously planned to invite the top 12 ranked
athletes in each event to compete in Seville.
	   The IAAF also decided to introduce the women's 3,000 meter
steeplechase on the continental level in 2000, and consider the
event for possible inclusion at the 2003 World Championships.

No assault charges against cop four months after he beat his wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Assault charges cannot be filed against a
Kenyan police officer who savagely beat his wife four months ago
until police received a medical report, a police official said
Friday.
	   And the medical report has to include comments from the woman,
who remains in serious condition in Kenyatta Hospital, unable to
speak, four months after the July 31 beating.
	   ``I confirmed today the medical report cannot be done until the
victim recovers,'' said senior Nairobi police official Gabriel
Thinwa. ``The patient is not talking, and this where the main
evidence is expected to come from.''
	   Thinwa denied newspaper and television reports that police have
failed to take action against Constable Felix Nthinwa Munyao.
	   ``We have completed our investigations, and at present Officer
Munyao had been interdicted (suspended) pending court action,''
said Thinwa, who is Munyuo's commanding officer.
	   No charges have been filed against another police officer who
doused his girlfriend with parrafin last month and set her afire
after a quarrel. The woman died of burns.
	   Thinwa said police have established that Munyuo had a quarrel
with his wife Betty Kavata during which she was seriously beaten
and later hospitalized.
	   The Daily Nation on Friday quoted doctors as saying only divine
intervention could save her life.
	   ``The patient's memory is gone. Her chances of survival are
minimal,'' the newspaper quoted her doctor as saying.
	   Wife-beating is common throughout Kenya, and sociologists and
criminologists say it is on the rise, partly because of Kenya's
worsening economic situation.
	   The private Coalition of Violence Against Women plans to launch
a 16-day awareness campaign Wednesday to highlight violence against
women and girls in the East African nation.

Britain ready to propose tougher hooligan laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is proposing new laws to crack down on
soccer hooligans, racist fans and ticket scalpers.
	   The measures, expected to be in place next season, have been
called the toughest in the world by government officials.
	   The plans for toughening up on soccer-related violence come in
the wake of disturbances at this year's World Cup in France, where
English troublemakers clashed with police and rival fans.
	   There have also been violent outbursts on the pitch this season
in English soccer. In one incident, Sheffield Wednesday player
Paolo Di Canio pushed a referee to the ground. In another, West Ham
striker John Hartson kicked teammate Eyal Berkovic in the head in a
practice session.
	   The measures, as reported in British newspapers, are to be
unveiled next week by the Home Office. They include:
	   _ increased fines and exclusion orders blocking known
troublemakers from soccer matches in Britain.
	   _ restrictions on ticket sales to keep scalpers from obtaining
tickets of matches abroad.
	   _ moves to make racist chants criminal offenses.
	   _ increased powers to bar unconvicted but known hooligans from
traveling to matches abroad.
	   The crackdown, called for in a report earlier this year by
former government minister David Mellor, is also aimed at helping
England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup against competition from
South Africa and Germany.
	   An unidentified Home Office official, quoted in Friday's Daily
Mail, said pressure would be put on league officials to crack down
on player violence on the field.
	   ``There is little point in us telling fans how to behave and
weeding out the troublesome element if they see players essentially
getting away with things,'' the paper cited the source as saying.
	   ``Players misbehaving on the pitch inevitably give the
impression to fans that it is OK to misbehave. We want to see
player and the F.A. setting an example.''

 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUJRANWALA, Pakistan (AP) _ Captain Aamir Sohail returned to top
form with a strokeful 91 as Pakistan cruised to a four-wicket win
over Zimbabwe in the first one-day International of the three-match
series at Jinnah Stadium Friday.
	   Sohail, who made just 41 against Australia in Pakistan's 3-0
drubbing in the limited overs series 10 days ago, played a pivotal
role as the home team achieved the victory target of 238 with 2.2
overs to spare.
	   ``We didn't make enough runs. I think we were short by 50 runs
on a 280-run wicket.'' said Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell.
	   ``We should have had capitalized on Neil Johnson and Grant
Flower's good start, but unfortunately our middle-order could not
keep the momentum going,'' he said.
	   However, Campbell was confident of his team's victory against
Pakistan in the second match on Sunday. ``If we want to keep the
series alive we have to win the next game and I am confident our
players can do it.''
	   Inform Yousuf Youhanna made a sedate unbeaten 55 to go along
with his two previous innings of 100 and 92 against Aussies with
Azhar Mahmood remaining undefeated on 17 and brought the victory
with a boundary off Heath Streak.
	   Grant Flower briefly revived Zimbabweans hopes when he removed
Sohail and one-day sensation Shahid Afridi in space of five
deliveries with Pakistan still requiring 93 runs for victory in
nearly 17 overs.
	   Flower with his occasional left-arm spin had Sohail caught by
Paul Strang at backward square leg in the 31st over and then Afridi
skied the ball into the safe hands of Eddo Brandes in the deep
after making just two.
	   Sohail, who reached his half century off 63 balls, hit nine
fours and a six off Brandes' medium pace before he was out after
facing 105 balls.
	   ``It's not a big thing that I have missed the century, as long
as the team wins it's more important for me,'' Man of the Match
Sohail said, who looked a relieved man after tasting defeats both
in the Test and one-day series against Australia.
	   With Pakistan looking in some trouble at 145 for five in the
33rd over, Moin Khan entertained a capacity crowd of 20,000, with
his enterprising 35 off 26 balls, hitting four fours and a six
which helped the home team to come out of a mini collapse.
	   Pakistan was strengthened with the inclusion of dashing
left-handed opener Saeed Anwar, who had to sit out from the one-day
series against Steve Waugh's Australia due to stomach ailment.
	   Anwar gave Pakistan a rollicking start of 60 off 77 deliveries
with Sohail before off-spinner Andrew Whittall had him clean bowled
in his first over for 19.
	   Inzamamul Haq also returned to Pakistan fold after missing the
series against Australia due to toe injury, but was out for just
three when he attempted to take a needless third run off a strong
Craig Wishart's throw from deep third man.
	   Streal gave away 49 runs for the wickets of Ijaz Ahmed (4) and
Khan (35) while Grant Flower chipped in with similar number of
scalps for 17.
	   Earlier, Pakistan spinners Saqlain Mushtaq and Afridi shared
seven wickets in between them as Zimbabwe was dismissed for 237 in
the last over.
	   Off-spinner Mushtaq claimed two wickets each in his two spells
to finish with four for 35 and Afridi, the leg-spinner, chipped in
with three wickets for 45 as Zimbabwe failed to cash in on a good
start.
	   Neil Johnson and Grant Flower gave the visitors a flying start
of 75 runs off 80 deliveries after Sohail won the toss and elected
to field.
	   Flower departed in the 14th over off a doubtful caught behind
decision after making 26 off 44 balls. TV replays showed that
paceman Shoaib Akhtar's delivery did not touch Flower's bat.
Although the bowler did not appeal, umpire Nazir Junior ruled out
Flower.
	   Mushtaq, removed Craig Evans (5) and Andy Flower (4) in his
third and fourth overs as Zimbabwe innings failed to gain momentum
after 20th over. In between these two wickets, Wasim Akram
brilliantly ran out Murray Goodwin, who scored 16.
	   Johnson kept one end intact and made a resolute career-best 74,
surpassing his previous best of 72 against Sri Lanka in last week's
Champions Trophy Tournament at Sharjah.
	   The 28-year-old left-hander hit four fours during his 99-ball
innings before he was smartly caught by Akram at backward square
leg off Sohail in the 32nd over.
	   Captain Alistair Campbell tried to lift the run-rate but
Zimbabwe managed to get 61 in the last 10 overs. Campbell made a
defiant 42 off 57 deliveries before was caught by Akram at covers
to become one of Afridi's three victims.
	   Saqlain then wrapped up the innings when he had last man Eddo
Brandes stumped by Moin Khan in the last over.
	   Sohail bowled a steady 10-over spell and conceded 37 for the key
scalp of Johnson.

Canadian vows to run again, complains of treatment by Canada
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HERZLYIA, Israel (AP) _ Runner Ben Johnson told high school
students Friday that he lost his right to compete because he ``went
with the flow'' and took performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of Argentinean soccer star
Diego Maradona, who has also been suspended for drug use, Johnson
presented something of a mixed message.
	   On the one hand, he warned the 300 teen-agers packed into the
Ben Gurion High School gymnasium here that taking drugs ``can harm
you in the long run.
	   ``As a kid, I didn't know much better. I kind of went with the
flow. If I had discipline it would not have happened,'' he said.
``Don't make the mistake I did.''
	   On the other hand, Johnson was clearly bitter.
	   He suggested to the students that he had been singled out
unfairly and that Canada did not back him up when he was stripped
of his gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive
for steroids.
	   In an interview, he said ``all the top athletes'' used steroids
10 years ago, and many still do.
	   ``They had to pick on somebody, and they picked on me,'' he said
in the speech about his Olympics experience.
	   ``If I was from Britain or the United States my country would
have protected me.''
	   Johnson was banned for life from track and field in 1993 after
failing another drug test.
	   Even so, Johnson said he trains 20 to 25 hours a week and hopes
to compete in the year 2000 Olympics in Australia.
	   ``I can still run just as fast as before,'' Johnson said in an
interview. But time is running out with Johnson facing his 37th
birthday next month.
	   ``I want to return to track and field as fast as possible. At
36, I haven't much time left although I feel like a 20 year old,''
he added.
	   His manager, Morris Chrobotek, said there was a possibility that
Johnson could run for another country and said there were at least
10 countries that might accept Johnson. He named Israel, the United
States and Japan as possibilities.
	   ``He is striving to come back and prove to the world that he can
do it clean,'' said Chrobotek, noting Johnson had applied to the
Athletics Canada to reinstate him as a runner and cancel the
lifetime ban.
	   Johnson, in Israel as a guest of the Macabbieh Athletic
Association in Tel Aviv, ran 50-meter sprints with some of the
students after the speech, allowing some to win. He also gave
pointers on take off to the young runners.
	   ``I was very excited to meet this man. I remember him so well
from when I was small,'' said Ilan Ziv, 17.

Prime Minister declares state of emergency to end violence in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister declared a
state of emergency in a southern province and ordered the army to
quell violence that has killed more than 1,000 people in the port
city of Karachi.
	   Sharif announced setting up of military courts in Karachi _ the
provincial capital of the Sindh province_ to try those behind the
violence. These courts will decide cases within days, not weeks and
months, he said.
	   ``The decision has been taken to protect lives of the people and
is in the larger interest of the city and the country,'' he said.
	   Sharif last month dismissed the elected provincial government of
Sindh after widespread political violence killed more than 1,000
people in Karachi this year, paralyzing economic activity.
	   The prime minister invoked Article 245 of the constitution,
which allows the suspension of civil rights.
	   ``The step has been taken because the terrorists were becoming
more and more powerful,'' he said. ``We want to get Karachi out of
this hell.''
	   Sharif had accused his former ally, the Muttahida Qami Movement
(MQM), of most of the bloodletting in Karachi including last
month's murder of former governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM, which changed its name to Muttahida Qami Movement from
the Mohajir Qami Movement, is locked in a bloody conflict with its
dissident faction called the MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have
died in tit-for-tat killings by the militants of these two factions
in recent months. The party broke into two groups several years
ago.
	   The MQM is comprised of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at
independence from Britain in 1947 and their descendants.
	   The government has arrested 490 people for involvement in
terrorist activities since the imposition of governor's rule,
Sharif said.
	   But Sharif said military courts are needed in Sindh because
``terrorists threatened the witnesses, judges and their families,''
	   ``It is also a part of Islamic justice which says speedy justice
should be provided at the door step. These courts will be a lesson
for the criminals and terrorists,'' he said.
	   Sharif asked the MQM to support government programs to stop the
violence in Karachi, but it refused. His party dismissed the Sindh
government on Oct. 30 and imposed federal rule _ a decision
bitterly criticized by opposition parties.
	   Senator Iqbal Haider, a member of the main opposition Pakistan
People's Party, said the decision was in total violation of the
constitution.
	   ``The government does not have any justification for this harsh
decision. It is a mini-martial law,'' he said.
	   A MQM spokesman Shoaib Bukhari said there won't be any justice
in the military courts.
	   ``The courts will decide cases in haste and will not provide any
speedy justice,'' he said.

Palestinian land confiscated for Jewish settlement roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 9 to FIX grammar &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YITMA, West Bank (AP) _ Twenty years ago, Khalil Eid planted
rows of olive trees on a rocky plot of land in his West Bank
village.
	   As the trees flourished, so did Eid's livelihood. He took the
olives to family presses and sold bottles of oil.
	   On Thursday, the 58-year-old Palestinian farmer watched from a
wind-swept hillside while Israeli bulldozers and mechanical shovels
ripped a swath of village land and uprooted his olive grove.
	   The bulldozers, guarded by Israeli troops, were clearing land
for 13 bypass roads crisscrossing the West Bank and linking Jewish
settlements that eventually will be surrounded by Palestinian
territory.
	   Israel says the roads are necessary for settlers' security.
After agreeing to hand over some West Bank land, it announced last
week it would confiscate thousands more acres (hectares) of
Arab-owned land for highways.
	   Palestinians say the roads will reinforce Israel's hold over the
area and make it nearly impossible to divide the land for a future
Palestinian state.
	   ``I look at the West Bank in the year 2005 and I see that it
will look like Swiss cheese,'' said Khalil Tufjaki, chief
cartographer for the Palestinian Authority. Most of the West Bank,
home to 1.6 million Palestinians and 150,000 Israelis, will be
sliced-up for bypass roads under the Israeli plan, he said.
	   Palestinian official Nabil Amr called the land expropriations
``provocative,'' and correctly predicted violence.
	   In the village of al-Khader near Bethlehem, Israeli troops
clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers last weekend when clearing
began there for a road connecting Jerusalem with the Jewish
settlement of Efrat.

Six Chechen policemen freed in neighboring region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six Chechen policemen who disappeared from their
post over the weekend were freed on Friday by security forces, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The six were serving along the border between the regions of
Chechnya and Ingushetia in Russia's troubled Caucasus region when
they went missing.
	   No details of the Ingush security operation to free the
policemen were provided, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Ingushetia has been torn by violence resulting from ethnic
strife with nearby North Ossetia. It has also suffered a spillover
of violence and kidnappings from breakaway Chechnya, where rebels
fought a 1994-96 independence war with Russia.

Parisian woman found dead of starvation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A 26-year-old woman was found dead from starvation
in her Paris apartment, and her sister, found with her, was
suffering from acute malnutrition, police said Friday.
	   Police said rescue workers called to the apartment in southern
Paris found the body of Malika, whose last name was not released,
on Thursday. Her sister, Nadia, 32, who was in the apartment at the
time, was hospitalized in an advanced state of malnutrition.
	   Nadia told rescue workers that her sister had had no income for
several months and that the family was unable to help buy food,
according to police.
	   Further details were not immediately available. It was not
immediately clear who alerted rescue workers to the situation.
Police said an investigation was underway.
	   Meanwhile, French radio reported that frigid temperatures took
the life on Friday of a homeless man near one of the city's major
hospitals, Cochin, also in southern Paris.
	   According to a witness who spoke on Europe I radio, the man died
because emergency social services refused to come get him. The
witness was identified only as Michelle.
	   She said she called several emergency numbers and was turned
away and redirected to a new service each time.
	   She said the man was still alive when firefighters arrived.
	   ''He was still alive because they told him, 'no, no, don't move.
Don't be afraid,''' she told Europe I.
	   ``Unfortunately, he died.''

Ho-ho-no! Britain faces Santa shortage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It seems the Santa Claus business in Britain has
fallen on lean times.
	   One of the country's largest suppliers of Santa Clauses reports
a serious shortage of actors aspiring to play the jolly old elf
this year _ a problem partly blamed on healthier eating trends.
	   The Ministry of Fun, a London-based entertainment agency,
demands that its Santas be convincing _ which means an authentic
fat belly is required. ``Kids can spot padding,'' agency director
Julian Pearson says.
	   But fewer Santas are measuring up this year.
	   ``They're eating salads and everything like this,'' Pearson
says. ``This is not what we want. We need to fatten them up.''
	   Pearson faces finding Santas for about 470 engagements, ranging
from store appearances to magazine shoots, in the weeks leading up
to Christmas. So far, he's got only about 30 working, fewer than in
previous years.
	   The demand for Santas is especially high this season, so Pearson
says he's even scanned ads in actors' trade newspapers trying to
recruit older, portly actors _ preferably with their own white
beards.
	   But most physically suitable thespians refuse to subject
themselves to the rigors of being Kris Kringle, he says.
	   Francine Estry Elkinson's Manchester marketing agency also is
deperately seeking suitable Santas. She agrees older actors with
the right look and voice tend to be weight-conscious, which means
they don't fill out the suit properly.
	   ``I think everybody is facing the same sort of thing,'' she says
of the shortage.
	   Pearson says he'll take amateurs who look the part, but
applicants must audition, and most don't make the cut.
	   For the ones who do, the pay isn't bad _ about 100 pounds (dlrs
167) for a few hours of spreading good cheer.
	   ``It's a huge job,'' Pearson says. ``It's the most magical job
in the world.''

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A sea of mostly impoverished Romanians
lined up outside the presidential palace, waiting in the freezing
cold for their chance to see their president, media reported
Friday.
	   But despite falling living standards, the 5,000 people who
pushed and shoved their way inside the palace gates weren't calling
for the resignation of President Emil Constantinescu and his
government. They were well-wishers who wanted to kiss his cheek on
his 59th birthday.
	   While thousands of people across the country marched in the
streets Thursday, protesting Constantinescu's failure to retool the
economy along market lines, the president received his guests _ and
their kisses _ in a large marble drawing room with hand-woven
carpets.
	   Greeting people, Constantinescu acknowledged times were hard.
	   ``I can't do too much for you, but I can try to respond to the
love and faith you have in me,'' said Constantinescu as people
broke into a spontaneous ``Happy Birthday.''
	   Some people brought huge bouquets. Others brought him letters
asking for help with their hardships.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile gave the president an antique sword
and a group of students brought him a tank of 59 turtles _ a wish
for a long life.
	   The director of pro-government daily Ziua published a letter
Friday congratulating Constantinescu on his birthday, in a style
reminiscent of fawning letters sent to former communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed in 1989.
	   Under Ceausescu, people were forced to wish the leader a happy
birthday.
	   Former President Ion Iliescu opened the presidential palace and
offered well-wishers a glass of champagne on his birthday, and
Constantinescu has carried on the tradition.
	   Explaining the fervor, Tudor Oltean, a former government
official said: ``Romanians like to use any occasion for kissing and
bowing, to show how faithful and obedient they are,'' he said.
``After that, they are faithful to the next person in power.''

Turin club worried about safety in Istanbul, Italian fans to stay
</HEADLINE>
home &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Citing growing tensions between Italy and
Turkey, Italian league champion Juventus said Friday no Italian
fans will be accompanying the team to its championship league match
in Istanbul.
	   Italy and Turkey are locked in a standoff over a Turkish Kurd
rebel leader arrested in Rome last week. Feeling is running strong
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to immediately send him back for
trial as a terrorist.
	   The Turin team's safety in Istanbul is ``a big worry,'' Juventus
manager Luciano Moggi acknowledged Friday.
	   While the club is ready to play Galatasaray on Wednesday, it
said no fan will be traveling to Turkey to support the team.
	   ``Members of the VIP club, which usually travel with the team,
will also stay home. Only players and team officials will go to
Istanbul,'' said a spokesman for the team, who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name.
	   He refused to say if it was an independent decision by the fans'
clubs or a move ordered for security reasons.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema, who had been initially invited
to watch the game in Istanbul, also gave up the trip.
	   Europe's governing body for soccer, UEFA, said a final decision
about whether to play next week's match would be made Monday.
	   ``We are ready to play, under condition security is guaranteed.
We will stick to UEFA's decision,'' the club spokesman said.
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi was quoted by Milan's sports daily
Gazzetta dello Sport as saying ``we hope we don't go to Turkey.''
	   Juventus, which needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep
alive its qualifying chances, clearly would prefer to play the
match on a neutral field rather than at home of the Turkish
champion.
	   With four draws in as many games of Group B, Juventus' chances
to reach its fourth final since 1996 are in jeopardy. Galatasaray
is the group leader.
	   The Turin team is owned by the Agnelli family, which controls
Italy's Fiat auto giant.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police burst into a dissident's home Friday in
eastern China, breaking up a political meeting and taking him and
three other activists away, a human rights group said.
	   The police in the city of Hangzhou also searched Wu Yilong's
home and seized a fax machine, an address book and documents, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Wu and the three others had met to discuss affairs related to a
political party set up by dissidents in June to challenge the
ruling Communist Party, the Hong Kong-based group reported.
	   Chinese authorities have refused dissidents' requests to
register the China Democracy Party, as required by law, and
detained and questioned dozens of its supporters, mostly for short
periods of time.
	   Apart from Wu, the police detained Wang Rongqing, also from
Hangzhou, and Yao Zhenxian and Li Guotao, who arrived in Hangzhou
on Friday morning from Shanghai, about 180 kilometers (110 miles)
to the northeast, the Information Center said.
	   It said the four dissidents' whereabouts were unknown.

U.N. weapons teams in Iraq inspect on Muslim Sabbath

	    &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams went into the field for
the third consecutive day on Friday, usually a day of rest in the
Muslim world.
	   ``We're going to be working seven days a week,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
weapons inspections. ``We want to get on with things and get as
much done in as short a period of time as possible.''
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts.
	   Neither side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons
inspectors returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been
evacuated last week amid fears of a U.S. missile strike.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will
lift the trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The inspectors, who generally have not worked on Friday, the
Muslim Sabbath, refused to talk with reporters. Ms. Cross would not
say where they were going.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''
	   In sermons at Friday prayers, mosque preachers addressed the
standoff that almost led to the American attack.
	   ``We thank God that the crisis ended,'' said Imam Bakr
al-Samerai at the Abdel-Khader al-Gailani Mosque.
	   Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at the 14th of Ramadan Mosque,
urged Arabs to ``stand by Iraq and tell America that we will not
allow this oppression and aggression to continue.''
	   The United States and Britain had threatened military action if
Iraq did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the
work of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging
full cooperation with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the
council of its compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to
an easing or lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales
and crippled the economy.
	   But the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter Burleigh,
made it clear earlier this week that the United States does not see
the review as leading automatically to an end of the sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruling
Baath Party, on Friday quoted an unidentified Information Ministry
official as saying Burleigh was being provocative.
	   ``This illegal and unethical position toward the comprehensive
review was the reason behind the latest crisis, and the American
insistence on bringing the issue to the surface again means they
are still working to create crises with Iraq,'' the official was
quoted as saying.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the U.N. inspectors, told the official Iraqi News Agency that
inspectors visited seven sites Wednesday and even more Thursday.
	   The teams to date have been going to previously designated
weapons sites. In the past, they have taken Friday off.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said in New York on Thursday that he
had begun assembling teams for surprise visits, which in the past
have been the most contentious. Butler also said he sent three
letters to the Baghdad government seeking documents, but hadn't yet
received a reply.
	   ``We will test the whole spectrum of our work'' before reporting
back to the Security Council in three to four weeks, Butler said.

President of Kyrgyzstan arrives in Budapest, Hungary (AP) _ The
</HEADLINE>
president of Kyrgyzstan arrived Friday on a four-day official visit
to Hungary, in an effort to boost economic and trade relations, and
to learn from Hungary's experience to create market economy.

<TEXT>
	   Kyrgyzstan is one of the most impoverished of the former Soviet
republics, and was badly hit by Russia's economic crisis in August.
	   President Askar Akayev is the first president of the central
Asian republic to visit Hungary. Hungarian President Arpad Goenz
visited Kyrgyzstan a year ago. Akayev is accompanied by several of
the country's ministers.
	   Kyrgyzstan, which now is engaged in market reforms, is
interested in the experiences of Central European countries such as
Hungary and Poland, which are front-runners to join the European
Union. Akayev visited Poland for two days prior to his arrival in
Hungary.
	   Bilateral trade between Hungary and Kyrgyzstan is low, totaling
only dlrs 2.3 million in 1997. It increased slightly to dlrs 2.9
million in the first eight months of this year.
	   Four new cooperation agreements are to be signed in the areas of
culture, science, education, tourism and customs.
	   The visit will conclude Monday with talks with Prime Minister
Viktor Orban.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Despite last-minute glitches, Israel
withdrew troops from parts of the northern West Bank on Friday,
fulfilling the first step of the new Mideast peace accord and
moving the Palestinians a step closer to statehood.
	   The withdrawal was already well under way when Palestinians
raised questions about changes Israel made in the redeployment map
on short notice. The pullback was put on hold and only resumed two
hours later, after a meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and the Israeli troop commander in the West Bank.

Heavy snow forces rerouting of aid convoys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of two Serb police killed in grafs 7-9. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yuogslavia (AP) _ A heavy overnight snowfall in Kosovo
forced the rerouting of aid convoys Friday amid concerns about
reaching refugees sheltered in remote villages.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees diverted three
aid convoys carrying food, blankets and mattresses, originally
destined for three distribution points west of Pristina, to
Podujevo, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital,
after a snowfall of between 20 and 50 centimeters (20 inches), said
the organization's spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.
	   Although UNHCR says there are no longer any refugees living out
in the open, many are sheltering in the homes of friends and
relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in their destroyed
houses and need aid supplies to survive the winter.
	   ``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain
areas,'' del Mundo said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are
sharing food with displaced people sheltering there. ... Until the
next harvest, they will need support.''
	   Up to 300,000 people in the Serbian province of Kosovo have been
left homeless since government forces cracked down on separatist
Albanian rebels in late February. Hundreds more, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, have been killed.
	   The crackdown ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes.
The separatist guerrillas have grudgingly accepted a cease-fire.
	   Sporadic shooting has nonetheless continued, with each side
blaming the other for shooting first. On Friday, two Serb police
were killed and four others wounded in western Kosovo, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center said Albanian rebels fired a mortar at the police
vehicle, then opened fire from automatic weapons, while it was
traveling a main road near the village of Prilep in western Kosovo.
	   Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos Cizmadzija, 45, were killed and
four of their colleagues wounded, three of them seriously, the
Media Center said. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   UNHCR has been sending out two to three relief convoys six days
a week, with large convoys consisting of about 20 trucks going to
the major distribution points three times a week.
	   From there, the aid is transported to villages, using smaller
vehicles. But heavy snowfall can cause many of the dirt tracks
leading to villages to become impassable.
	   Aid convoys were not the only ones affected by the snow. The
principal ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, failed to appear
at his scheduled news conference on Friday morning due to the bad
weather conditions.
	   The weather bureau forecast continued snowfall until Saturday.

TV company calls off bid for Arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The TV company Carlton Communications on Friday
called off its bid to take over North London soccer club Arsenal.
	   The moves comes just a day after angry fans turned up at a
Manchester United shareholders meeting to oppose a takeover bid for
the club by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television.
	   Carlton announced it was involved in talks with Arsenal on Sept.
10, the day after BSkyB unveiled its bid for Manchester United.
	   The Manchester United deal has been accepted by the team's board
of directors, but still needs approval by the government's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
	   No price for the Carlton bid was made public, although a figure
of 275 million pounds (dlrs 457 million) was widely reported. BSkyB
has offered 623 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion) for Manchester
United, the highest ever for a sports franchise.
	   Carlton offered no immediate explanation for its reversal.
	   Arsenal's stock price Friday was valued at 162 million pounds
(dlrs 268 million), or 2,900 pounds (dlrs 4,800) per share.

Britain considering explore renewed military ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Britain is exploring the possibility of
restoring military ties with its former colony of Nigeria in the
wake of improved relations between the two countries, a senior
British military officer said Friday.
	   Maj. Gen. Christopher Drewry, Britain's assistant chief of
defense staff, met with his counterpart, Air Vice-Marshal Al-Amin
Daggash, on Thursday to discuss bilateral ties.
	   Drewry is in Nigeria to ``put in place the necessary machinery
for the resumption of military links,'' he said.
	   Military ties between Britain and Nigeria were suspended by
London as part of a series of sanctions aimed at punishing former
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha died in June and was replaced by Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who has been working toward restoring Nigeria's battered
foreign relations. He also plans to hand power over to a civilian
government next year.
	   British Commonwealth states, European Union members and the
United States all imposed trade and economic sanctions on Nigeria
following the 1995 execution of environmental activist and author
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other associates.
	   Although Britain is exploring the possibility of restoring
military relations with Nigeria, Drewry said final approval would
only come after democratic reforms had been fully adopted in the
West African country.
	   Nigeria's military is one of most advanced in Sub-Saharan Africa
and has played a leading and dominant role in a regional
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
	   Nigerian troops fighting under the ECOMOG banner toppled a
military junta in Sierra Leone earlier this year and cleared the
way for that country's elected president to be reinstated.
	   Drewry commended Nigeria's military command for its
participation in ECOMOG operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia and in
the near future in Guinea-Bissau.

Turin club worried about safety in Istanbul, Italian fans to stay
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT name of league &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Citing growing tensions between Italy and
Turkey, Italian league champion Juventus said Friday no Italian
fans will be accompanying the team to its Champions League match in
Istanbul.
	   Italy and Turkey are locked in a standoff over a Turkish Kurd
rebel leader arrested in Rome last week. Feeling is running strong
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to immediately send him back for
trial as a terrorist.
	   The Turin team's safety in Istanbul is ``a big worry,'' Juventus
manager Luciano Moggi acknowledged Friday.
	   While the club is ready to play Galatasaray on Wednesday, it
said no fan will be traveling to Turkey to support the team.
	   ``Members of the VIP club, which usually travel with the team,
will also stay home. Only players and team officials will go to
Istanbul,'' said a spokesman for the team, who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name.
	   He refused to say if it was an independent decision by the fans'
clubs or a move ordered for security reasons.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema, who had been initially invited
to watch the game in Istanbul, also gave up the trip.
	   Europe's governing body for soccer, UEFA, said a final decision
about whether to play next week's match would be made Monday.
	   ``We are ready to play, under condition security is guaranteed.
We will stick to UEFA's decision,'' the club spokesman said.
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi was quoted by Milan's sports daily
Gazzetta dello Sport as saying ``we hope we don't go to Turkey.''
	   Juventus, which needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep
alive its qualifying chances, clearly would prefer to play the
match on a neutral field rather than at home of the Turkish
champion.
	   With four draws in as many games of Group B, Juventus' chances
to reach its fourth final since 1996 are in jeopardy. Galatasaray
is the group leader.
	   The Turin team is owned by the Agnelli family, which controls
Italy's Fiat auto giant.

Former Yeltsin bodyguard alleges Yeltsin got TV shares
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2-3 with Yeltsin aide denying the president
had any shares. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's former bodyguard said
Friday that he had received instructions from a controversial
financier to transfer more than one-quarter of the shares in
Russia's largest television station to Yeltsin, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin denied the charge Friday.
	   ``(The president) has no shares, doesn't control any shares, and
this question was not coordinated with him,'' Yakushkin told a news
conference.
	   A hard-line Communist member of parliament had alleged on
Wednesday that financier Boris Berezovsky had given the bodyguard,
Alexander Korzhakov, the power of attorney to give 26 percent of
shares in the ORT television station to Yeltsin in 1994. The member
of parliament, Viktor Ilyukhin, called the alleged transfer a
bribe.
	   The station is 51 percent government-owned, with the remainder
held by various private investors, including Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky confirmed Thursday that the shares were transferred,
but said that Korzhakov had forced the transaction.
	   Korzhakov, the former head of the presidential security service
and Yeltsin's confidant for 11 years, was ousted in a Kremlin power
struggle in June 1996.
	   The ORT station has meanwhile been fighting bankruptcy
proceedings against it. On Friday, its noon news broadcast, which
usually runs 15 minutes, was cut to just three minutes because the
company could not prepare video footage, ORT said.
	   Shortly after noon, court marshals announced they were
temporarily ending their attempts to confiscate ORT's company cars
as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The government had appealed
to law enforcement authorities to halt the threatened, forced sale
of the station's assets to pay its multimillion-dollar debt to
government-owned transmitters.
	   ORT officials say they've already cut costs, but that their
biggest source of income, advertising, has shrunk as a result of
the country's economic crisis.

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Despite last-minute glitches, Israel
withdrew troops from parts of the northern West Bank on Friday,
fulfilling the first step of the new Mideast peace accord and
moving the Palestinians a step closer to statehood.
	   The withdrawal was already well under way when Palestinians
raised questions about changes Israel made in the redeployment map
on short notice. The pullback was put on hold and only resumed two
hours later, after a meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and the Israeli troop commander in the West Bank.
	   The map incident was only the lasted hiccup in the
implementation of the Wye River peace agreement which has been
marred by delays and bitter disputes. ``We have to exert maximum
efforts to build the trust required between the two of us,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The pullback gives Arafat full or partial control of an
additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank, or 510 square kilometers
(204 square miles) and takes him a step closer to his final goal _
statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
faces a mounting challenge by hawkish allies who oppose land
concessions and threaten to topple the government. Netanyahu
reportedly is considering calling early elections.
	   ``We signed the agreement with a heavy heart, and with a heavy
heart we proceed to implement it,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai wrote Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners, including 150
criminals, drawing complaints from the Palestinians who demanded
that all those freed be security prisoners.
	   ``It's a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' said
Hisham Abdel Razek, a senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoner affairs. Abdel Razek stayed home, instead of
greeting returnees arriving by bus at the Nahal Oz crossing between
Israel and Gaza.
	   Mahmoud Obeid, a TV cameraman, was filming the arrivals when he
recognized one of the prisoners as his brother Ahmed, whom he had
last seen 11 years ago. Obeid dropped his camera, ran to his
brother, a security prisoner, and hugged and kissed him.
	   Israel and the Palestinians also signed a protocol for the
operation of the Palestinian international airport in Gaza. Arafat
said the airport would open Tuesday with a flight from Cairo
carrying Egyptian government officials, the Palestinian news agency
Wafa said. Planes from Morocco, Jordan, Spain and Holland were to
follow, Wafa said.
	   The Israeli redeployment began Friday morning.
	   Israeli army trucks loaded with 130 red-and-yellow border
markers left the Dotan army base south of the Palestinian town of
Jenin and drove to road junctions to demarcate the new borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   On the outskirts of Silt al-Harthiye village near Jenin, a crane
lifted a border stone the size of a washing machine from a truck.
	   Nearby, Israeli and Palestinian officers pored over a map spread
on the hood of a white Palestinian jeep to make sure the marker was
being placed in exactly the right spot. A Hebrew-Arabic interpreter
translated between the two sides.
	   At the end of the withdrawal, an additional 36 smaller towns and
villages had come under full Palestinian control, said Palestinian
police commander Brig. Gen. Ismail Jaber.
	   The Palestinian Authority already has full control over the
seven West Bank cities and has joint jurisdiction with Israel in
some 400 villages.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000, Palestinian police made a
triumphant entry Friday afternoon. A convoy of more than a dozen
police cars drove through the main street and officers shot their
Kalashnikov assault rifles in the air.
	   Thousands watched the arrival, but the despite the momentary
festiveness, many remained skeptical. ``Outside of town, there are
still Israeli checkpoints. So what will change?'' said Khalil Abu
Rub, a 55-year-old merchant sitting in a nearby coffee shop.
	   To Jewish settlers in the area, the pullback meant new anxiety,
and some were toying with the idea of returning to Israel.
	   ``If life becomes intolerable and dangerous, and there is even a
chance that a child will be killed or injured, I think we should
seriously consider leaving, provided the government will compensate
us,'' said Ovadia Yaacov, 48, a retired army officer and father of
three who lives in the Ganim settlement which after the pullback
was surrounded on three sides by Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   In the troop pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank, or 110 square
kilometers (44 square miles), were transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1 percent of the
land, or 400 square kilometers (160 square miles), moved from joint
jurisdiction to sole Palestinian control.
	   Friday's withdrawal marks stage one of a three-phase pullback
that is to be completed by the end of January. By then, Arafat will
have full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   While a vast majority of Israelis favor the withdrawal _ with
polls consistently showing more than 70 percent approval _
Netanyahu had difficulties keeping his hard-line allies on board.
	   ``Today is one of the worst days, as far as I'm concerned, in
the inspiring history of Zionism,'' Jewish settler leader Aharon
Domb, a former Netanyahu supporter, wrote in Yediot.

A wavering Schroeder praised for about-face on cheap labor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder won rare
praise from industry Friday for abruptly scrapping plans to burden
more low-wage jobs with Germany's high taxes.
	   But the reversal also exposed confusion in the new center-left
government about its political direction as Schroeder tries to
fulfill his top campaign pledge _ lowering unemployment stuck above
10 percent.
	   The chancellor, in office less than a month, had announced the
new tax measures last week in his inaugural address. He withdrew
them Thursday after heavy criticism by business groups as well as
people in low-paying service jobs.
	   ``The Schroeder government was clever to review this decision,''
Holger Wenzel of the Association of German Retailers was quoted
Friday as saying in the Bild daily. ``A large pool of voters would
have been extremely angry.''
	   The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing
thousands of small and medium-size firms, also welcomed the
decision.
	   Schroeder won September elections for the Social Democrats
partly by wooing traditionally conservative voters with his
pro-market image. But the new administration has since hewed to the
left with plans to bolster social programs.
	   Lawmakers took up key parts of Schroeder's campaign agenda
Friday, including a law that would undo cuts in retirement benefits
and sick pay passed by the previous government under Helmut Kohl.
	   Labor Minister Walter Riester told parliament the law would
restore ``social peace.''
	   Higher energy prices are part of the package, a nod to
Schroeder's junior coalition partner, the ecology-minded Greens.
	   Prices of fossil fuels and electricity would rise on April 1 to
finance a cut in social security taxes, which contribute to high
German labor costs that hurt the country's competitiveness.
	   To please labor unions upset about a proliferation of low-wage
jobs, Schroeder had initially promised to lower the minimum taxable
monthly wage to 300 marks (dlrs 178) from 620 marks (dlrs 370) in
western Germany and 520 marks (dlrs 310) in former communist East
Germany.
	   The revised plan sets a nationwide level of 620 marks, which
should encourage hiring in the struggling east.

Brokers laundered millions each year on Amsterdam exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Stockbrokers using Swiss-based
numbered bank accounts laundered 1.8 billion guilders (dlrs 1
billion) per year on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange before fiscal
investigators ended the fraud, police believe.
	   Citing unnamed police sources, the Dutch newspaper Algemeen
Dagblad on Friday reported for the first time the extent of the
money-laundering operations uncovered in October 1997.
	   It wasn't clear how long the fraud, which rocked Amsterdam's
financial institutions, had been going on before police broke up
the ring.
	   A spokesman for Amsterdam's Public Prosecutor's Office declined
comment on the newspaper report.
	   The main suspects in the case, brokers Han Vermeulen and Adri
Strating, are due to go on trial next year on charges ranging from
tax evasion to insider trading.
	   Brokers involved in the laundering reportedly swapped
information and cut deals at a swanky Amsterdam brothel.
	   Investigators say the brokers were able to launder cash _ some
of it from drug deals _ by buying shares on Amsterdam's bourse via
the anonymous Swiss accounts.

Finance minister threatens to shut down striking mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's finance minister threatened
Friday to close a money-losing, state-run mine in the wake of a
ten-day strike by miners exasperated by their grinding misery.
	   Some 1,000 miners in the town of Zlatograd, 300 kilometers (188
miles) southeast of Sofia, walked out of the pits on Nov. 10 to
demand a 200-percent raise of their leva 160,000 (dlrs 96) monthly
salaries.
	   Addressing lawmakers on the issue Friday, Finance Minister
Muravei Radev denounced the demand as ``absurd,'' citing a leva 230
million (dlrs 140,000) loss the Zlatograd lead and zink mine incurs
every month. With the strike, the loss grows even bigger.
	   ``If today the striking miners don't go back to work, the
Finance Ministry will instantly open a procedure to liquidate the
mine,'' Radev said. ``There is no other option.''
	   Mining is the only source of revenue for the people in the
barren southern Rhodope Mountains, where the Zlatograd mine is
located and losses and industrial unrest have persisted.
	   Last year the government split the 7,000-worker complex into
eight smaller companies meant to become self-sustaining. Some of
the new units fared well, but in Zlatograd the decline continued.
Losses have stemmed from bureaucracy and falling lead and zink
prices on world markets.
	   The Gorubso mines are on a government list of state companies
cut off banking loans and slated for possible shutdown unless they
find a way to recover. The Ministry of Finance is in charge of
those companies.
	   Bulgaria has endorsed tough financial discipline to offset
consequences of hyperinflation the previous Socialist government
caused early last year by too much deficit spending.

Afghanistan's Taliban rulers clear bin Laden of terrorist charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man accused of orchestrating the
U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man
Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the
permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.
	   The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, closed
on Friday their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin
Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.
	   ``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,''
Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib told The Associated
Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan
capital, Kabul. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without
sin. ... He is a free man.''
	   A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden in the Aug. 7 bombings that
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
	   White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy
said, ``Without commenting on the rigor of the Taliban judicial
system, it is clear that Mr. bin Laden is a proven threat to U.S.
national interests.''
	   Bin Laden will remain a focus of American diplomatic and legal
efforts to ``take down his terrorist network and bring him and his
associates to justice,'' Leavy said in Tokyo, where he was
traveling with President Bill Clinton.
	   Two weeks ago, Washington offered a dlrs 5 million reward for
the capture of bin Laden, something the Taliban said was tantamount
to encouraging terrorist activity inside their war-shattered
country.
	   Saqib said he waited in vain in his cavernous office, stark
except for an ornately carved wooden desk and a bright bouquet of
plastic flowers, for American officials to provide evidence of bin
Laden's involvement in terrorist activity.
	   ``It is their shame that they have been silent,'' said Saqib.
``Anything that happens now anywhere in the world they blame Osama,
but the reality is in the proof _ and they have not given us any.''
	   The United States does not recognize the Taliban government and
has no diplomatic representative in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban religious army espouse a strict brand of Islamic law
that bans women from working and girls from school and outlaws most
forms of light entertainment.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi billionaire who was thrown out of his
homeland for advocating the ouster of the Saudi royal family, is
believed by the United States to be using bases in Afghanistan to
train and finance Islamic terrorist groups worldwide that target
U.S. interests and U.S. citizens.
	   In August, the United States launched a missile attack on
eastern Afghanistan against suspected terrorist training camps.
Twenty-six people were killed; bin Laden was unhurt.
	   The Taliban have refused to hand over bin Laden to the United
States, saying even more Tomahawk cruise missiles would not
persuade them to do so. Taliban commanders who know bin Laden say
he is living in mountain camps outside the Taliban stronghold of
Kandahar along with his three wives, children and a handful of
bodyguards.
	   Bin Laden settled in Afghanistan when the Taliban's opponents,
led by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, ruled Kabul. The
opposition now controls about 10 percent of Afghanistan, mostly in
the north.
	   Taliban officials now ask why the United States didn't demand
the extradition of bin Laden before the Taliban captured Kabul in
1996.
	   ``Why not say then that he was a terrorist and ask for him then?
Why now when the Taliban are successful?'' said Mullah Mohammed
Haqzar, deputy interior minister.
	   Bin Laden first came to Afghanistan in the 1980s, enraged by the
Soviet invasion of the Islamic country. He fought alongside
anti-communist Afghan guerrillas that the United States also
supported.
	   After the war, he returned home and then moved to Sudan. The
Saudi government, fearing his brand of militant Islam, stripped him
of his citizenship in April 1994. With Western pressure mounting on
Sudan, he was forced to leave in 1995 and returned to Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden's self-declared war against the United States began
after the 1991 Gulf War to protest the presence of U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia, home to two of Islam's holiest sites, Mecca and
Medina.

West Indies 101 for two wickets at lunch against SAfrican local
</HEADLINE>
team &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with tea time; NO pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies survived two
mini-collapses to take an early rain-induced tea break at 193 for
four wickets on Friday, the first day of their four-day match
against the provincial Free State at Springbok Park.
	   The match is the second warm-up game against a South African
provincial team before a five Test series begins Thursday.
	   The pre-lunch session was punctuated by the cheap dismissals of
Philo Wallace (11) and Brian Lara (10).
	   The West Indies' heroes of the morning _ Clayton Lambert and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul _ were finally dismissed within seven runs
of each other after they put on 90 runs for the third wicket.
	   Lambert was the first to go, trapped leg before wicket back on
his stumps by a Kosie Venter flipper for 67. His 128-ball innings
included seven boundaries, but also some streaky shots.
	   Chanderpaul succumbed at 48, edging Johan van der Wath to
wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk.
	   Carl Hooper and Stuart Williams set about restoring the West
Indies innings. Hooper selected his shots judiciously, hitting out
against Venter who had, until his seventh over, been the model of
economy.
	   The rain sent the players off the field for an early tea-break.
If more than half-an-hour of play is lost, the match will resume
half-an-hour early tomorrow.

Cyprus charges Israelis with spying, trial begins Dec. 8

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean
island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with
spying on Cyprus for a foreign country and will go on trial next
month. A defense request for bail was turned down.
	   The two were also charged with the illegal possession of
wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other
to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus
and Israel.
	   The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged
during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of
Larnaca. Judge Tefkros Economou, after retiring to consider the
evidence against them, returned to the court to announce that their
trial will begin Dec. 8 as the prosecution requested.
	   Adjourning the proceedings for a second time to look into a
defense request for bail, Economou later decided that the two must
continue to be held by Cypriot authorities given the gravity of the
charges they faced.
	   Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides earlier said the Israeli
Embassy in Cyprus would keep the two men inside its premises in the
capital Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Larnaca, until
the trial begins. Hergov and Damary have been held in the Nisosia
Central Prisons since their arrest Nov. 6.
	   Prosecutor George Papaioannou objected to the bail request,
arguing that the two faced ``serious spying charges.''
	   The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of
Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in
the apartment the two men had rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an
Israeli head of state.
	   Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their
arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia
in two separate cars. Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they
were guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
	   Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the
courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
	   The spying charge states that the two men collected information
linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign
state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two
worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a
main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.

France still undecided over participation in Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top French soccer officials failed to decide
whether to play in the controversial Confederations Cup, during a
meeting Friday aimed at resolving the muddle.
	   The world governing body FIFA moved the eight-nation event from
Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France, which withdrew
because of conflicts with the European club calendar.
	   French Football Federation (FFF) president Claude Simonet
accepted the changes. But the summer dates upset Noel Le Graet,
president of the French National League (LNF), which plans to begin
its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   Simonet and Le Graet met with the FFF's governing general
council Friday, but failed to make a final decision on whether to
participate in the event, which will take place in Mexico.
	   ``We are flattered to be invited to this competition, but the
dates still present a problem,'' Simonet told reporters after the
meeting. ``We cannot create problems with the domestic calendar,
that is certain.''
	   French officials still hope to persuade FIFA to bring forward
the dates of the Confederations Cup to the end of the current
season.
	   FIFA will meet to discuss the conflict December 4.
	   ``We cannot turn down an invitation a second time,'' Simonet
said.
	   French officials point to the possibility of an expanded
Champions League and the uncertainty over the pre-season Intertoto
Cup. Both might mean that clubs play extra matches in the summer.
	   Adding to the scheduling congestion, officials want the
1999-2000 season to finish as early as possible because of UEFA's
Euro 2000 Championship - considered second in prestige only to the
World Cup, and far more important than the new Confederations Cup.
	   ``I can't envisage starting the first division after July 28,''
Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games (July 23-Aug. 8).
	   What's more, the dates force Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia - which
will compete in the Copa America between June 29 and July 18 - into
two major events in less than a month.
	   The underlying problem is not between FIFA and UEFA, former
soccer great Michel Platini, a member of FIFA's football committee,
told reporters.
	   ``Rather, the battle is between the big clubs and federations.
Each wants to have more matches to earn more money.''

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A crew member of a Djibouti cargo boat
hijacked two months ago managed to overwhelm the pirates and retake
control of the Nur Star, radio reports said Friday.
	   The reports from the northern port of Bosasso, where the boat
was seized by pirates in September, said an Ethiopian crewman
managed to grab a gun from one of the captors and kill him while
another pirate dived overboard and the other four were subdued.
	   It was not clear what the boat had been doing off the north
coast of Somalia since September. But the pirates had demanded dlrs
75,000 ransom to release the unspecified number of crew. Gunmen
hired by the vessel's Djibouti owner made several vain attempts to
recapture Nur Star.
	   The vessel had offloaded food in Bosasso and was to take on
goats destined for Saudi Arabia when it was seized.
	   Piracy is common in the waters of the Gulf of Aden and the
Indian Ocean off Somalia, and gunmen in high-powered speed boats
attack cargo vessels and fishing boats with regularity.

Athletics chief calls for undercover agents in fight against
</HEADLINE>
doping &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ One day after France adopted a tough
anti-doping law, Germany's athletics chief proposed Friday
``creative methods'' to fight the problem, including the employment
of undercover agents.
	   Helmut Digel, president of the German Athletics Federation
(DLV), said little progress has been made in the struggle against
doping.
	   ``The reality is that we have been running in place for 20
years,'' Digel told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper in an
interview published Friday.
	   ``I still don't see any success in effectively dealing with the
problem,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``We need creative methods to overcome the problem'' _ from
criminologists, to underground agents, to giving immunity to
witnesses willing to expose offenders, Digel said.
	   He said authorities should be given a freer hand in chasing
doping offenders and urged tougher laws.
	   Digel's comments came a few days after the federation's chief
doctor Karlheinz Graff revealed that two German athletes had asked
him for a substance to treat thickening of the blood, which can
occur after taking EPO. Graff declined to name the two athletes.
	   EPO is a synthetic hormone that increases the oxygen-carrying
red blood cells and is still undetected by conventional drug tests.
	   French lawmakers adopted a bill Thursday that gives France one
of the world's toughest anti-doping laws.
	   Doping became a national issue during the Tour de France, with
revelations of widespread doping by riders in the hugely popular
summer event.
	   The law, which was approved by the Senate in May, creates a
strong doping prevention committee. It requires sports federations
to show they are acting to eradicate the use of illegal drugs, and
punishes those found prescribing, supplying, encouraging or using
them.
	   The law orders a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine
of up to 50,000 francs (dlrs 8,700) for anyone not cooperating with
authorities in the control of drugs.
	   Those found guilty of prescribing, offering, administering or
using banned substances will face up to five years in prison and a
fine of 500,000 francs (dlrs 87,000).
	   Those punishments rise to seven years in prison and fines of up
to one million francs (dlrs 174,000) in cases where the drug supply
is organized by a group or is targeted at minors.

Iraqis fear U.N. humanitarian program supports sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY107 of Nov. 19 &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations' oil-for-food program is
helping Iraqis keep food on the table, but there are growing fears
it also is hurting the country's efforts to end eight years of
harsh sanctions.
	   Government officials say that because the international
community knows Iraqis are being fed _ even at a subsistence level
_ there is less pressure to lift the oil embargo. And citizens are
tired of accepting handouts when they know their oil-rich country
could afford to buy anything it needs.
	   ``We accepted this program as a temporary one,'' Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said in a recent interview. ``Now, it has
become a cover to continue sanctions on Iraq.''
	   Saleh repeated Iraq's frequent complaints about the program: the
tedious process of getting contracts through the U.N. bureaucracy
and painfully slow deliveries.
	   ``Anyway, people need more than food,'' Saleh argued. ``We need
investment in agriculture and industry, to create job opportunities
and to raise income. Oil-for-food can't do this.''
	   U.N. officials defend the program, saying it has improved life
for Iraqis _ though not enough. They also say the greater supply of
flour, sugar and other commodities has helped bring down prices in
the market, making more things affordable.
	   Not all aid officials agree.
	   Denis Halliday quit as head of the U.N. humanitarian program in
Iraq in September with an angry blast. He complained of ``a certain
incompatibility'' in U.N. resolutions, ``one imposing sanctions
with the results we are all too familiar with, and another imposing
a humanitarian program with all its shortcomings and politics.''
	   The trade sanctions, which limit the sale of oil, ban air travel
and prohibit most financial dealings, were imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   They have devastated Iraq's economy, once one of the region's
richest with oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia. The currency
has depreciated to the point that a government worker's monthly
salary will barely buy two chickens and unemployment among Iraq's
22 million people is rampant.
	   The U.N. Security Council won't lift the sanctions until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, as required by cease-fire resolutions that ended the
1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraq tried to force the issue in October, curtailing the
inspectors work to try to push the Security Council to ease the
sanctions. But Baghdad backed down last weekend under threat of
U.S. military strikes.
	   The oil-for-food program, launched in December 1996, allows Iraq
to export limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and other
necessities.
	   The food is distributed in monthly rations that include flour,
rice, sugar, lentils, cooking oil and tea _ providing about 2,000
calories a day per person. Powdered milk is available for babies.
	   The Iraqi government claims 5,000 people are dying every month
because of the sanctions, most of them children and the elderly.
	   But Philippe Heffinck, head of the U.N. Children's Fund in
Baghdad, said a U.N. survey of children under age 5 showed the rate
of chronic malnutrition falling to 27 percent this year from 32
percent before oil-for-food.
	   ``What we see now is a stabilizing of the numbers,'' Heffinck
said. ``It's still unacceptably high, but at least the situation
isn't deteriorating.''
	   He also said Iraq wasn't getting enough money for other pressing
needs, such as repairing electricity generators, replacing leaking
sewer pipes and improving water sanitation.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs here, said
the oil-for-food also has created ``a new dynamism'' in the private
market.
	   Families, for example, will sell the flour they don't use and
spend the money on other things, such as shoes. Nursing mothers
often swap baby milk for other goods.
	   Merchants have responded by bringing more smuggled goods into
the market from Turkey, Syria, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   In a noticeable change from just six months ago, some grocers
now have Kellogg's corn flakes, Turkish chocolates, Pert and
Pantene shampoos and a dozen brands of cigarettes.
	   Increasing the supply of food also has helped lower prices, Falt
said.
	   At Shorja, the big wholesale market in the city center, sugar,
which sold for 91 cents for 2 pounds (.9 kilos) before the
oil-for-food program, has fallen to 31 cents. Chicken, which had
sold for dlrs 2 for two pounds, is down to dlrs 1.25.
	   Still, life on rations grates.
	   ``Before the war, everything was available here. Hotels even
flew in fine food every day for their dining rooms _ smoked salmon,
caviar, things like that,'' said Hamed Ahmed, 48, who runs a small
supermarket in the Karada neighborhood. ``Now, most people barely
make it on their rations.''

U.S. insists Serbs did not reject Kosovo proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The top U.S. mediator in Kosovo
dismissed Friday the idea that Serbia's president had rejected a
U.S. draft plan that reportedly would give Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians virtual self-rule.
	   ``We don't consider the Serbs have rejected our agreement and
expect to be talking to them in the next few days,'' mediator
Christopher Hill said in Lisbon.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic on Wednesday rejected the
U.S. proposal, saying it did not respect full equality of all
ethnic communities in the southern Serbian province.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians who make up the vast majority of the
population complain of repression at the hands of a Serbian
minority.
	   ``We are not interested in seeing Kosovo just dominated by one
ethnicity, but the Serbs need to understand that we can't vow for
the situation to continue where Kosovo is being ruled by Belgrade
directly,'' Hill told the Associated Press.
	   He was speaking at the 44th general assembly of a pro-NATO
lobbying group called the Atlantic Treaty Association.
	   Under the proposal drafted by Hill, Kosovo would have its own
democratic structures, including a president, courts and
parliament.
	   Details of the draft plan were published this week by an
Albanian-language newspaper in Kosovo.
	   Milutinovic claimed it gave too much power to
independence-minded ethnic Albanians.
	   ``The problem is the Albanians would like our agreement to take
them out of Serbia. We can't do that because the Serbs won't allow
that,'' Hill added.
	   Milutinovic has said Kosovo Albanians could have self-rule but
must remain part of Serbia, the dominant of the two republics that
make up Yugoslavia. The other is Montenegro.
	   The U.S. proposal envisages almost no Serbian control in the
province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction of
Yugoslavia.

EU to cooperate with U.S. if Washington lifts sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission said
Friday it will support a U.S. proposal aimed at resolving the
banana trade dispute through the World Trade Organization if
Washington lifts a related threat to impose sanctions against the
15-nation EU.
	   The EU executive Commission said it will support an accelerated
WTO dispute settlement procedure for the banana dispute if the
United States lifts a threat to impose 100 percent duties on a
range of EU imports.
	   The U.S. threat was in response to a new EU banana import system
that the U.S. administration claims is in violation of WTO rules
and unfairly favors imports from former European colonies.
	   The EU agreed this year to change its banana import system by
Jan. 1, 1999 after the WTO ruled that the existing system is
illegal.
	   ``The EU is ready to cooperate with the United States, or any
other WTO member, in an accelerated WTO dispute settlement panel on
any disagreement about the conformity of the new EU banana regime
with WTO rules,'' the Commission said in a statement. ``But the EU
will not do so under the continuing threat of unilateral United
States sanctions.''
	   The Commission said the U.S. administration can expect full EU
cooperation in a new WTO dispute settlement procedure, which would
involve the creation before Jan. 15 of a dispute settlement panel.
	   ``The United States has nothing to fear. We believe that our new
regime conforms with WTO rules,'' it said. ``But if a panel found
otherwise, the EU would comply with its judgment.''
	   In that case, the Commission said, the U.S. would be entitled to
seek WTO-authorized retaliatory measures until the EU fully
complied with the judgment.
	   The Commission said the U.S. threat of unilateral sanctions
amounted to an effort to ``enter the court room pointing a pistol
at the other side.''
	   The Commission has said it'll complain to the WTO about the
sanctions if Washington implements it. It has said the U.S. plan
would affect EU exports to the United States worth 1.3 billion
European currency units (dlrs 1.52 billion) in 1997.

 &UR; West Indies 101 for two wickets at lunch against SAfrican local
team &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with tea time; NO pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies survived two
mini-collapses to take an early rain-induced tea break at 193 for
four wickets on Friday, the first day of their four-day match
against the provincial Free State at Springbok Park.
	   The match is the second warm-up game against a South African
provincial team before a five Test series begins Thursday.
	   The pre-lunch session was punctuated by the cheap dismissals of
Philo Wallace (11) and Brian Lara (10).
	   The West Indies' heroes of the morning _ Clayton Lambert and
Shivnarine Chanderpaul _ were finally dismissed within seven runs
of each other after they put on 90 runs for the third wicket.
	   Lambert was the first to go, trapped leg before wicket back on
his stumps by a Kosie Venter flipper for 67. His 128-ball innings
included seven boundaries, but also some streaky shots.
	   Chanderpaul succumbed at 48, edging Johan van der Wath to
wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk.
	   Carl Hooper and Stuart Williams set about restoring the West
Indies innings. Hooper selected his shots judiciously, hitting out
against Venter who had, until his seventh over, been the model of
economy.
	   The rain sent the players off the field for an early tea-break.
If more than half-an-hour of play is lost, the match will resume
half-an-hour early tomorrow.

Pakistan minister declares emergency to end violence in port city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes. ADDS byline. No

 &UR; By GHULLAM HASNAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's Prime Minister Friday
suspended civil rights in a southern province and ordered the army
to quell violence in the port city of Karachi, where 1,000 people
have died in factional fighting.
	   Nawaz Sharif called in the army in the Sindh province to aid the
government and set up military courts in the port city of Karachi
to try those behind the factional violence. These courts will
decide cases within days, not weeks and months, he said.
	   ``The step has been taken because the terrorists were becoming
more and more powerful,'' he said. ``We want to get Karachi out of
this hell.''
	   Sharif last month dismissed the elected provincial government of
Sindh after widespread political violence killed more than 1,000
people in Karachi this year, paralyzing economic activity.
	   Sharif accused his former ally, the Muttahida Qami Movement
(MQM), of most of the bloodletting in Karachi including last
month's murder of former governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM promotes the rights of Urdu speaking people who migrated
from India at independence from Britain in 1947 and their
descendants.
	   On Friday, human rights groups and opposition parties said the
move was unconstitutional and threatened democracy.
	   ``It is an undeclared martial law,'' said Asma Jehangir, the
chairperson of independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who
urged Sharif to resign. Calling in the army ``is an acceptance of
incompetence by the government.''
	   Sharif said the state of emergency is in the larger interest of
the city and the country. President Rafiq Tarar invoked Article 245
of the constitution, which allows the suspension of civil rights,
bans political meetings and strikes and prevents military court
rulings from being challenged in civilian court.
	   The MQM, which changed its name to Muttahida Qami Movement from
the Mohajir Qami Movement, is locked in a bloody conflict with its
dissident faction called the MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have
died in tit-for-tat killings by the militants of these two factions
in recent months. The party broke into two groups several years
ago.
	   The main party is controlled by Altaf Hussain, who has lived in
London since 1992.
	   Since the imposition of federal rule in October, the provincial
government has arrested 490 people for involvement in terrorist
activities.
	   Sharif said military courts are needed in Sindh because
``terrorists threatened the witnesses, judges and their families''
and had paralyzed the justice system.
	   ``It is also a part of Islamic justice which says speedy justice
should be provided at the door step. These courts will be a lesson
for the criminals and terrorists,'' he said.
	   Opposition parties are bitter over the Oct. 30 dismissal of the
provincial government, which occured after the MQM refused to
support a government plan to end the violence.
	   And Senator Iqbal Haider, a member of the main opposition
Pakistan People's Party, said the government is not justified in
imposing a state of emergency.
	   ``It is a mini-martial law,'' he said.

Refugee hosts must show patience, Ogata says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Although humanitarian disaster has been averted in
Kosovo, countries facing an influx of refugees from the Serbian
province should continue to host them, the United Nations' top
refugee official said Friday.
	   Some 60,000 refugees have returned to their homes over the last
few weeks but the peace in Kosovo ``is marred by virtually daily
incidents,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata.
	   UNHCR is ``insisting'' on the fast deployment of up to 2,000
unarmed verifiers in Kosovo to help restore confidence, Ogata told
reporters.
	   Violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, under the threat of NATO airstrikes
on his forces, to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers
in Kosovo.
	   For the agreement to work, ``it requires patience from those
countries which host Kosovo refugees'' as well as restraint from
Yugoslav authorities and ethnic Albanians in the province, Ogata
said.
	   Before the agreement, aid workers feared a humanitarian disaster
this winter if tens of thousands of displaced people were forced to
stay in the open.
	   Ogata is chairing a regular meeting in Geneva to discuss the
situation of refugees in the former Yugoslavia. Countries agreed
that ``nobody will be returned to Kosovo at this point,'' she
noted.
	   UNHCR estimates that some 68,000 Yugoslav citizens, mostly
Kosovo Albanians, have applied for asylum in Western Europe this
year. Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have the largest
numbers of Kosovo refugees.

Authorities seize 6,000 counterfeit Beanie Babies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YORK, England (AP) _ Authorities seized 6,000 counterfeit
versions of two of the most coveted Beanie Babies soft toys Friday,
including a bear introduced to benefit Princess Diana's memorial
fund.
	   Copies of the Princess Bear and Britannia Bear, both popular
collectors' items, were seized in raids throughout this north
England city, authorities said.
	   The toys were worth a total of about 300,000 pounds (dlrs
500,000), according to Ty Europe Ltd., the manufacturer.
	   The Britannia Bear retails for between 120 and 200 pounds (dlrs
200 to 325) and the Princess Bear at 80 pounds (dlrs 135), with all
profits from the latter benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund.
	   Both are difficult to find, however.
	   ``We have undoubtedly helped to thwart a group of people who
were planning to cash in from these forged bears in the run-up
towards Christmas,'' said Colin Rumford, head of the city's
anti-fraud arm.
	   ``We have succeeded in protecting our citizens from this scam
and in preventing these conmen from defrauding the memorial fund,''
he said.

Cuba signs oil exploration contract with Brazilian company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Petroleos Brasileros has signed a six-year
agreement to search for oil in Cuba, the Cuban government news
agency reported Friday.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro attended the signing of the
agreement between Petrobras and Cuba's state oil company.
	   Under the agreement, Petrobras is to make new geological
studies, review old ones and drill at least one exploration well.
	   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said that about a dozen
European and Canadian companies are involved in oil exploration in
Cuba. Cuba wants to increase oil output since economic difficulties
have forced it to slash imports in recent years.
	   Cuba's oil industry expects to produce nearly 1.5 million tons
of oil this year. The heavy crude found far is used largely for
power generation.

OSCE Ambassador receives a death threat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Everts, CLARIFIES that he did not

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international official in Albania
received an anonymous death threat connected to an upcoming
constitutional referendum, media reported Friday.
	   Daan Everts, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe's Ambassador to Albania, received a message earlier this
week, warning him to give up supporting the constitution, or else
he would be dead.
	   The threat is connected to Everts' support of the Sunday
referendum, when Albanians are to vote on the country's first
post-communist constitution, the papers said.
	   ``Someone communicated to me through an Albanian staff member
that I will not leave the country alive,'' Everts told The
Associated Press Friday. He said he had an idea where the threat
came from but refused to elaborate.
	   Asked if he was afraid Everts said, ``not relally, but we can't
completely discount this thing here.''
	   Everts said the person who made the threat demanded he halt
efforts to encourage Albanians to vote in Sunday's referendum.
	   Earlier in the day, Everts said by telephone he would continue
his work. ``I know I can fully rely on the hospitality of the
Albanian people,'' he said.
	   Everts has often come under attack from the opposition
Democratic Party, which has called on people to boycott Sunday's
referendum. The party leaders have publicly accused the ambassador
of siding with the ruling coalition, led by the Socialist Party.
	   Everts said his job is to represent the international community,
which condemns the boycott as undemocratic and leading to the
self-isolation of the opposition.

	   COTONOU, Benin (AP) _ The Paris-based press rights group
``Reporters Without Borders,'' has expressed concern over jail
terms handed down to two journalists from Benin for allegedly
defaming a former government minister.
	   ``Our organization believes that no sentence should be
disproportional to the crime'', the group's president, Robert
Menard, said in an open letter to Benin's President Mathieu
Kerekou. The letter was faxed to news organizations on Friday.
	   Maurice Chabi, editor the independent Echoes of the Day
newspaper and staff reporter Pascal Zantou, were each sentenced to
six months in prison this week after being found guilty of libel.
	   The newspaper earlier this year published a report that claimed
former Education Minister Djidjoho Padonou had embezzled state
funds.
	   ``Reporters Without Borders hopes that the appeal court will
reverse the lower court's decision and quash the sentences,''
Menard said in his letter.

Slaney's arbitration hearing expected in early '99
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The drug controversy surrounding U.S.
track star Mary Slaney is set to be reopened.
	   An International Amateur Athletic Federation spokesman said
Friday that an arbitration hearing into Slaney's case is expected
to be held in early 1999.
	   The IAAF had announced last January that it intended to take
Slaney's case to arbitration, saying it was not satisfied with USA
Track and Field's decision to clear her of doping allegations
stemming from a 1996 drug test.
	   The sides have been unable so far to agree on a date for the
hearing, but the IAAF doping commission reported Friday that the
details were almost settled.
	   ``It's now likely the hearing will be in early January, or
sometime early in the next year,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri
said. ``We hope to find the date in the next month.''
	   The hearing would be held in Monaco. Slaney, who is not obliged
to attend, could face a two-year international suspension if found
guilty of a doping offense.
	   ``We have to arrive at an end,'' Reineri said. ``It's been more
than two years now since this happened. The doping commission and
the IAAF want to arrive at this arbitration and have a decision to
declare the case closed in one way or the other.''
	   Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in U.S.
history, provided a urine sample during a routine drug test at the
1996 U.S. Olympic trials.
	   She was later notified that her test revealed an unusually high
ratio of testosterone, a naturally occurring hormone that also is
taken in concentrated form to improve performance.
	   The test showed a high ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone,
another natural substance.
	   The so-called T-E ratio normally is 1-to-1. If an athlete's
urine sample shows a ratio of 6-1 or higher, that triggers further
tests that can lead to banishment from the sport.
	   The IAAF complained that USA Track and Field was dragging its
feet on the matter and suspended Slaney in May 1997. The U.S. body
then followed suit and imposed its own suspension.
	   Slaney and her attorneys argued that the test did not take into
account the hormonal swings a woman goes through during
menstruation, while on birth control and nearing menopause.
	   USATF agreed, and in September 1997 lifted the suspension and
cleared Slaney of the charges. It said the
testosterone-epitestosterone test was flawed.
	   The IAAF cleared Slaney to compete but said it did not accept
the USATF ruling and would refer the case to arbitration.
	   Slaney, who turned 40 in August, has said she would like to
compete in her fourth Olympics in Sydney in 2000.
	   In another drug case involving an American athlete, the IAAF
council on Friday asked USATF to schedule a doping hearing for
sprinter Christy Opara Thompson.
	   Opara Thompson was born in Nigeria but is now considered an
American after marrying a U.S. citizen.

Yeltsin's trip to India postponed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kremlin waffled Friday on whether Boris
Yeltsin will visit India next month, two days after reviving
speculation about his ailing health by saying he had canceled the
trip.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday the president had
postponed the trip, but refused to indicate any new date. He said
the decision had nothing to do with Yeltsin's physical condition.
	   Kremlin press officials said Wednesday that Yeltsin had canceled
the trip and asked Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to go in his
place.
	   Yakushkin confirmed Friday that Primakov is going, and said the
visit is likely to take place in December _ the same time Yeltsin's
trip had been planned. But Yakushkin insisted that ``there is no
talk of (Primakov going as) a replacement.''
	   ``This in an independent visit by Primakov. As for the visit by
the president of the Russian Federation, that has not been
canceled. It has been postponed, and the dates are being worked
out,'' Yakushkin said.
	   The vague, careful comments reflect the secrecy in which the
Kremlin shrouds questions of Yeltsin's health.
	   Yakushkin conceded Friday that Yeltsin's doctors ``aren't
happy'' about the prospect of a long flight to India and the change
of climate, but said the worries were not significant enough to
affect Yeltsin's travel plans.
	   ``This has nothing to do with (Yeltsin's) health. This has to do
with the need to resolve problems that have built up in our
economic and trade relations. And that is the job of the prime
minister,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Russian media have said that Yeltsin's health problems would
rule out any more foreign trips during the remaining 20 months of
his presidency. Yeltsin has canceled several foreign trips this
fall after falling ill, and no more are on his immediate schedule.
But the Kremlin denies that Yeltsin has any major health problems.
	   Yeltsin met Friday with the head of the Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, at a country residence near Moscow, where
the president has spent much of his time in recent weeks. Yeltsin
was planning to receive Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday,
Yakushkin said.

OSCE Ambassador receives a death threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Everts, CLARIFIES that he did not
receive anonymous phone call. Repeating to CORRECT lead sequence. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international official in Albania
received an anonymous death threat connected to an upcoming
constitutional referendum, media reported Friday.
	   Daan Everts, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe's Ambassador to Albania, received a message earlier this
week, warning him to give up supporting the constitution, or else
he would be dead.
	   The threat is connected to Everts' support of the Sunday
referendum, when Albanians are to vote on the country's first
post-communist constitution, the papers said.
	   ``Someone communicated to me through an Albanian staff member
that I will not leave the country alive,'' Everts told The
Associated Press Friday. He said he had an idea where the threat
came from but refused to elaborate.
	   Asked if he was afraid Everts said, ``not relally, but we can't
completely discount this thing here.''
	   Everts said the person who made the threat demanded he halt
efforts to encourage Albanians to vote in Sunday's referendum.
	   Earlier in the day, Everts said by telephone he would continue
his work. ``I know I can fully rely on the hospitality of the
Albanian people,'' he said.
	   Everts has often come under attack from the opposition
Democratic Party, which has called on people to boycott Sunday's
referendum. The party leaders have publicly accused the ambassador
of siding with the ruling coalition, led by the Socialist Party.
	   Everts said his job is to represent the international community,
which condemns the boycott as undemocratic and leading to the
self-isolation of the opposition.

Canadian prime minister lauds China's progress on rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with reported detention of
dissidents, more Chretien remarks, dlrs 464 million in contracts;
Minor editing to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised
China on Friday for signing international accords on human rights
but said his country remained troubled by reports of curbs on
freedom.
	   ``Progress is being made. Progress which we applaud,'' Chretien
said in a speech at elite Tsinghua University.
	   But he cautioned: ``Many Canadians are disturbed when we hear
reports from your country of restrictions on the right to free
expression of different political views. And particularly when we
hear of people being harassed and imprisoned for expressing
political views different from the government.''
	   In the latest incident, police burst into a dissident's home
Friday in the eastern city of Hangzhou, breaking up a meeting and
taking him and three other activists away, and seizing a fax
machine, an address book and documents, a human rights group said.
	   The four had met to discuss affairs related to a political party
dissidents set up in June to challenge the ruling Communist Party,
said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, based in Hong Kong.
	   Chretien urged China to quickly ratify two key United Nations
accords it has signed that provide fundamental guarantees of civil,
religious and political rights.
	   Chretien again touched on human rights later Friday in another
speech, saying Canada believes ``the free and open expression of
opposing views is not a threat to anyone or any nation.''
	   Chinese and Canadian companies, many of them small and
medium-sized, signed commercial contracts Friday worth a total of
about U.S. dlrs 464 million, involving agriculture, water
conservation, transport, electronics, medical care and machinery,
China's state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   ``This is a sign of a dynamic, growing relationship,'' Chretien
said of the deals.
	   Chretian said he and his Chinese counterpart, Zhu Rongji, had
agreed to a goal of doubling direct investment in each other's
countries over the next five years.
	   Following meetings between Chretien and Zhu, the two countries
signed a set of seven agreements Thursday on cooperation in
environmental work, legislation, urban development, agriculture and
the preservation of cultural relics.
	   Chretien also met Friday with Li Peng, head of the Chinese
legislature, and with President Jiang Zemin.
	   On Saturday, he was to make a quick trip to the western city of
Lanzhou, in Gansu province, to inspect joint development projects
there, before returning to Canada late in the day.
	   The Canadian leader was accompanied on the visit by an entourage
of 70 trade officials and executives.

Kurdish rebel leader freed from custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Turkish prime minister writing to NATO; comments
from defense minister; background on significance of Germany's
decision; Kurds celebrating in Rome; Italian opposition forces call
for Ocalan's expulsion &QL; 
 &UR; With AP photos &QL; 
 &UR; By ALESSANDRA RIZZO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court freed a Kurdish rebel leader from
detention Friday but ordered him to remain in Rome while his appeal
for political asylum is considered.
	   Ocalan has been held in a military hospital since he was
arrested last week upon arrival on a flight from Moscow.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition, but Italy's law prohibits
it from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the
death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey.
	   ``I am amazed,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, told
the AGI news agency. ``The head of a terrorist organization, a
notorious assassin is treated by your country like a welcome
guest.''
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insists he won't be intimidated
by Turkey.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told
reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Germany announced Wednesday that it would not seek the
extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany on
charges of terrorism since 1990. The decision meant Italy no longer
needed to detain Ocalan on the German-issued arrest warrant.
	   ``It is clear that we will review our economic and trade
relations with a government, which by keeping the murderer of
30,000 people and providing him haven, is becoming an accomplice to
his crimes,'' Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin said from
Ankara.
	   The Anatolia news agency reported that Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz appealed to NATO for support, explaining that Ocalan
is the ``worst terrorist of the century.''
	   In a written statement, Ocalan appealed to the thousands of
Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity to return
home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic
means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior which might
reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a
Kurdish spokesman in Rome, Akif Hasan.
	   About 700 Kurds began dancing and chanting pro-Ocalan slogans in
a central Rome piazza when they heard of Ocalan's release.
	   Turkey has been furious over Italy's refusal to turn over
Ocalan. Turkish businesses have begun boycotting Italian goods in
response.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Italy's opposition forces have called for Ocalan's expulsion
from Italy.
	   Ocalan heads a guerrilla movement which has fought a 14-year war
for autonomy in predominantly southeastern Turkey. Nearly 37,000
people have been killed.
	   Friday's court decision said Ocalan will be free to move around
Rome but he will have to notify authorities of any plans to leave
his residence.

Japan's top banks post profit, most plan to ask for bailout money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's top nine banks marked profits for the first
half of this fiscal year, but many of them expected to post losses
at the end of the year after writing off massive bad loans, the
banks said Friday.
	   Reflecting the fragile financial state of the banks, all but one
of the nine announced Friday they will plan to apply for billions
of dollars in public money earmarked under a government bailout.
	   The funds sought ranged from 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.5 billion)
to 700 billion yen (dlrs 5.8 billion).
	   Some 25 trillion yen (dlrs 208 billion) has been promised under
the bailout legislation that passed last month. The plan is aimed
at tackling the massive bad loan problem leftover from excessive
speculation of the 1980s.
	   The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was the only bank passing on the
bailout money.
	   The bank said it planned to raise capital by issuing new shares
and selling the land and buildings of its head office in Tokyo and
then leasing them from the buyer. It also will cut workers by about
20 percent, or 3,000, from 15,500 by March 2002.
	   The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi posted a group net profit of 43.99
billion yen (dlrs 366 million) for the first half of the fiscal
year ending in September, compared to a 479.17 billion yen (dlrs
3.99 billion) loss for the same period last year.
	   For the entire fiscal year through next March, the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi foresees a group net loss of 30 billion yen (dlrs
250 million).
	   Sakura Bank said it will ask for between 400 billion yen (dlrs
3.3 billion) and 600 billion yen (dlrs 5 billion) in public money.
	   Sakura Bank reported a parent net profit of 32.23 billion yen
(dlrs 268 million) for the first half of the year, up from 17.06
billion yen (dlrs 142 million) for the same period last year.
	   Sakura said it had 1.59 trillion yen (dlrs 13 billion) in
problem loans at the end of the fiscal term ended September. The
bank plans to write off 910 billion yen (dlrs 7.5 billion) in
non-performing loans during the full fiscal year.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which posted a parent profit of 76.38
billion yen (dlrs 636 million), up from 15.62 billion yen (dlrs 130
million) a year ago, said it will ask for about 500 billion yen
(dlrs 4.2 million) in public funds.
	   Tokai Bank, posting a profit of 25.22 billion yen (dlrs 210
million) for the parent, up from 11.64 billion yen (dlrs 97
million), will apply for between 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.5 billion)
and 400 billion yen (dlrs 3.3 billion) in public funds
	   Group figures were not immediately available for those banks.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two strong earthquakes hit a rural area in
southwestern China, killing one person and injuring 1,383 _ 210 of
them seriously, the Central Seismology Bureau reported Friday.
	   A magnitude-5.0 quake struck the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County
in southwest China's Yunnan province and neighboring Yanyuan County
in Sichuan province at 7:31 p.m. (1131 GMT) Thursday, followed by a
stronger 6.2 quake seven minutes later.
	   Of the injured, 1,173 were slightly hurt, while 210 people
suffered serious injuries, many from houses collapsing, said a
bureau spokesman who gave only his surname, Wu. He gave no other
details.
	   The quake destroyed the houses of 230 families and three
schools, and a landslide blocked a river, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported. Wu, the bureau spokesman, said the full number of
destroyed homes was still being calculated.
	   Losses were estimated at 200 million yuan (dlrs 24 million),
Xinhua said. Clothing, food and medicines were being sent to the
area, it added.
	   Ninglang is a poor area where 80 percent of the people receive
food relief, Xinhua said.
	   Quakes measuring 5.3 and 5.2 hit the same area, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Oct. 2 and 27.

Germany keeps Scientology, ex-communists under surveillance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany decided Friday to keep the Church
of Scientology under surveillance by domestic intelligence agents,
prompting fresh charges of religious discrimination by the
U.S.-based church.
	   A probe by German officials has determined that Scientology
remains a potential threat to democracy, said Walter Zuber, who
chaired a meeting of interior ministers of Germany's 16 states that
made the decision.
	   Though Scientology won tax-exempt status as a church in the
United States in 1993, German officials maintain it is primarily an
economic enterprise. It has been under surveillance since June
1997.
	   Sabine Weber, a Scientology representative in Germany,
threatened a wave of lawsuits against the spy authorities.
	   Church president Rev. Heber Jentzsch, in a statement issued in
Los Angeles, accused Germany of ``stigmatization of the members of
a religious minority.''
	   Scientologists claim many of their 30,000 German members face
persecution and job discrimination. The U.S. government has
criticized Germany's stance.
	   In their first meeting since a left-leaning federal government
took power, the state officials also agreed to keep the former East
German communists under the domestic security agency's watch.
	   Otto Schily, the federal interior minister, said it was
``doubtful'' that the Party of Democratic Socialism was completely
committed to democracy.
	   Schily had suggested this month he might lift surveillance of
the PDS after the party entered a state government for the first
time since German unification in 1990.

International law caught up with Pinochet, says U.N. panel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Britain is obliged under international law to see
whether it can prosecute Gen. Augusto Pinochet even if it decides
against extraditing him to Spain, the chairman of a key U.N. panel
said Friday.
	   ``Twenty years ago dictators, when deposed, could look forward
to a happy, comfortable retirement,'' said Peter Thomas Burns.
``International human rights law has caught up with them.''
	   The 1984 Convention against Torture, which Britain has ratified,
is one of the treaties created since World War II that changes the
rules of the game, said Burns, a Canadian.
	   ``The old dictators from throughout the world who brutalized,
maimed, tortured, murdered their own citizens are now confronting''
a new reality, he said.
	   Previously the 82-year-old former Chilean dictator could have
visited any country in the world without fear of what is happening
to him in Britain, said Burns. ``But international legal events
have caught up with people in that category.''
	   Burns spoke to reporters at the end of a two-week session by the
Committee Against Torture, a panel of 10 independent experts he
chairs, to review how countries are living up to their obligations
under the treaty.
	   The committee concluded its consideration of Britain by formally
urging the British public prosecutor to investigate Pinochet if it
decides against extraditing him.
	   Burns praised Britain for its openness in dealing with the
committee and said he wasn't surprised that British authorities had
yet to respond to its recommendations sent to London Thursday.
	   ``It's a very complicated question,'' he said.
	   Part of the problem for Britain is that, under its system of
common law, it must enact legislation incorporating its obligations
under international treaties before they take precedence in British
courts, he said.
	   He noted that Britain's State Immunity Act protects heads of
state from other countries, but said that the law should be changed
to meet obligations under international law.
	   ``They've got to investigate, they've got to try and put
together a case and if they can put together a case they then have
to prosecute,'' Burns said.

it can be considered to join the European Union, the acting EU
council president said Monday.
	   Following a meeting with his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic,
Austrian Foreign Minister, Wolfgang Schuessel said reform is a
``step by step process,'' and Croatia is showing progress.
	   ``But there are many more steps ahead,'' warned Schuessel, who
is also acting EU council president, while Austria holds the
rotating EU presidency.
	   All relevant parties in Croatia must be able to have access to
radio and TV, he said, refering to the tight grip that Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman holds on state-run media.
	   ``When Croatia begins moving in this direction, then moving
towards the EU is a possibility,'' the Austrian Press Agency quoted
him saying.
	   Another major issue for Croatia's acceptance into Europe is
refugee return. More that 250,000 Serbs and Croats remain exiled
from their homes since the 1991-95 Serbo-Croat war. Under intense
international pressure, the government introduced a return program
earlier this year, which has enabled almost 50,000 Serbs to return.
	   Schuessel also said Croatian authorities need to be more
``concrete and energetic in facilitating and implementing the
return program.''
	   The Austrian foreign minister arrived in Zagreb Friday to
partake in the two-day forum of the Central European Initiative, a
16-member organization aimed at keeping Europe's richer nations
from closing the door on countries climbing out of communism.
	   The CEI countries include Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, Croatia,
Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia. Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and
Montenegro, is not a member.
	   Austria and Italy are the only active EU members in the
association, but they have lobbied hard in recent years to
integrate their neighbors to the south and east into Western
structures.
	   Schuessel is meet Tudjman later in the day.

Cyprus charges Israelis with spying, trial to begin in December
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held in Cyprus on suspicion
of espionage were formally charged Friday with spying on this
Mediterranean island and will go on trial next month. A defense
request for bail was turned down.
	   The two were also charged with the illegal possession of
wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other
to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus
and Israel.
	   The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged
during a brief court hearing in the coastal town of Larnaca, 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of the capital, Nicosia.
	   Judge Tefkros Economou announced their trial would begin Dec. 8
and denied them bail.
	   The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of
Ziyi. Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in
the apartment the two men had rented.
	   The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations
between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer
Weizman ended the first official visit to the island by an Israeli
head of state.
	   The spying charge states that the two men collected information
linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign
state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
	   Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their
arrest two weeks ago, the two were bowed their heads Friday as they
were escorted into the courthouse to avoid the waiting
photographers.
	   The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that
was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two
worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union
with Greece. It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a
a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles. Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent
their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
	   The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is
the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a
main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.

Japanese fair trade watchdog issues warning to Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese trade regulators slapped Microsoft Corp.
with a warning Friday after ruling the software giant broke
anti-monopoly laws by aggressively promoting its products.
	   The decision does not affect the Redmond, Washington-based
company's high-profile anti-trust case in the United States, but
adds to criticism that Microsoft's marketing strategies unduly
squeeze competitors.
	   The Japanese Trade Commission ruled Microsoft attempted to
unfairly restrict competitors' access to the market by bundling
pre-installed word-processing and spreadsheet software, said FTC
spokesman Kanichiro Nakanishi.
	   The ruling stems from an investigation that began in January.
The trade watchdog also issued a warning to Microsoft and its
Japanese subsidiary against engaging in unfair business practices.
	   Microsoft Co., the wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of Microsoft
Corp., issued a statement in Tokyo late Friday saying it had
already voluntarily stopped the practices cited by the FTC and did
not anticipate having to make any additional changes in its
marketing in Japan.
	   Makoto Naruke, the president of Microsoft Co., said in the
statement that he welcomed the conclusion of the FTC's
investigation and was confident that his company had acted in
accordance with the law.
	   A company official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Microsoft does not plan to formally protest the ruling, but that
the company does not believe it violated any laws.
	   Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at
Microsoft's headquarters, said the ruling in a way was positive for
the company because the Japanese FTC decided not to pursue separate
allegations involving dominance over Internet services. Similar
allegations are central to the U.S. Justice Department's case
against Microsoft.
	   ``It's certainly ironic that the Japanese government has dropped
all of the browser allegations, but our own government is
continuing its attack on one of America's leading exporters,''
Smith said.
	   The Japanese ruling has no bearing on the U.S. case, in which
the Justice Department and 20 states contend Microsoft has used its
dominance in PC operating systems to quash competition.
	   Microsoft had contracts in Japan whereby companies offering
Internet access were promoted via a list linked to its Windows
software. In return, these service providers had agreed to promote
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
	   Those contracts were criticized for being exclusionary, and
Microsoft modified them earlier this year, the Microsoft lawyer
said.
	   In January, agents from the commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo
offices, confiscating information about Microsoft's Windows
operating system and Internet Explorer browser software. It also
collected information about Microsoft's word processing program
Word and spreadsheet Excel.
	   Microsoft's Windows operating software controls the basic
functions of 85 percent of the world's personal computers.

Heavy snow forces rerouting of aid convoys

	   PRISTINA, Yuogslavia (AP) _ Heavy snow forced U.N. officials to
reroute trucks carrying food, blankets and mattresses to Kosovo on
Friday, raising concern about reaching refugees sheltered in remote
villages.
	   As much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell in the
Yugoslav province overnight and more snow was forecast through
Saturday.
	   With many roads impassable, three U.N. aid convoys that had been
destined for distribution points west of Pristina had to be
diverted to Podujevo, a town 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of the
capital.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the
snow would be a major problem, especially in mountain areas.
	   ``Even in the towns and cities, people are sharing food with
displaced people sheltering there,'' spokesman Fernando del Mundo
said. ``Until the next harvest, they will need support.''
	   Up to 300,000 people were left homeless by the Serb-led
government's armed assault on ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo. Hundreds more, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, were
killed.
	   The crackdown ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   Sporadic shooting has nonetheless continued, with each side
blaming the other for shooting first. On Friday, two Serb police
were killed and four others wounded in western Kosovo, the Serb
Media Center reported.
	   The center said Albanian rebels fired a mortar, then automatic
weapons, as the police were traveling a main road near the village
of Prilep in western Kosovo. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The U.N. refugee agency has been sending out two to three relief
convoys six days a week. The trucks take the aid to major
distribution points, from where it is taken by smaller vehicles to
villages.
	   Aid convoys were not the only ones affected by the snow. The
main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, failed to appear at
his scheduled news conference Friday morning due to the bad
weather.

Two-time Indianapolis 500 winner to call it quits after May race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Arie
Luyendyk of the Netherlands says he will retire following that race
next May.
	   The 45-year-old driver, a longtime resident of the United
States, went through a frustrating 1998 Indy Racing League season
during which he was often uncompetitive and didn't win until the
last race in Las Vegas.
	   Prior to that victory, his fourth in the IRL, Luyendyk indicated
numerous times he was considering stepping out of the cockpit for
the final time, although he was uncertain if he would simply retire
or cut back on his schedule.
	   In announcing his decision, Luyendyk, who still holds the record
of the fastest race at Indianapolis, said he wants to spend more
time with his family.
	   ``When you are committed to a team as a driver for an entire
season, you are committed every day of the year,'' he said. ``The
work doesn't start with practice on Friday and end with the race on
Sunday.
	   ``There is the travel, the testing and the appearances. Even
when I'm at home, I'm working out, busy on the phone and thinking
about the business of racing.''
	   Luyendyk will again drive at Indy for Fred Treadway, but only in
that one race. There was no immediate word from Treadway about
replacing Luyendyk for the rest of the IRL series.
	   Luyendyk's retirement from the IRL will leave the three-year-old
series with a handful of young stars but without a real marquee
attraction. The Flying Dutchman was easily the biggest name to
remain with the new series when the established teams of the CART
FedEx Championship Series chose to boycott the IRL.

Man seeking aid for son threatens suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ With a crowd of several hundred
watching, a distraught man with a gun stood outside a university in
Georgia's capital Friday threatening to kill himself.
	   Zaur Kakachiya was demanding government assistance to send his
son to Germany for cancer treatment, authorities said.
	   After the deputy mayor of Tbilisi, Gigi Tsereteli, spent 90
minutes trying to talk Kakachiya out of shooting, an unidentified
person managed to grab the gun and end the standoff, the Interior
Ministry said.
	   Tsereteli promised that Kakachiya's son would receive the
treatment.

Cattle corpses found in Jewish chapel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Jewish leader said Friday he has
suspended a contract with a kosher butcher after cattle corpses
were found in a chapel in a Jewish cemetery in northern Romania.
	   The cemetery watchman also owns a meat company that supplies
kosher beef to the 400-member Jewish community in the Transylvanian
city of Cluj.
	   The daily Evenimentul Zilei reported Friday that the
unidentified man was slaughtering cattle while on duty at the
cemetery, and the chapel served as a natural refrigerator.
	   The rear ends of six freshly slaughtered cattle were found
Wednesday on the floor of the chapel, where coffins are held
awaiting burial, said Nicolae Kallos, leader of the Jewish
community in Cluj, some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   Kallos declined to identify the cemetery watchman or provide
other details of the incident.
	   The Jewish community immediately suspended the contract with the
company and also informed health authorities, who fined the
watchman, Kallos said.

Vikings, Broncos can clinch playoff berths with victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They have been the dynamic duo in the American
National Football League this year, and on Sunday the Denver
Broncos and Minnesota Vikings can clinch playoff berths.
	   Yes, just 11 games into the season, defending Super Bowl
champion Denver and the somewhat surprising Vikings are in position
to qualify for the postseason. They need a few other things to
happen, but the way the season has gone thus far for each of them,
who's to say everything won't fall into place.
	   Denver also could become the first team since the 1991 Redskins
to go 11-0 if it beats visiting Oakland (7-3). A Broncos victory
would just about put away the AFC West division title, too.
	   The Broncos clinch a playoff berth with a victory and one of
following scenarios: Pittsburgh loses; Miami and Tennessee lose; or
Buffalo, Miami and the New York Jets lose.
	   ``Our intent every time we touch the field is to dominate
teams,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``We try to put 30,
40 points on the board, whatever it takes for us to dominate,
because we want to show teams that we don't have a chink in our
armor.
	   ``Once you lose a ballgame, teams see you have a chink in your
armor, they try to take full advantage of that. Right now, teams
don't really know how to approach us. They don't actually know if
they can beat us or not.''
	   Denver beat Oakland 34-17 in Week 3. The Raiders have turned it
around since then, but they face a formidable challenge at Mile
High Stadium, where the Broncos have won 21 in a row and are 27-2
under coach Mike Shanahan. Oakland must win without top-notch
cornerback Eric Allen.
	   These are different Raiders, however. They're playing
disciplined football, and they're getting along.
	   ``We've made a lot of changes,'' coach Jon Gruden said. ``We
think we have a good group of veteran players who have provided
leadership, and our chemistry in the locker room right now is
really excellent.''
	   As it is in Minnesota, which dominated a Monday night meeting
with Green Bay earlier this season. If the Vikings (9-1) beat the
Packers (7-3) at the Metrodome, their hold on the NFC Central
Division will be firm.
	   ``They would enjoy nothing better than to come out of this
season 2-0 vs. the Packers,'' Packers DE Vonnie Holliday said.
``That's really big. These guys haven't gone to the Super Bowl two
years in a row and they haven't won the division. The Packers have.
So this is really big for Minnesota, as well.
	   ``We're going to come out of the game (and) they'll still be No.
1. But who knows? They may slip up further down the road and leave
it open somehow.''
	   Minnesota's potent passing game, led by Randall Cunningham, Cris
Carter, Randy Moss, Jake Reed and a superb offensive line,
destroyed the Packers in their last matchup. And that came in the
rain at Lambeau Field. Conditions will be more favorable for
putting the ball in the air in the dome on Sunday.
	   The Vikings should be brimming with confidence.
	   ``We've kind of stayed out of the talking game, but they've
indicated from all their interviews that they're coming in here
with bad intentions,'' coach Dennis Green said. ``And we understand
that.''
	   A playoff berth will be guaranteed for the Vikings if they win
and either Arizona or New Orleans loses. The Cardinals are at
Washington and the Saints are at San Francisco.
	   Also on Sunday, it's Chicago at Atlanta, Detroit at Tampa Bay,
Indianapolis at Buffalo, Jacksonville at Pittsburgh, Philadelphia
at the New York Giants, Seattle at Dallas, Carolina at St. Louis,
Kansas City at San Diego, the New York Jets at Tennessee, and
Baltimore at Cincinnati.
	   Monday's game features Miami at New England.

Teams with 32 straight losses is invited to Wembley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Question: What does 432 goals yielded in
32 matches equal?
	   Answer: An invitation to Wembley Stadium.
	   At least it does for the Sutton St. Nicholas soccer team from
western England, which has been invited for its ``never say die
spirit'' to Wednesday's Champions League match between Arsenal and
French side Lens.
	   Team members will march on the Wembley turf before the match,
carrying the UEFA Champions League flag. The team will also attend
a coaching session at the Arsenal Soccer School.
	   ``Sutton St. Nicholas' recent run of form would be enough to
make most people give up, but not these boys,'' said John Hawkes of
McDonald's restaurants, the UEFA sponsor that is organizing the
visit.
	   In a recent match, goalkeeper Daniel Durkin retired from goal to
play midfield, where he scored for the first time. But his side
still lost 12-1.

Champion coffeeshop pulls out of Cannabis Cup contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hundreds of American marijuana
users are rolling into town for the annual Cannabis Cup contest, an
attempt to smoke out the Dutch capital's best drug ``coffeeshop.''
	   But a cloud of controversy hung over the usually mellow event
when last year's titlist withdrew Friday, accusing the yearly
potfest of becoming a ``commercial circus.''
	   Two and a half days of judging by cannabis connoisseurs can lead
to _ believe it or not _ a ``stressed atmosphere'' in some of the
so-called coffeeshops where marijuana and hashish are freely sold,
said the cafe De Dampkring, which has won the Cannabis Cup for the
last two years.
	   ``With grave concern we see how the event, which started in 1988
as a harvest festival ... gradually deteriorates into a commercial
circus in which the economic interests of coffee shops and seed
companies pull most weight,'' De Dampkring's owners griped in a
statement.
	   ``We hate the stressed atmosphere, the favoritism and the
buttering up to the media,'' they added.
	   During the Cup, which begins Monday, coffeeshops slash their
prices and often dole out free gifts to foreign visitors. De
Dampkring argued that such extravagance means only about 20 of
Amsterdam's 356 coffeeshops can afford to participate.
	   Stress is a word rarely linked with the atmosphere that usually
prevails in the hazy dens thick with sweet-smelling smoke.
	   Dutch justice authorities tolerate coffeeshops, arguing they
allow police to keep tabs on the soft drugs trade and keep cannabis
users away from hard drugs such as heroin.
	   During Cannabis Cup week, an event sponsored by the American
magazine ``High Times,'' hundreds of people, mostly Americans,
descend on Amsterdam each year to sample the best brands of
marijuana and hashish the shops have on offer.

Marion Jones, Haile Gebrselassie favored for IAAF awards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ American sprinter Marion Jones and
Ethiopian distance runner Haile Gebrselassie are the favorites in
the running for the IAAF athletes of the year awards.
	   The winners are scheduled to be announced Sunday at the IAAF's
annual year-end gala in Monaco.
	   There is no suspense over the women's winner.
	   Jones, who also won the 1997 award, has dominated women's track
and field this year in stunning fashion.
	   She was unbeaten on the track in the 100 meters, 200 meters and
relays. She compiled an overall winning streak of 37 events that
was snapped when Heike Drechsler beat her in the long jump at the
World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa.
	   In the 100, Jones clocked 10.90 seconds or faster in 20 races
and ran the fourth fastest time ever _ 10.65 _ at the World Cup.
Jones is the second fastest woman ever behind the late Florence
Griffith Joyner, who still holds the world record at 10.49.
	   Jones also ran the third-fastest 200 in history, clocking 21.62
seconds in Johannesburg.
	   She won the women's overall IAAF Grand Prix title and was one of
three athletes to share the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot.
	   Other women's finalists for the award include French sprinter
Christine Arron, European champion in the 100 and 200, and Irish
distance runner Sonia O'Sullivan.
	   The contest for the men's award is much closer, with
Gebrselassie a slight favorite over Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj.
	   The Ethiopian set world indoor records at 2,000 and 3,000
meters, and smashed outdoor records at 5,000 and 10,000. He was
undefeated from 1,500 to 10,000 meters and was a Golden League
jackpot winner.
	   Guerrouj broke the outdoor world record in the 1,500 and clocked
the second fastest times ever for the mile and 2,000. He was
undefeated at all distances and was a Golden Leauge jackpot winner.
	   Other men's finalists include sprinter Ato Boldon of Trinidad
and Tobago, and Brazil's Ronaldo Da Costa, who set a world record
in the marathon.
	   The IAAF festivities will also include tributes to Griffith
Joyner, who died in September at the age of 38 after suffering a
seizure, and American heptathlete/long jumper Jackie Joyner Kersee,
who retired after an 18-year career that included six Olympic
medals and four world championship gold medals.

Lawmakers of all parties propose to abolish capital punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Lawmakers of all parliamentary parties
agreed Friday to propose abolition of the death penalty in a step
to move Bulgaria closer to European legal standards, the state news
agency BTA reported.
	   It quoted the chairman of parliament's legal commission,
Svetoslav Luchnikov, as saying his panel would propose on Dec. 10
to replace capital punishment by life imprisonment with no right of
pardon.
	   Luchnikov said commission members from all parties backed the
proposal.
	   Executions have been suspended in Bulgaria since 1990 under a
parliament-approved moratorium on death penalties.
	   Nineteen convicts sentenced to death are currently waiting in
prisons to be executed or handed a lesser verdict.
	   The death penalty has caused heated public debates as the crime
rate rose five times since the fall of communism in 1989.
Supporters said Bulgaria needs capital punishment to crack down on
crime, while opponents said it was uncivilized and would not attain
the expected effect.

International law caught up with Chile's ex-dictator, U.N. panel
</HEADLINE>
chief says &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Britain is obliged under international law to see
whether it can prosecute Gen. Augusto Pinochet even if it decides
against extraditing him to Spain, the chairman of a key U.N. panel
said Friday.
	   ``Twenty years ago dictators, when deposed, could look forward
to a happy, comfortable retirement,'' said Peter Thomas Burns.
``International human rights law has caught up with them.''
	   The 1984 Convention against Torture, which Britain has ratified,
is one of the treaties created since World War II that changes the
rules of the game, said Burns, a Canadian.
	   ``The old dictators from throughout the world who brutalized,
maimed, tortured, murdered their own citizens are now confronting''
a new reality, he said.
	   Previously the 82-year-old former Chilean dictator could have
visited any country in the world without fear of what is happening
to him in Britain, said Burns. ``But international legal events
have caught up with people in that category.''
	   Burns spoke to reporters at the end of a two-week session by the
Committee Against Torture, a panel of 10 independent experts he
chairs, to review how countries are living up to their obligations
under the treaty.
	   The committee concluded its consideration of Britain by formally
urging the British public prosecutor to investigate Pinochet if it
decides against extraditing him.
	   Burns praised Britain for its openness in dealing with the
committee and said he wasn't surprised that British authorities had
yet to respond to its recommendations sent to London Thursday.
	   ``It's a very complicated question,'' he said.
	   Part of the problem for Britain is that, under its system of
common law, it must enact British legislation to put into effect
ratified international treaties.
	   Britain has already enacted legislation enabling part of the
treaty, but not the provision pertaining to the Pinochet case.
	   Burns noted that Britain's State Immunity Act protects heads of
state from other countries, but said the law is not in accordance
with its obligation under the international treaty. For that
reason, he urged Britain to change its national laws and pursue the
case against Pinochet.
	   ``They've got to investigate, they've got to try and put
together a case and if they can put together a case they then have
to prosecute,'' Burns said.

France again criticizes reports it tipped off Iraq about strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ Still incensed about reports France tipped off Iraq
about impending air strikes last weekend, a French Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Friday such insinuations are ``idiotic.''
	   Deputy spokesman Francois Rivasseau was reiterating remarks
earlier this week by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine about a news
report of remarks on an ABC news program by Senator John McCain, a
Republican from Arizona.
	   McCain later denied he had accused France of warning Iraq about
an impending attack, but the French Foreign Ministry is still
having to fend off the charge.
	   ``The insinuations are completely idiotic,'' Rivasseau told a
regular news briefing, repeating the phrase three times.
	   Rivasseau said the United States, Britain and France ``had
cooperated fully to obtain an Iraqi turnabout. These pressures bore
fruit. It was the result of a common strategy.''
	   He did say France ``had underlined to the Iraqi authorities the
importance, the growing urgency of a turnabout on their part. These
pressures bore fruit. It's the result of a common strategy.''
	   France has been less inclined than the United States to support
the use of force in order to force Iraq to comply with U.N.
disarmament resolutions.
	   Earlier this year, France resisted U.S. efforts to use the
threat of air strikes to force Iraq to allow U.N. inspectors
complete and unhindered access to suspected weapons sites.
	   France is also eager for the lifting of U.N. economic sanctions
against Iraq, which severely restrict the petrol-rich country's oil
sales.
	   Iraq owes France dlrs 5 billion for purchases made in the 1980s
and France would like to see the resumption of normal trade
relations, in part in hopes of recovering some of its money.
	   Once the sanctions are lifted, Iraq will have to modernize its
oil-producing facilities and the French are eager to get in on the
bidding for renovation contracts.
	   Until then, Rivasseau expressed support Friday for the extension
of the U.N.'s food-for-oil program, which allows Iraq to sell part
of its oil production overseas and use the proceeds to import food.
	   The United Nations is set to debate the extension in the near
future.
	   Meanwhile, Rivasseau said U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering would meet Vedrine in Paris on Monday. Iraq is likely to
be among the top subjects.

Caribbean immigrants gain political clout in U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Immigrants from the
small islands of the Eastern Caribbean have not always found the
warmest welcome in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but this month's
election shows the community has come of age, said Sen. David
Jones.
	   When the 23rd Legislature convenes in this U.S. Caribbean
territory next year, one third of the 15 members will trace their
roots to islands elsewhere in the region.
	   For Jones, a native of Dominica and now a senator representing
St. Croix, the change ``represents that people of the Eastern
Caribbean have come of age and are moving into leadership to make a
contribution.''
	   The 1995 Population and Housing Survey published by the
University of the Virgin Islands' Eastern Caribbean Center
estimates that about 31 percent of the approximately 110,000
residents of the territory were born on neighboring islands.
	   That population has brought commensurate political clout.
	   ``In the past, those from the Eastern Caribbean trying to vie
for public office were pummeled,'' said Sen. Roosevelt David, a
native of Nevis.
	   Jones said those pummelings were partially due to ``a little
insecurity and fear, which is unfounded.''
	   But David said this year's election represents growing
acceptance of immigrants.
	   ``It's not necessarily that we're from the Eastern Caribbean,
it's that we have something to offer,'' David said.
	   The Eastern Caribbean presence has already been felt in the
territory's Legislature. Last year, David found himself debating
Sen. Adelbert Bryan over government subsidies for a local cricket
program. Bryan protested that government funding should support
American sports such as baseball and football rather than those
from abroad, such as cricket.
	   David won the funding, but with more allies in the next
Legislature, he will have more support in such debates.
	   The strength of the immigrant legislators may now be
institutionalized. Jones said there has been discussion about
establishing an Eastern Caribbean caucus within the Democratic
Party on the islands.

Pope takes tough line with Austrian bishops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: REPHRASES quotes in 2nd graf, ADDS remarks on state of church &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II took a tough line Friday
with visiting Roman Catholic bishops from Austria, dampening any
hopes for change in church policy demanded by an active Austrian
reform movement.
	   John Paul rejected the idea of a ``democratization'' of the
church, saying the truth cannot be arrived at ``through opinion
polls and in a democratic manner.''
	   Nor can the revealed truth be decided by ``some one from
below,'' the pope told his bishops.
	   Lay people, he said, must not consider priests and bishops ``an
obsolete model'' with which the church can do without.
	   The Austrian church has been rocked by a sex scandal and demands
for reforms by a group called We are the Church, which has gathered
hundreds of thousands of signatures and has the support of some
bishops.
	   John Paul repeated church prohibitions against women priests,
divorce and abortion, positions he has indicated often he had no
intention of changing.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican.
	   Tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the country's
top church leader, acknowledged the conflicts within the church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.''
	   The traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by accusations that
a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican+'s handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of Austria's 8 million
people are Catholics, but only 20 percent attend church regularly
and 40,000 leave the church each year.
	   The pope told his bishops that ``I cannot hide two grave
worries,'' regarding low Mass attendance and a lack of priestly
vocations.

EU to cooperate with U.S. if Washington lifts sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission said
Friday it will support a U.S. proposal aimed at resolving the
banana trade dispute through the World Trade Organization if
Washington lifts a related threat to impose sanctions against the
15-nation EU.
	   The EU executive Commission said it will support an accelerated
WTO dispute settlement procedure for the banana dispute if the
United States lifts a threat to impose 100 percent duties on a
range of EU imports.
	   The U.S. threat was in response to a new EU banana import system
that the U.S. administration claims is in violation of WTO rules
and unfairly favors imports from former European colonies.
	   The EU agreed this year to change its banana import system by
Jan. 1, 1999 after the WTO ruled that the existing system is
illegal.
	   ``The EU is ready to cooperate with the United States, or any
other WTO member, in an accelerated WTO dispute settlement panel on
any disagreement about the conformity of the new EU banana regime
with WTO rules,'' the Commission said in a statement. ``But the EU
will not do so under the continuing threat of unilateral United
States sanctions.''
	   The Commission said the U.S. administration can expect full EU
cooperation in a new WTO dispute settlement procedure, which would
involve the creation before Jan. 15 of a dispute settlement panel.
	   ``The United States has nothing to fear. We believe that our new
regime conforms with WTO rules,'' it said. ``But if a panel found
otherwise, the EU would comply with its judgment.''
	   In that case, the Commission said, the U.S. would be entitled to
seek WTO-authorized retaliatory measures until the EU fully
complied with the judgment.
	   The Commission said the U.S. threat of unilateral sanctions
amounted to an effort to ``enter the court room pointing a pistol
at the other side.''
	   The Commission has said it'll complain to the WTO about the
sanctions if Washington implements it. It has said the U.S. plan
would affect EU exports to the United States worth 1.3 billion
European currency units (dlrs 1.52 billion) in 1997.

Luxury hotel planned on site of Hitler's Alpine retreat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) _ A hotel that was part of Adolf
Hitler's Alpine redoubt during the Nazi era will be torn down to
make way for a luxury resort, Bavarian officials said Friday.
	   Once a retreat where the Nazi elite hit the ski slopes and
received foreign guests, the Obersalzberg area above Berchtesgaden
became a U.S. Army recreation spot after Germany's defeat in World
War II.
	   The army returned the hotel to Bavaria in 1995 after Germany
refused to spend 30 million marks (dlrs 18 million) for repairs.
	   Now, the old building will be razed and replaced with a
four-star, 200-bed hotel scheduled to open in 2002, Bavarian
Finance Minister Kurt Faltlhauser said. The new resort will include
a nine-hole golf course and six skilifts.
	   Faltlhauser sought to dispel any worries that the complex might
come under the influence of neo-Nazis. Because of the area's past,
Bavaria will remain the property's owner to retain a say in its
use, he said.
	   A private operator will carry out the 60 million mark (dlrs 36
million) project.
	   Obersalzberg, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of
Munich, included a number of buildings connected by an unfinished
system of tunnels and bunkers that were designed as Hitler's Alpine
fortress. Nearby is Kehlstein peak, with a restaurant known as
``Eagle's Nest,'' also once used by Hitler.
	   State officials are preparing a documentation center on
Obersalzberg's history on the ruins of Hitler's former Nazi guest
house. It is to open next year.
	   The project, overseen by the Munich Historical Institute, has
been criticized by some as marketing the history of the Nazis.
Critics have instead demanded a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust, but the state has refused to back down.

Nicaragua accepts Cuban doctors it previously rejected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODOLFO GARCIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ After originally refusing its help,
Nicaragua is accepting a Cuban offer to send medical teams to fight
epidemics caused by Hurricane Mitch, the Cuban ambassador said.
	   Cuba will send six teams, each consisting of a doctor, a nurse
and an epidemiologist, Ambassador Damian Arteaga said Thursday on
Radio Ya.
	   Cuba had offered medical assistance in early November, soon
after the hurricane struck Central America, killing an estimated
10,000 people in the region.
	   But the government of President Arnoldo Aleman accepted only
food and medicine, saying it couldn't transport doctors to the
areas affected by the storm. Meanwhile it accepted the help of
doctors from other countries.
	   The rejection of Cuban doctors appeared to stem from the bad
relations since Aleman was elected president last year.
	   Cuba was a strong ally of Nicaragua's Sandinista government of
the 1980s, which Aleman had opposed and which had imprisoned him.
Aleman has maintained tight relations with the Cuban exile
community in Miami, which strongly opposes Fidel Castro.
	   The rejection of the Cuban doctors was sharply criticized by
Nicaraguans, some of whom noted that even the staunchly
anti-communist Somoza regime permitted Cuban doctors to help after
a 1972 earthquake struck Managua, killing 10,000 people.
	   Arteaga said the Health Ministry asked Cuba for help Wednesday,
after some of the transportation difficulties were resolved. The
teams are expected to arrive Saturday.
	   Nicaragua has had outbreaks of diarrhea, dengue, cholera and
other diseases, many stemming from the river contamination caused
by the hurricane.

Denmark's crown prince to go on four-month expedition in Greenland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Crown Prince Frederik, the heir to
Denmark's throne, plans to take part in a 3,500-kilometers
(2,170-mile) dog-sled trek to mark the 50th anniversary of a Danish
Navy unit that patrols along Greenland's northern fringe.
	   The trip, set for February 2000, is planned to set off from
Qaanaaq, north of the U.S. Air Force base in Thule, 500 kilometers
(310 miles) south of the North Pole. The crew will follow the
coastline and are expected to arrive in June in Ittoqqortoormiit,
1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northeast of the Greenland capital of
Nuuk.
	   The crown prince, 30, is a member of the navy's elite frogman
unit and has taken part in Arctic drills.
	   Frederik's personal secretary was quoted as telling newspapers
on Friday that the crown prince would take part in the expedition
on the same conditions as the others. ``He is part of the team,''
Per Thornit was quoted as saying by the Berlingske Tidende daily.
	   The six-person expedition will include three sleds, each
weighing about 450 kilograms (990 pounds), pulled by a total of 42
pounds.
	   The trip is to commemorate the founding in 1950 of the Sirius
patrol, which monitors to nothern fringes of the Danish territory.

Friend: Kwame Ture to be memorialized Sunday in many countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Memorial services will be held in more
than a dozen countries Sunday for black activist Kwame Ture, the
same day the former Stokely Carmichael will be buried in this West
African nation, a friend said Friday.
	   ``Comrades are planning activities in more than 20 countries,''
said Eric Mohammed. He said details for the memorials had yet to be
worked out, but he said two of the countries involved would be
South Africa and the United States.
	   Ture, who changed his name from Carmichael after he moved to
Guinea in 1968, died Sunday of prostate cancer at the age of 57.
	   How many people will attend the memorials, though, remains to be
seen.
	   Ture quickly became a fringe political figure after he moved to
Guinea, and a man largely forgotten except for his '60s activism.
	   Ture, who never stopped preaching the ideals of leftist
revolution, will be memorialized Sunday morning with a service in
Conakry and then buried in one of the city's cemeteries, Mohammed
said.
	   Dozens of Ture's friends have been asked to come to Ture's
funeral, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, famed South African
singer Miriam Makeba.
	   It was not yet clear who would be attending. Farrakhan, however,
will be sending two emissaries, Mohammed said.
	   Ture, whose political career began as a college student in the
1960s, became one of the best-known figures of the era and
popularized the term ``Black Power.'' He left America and moved to
Guinea in 1968, invited by Guinea's Marxist dictator, Sekou Toure.
	   He spent the rest of his life lecturing and writing, preaching
black power and championing socialism while condemning America,
capitalism and Zionism.

Israeli who allegedly wanted to attack premier brought to court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court on Friday extended by four
days the detention of an Israeli man suspected of planning to
attack Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Outside the magistrate's court in the northern town of Acre,
several ultra-Orthodox Jews chanted and read psalms to show support
for the suspect, Shabtai Bloch, 48, a member of the ultra-Orthodox
Chabad group.
	   Bloch allegedly plotted to attack Netanyahu during the prime
minister's Thursday visit to the northern town of Safed. Police
gave no further details. Bloch's lawyer told Israel radio that his
client opposes violence.
	   Chabad members demonstrated against Netanyahu in Safed during
the visit, angry over last month's Israel-Palestinian agreement
under which Israel is to hand over territory in the West Bank.
Israel radio said Bloch organized the protest.
	   At Chabad headquarters in New York, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a
spokesman for the movement, said ``Violence, even the threat of
violence, is anathema'' to Chabad.
	   Chabad supported Netanyahu in Israel's 1996 election, but
members feel Netanyahu has betrayed them by agreeing to hand over
West Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   On Friday, the Israeli court ruled that the police had
sufficient evidence to justify holding Bloch for another four days.
	   In 1995, an ultra-nationalist Jew assassinated Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, trying to stop Rabin's policy of trading West Bank
land for peace with the Palestinians.

Russia puts first segment of international space station in orbit

<TEXT>
	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The first part of the international
space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a
faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space
exploration and colonization.
	   A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its
initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the
unit was operating as planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or
Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous
with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched
Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project
cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central
Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday _ more than a year
later than planned.
	   ``During the Cold War era, the countries were launching
individually as much as they could to show the rest of the world
what they could do. This day is the day when countries were working
together to show what the world can do,'' said U.S. astronaut
Michael Foale, a veteran of the Russian Mir space station, who
watched the launch.
	   Another shout of joy went up among the crowd at Baikonur when
ground control announced that the Zarya had separated from its
booster rocket and reached its first orbit.
	   The heads of the space agencies of the participating nations
watched the liftoff from a distance of about 5 kilometers (3
miles). At the launch site, Russian Strategic Rocket Forces troops
who had prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid
poisoning by the highly toxic rocket fuel.
	   The huge roar of the rocket reverberated for dozens of
kilometers (miles) across the empty plain.
	   Russian and U.S. officials, who will jointly control the Zarya
from Moscow and Houston, said the successful launch was just the
first step to getting the massive space station assembled and
working.
	   ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space
walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual
respect ... the international space station is going to be a
reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after
the launch.
	   His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch was a
vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry.
	   ``Today we made a truly epoch-making step to carry out this
project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is
perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the
international space station,'' he said.
	   The mood at the launch pad was tense before the liftoff, with
space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks.
	   The launch ushers in a new era of cooperation among former
space-race rivals. Space officials expressed optimism that
cooperation would further promote world stability following the end
of the Cold War.
	   ``We still have some contradictions, we still have combat
missiles aimed at each other, but the predominant trend is the
state of cooperation and doing things together,'' said Yuri
Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya is designed to serve as a space
tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion,
power and communications.
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, is due to be completed by 2004. It will
not be inhabitable until at least early 2000, following the launch
of a Russian-made crew module which is set to blast off next July
or August.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment was
postponed repeatedly, mainly because the chronically broke Russian
space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the
station that is to go up later.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

Champion coffeeshop pulls out of Amsterdam Cannabis Cup contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hundreds of U.S. marijuana users
are rolling into Amsterdam for the annual Cannabis Cup contest, an
attempt to smoke out the Dutch capital's best drug ``coffeeshop.''
	   During Cannabis Cup week, an event sponsored by the U.S.
magazine ``High Times,'' hundreds of people, mostly Americans,
descend on Amsterdam each year to sample the best brands of
marijuana and hashish the shops have on offer.
	   But a cloud of controversy hung over the usually mellow event
when last year's titlist withdrew Friday, accusing the yearly
potfest of becoming a ``commercial circus.''
	   Two and a half days of judging by cannabis connoisseurs can lead
to _ believe it or not _ a ``stressed atmosphere'' in some of the
so-called coffeeshops where marijuana and hashish are freely sold,
said the cafe De Dampkring, which has won the Cannabis Cup for the
last two years.
	   ``With grave concern we see how the event, which started in 1988
as a harvest festival ... gradually deteriorates into a commercial
circus in which the economic interests of coffee shops and seed
companies pull most weight,'' De Dampkring's owners griped in a
statement.
	   ``We hate the stressed atmosphere, the favoritism and the
buttering up to the media,'' they added.
	   During the Cup, which begins Monday, potshops slash their prices
and often dole out free gifts to foreign visitors. De Dampkring
argued that such extravagance means only about 20 of Amsterdam's
356 coffeeshops can afford to participate.
	   Stress is a word rarely linked with the atmosphere that usually
prevails in the hazy dens thick with sweet-smelling smoke.
	   Dutch justice authorities tolerate the shops, arguing they let
police keep tabs on the soft drugs trade and keep cannabis users
away from hard drugs such as heroin.

Zhirinovsky: Give presidential hopefuls some on-the-job training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist
politician with a penchant for getting attention, proposed Friday
that Russia give its prospective presidential candidates some
on-the-job training.
	   Zhirinovsky suggested that the government appoint each of five
potential candidates to a post as deputy prime minister, and then
see what they can do, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   His proposed aspirants are liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky,
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Krasnoyarsk regional Gov. Alexander Lebed and, last
but surely not least, himself.
	   ``Let Yavlinsky take up the economy, Luzhkov agriculture,
Chernomyrdin gas and oil. Let Lebed first make the army such as it
should be,'' Zhirinovsky said.
	   His proposed role for himself: national policy, presumably
referring to policies toward national and ethnic groups within
Russia.
	   As with most of Zhirinovsky's proposals, there is no prospect
that the government will take the idea seriously. Zhirinovsky was
once considered a strong potential presidential contender, but is
now regarded primarily as the clown prince of Russian politics.

Monsanto denies testing seed with high-yield gene in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI (AP) _ Responding to threats from a militant farmers'
group, Monsanto Co. denied Friday it was locally testing seeds
altered with a gene that promotes greater yields but renders the
plants sterile.
	   ``Since the so-called terminator gene does not exist today in
any plant in any country in the world, the question of its
involvement in the field trials currently on in India does not
arise,'' the agricultural and pharmaceutical products giant said in
a statement.
	   Delta and Pine Land Co. of Scott, Missouri _ the largest cotton
seed company in the world recently acquired by Monsanto _ developed
and patented the gene, which produces higher yields but its crops
have sterile seeds.
	   Critics say seeds altered with the gene would force farmers to
repeatedly buy new seeds rather than saving seeds for successive
crops, eventually giving companies unprecedented control of the
world's food supply.
	   At least 90 percent of India's 400 million farmers conserve
seeds from crops for sowing in the next season, a choice they would
not have once they started using a variety of ``terminator seeds,''
food policy expert Devinder Sharma said.
	   The terminator seed was banned by India's federal government in
May, but experts say the prohibition can be easily flouted. Several
countries and international research groups have considered banning
or limiting the new system.
	   Monsanto was reacting to the threat of ``direct action'' a day
earlier by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, a powerful farmers'
lobby in the southern state of Karnataka, if Monsanto did not spell
out details of its field trials within a week.
	   Monsanto has received permission from the Indian government to
carry out field trials of a pest-resistant cotton seed in 40
locations in the three southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh
and Tamil Nadu, and the central Madhya Pradesh province.

Hundreds of youth protest planned anti-drug legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ There was an unmistakable sweet smell
in the air in Budapest's downtown Voeroesmarty Square Friday, where
a couple of hundred young people demonstrated against the
government's plan to tighten anti-drug legislation.
	   The amendment of the existing law would punish not only drug
dealers, but also users, and the center-right government is hopeful
the measure will help decrease drug consumption.
	   The government is proposing that anyone caught with even the
smallest amount of any drug could face time in prison. No date to
discuss the proposal has been set.
	   ``Don't criminalize us,'' a banner said.
	   According to surveys, some 20 percent of teen-agers already have
tried drugs, and more than 40 billion forints (dlrs 180 million)
was spent on drugs in the past year.
	   ``I smoke marijuana, and don't think I'm a criminal, and don't
want to go to prison,'' said 19-year-old Robi, who didn't give his
last name.
	   Organizers of the demonstration agree that drug consumption
should be reduced, but ``not by handling the question as a penal
case,'' teacher Gabor Tajta said.
	   It has long been debated in Hungary whether a partial
liberalization of laws regulating the use of soft drugs, or a total
ban on all drugs, would be desirable.
	   This year, 28 people already have died from overdosing on
heroin, twice as many as in 1997.
	   ``The extremely low number of hard-drug addicts in the
Netherlands show that it was a good decision from the authorities
to start to differentiate between hard and soft drugs,'' Martin
Hommenga, spokesman for the Dutch Health Institute, told the daily
Nepszabadsag.
	   At the end of the protest, demonstrators lighted candles in
memory of those who have died from a drug overdose.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ About 45 percent of middle
and high school students in the Cayman Islands have used drugs,
drank alcohol or smoked tobacco in the last year, a survey found.
	   The survey of 86 percent of the students age 11 to 17 by the
Cayman Islands National Drug Council found that drug use continues
to be lower than in Canada or the United States.
	   Among the findings:
	   _ 40 percent had drunk alcohol in the last year, and students
were beginning to drink at a younger age than five years ago, with
19 percent of seventh graders saying they had drunk alcohol;
	   _ 9 percent were active smokers;
	   _ 7 percent had smoked marijuana in the last year;
	   _ 4.5 percent had used hard drugs including heroin,
amphetamines, cocaine and others.
	   The Council said the survey would be used to evaluate and
develop drug abuse prevention programs.

Supreme Court increases Hells Angel's sentence to life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Friday increased
to life imprisonment the sentence of a Hells Angel who killed a
member of a rival gang in the last outburst of the Nordic biker
war.
	   Vagn Smidt had been sentenced to 16 years in September for the
shooting of Bjoern Gudmandsen, a member of the Bandidos, outside a
restauarnt in the resort town of Liseleje in 1997. Three other
bikers were wounded in the shooting, which was watched by scores of
vacationers.
	   Smidt claimed he fired in self-defense.
	   On appeal from the prosecutor, the Supreme Court raised Smidt's
sentence to life.
	   It was the second time the highest court increased sentences
related to the three-year feud between Hells Angels and Bandidos in
Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which had left 12 people dead
and more than 70 wounded.
	   In September, a Hells Angel who took part in a fatal shooting
attack on Bandidos members at the Copenhagen airport in March 1996,
was given a life term by the Supreme Court. Two other Hells Angels
also had their sentences slightly increased.

Stars donate a bit of their time to charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ever wanted to walk around on the arm of Leonardo
di Caprio, George Clooney or Cindy Crawford?
	   For those unable to realize that ambition, now there is at least
the chance to walk around with something that has been on the arm
of a heartthrob.
	   A total of 75 stars of cinema, sport, the catwalk and politics
have donated their watches for a New York auction to raise money
for charity, watch auctioneer Antiquorum announced Friday.
	   The Famous Faces Watch Auction, organized by Antiquorum and
retailer Tourneau, will take place Feb. 24.
	   All the money raised from the sale of each watch will go to a
charity nominated by the donor. Their choices range from the
Children of Chernobyl Foundation to the Palm Beach School of Arts.
	   Among the watches is a ``Desert Storm'' watch, worn by Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War.
	   He told Antiquorum he always wore two watches, one on his left
arm set to Saudi Arabian time and the watch to be auctioned on his
right arm, set to Eastern Standard Time.
	   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey donated her cherished Breguet
Marine gold self-winding watch, while U.S. comedian Bob Hope handed
over his ``red, white and blue watch'', worn on his Christmas
tours.
	   The idea for the sale came after a watch formerly owned by jazz
musician Duke Ellington made dlrs 673,500 at an auction last year,
Antiquorum marketing director Gloria Teresi said.
	   ``It was an important watch, but it made an amazing price and we
realized that the connections between celebrities and fine pieces
was very, very magnetic.''
	   Although not all the watches are valuable in themselves, some of
them will fetch six- or seven-figure sums, said Teresi.
	   A display of the watches will tour Geneva, Hong Kong, Tokyo and
cities across the United States from January.

Tempest on left as former premier lashes out at deceased president

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Michel Rocard has stirred a
tempest over the tomb of the late President Francois Mitterrand,
charging that the former head of state ``was not an honest man.''
	   The remark drew a deluge of condemnation from fellow Socialists,
exposing old divisions as the current prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, works to heal the rifts.
	   Rocard, prime minister from 1988-91, was long known as a foe of
Mitterrand, though both men were leading Socialists. He had in the
past taken jabs at Mitterrand, but his remark published Thursday in
La Revue du Droit Public was what the prestigious daily Le Monde
called in its lead headline Friday a ``cruel epitaph.''
	   Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande said in an interview
with Le Monde that he ``deplored with sadness'' the remark by
Rocard.
	   The remark was made in a commentary filled with caustic
observations about Mitterrand, who died in 1996 after 14 years as
head of state.
	   Michel Charasse, once a member of Mitterrand's inner circle,
replied scathingly, calling Rocard a ``failure.''
	   ``One does not have the right, even when one feels a bit
isolated, aging, a little shoved aside ... to say just anything to
get talked about,'' Charasse said. ``When you're a failure, you're
a failure.''
	   Socialist lawmaker Louis Mermaz called the remark ``totally
undignified.''
	   Rocard charged in the article that Mitterrand used ``ruse and
violence'' in his relations with others.
	   He claimed that Mitterrand accepted him as prime minister ``so
that I would sink,'' and then surrounded him with ``his black
guard,'' leaving him little leverage to make official appointments.
	   But ``my real problem was that Mitterrand was not an honest
man,'' Rocard wrote without elaborating.
	   Rocard remained silent Friday, not responding to the criticism
that rained on him in a public duel that underscored old divisions
among Socialists just as party leaders are trying to recreate their
image.
	   The only silent voice in the uproar was the opposition right.
	   Jack Lang, the former culture minister who also basked in
Mitterrand's inner circle, advised Rocard to take ``a couple days
of rest.''

Italy's energy giant, ENI, nominates company veteran as CEO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The board of Italian energy giant ENI has nominated
company veteran Vittorio Mincato as its new chief executive,
replacing Franco Bernabe after he left to oversee reforms at
Telecom Italia SpA.
	   Mincato had led the petrochemical division of ENI, the world's
seventh-largest oil and natural gas company in terms of sales.
	   With Bernabe, he presided over the restructuring of ENI's
petrochemical division after it was caught up in Italy's political
payoff scandals in the early 1990s. Bernabe also supervised ENI's
gradual privatization.
	   On Thursday, Telecom's board announced Bernabe was leaving ENI
to take over as the phone company's new chief executive. Board
members hope Bernabe will pull off the same kind of management
reforms at the phone company, which has been shaken by four top
management changes in the past two years.
	   ENI is Italy's largest company in terms of stock market
capitalization. Telecom is second.

Kosovo youth escape reality at concert of Bosnian singer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The lights went off and the music
started. For just a little while, the youth at the concert could
dream they were somewhere besides Kosovo.
	   For thousands of young people caught in a life of ethnic
divisions and fear in the southern Serbian province, the Thursday
evening concert of a popular Bosnian singer was a rare opportunity
to relax and forget.
	   ``This is a special event, a change, a rare chance to gather and
have fun,'' said 16-year-old Sandra Cosic, smiling as her eyes
scanned the packed hall of the sports center in Pristina, the
provinicial capital.
	   ``It's been a while since anybody famous came here to play for
us,'' added Milan Dobricevic, 19. ``I've never seen so many people
in one place.''
	   The popularity of Zdravko Colic, a singer from Sarajevo, dates
back to the 1970s when his records sold widely throughout former
Yugoslavia. When the war started in Bosnia in 1992, Colic stopped
singing and left Sarajevo. This tour is his first since then.
	   With their hands high in the air, swinging, dancing, laughing,
thousands of happy teen-agers living in this drab city seemed to
forget the reality around them _ the sporadic clashes, the hundreds
of dead and hundreds of thousands of homeless, the devastated
countryside, the uncertain future.
	   Although Pristina hasn't directly experienced the conflict
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, the
tensions are present, bringing fear and depriving young people of
what should be a carefree time in their lives.
	   ``We are all aware what the situation is like, but there are a
lot of us young people in Pristina and more such events should be
organized,'' Dobricevic said.
	   Still, even Colic's Serbo-Croatian music, which was loved by all
ethnic groups in former Yugoslavia, seemed unable to bridge the
divisions.
	   The concert audience was overwhelmingly Serb, with only a few
ethnic Albanians, who speak Albanian. Asked about ethnic Albanian
youths, the young Serbs said there might be some in the crowd but
certainly not many.
	   Why?
	   ``We have our cafes, they have theirs, we don't go to schools
together, we just don't mix,'' explained Janko Joksic, 20.
	   When Serbia deprived majority ethnic Albanians of their
self-rule in 1989, the two communities moved to two separate worlds
that rarely overlap. Teen-agers brought up in such a society rarely
break the rule.
	   ``I didn't pay attention whether they are here or not,'' said a
high school student who identified himself only as Marko. ``Only
those who go out and are friends with the Serbs are here now.''
	   They are few.
	   A young boy standing in the group of young Serbs said he was an
ethnic Albanian who came to see the concert with his Serb friends.
But he refused to give his name. Asked about other Kosovo
Albanians, he only smiled.

	   Corn maze a big hit
	   TRACY, California (AP) _ Cornstalk mazes are nothing new to
farmer Ron Dell'Osso, but he decided this year to add a few more
twists and turns _ 5 acres' (2 hectares') worth more.
	   Dell'Osso's family farm has one of the largest pumpkin yields in
California, producing about 2,500 tons (2,270 metric tons) a year.
	   When October rolls around, his family sets aside a few acres
(hectares) for the public, in the form of ``U-pick'' pumpkin patch.
To attract customers, Dell'Osso began to cut a few narrow paths in
a small cornfield.
	   ``I used to have little corn mazes, very little, nothing to
really talk about,'' Dell'Osso said.
	   But this year his family went all out, enlisting the Boys and
Girls Club of Tracy, local schools and volunteers from nearby banks
and businesses to build a monster maize maze and other attractions.
	   In a 10-acre (4 hectare) plot, Dell'Osso has built three
cornstalk mazes, a mini-maze made from bales of hay for small
children, a hay-bale pyramid for climbing, a pony ride ring with
two ponies, free hay rides and of course, a pumpkin patch.
	   It costs dlrs 3 to try one cornstalk maze. For all three, it is
dlrs 6. For an unlimited day-pass for an entire family, it runs
dlrs 20. And pumpkins? Twenty cents a pound. Everything else is
free.
	   For most people, it takes about 45 minutes to negotiate the
three corn mazes.
	   ``I had a kid run through here real fast and sweaty, saying he
did it in 10 minutes,'' said Sue Bryant, administrative assistant
for the Boys and Girls Club. ``Then there was a woman who took two
hours. We were getting a bit worried about her.''
	   Scores of families and school-age children have been running
through the mazes since Oct. 1. Dell'Osso thinks by the end of the
month, about 15,000 people will have tried the mazes, raising
roughly dlrs 90,000.
	   ``I figured it would be a nice fund-raiser for the club and the
school. They needed a fall fund-raiser,'' said Dell'Osso, a
third-generation grower whose family has farmed in the area for
more than 80 years. ``It's just a way for me to help out the
community.''

Clinton's worries: North Korean hostility, Japanese trade tensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material, changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Addressing two of the United States' biggest
worries in Asia, President Bill Clinton said Friday communist North
Korea may be taking a more hostile approach to America and its
Asian allies and he warned of increased trade tensions with Japan.
	   Closing out a two-day visit to Japan, Clinton said he was
reviewing his administration's policy toward North Korea, which
considers the United States an enemy and remains in a technical
state of war with South Korea 45 years after a Korean War
cease-fire.
	   He said William Perry, a former U.S. defense secretary, was
overseeing the policy review.
	   At a joint news conference at the Akasaka Palace, Clinton and
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said both nations realize Japan should
act quickly to help pull Asia out of its economic crisis. Clinton
struck a conciliatory tone, but earlier in the day he talked of
possible trade wars.
	   Clinton and Obuchi both said that North Korea must come clean on
a suspected secret nuclear weapons site and limit its ballistic
missile program. The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions
that the program has been accelerated.
	   ``There are some disturbing signs there,'' Clinton said, without
offering any details.
	   Obuchi, recalling North Korea's firing of a ballistic missile
over Japanese territory on Aug. 31, said the event was ``a very
shocking experience'' for the Japanese. He said the incident made
it even more important for North Korea to clear up suspicions about
its nuclear ambitions. Clinton said the missile shot was
destabilizing and ``disturbed us greatly.''
	   Clinton said a U.S. team he sent to North Korea this week to
insist on seeing a suspected secret nuclear weapons site was met
with ``completely unacceptable'' conditions. The North Koreans
demanded a dlrs 300 million payment in exchange for the inspection,
U.S. officials said.
	   ``It's fair to say that no one can be absolutely sure of whether
the North Korean position is simply a product of economic
difficulties so they're attempting to get more money out of various
countries for doing what they ought to be doing anyway, or whether
they really are moving toward a more hostile posture,'' Clinton
said. ``We will evaluate that very carefully.''
	   Later Clinton was flying to Seoul for a two-day visit that will
include meeting with U.S. troops at an Army training range and at
Osan Air Base, host to U.S. Air Force U-2 spy planes that keep an
eye on North Korea.
	   Clinton also will discuss the North Korea missile and nuclear
problems with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, officials said.
	   Speaking to reporters before Clinton's arrival in Seoul, Kim
said he would counsel the United States not to press North Korea
too hard on the issue of its suspected nuclear site.
	   ``We need patience when dealing with North Korea,'' Kim said.
``Without any conclusive evidence, it is not a good idea to blow up
the problem.''
	   At his news conference in Tokyo, Clinton stressed the importance
of Japan's economic revival. He said Obuchi's government must move
quickly to implement its newest economic recovery plan. And he also
cautioned that unless Japan becomes more open, today's tensions
over trade will only get worse.

France still undecided over participation in Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT typo in slug. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top French soccer officials failed to decide
whether to play in the controversial Confederations Cup, during a
meeting Friday aimed at resolving the muddle.
	   FIFA moved the eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug.
8 to placate France, which withdrew because of conflicts with the
European club calendar.
	   French Football Federation (FFF) president Claude Simonet
accepted the changes. But the summer dates upset Noel Le Graet,
president of the French National League (LNF), which plans to begin
its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   Simonet and Le Graet met with the FFF's governing general
council Friday, but failed to make a final decision on whether to
participate in the event, which will take place in Mexico.
	   ``We are flattered to be invited to this competition, but the
dates still present a problem,'' Simonet told reporters after the
meeting. ``We cannot create problems with the domestic calendar,
that is certain.''
	   French officials still hope to persuade FIFA to bring forward
the dates of the Confederations Cup to the end of the current
season.
	   FIFA will meet to discuss the conflict Dec. 4.
	   ``We cannot turn down an invitation a second time,'' Simonet
said.
	   French officials point to the possibility of an expanded
Champions League and the uncertainty over the pre-season Intertoto
Cup. Both might mean that clubs play extra matches in the summer.
	   Adding to the scheduling congestion, officials want the
1999-2000 season to finish as early as possible because of UEFA's
Euro 2000 Championship _ considered second in prestige only to the
World Cup, and far more important than the new Confederations Cup.
	   ``I can't envisage starting the first division after July 28,''
Simonet said.
	   The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League
Soccer and the Pan American Games (July 23-Aug. 8).
	   What's more, the dates force Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia - which
will compete in the Copa America between June 29 and July 18 - into
two major events in less than a month.
	   The underlying problem is not between FIFA and UEFA, former
soccer great Michel Platini, a member of FIFA's football committee,
told reporters.
	   ``Rather, the battle is between the big clubs and federations.
Each wants to have more matches to earn more money.''

Canadian vows to run again, complains of treatment by Canada
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REFILING to fix slug, CHANGE track and field to athletics in
10th para
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HERZLYIA, Israel (AP) _ Runner Ben Johnson told high school
students Friday that he lost his right to compete because he ``went
with the flow'' and took performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of Argentinean soccer star
Diego Maradona, who has also been suspended for drug use, Johnson
presented something of a mixed message.
	   On the one hand, he warned the 300 teen-agers packed into the
Ben Gurion High School gymnasium here that taking drugs ``can harm
you in the long run.
	   ``As a kid, I didn't know much better. I kind of went with the
flow. If I had discipline it would not have happened,'' he said.
``Don't make the mistake I did.''
	   On the other hand, Johnson was clearly bitter.
	   He suggested to the students that he had been singled out
unfairly and that Canada did not back him up when he was stripped
of his gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive
for steroids.
	   In an interview, he said ``all the top athletes'' used steroids
10 years ago, and many still do.
	   ``They had to pick on somebody, and they picked on me,'' he said
in the speech about his Olympics experience.
	   ``If I was from Britain or the United States my country would
have protected me.''
	   Johnson was banned for life from athletics in 1993 after failing
another drug test.
	   Even so, Johnson said he trains 20 to 25 hours a week and hopes
to compete in the year 2000 Olympics in Australia.
	   ``I can still run just as fast as before,'' Johnson said in an
interview. But time is running out with Johnson facing his 37th
birthday next month.
	   ``I want to return to track and field as fast as possible. At
36, I haven't much time left although I feel like a 20 year old,''
he added.
	   His manager, Morris Chrobotek, said there was a possibility that
Johnson could run for another country and said there were at least
10 countries that might accept Johnson. He named Israel, the United
States and Japan as possibilities.
	   ``He is striving to come back and prove to the world that he can
do it clean,'' said Chrobotek, noting Johnson had applied to the
Athletics Canada to reinstate him as a runner and cancel the
lifetime ban.
	   Johnson, in Israel as a guest of the Macabbieh Athletic
Association in Tel Aviv, ran 50-meter sprints with some of the
students after the speech, allowing some to win. He also gave
pointers on take off to the young runners.
	   ``I was very excited to meet this man. I remember him so well
from when I was small,'' said Ilan Ziv, 17.

to life imprisonment the sentence of a Hells Angel who killed a
member of a rival gang in the last outburst of the Nordic biker
war.
	   Vagn Smidt had been sentenced to 16 years in September for the
1997 shooting of Bjoern Gudmandsen, a member of the Bandidos,
outside a restaurant in the resort town of Liseleje. Three other
bikers were wounded in the shooting, which was watched by scores of
vacationers.
	   Smidt claimed he fired in self-defense.
	   On appeal from the prosecutor, the Supreme Court raised Smidt's
sentence to life.
	   It was the second time the highest court increased sentences
related to the three-year feud between Hells Angels and Bandidos in
Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which had left 12 people dead
and more than 70 wounded.
	   In September, a Hells Angel who took part in a fatal shooting
attack on Bandidos members at the Copenhagen airport in March 1996
was given a life term by the Supreme Court. Two other Hells Angels
also had their sentences slightly increased.

Italian soccer star to be operated in Vail

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Italian soccer star Alessandro Del Piero
will undergo surgery to repair a torn left knee ligament at Vail's
Steadman Hawkins Clinic, his agent announced Friday.
	   The operation will be performed early next week by professor
Richard Steadman, a surgeon who has treated major knee injuries of
several professional athletes, including Italian soccer players
Nicola Berti and Maurizio Ganz.
	   Del Piero, a 24-year-old star-forward of league champion
Juventus of Turin and of Italy's national team, was injured in play
action during a league game against Udinese two weeks ago.
	   Team doctors said he's expected to be sidelined for the
remainder of the Italian soccer season, through May.
	   One of the most classy and popular Italian players and the
Champions Cup leading scorer last season, Del Piero said in a
recent interview that he was prepared to face a long rehabilitation
``and be back to action, stronger than before, next season.''
	   The player was scheduled to fly to Denver, via Chicago, Saturday
morning along with his agent Claudio Pasqualin and Juventus doctor
Riccardo Agricola.

FIA defends exclusive deal with Formula One
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The dispute between auto racing authorities and the
European Commission intensified Friday when the International
Automobile Federation (FIA) said that Brussels has no right to
interfere in its contracts with Formula One Administration Ltd.
	   European Commission antitrust officials, headed by competition
commissioner Karel van Miert, are pushing ahead with an inquiry
into the running of Formula One racing to ensure it complies with
EU fair-trading rules.
	   But in a statement, Max Mosley, FIA president, said the deal
between FIA and Formula One ``could not be rendered null and void
by Mr. Van Miert or anyone else. It has no effect on competition.''
	   Formula One Administration Ltd. is the U.K.-based company that
holds broadcasting and other rights to Grand Prix racing.
	   The Commission is expected to rule on the matter in 1999, which
could impact Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone's plans to launch a
dlrs 2 billion Eurobond issue.

Senator says Puerto Rico must choose between statehood and
</HEADLINE>
independence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Just 23 days before Puerto Ricans
vote on the island's political future, Sen. Robert Torricelli said
Friday that Puerto Rico must ultimately choose between statehood or
independence.
	   The question is not whether Congress will approve statehood but
whether it will allow the current commonwealth status to continue,
Torricelli said at a press conference with Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello and Perth Amboy, New Jersey, mayor Joseph Vas, who was
born in Puerto Rico and has family there.
	   The Democratic senator from New Jersey said the elimination in
1996 of a key federal tax break for U.S. corporations with
operations in Puerto Rico was the beginning of the end for
commonwealth status.
	   Most members of Congress and many Puerto Ricans consider Puerto
Rico a colony, but commonwealth supporters on the island say the
relationship with the United States should be improved, not
scrapped.
	   On Dec. 13, voters will choose between four status definitions
that describe statehood, independence, free association and the
current commonwealth status. But the political party supporting
commonwealth has urged its followers to vote ``none of the above''
to protest Congress' definition of commonwealth.

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The first part of the international
space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a
faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space
exploration and colonization.
	   A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its
initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the
unit was operating as planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or
Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous
with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched
Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.

Reports: Turkey boycotts BP, Amoco over rift on Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>
pipeline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Energy Ministry has stopped
buying crude oil from British Petroleum and U.S.-based Amoco in
retaliation for their alleged lobbying against a Turkish pipeline
project for Caspian Sea oil, according to news reports Friday.
	   The reported Turkish boycott comes weeks before an international
consortium, including BP and Amoco, is to decide whether to pick
the Turkish pipeline route or an alternative.
	   Earlier Friday, Amoco said it would consider such a boycott
``regrettable.''
	   Energy Ministry Undersecretary Yurdakul Yigitguden refused to
comment on the reports but said: ``Under the circumstances, it
should be understandable that the government would deal with
companies that have a long-term focus on Turkey.''
	   According to private television NTV and other news media, Turkey
also dropped Amoco from international bidding to build a liquefied
natural gas processing plant near the Aegean port city of Izmir.
The project is expected to cost Turkey dlrs 500 million.
	   Last week, Yigitguden challenged the consortium's projections on
the costs of the Turkish pipeline project, which would carry oil
from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean
coast.
	   The consortium forecast the cost of the 1,730-kilometer
(1,081-mile) pipeline at dlrs 3.7 billion. Turkey says it would
cost only dlrs 2.3 billion.
	   The consortium is said to be opting for a shorter and cheaper
pipeline running through the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa.
	   The consortium is made up of companies from the United States
and seven other nations. It was not clear why Amoco and BP would
have been singled out for punishment by Turkey.
	   The United States is actively lobbying for Turkey in an apparent
effort to keep Russia's influence over former Soviet republics at
bay.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams carried out field
inspections Friday while Iraqis, relieved that the threat of U.S.
air strikes was over, flocked to outdoor markets, amusement parks
and picnic grounds.
	   The inspectors' working on the Muslim sabbath is a change of
policy. Traditionally they took Fridays off. But Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission that oversees
disarmament efforts, said teams would work seven days a week in
future.
	   ``We want to get on with things and get as much done in as short
a period of time as possible,'' Cross said.
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad. The inspectors refused to talk to reporters,
and Cross would not say where they were going.
	   But the inspectors were believed to be checking the monitoring
equipment they had installed at known weapons sites before the
recent crisis.
	   The more contentious inspections _ when the U.N. experts make
surprise visits to sites where they suspect evidence of banned
weaponry is hidden _ are not expected until next week. The
inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift the
punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The inspectors resumed work on Wednesday, a day after they flew
back from Bahrain, where they had gone early last week amid fears
of air strikes.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened to use force if
Iraq did not reverse its decisions in August and October that
effectively put an end to inspections.
	   Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging full cooperation with
UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has said he will maintain forces in the Gulf
to ensure Iraq follows through.
	   On Friday, the relief was tangible among Iraqis who crowded
Baghdad's mosques and strolled in its many gardens and parks.
	   ``Life is again normal and we can live,'' said Nawal Jamil as
she walked with her husband and three children at Al-Zawra Park in
Al-Mansour neighborhood.
	   Bakr al-Samerai, the preacher at the Abdel-Kader al-Gailani
Mosque, had a similar message in his Friday sermon: ``We thank God
that the crisis ended.''
	   But others expressed concern at the American presence in the
Gulf and its threat to strike without warning if Iraq breaks its
pledge of cooperation.
	   Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at the 14th of Ramadan Mosque,
urged other Arab nations to ``stand by Iraq and tell America that
we will not allow this oppression and aggression to continue.''
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar
Hamdoon, told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that ``it
is not unlikely for the crisis to erupt again.''
	   He suggested the United States would try to provoke the Baghdad
regime, but he said the Iraqi government was ``keen on warding off
a crisis because we want the (U.N.) comprehensive review to take
place as soon as possible.''
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' of its
progress on disarmament will lead to an easing or lifting of the
sanctions, which have limited oil sales and crippled the economy.
	   However, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter
Burleigh, has said the United States does not see the review as
leading automatically to the lifting of sanctions.
	   Neither Iraq nor UNSCOM has been saying much since the
inspections resumed.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''

Skinstad steps up for Springboks against Scots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Bobby Skinstad, one of the rising stars of world
rugby union, gets the chance to terrorize the Scots at Murrayfield
Saturday and help South Africa to its 16th international victory in
a row.
	   A 22-year-old loose forward, Skinstad went on as a substitute in
last week's 28-20 win over Wales, which the South Africans were
losing by three points with three minutes to go, and impressed with
his all-action play at the back of the scrum.
	   Now he replaces Andre Venter, whose late try clinched South
Africa's victory but who is regarded by Springboks coach Nick
Mallett as less influential than Skinstad.
	   ``Bobby Skinstad is a game-breaker,'' Mallett said. ``I just had
to find a place for him.''
	   The Scots have made sweeping changes with stars such as Rob
Wainwright and Gregor Townsend no longer on the starting lineup.
Three players, New Zealand-born John Leslie, Jamie Mayer and Budge
Pountney, make their debuts against a Springbok team which also has
former Canadian international Christian Stewart making his debut in
a South African shirt at center.
	   The Scotland-South Africa matchup at Murrayfield is one of five
international matches this weekend and the program makes it appear
the World Cup has come a year early.
	   Five Nations titlist France has a tough game against Australia,
Wales meets Argentina and there are two World Cup qualifying
matches, Ireland vs. Romania and England vs. Italy on Sunday, even
though all four teams have already made it safely through to next
year's championship.
	   Australia, on a brief 13-day tour, has injury and illness
concerns. Winger Jason Little (flu) and flyhalf Steve Larkham
(knee) are expected to play. However, Australia will be without
seven topline players, prompting starts for fullback Chris Lathan,
center Nathan Grey and prop Patricio Noriega.
	   France is also banged up. Winger Emile Ntamack has been replaced
by Philippe Breton-Salles, while five-eighth Thomas Castaignede,
prop Christian Califano and fullback Jean-Luc Sadourny are
unavailable.
	   After going so close to beating the mighty South Africans, the
Welsh, now playing under Kiwi coach Graham Henry, are hopeful of a
victory over the Pumas at Llanelli.
	   ``Argentina are very powerful up front,'' said back row forward
Scott Quinnell, who teams up again with his 266-pound brother Craig
in the Welsh pack. ``But, as against South Africa, we've got to get
in their faces. I'm sure our pack will relish the challenge.''
	   England and Italy both crushed the Netherlands to ensure places
in the World Cup and the English, a 110-0 winner over the mainly
amateur Dutch players, are strongly favored to beat the Italians at
Huddersfield.
	   The Italians ran in 11 tries against the Dutch in a 67-7 win but
England's strong pack shouldn't allow them so many opportunities.
Although a place in the finals has been clinched, England sends out
the same starting 15 as against the Dutch in what is a foretaste of
2000, when Italy joins up to make it a Six Nations competition
instead of Five.
	   ``This is their first crack at England since they have been
granted this honor and they will want to ensure that they make a
mark,'' said England coach Clive Woodward, whose team will have to
watch out for the accurate kicking of Diego Dominguez and slick
handling of the Italian backs.
	   After watching Romania only narrowly beat Georgia 27-23 on
Wednesday, Ireland is expecting a confidence-boosting win at
Lansdowne Road.
	   ``We were not overly impressed by their performance and we
expected a bit more,'' Irish team coach Warren Gatland said of the
Romanians' showing. ``In some respects that makes it a bit more
difficult from our point of view because all of our own players
were at the match (in Dublin) and there may be a danger of
complacency being a factor.''

Military police reportedly to discipline Zimbabwean troops in
</HEADLINE>
Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe dispatched 1,500 military
police to Congo amid fears some Zimbabwean troops deployed there
are on the verge of mutiny, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Zimbabwe Independent, a respected independent business
weekly, said the military police aimed to crack down on
``unprecedented indiscipline'' among soldiers discontented with
their role in an offensive against Congolese rebels in the east of
the vast mineral-rich country.
	   Zimbabwe has about 8,000 troops fighting alongside Angolan and
Namibian allies supporting Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Zimbabwe army spokesman Col. Chancellor Diye acknowledged that
extra military police were dispatched to Congo, but refuted the
report they were being sent to quell a possible mutiny.
	   The unspecified number of military police were being dispatched
for routine duties, including guarding prisoners, military traffic
control and routine military discipline, Diye said.
	   The newspaper, quoting unidentified military sources, said
morale among Zimbabwean troops was plunging, raising fears of a
full-scale mutiny.
	   The Zimbabwe government says nine of its soldiers have been
killed in action in Congo and 16 captured, but the newspaper said
its sources believed at least 60 Zimbabweans have died in fighting
since they were deployed in mid-August.
	   Some officers were only reporting for duty sporadically, the
paper said.
	   Zimbabwean officers also expressed concern over the low caliber
of Congolese government troops and the ease with which they were
infiltrated.
	   The paper said one senior officer was wounded in a gunfight with
a rebel sympathizer who infiltrated Congolese forces and another,
identified only a Maj. Ncube, was killed when a woman companion
lured him to a rebel hideout.

Orsay museum opens its doors after two-week strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Orsay Museum employees ended a two-week strike
Friday, finally giving impatient visitors a chance to see a prized
collection of 19th century art.
	   The workers had been demanding a bonus of 1,600 francs (dlrs
280) for extra work in connection with the hugely popular exhibit
of works by Van Gogh and Jean-Francois Millet.
	   The museum decided to give a one-time 1,000 franc (dlrs 180)
payout to all employees whose work brings them in contact with the
public as well as three extra days off. The entire staff will get
two extra days off.
	   The workers had protested ``the disastrous conditions''
resulting from the Van Gogh-Millet exhibition, which opened Sept.
17 and runs until Jan. 3.
	   Visitors at times had to wait up to three hours in line to get
inside, and museum employees complained tourists were venting their
anger on them.
	   More than 3 million visitors come to see the exhibit at the
renovated train station on the Left Bank of the Seine River, which
is one of Paris' main tourist attractions.
	   The strike was just the latest in a wave of walkouts which have
closed major Paris attractions this fall, including the Eiffel
Tower and the National Library.

	   HERZLYIA, Israel (AP) _ Runner Ben Johnson told high school
students Friday that he lost his right to compete because he ``went
with the flow'' and took performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of Argentinean soccer star
Diego Maradona, who has also been suspended for drug use, Johnson
presented something of a mixed message.
	   On the one hand, he warned the 300 teen-agers packed into the
Ben Gurion High School gymnasium here that taking drugs ``can harm
you in the long run.
	   ``As a kid, I didn't know much better. I kind of went with the
flow. If I had discipline it would not have happened,'' he said.
``Don't make the mistake I did.''
	   On the other hand, Johnson was clearly bitter.
	   He suggested to the students that he had been singled out
unfairly and that Canada did not back him up when he was stripped
of his gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive
for steroids.
	   In an interview, he said ``all the top athletes'' used steroids
10 years ago, and many still do.
	   ``They had to pick on somebody, and they picked on me,'' he said
in the speech about his Olympics experience.
	   ``If I was from Britain or the United States my country would
have protected me.''
	   Johnson was banned for life from athletics in 1993 after failing
another drug test.
	   Even so, Johnson said he trains 20 to 25 hours a week and hopes
to compete in the year 2000 Olympics in Australia.
	   ``I can still run just as fast as before,'' Johnson said in an
interview. But time is running out with Johnson facing his 37th
birthday next month.
	   ``I want to return to track and field as fast as possible. At
36, I haven't much time left although I feel like a 20 year old,''
he added.
	   His manager, Morris Chrobotek, said there was a possibility that
Johnson could run for another country and said there were at least
10 countries that might accept Johnson. He named Israel, the United
States and Japan as possibilities.
	   ``He is striving to come back and prove to the world that he can
do it clean,'' said Chrobotek, noting Johnson had applied to the
Athletics Canada to reinstate him as a runner and cancel the
lifetime ban.
	   Johnson, in Israel as a guest of the Macabbieh Athletic
Association in Tel Aviv, ran 50-meter sprints with some of the
students after the speech, allowing some to win. He also gave
pointers on take off to the young runners.
	   ``I was very excited to meet this man. I remember him so well
from when I was small,'' said Ilan Ziv, 17.

Several thousand demonstrate against student's death in camp

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Several thousand Eritrean university
students demonstrated peacefully Friday against the death of a
fellow student in a detention camp in Ethiopia.
	   Observers, who included diplomats, university professors and
clergy, estimated the crowd at more than 2,000 or half the
enrollment of Asmara University.
	   Demonstrators carried signs saying ``Why Students?'' and ``No
More Patience.'' They said it was the first student demonstration
in the history of Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia
in 1993 after a 30-year war.
	   Ghebrekidan Zekarias, a 27-year-old statistics major, died of an
inflammatory bowel disease Oct. 7 at the Blatien detention center
in southwestern Ethiopia, according to the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
	   Two other young Eritreans died of unspecified illness at the
camp around the same time, the ICRC said.
	   Zekarias was one of 85 Eritrean students in Ethiopia on an
exchange program between the two neighboring nations in the Horn of
Africa. When a long-simmering border dispute turned violent in
early May, Ethiopia interned the students in a camp at Fiche north
of the capital, Addis Ababa.
	   Later, 46 were released and sent back to Eritrea, and 39 others
were sent to Blatien.
	   Ethiopia is holding 1,300 Eritreans, including the remaining 38
students, in detention camps on the grounds they are security
risks.
	   Awet Twelde, one of the 46 released students, said Eritrean
detainees in Fiche had been beaten with sticks and gun butts by
guards there.
	   He also said detainees seen talking to Red Cross delegates or
foreign journalists were roughed up after they left.
	   In June, Eritrea allowed the 49 Ethiopian exchange students
studying at Asmara University to take their exams before being
flown back to Ethiopia.
	   ``We will never regret the way our people treated the Ethiopian
students, because that is the way we wanted the Ethiopians to treat
us,'' Tewelde said.
	   Several hundred people were killed in air raids and cross border
shelling in June.
	   Frequent artillery exchanges have been reported in the past few
weeks.
	   Outside attempts to broker a peaceful settlement to the border
dispute have been fruitless.
	   Most peace plans call on Eritrea to withdraw from contested
areas along the common border before demilitarization and
demarcation can be carried out. Eritrea has refused to move from
what it calls its rightful territory.

Latvian PM candidate names coalition

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Efforts to form a governing coalition
including the biggest party in parliament have failed, leaving
Latvia the choice of a minority government or an awkward majority
constellation including both right-wingers and former communists.
	   Vilis Kristopans, who was named by President Guntis Ulmanis to
form a new government, announced Thursday night that his centrist
Latvia's Way party had reached a coalition agreement with the
centrist New Party and the rightwing Fatherland and Freedom.
	   Together, those parties hold only 46 of the 100 seats in the
Saeima parliament.
	   Ulmanis had said he hoped the coalition negotiations would be
able to bring in the People's Party, which won 23 seats in last
month's national elections. But People's Party leader Andris Skele,
a former prime minister, is widely regarded as abrasive and the
coalition talks reportedly broke down in clashes between him and
Kristopans.
	   Kristopans said he would likely seek the support of the leftist
Social Democrats, who have 14 legislative seats, possibly by
offering them several ministerial post, the Baltic News Service
reported.
	   But the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom has opposed
cooperation with the Social Democrats, whose leaders include former
high-ranking communists.
	   If it manages to win approval, the Kristopans government would
replace the outgoing coalition government lead by Prime Minister
Guntars Krasts, a member of Fatherland and Freedom.

Border guards detain 113 illegal aliens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Border guards in northeastern Poland
detained 113 refugees, the largest group of illegal aliens this
year, who crossed the border from Lithuania on Friday, officials
said.
	   The refugees _ men, women and children _ come from several Asian
countries, including Afghanistan, Vietnam, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
according to Col. Stanislaw Firlej, spokesman for the district
Border Guard unit in the northeastern city of Bialystok.
	   They split into several groups after crossing the border early
Friday and were stopped near the city of Suwalki, about 250
kilometers (155 miles) northeast of Warsaw, he said.
	   Firlej said the refugees will be passed to Lithuanian
authorities, according to a readmission agreement between the two
countries.
	   Since eastern European borders were opened after the fall of the
Iron Curtain in 1989, Poland has become a transit country for
refugees from Asia and southeastern Europe seeking a better life in
Germany and other Western countries.
	   During the first 10 months of 1998, 6,197 people tried to cross
Poland's borders without permission, according to Miroslaw
Szacillo, a national border guard spokesman.
	   Szacillo said Poland also refused entry to some 40,000 people
this year, thus preventing many potential attempts of illegal
crossing into Germany.

Montenegro protests to Serbia over impounding of a weekly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro sharply protested Friday
Serbia's impounding of an independent weekly, saying the
``repressive'' move further deteriorates relations between
Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   In a letter sent to the Serbian and Yugoslav governments,
Montenegro's Information Minister Bozidar Jaredic said impounding
the weekly represents ``major breach'' of the Yugoslav constitution
which calls for a free flow of information between the two member
republics.
	   The letter was made available to the Associated Press.
	   On Thursday, Serbian police at the Montenegrin border
confiscated and impounded all copies of the current edition of the
Monitor weekly were to go on sale in Serbia the next day.
	   A Serbian court later fined Monitor over 2.8 million dinars
(dlrs 280,000) for breaking the republic's restrictive information
law by publishing a picture of a clenched fist, the symbol of a
Belgrade University student group that has called for the toppling
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
	   The pro-Western Montenegrin leadership has been trying to
distance itself from Milosevic's autocratic rule, and relations
with Serbia have been very strained during the past year.
	   In the letter, Montenegro demanded ``an urgent end to the
illegal repressive'' moves by the Serbian authorities, warning such
action ``will further deteriorate relations'' between the two.
	   Three independent Belgrade newspapers were briefly banned last
month when Serbia's government passed a decree demanding strictly
``patriotic'' coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
imposed hefty fines on publishers of articles that authorities deem
anti-state.
	   Two other leading papers have already been slapped with
draconian fines for criticizing Milosevic's regime. Another major
independent daily temporarily closed down to avoid the fines.
	   Several Serbian newspapers tried to avert the media law by
publishing in Montenegro.

Deadly explosion hits Swaziland deputy prime minister's office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ An explosion demolished part of the
deputy prime minister's office Friday, killing at least one person
and wounding two others, according to a press report.
	   The explosion rocked the capital Mbabane just before 5 p.m.
(1500 GMT). Hundreds of onlookers gathered as police and firemen
searched the rubble and found three seriously injured victims, the
South African Press Association reported.
	   One man, believed a security guard, later died in a hospital,
SAPA reported. The blast destroyed a security guard hut.
	   It was not immediately clear if Deputy Prime Minister Arthur
Khoza was in the area, or what might have caused the blast.
	   On Oct. 28, an explosion badly damaged a bridge two hours after
King Mswati III crossed it, injuring one person.
	   In that case, police said they were investigating a possible
connection to political activists who have been protesting
Swaziland's ban on political parties.
	   Swaziland is a country of 1 million people sandwiched between
South Africa and Mozambique.

Two policemen killed, four wounded in Kosovo violence

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels were accused
of ambushing a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others in the latest outbreak of
violence in Kosovo.
	   As fresh white snow blanketed this troubled province of Serbia,
making roads hazardous and disrupting aid convoys, the low level of
conflict that has persisted despite an official cease-fire
continued.
	   The official Serb Media Center said ``Albanian extremists''
struck early Friday near Prilep, on the road from Pec to Djakovica
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the center said, when guerrillas fired an anti-tank round
into their vehicle and then opened up with small arms.
	   The dead were identified as Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos
Cizmadzija, 45. Three of their colleagues were badly wounded and
transported to the hospital in Pristina. A fourth suffered light
injuries.
	   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but it typifies
the violence between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels since last month's cease-fire and the Oct. 12 agreement
between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and President
Slobodan Milisevic.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded in the same area Wednesday.
Another was reported abducted earlier this week in Podujevo,
northeast of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the two million
people living in the province. Their political leadership is
seeking independence from Serbia. Hundreds of Albanians, mostly
civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during a
government crackdown from February to October.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was forced to divert three aid convoys
Friday carrying food, blankets and mattresses. The supplies
originally were destined for distribution points west of Pristina,
but were sent instead to Podujevo after a snowfall of between 20
and 50 centimeters (8 and 20 inches), said spokesman Fernando del
Mundo.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says no
refugees now live in the open. Many are sheltering in the homes of
friends and relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in
their damaged houses. But they still need supplies to survive the
winter, Del Mundo said.
	   ``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain
areas,'' he said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are
sharing food with displaced people. ... Until the next harvest,
they will need support.''
	   The UNHCR says about 60,000 refugees have returned to their
homes over the last few weeks. But High Commissioner Sadako Ogata
said the fragile peace ``is marred by virtually daily incidents.''
	   Mrs. Ogata, speaking in Geneva, called on countries hosting
Kosovo refugees to be patient and for the Yugoslav authorities and
ethnic Albanians to refrain from violence.
	   The UNHCR estimates that 68,000 Yugoslav citizens, mostly Kosovo
Albanians, have applied for asylum in Western Europe this year.
Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have the largest numbers.
	   Meanwhile, the top U.S. mediator for Kosovo dismissed the idea
that Serbian President Milan Milutinovic had rejected a U.S. draft
plan that reportedly would give ethnic Albanians virtual self-rule.
	   ``We don't consider the Serbs have rejected our agreement and
expect to be talking to them in the next few days,'' mediator
Christopher Hill said in Lisbon, Portugal.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic on Wednesday dismissed the
U.S. proposal for giving too much power to independence-minded
ethnic Albanians.

Study shows less than half of French bathe daily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French may be cleaner than they were 20 years
ago, but less than half bathe daily, a study says.
	   According to the annual study published by France's Committee on
Health Education, only 47 percent of the population takes a bath or
a shower daily _ and only because they feel they have to, not
because they like it.
	   The study, published Friday by the daily Le Figaro, shows the
French are not as clean as Germans, British and Scandinavians, but
have better hygiene than the Spanish, Portuguese and Greeks.
	   Yet, when it comes to bathrooms and washing machines, France is
better equipped than some of its neighbors.
	   In 1997, 95 percent of French homes had washing machines, and 96
percent had bathrooms, the report said. In 1962, just 29 percent
had bathrooms.
	   As for dental hygiene, the study says about 67 percent of French
brush their teeth twice daily, 25 percent brush once a day, and 8
percent say they don't brush at all.
	   ``Today people are much more aware of the importance of dental
hygiene,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Dhumeaux-Boedels, a Paris
orthodontist. ``This includes children, thanks to aggressive
campaigns by primary schools, parents and dentists themselves.''
	   The study also shows the French remain Europe's biggest
consumers of cosmetics and beauty products, a holdover from the
days of King Louis XIV.
	   The Sun King and his court perfumed themselves with heavy
fragrances to camouflage strong body odor. Louis liked an audience
when he relieved himself, but wouldn't have been caught dead
washing.
	   ``Call it a French particularity,'' Edouard Zarifian was quoted
as saying by Le Figaro. ``Because, at the same time, in other
European courts, bathing had been elevated to an institution.''

Report: Russia in danger of becoming oil importer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with this year's production figures in 5th graf,
export quotas reduced for key oil companies in last two grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is in danger of becoming an oil importer
after years of being one of the world's largest oil producers, a
top official was reported as saying Friday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is in charge of
economic policy, said oil production has been falling for the past
10 years and urgent action was needed to reverse the decline,
according to the Interfax news agency. Oil is Russia's largest
source of export earnings.
	   ``The situation in the oil sector is critical,'' Maslyukov said,
adding that the government must take ``serious measures'' to
resolve the industry's problems.
	   Russian oil production is likely to fall to 270 million metric
tons in 1999, and to 220 million metric tons in 2000, Maslyukov
warned during a meeting with officials of Transneft, the operator
of Russia's oil pipeline network.
	   In 1997, Russia's crude oil production totaled 297 million tons.
So far this year, crude production has been 244 million tons, 1
percent down from this time last year, Interfax quoted the State
Statistics Committee as saying.
	   The oil industry, like much of the Russian economy, is plagued
by old and inefficient equipment, corruption and lack of funds for
developing existing and new oil fields.
	   Meanwhile, the Fuel and Energy Ministry has reduced the export
quotas for six leading Russian oil companies because they haven't
been delivering the required amount of crude to domestic
refineries.
	   The reductions for Rosneft, Sibneft, Sidanko, Slavneft, Tatneft
and Onako will be reversed if the companies fulfill their domestic
obligations, the Interfax news agency quoted ministry officials as
saying.

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Leaning out of jeep windows,
Palestinian policemen triumphantly hoisted assault rifles into the
air Friday and fired quick volleys to celebrate their takeover of
this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to town greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and
villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full or partial
control over an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank and took
him one step closer to his final goal _ statehood.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles, roughly the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   However, support for the land-for-security agreement is slipping
in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government, and
Israeli media said Friday the prime minister might call early
elections in the spring, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   In the month since the signing of the accord in Washington,
Israel and the Palestinians have incessantly argued about each
others' obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind
schedule because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.
	   Last-minute glitches also threatened to hold up the pullback
itself. Without informing the Palestinians, Israel made changes in
the redeployment map Thursday night, such as keeping several roads,
including the one to Qabatieh, under full Israeli control for the
time being, rather than handing them to the Palestinians.
	   Israeli soldiers had already been busy for several hours moving
130 brown-and-yellow road markers to intersections in the northern
West Bank to delineate the new borders when the Palestinians raised
questions about the Israeli changes.
	   The withdrawal screeched to a halt. Maps in hand, Israel's army
commander in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, flew by
helicopter to Arafat's headquarters. The two looked at the maps,
Arafat gave his okay and the crisis was over.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, usually a tough critic of
the Israeli government, said that surprisingly the arguments of
recent weeks may have brought the two sides closer together.
	   But more needed to be done, he said. ``We have to concentrate
... and have to exert maximum efforts to build the trust required
between us,'' Erekat said.
	   On Friday afternoon, once the map crisis was over, Palestinian
police took up their new positions in 36 towns and villages near
Jenin and the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 resident, hundreds turned out to
watch the jeep convoy slowly making its way along the main street.
	   Two teen-agers jumped onto the roof of the lead jeep and hoisted
a large Palestinian flag. Officers in blue camouflage uniforms
hanging out of the windows raised their Kalashnikov assault rifles
and fired quick volleys into the air.
	   Half a dozen Qabatieh residents joined in the chorus, firing
their own machine guns, M-16 assault rifles and pistols.
	   The display of fire power is not unusual for Qabatieh which was
a stronghold of resistance to Israeli occupation during the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising.
	   At the height of the revolt in 1988, hundreds of residents had
rushed to the main square to cheer as vigilantes strung up the body
of a suspected collaborator with Israel on an electricity pole.
	   On that pole, residents on Friday draped a banner reading
``Today Qabatieh, tomorrow Jerusalem,'' a reference to Palestinian
hopes to one day establish their capital in the holy city.
	   At the ``Abu Halala Cafe' on main street, opinion was divided
over whether the new rulers would bring sweeping changes.
	   Teissir Mansour, a 50-year-old merchant sitting on a chair on
the sidewalk, puffing on a cigarette, said it was time police put
an end to rampant lawlessness. Many town residents are driving
unlicensed cars without insurance, he said, prompting clan feuds
over who will pay for the aftermath of accidents.
	   His neighbor in the cafe, 55-year-old Khalil Abu Rub, was upset
that he would still have to pass an Israeli checkpoint on his way
to Jenin. ``I think nothing will change,'' he said grimly.
	   The withdrawal left several Jewish settlements in the area as
isolated enclaves, and Israeli troops began reinforcing them with
cement trenches and shooting positions.
	   In Ganim, a community of 51 families, many were thinking about
leaving. Ilan Amar, 34, who had just moved to Ganim with his wife
Rikki and three children three months ago, said he felt cheated.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Amar, who sells car paints in the Israeli
port city of Haifa.
	   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including
150 criminals. Arafat had demanded that all those freed be
Palestinians who fought against Israeli occupation and despite some
joyous family reunions Friday, many Palestinians felt disappointed.
	   In a third step, Israel and the Palestinians signed the protocol
for operating Yasser Arafat International Airport in the Gaza Strip
town of Dahanieh. The airport, a strong symbol of fledgling
Palestinian independence, will open Tuesday with a flight from
Cairo carrying Egyptian government officials.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla hideouts after attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three guerrillas reported killed, Amal's denial,
Hezbollah bomb attack. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck Friday in southern
Lebanon, retaliating for attacks on Israeli outposts in which three
guerrillas died.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on a valley
between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   Israel believes the area is a base for Lebanese guerrillas
opposed to Israel's occupation of the border region in southern
Lebanon.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties. An Israeli army
spokesman said the planes returned safely to base after hitting
targets.
	   The air raid followed attacks on Israeli and allied positions in
the border enclave early Friday, the Lebanese officials said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   They said guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Amal group carried out
the attacks. An Israeli army spokesman said three guerrillas were
killed but he did not identify their group. Amal denied any of its
fighters were killed.
	   The attacks come at a time of heightened tension in which Israel
has been launching air raids over southern Lebanon almost daily.
	   Israel occupied the border region in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border attacks.
	   Israel suffered its heaviest losses in the zone in more than a
year when the guerrilla group Hezbollah killed three Israeli
soldiers with a roadside bomb Nov. 16.

Federal Reserve Chairman says euro depends on ECB's credibility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Siding with European central bankers,
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that the
success of Europe's single currency, the euro, depends on the
credibility of the new central bank that will watch over it.
	   Pointing to the German mark, Greenspan said its strength was
based on the reputation of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
	   ``If the European Central Bank fails to inherit the reputation''
of the Bundesbank, then the euro could be ``undercut,'' Greenspan
said via a video link from Washington to a banking conference in
Frankfurt.
	   But he also said ``I have considerable confidence that the
advent of the euro will be a successful one.''
	   Turning to foreign exchange rates, Greenspan called it an
``illusion'' to think target zones for the world's major currencies
could succeed.
	   ``One might argue it's a desirable goal, but not credible or
feasible,'' Greenspan said.
	   The idea is favored by Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister in
Germany's new center-left government, who views it as a way to
avoid harmful swings in financial markets.
	   Greenspan said the money that central banks would need to defend
the foreign exchange target, coupled with other technical problems,
make such a program ``extraordinarily difficult to manage.''
	   He also said interest rates would be a difficult way to manage
target zones. If Europe were in a recession, for example, and its
currency was at the lower end of the band, it wouldn't want to
raise interest rates to defend the currency.
	   The Bundesbank, which maintains it must remain free of political
interference, has ignored recent calls by Lafontaine for lower
interest rates in the euro zone to promote economic growth.
	   On Thursday the Bundesbank left its key interest rates
unchanged, just two days after the Federal Reserve trimmed its
rates for a third time in recent weeks,
	   Interest rates across much of Europe are already easing as
central banks bring their rates in line with the low levels in
Germany and France, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer told the
conference.
	   ``There is an agreement it should be done at a lower level _
that is all going on _ it's moving in the right direction,''
Tietmeyer said in a question-and-answer session following a speech.
	   Tietmeyer added that a convergence of interest rates in coming
weeks is essential as the euro will start with a single money
market rate on Jan. 1.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man accused of orchestrating the
U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man
Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the
permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.
	   The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on
Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.
	   ``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,''
Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The
Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in
the Afghan capital, Kabul. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a
man without sin. ... He is a free man.''
	   The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban
information minister said in a statement Friday.
	   The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions
that bin Laden is a rich man, saying the Saudi dissident has had
his foreign assets frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated.

Report: US Consul charged in car accident in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The traffic safety department in the city of
Vladivostok in Russia's Far East has charged the U.S. consul
general with injuring a pedestrian in a car accident, a news report
said Friday.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow confirmed that Consul General Douglas
Kent was in a car accident Oct. 27. Embassy spokesman Michael
Hurley had no other details about the case Friday and said the
consulate was handling it.
	   No one was available for comment at the consulate in
Vladivostok, eight time zones and 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles)
east of Moscow.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted traffic department chief Viktor
Chaika as saying Kent caused a three-car accident in which a
23-year-old pedestrian suffered a serious spinal injury. The
traffic department in Vladivostok charged him with violating
traffic safety and causing injury to a pedestrian.
	   While Kent is subject to Russian laws, if convicted he is likely
to be expelled instead of sentenced, because of his diplomatic
immunity, Chaika said.
	   Kent arrived in Vladivostok a few months ago, Hurley said.

Juventus, Italian striker to be operated in United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus and Italian national team striker
Alessandro Del Piero will undergo surgery to repair a torn left
knee ligament at the Steadman Hawkins Clinic in the United States,
his agent announced Friday.
	   The operation will be performed early next week in Vail,
Colorado, by Dr. Richard Steadman, a surgeon who has treated major
knee injuries of several professional athletes, including Serie A
notables Nicola Berti and Maurizio Ganz.
	   The 24-year-old Del Piero was injured in a league game against
Udinese two weeks ago.
	   Team doctors said he's expected to be sidelined for the
remainder of the Italian season, which concludes in May.
	   One of the most popular Italian players and the European
Champions Cup leading scorer last season, Del Piero said in a
recent interview that he was prepared to face a long rehabilitation
``and be back to action, stronger than before, next season.''
	   Del Piero was scheduled to fly to Denver, via Chicago, Saturday
morning along with his agent Claudio Pasqualin and Juventus doctor
Riccardo Agricola.
	   Steadman and his clinic are world renown for its specialty in
sports-related injuries, having treated former German national team
captain Lothar Matthaeus, five-time overall Alpine World Cup
champion Marc Girardelli, four-time Australian Open champion Monica
Seles, two-time women's World Cup downhill champion Picabo Street
and numerous prominent American baseball, basketball and gridiron
football players.

EU, South Africa step up efforts to clinch trade deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and South Africa on
Friday stepped up efforts to clinch a trade deal they have been
negotiating for four years, in a last-ditch attempt to wrap up the
accord by the end of the year.
	   Emerging from several hours of talks with the EU's top
negotiator Philip Lowe, South Africa's Ambassador to the EU Elias
Links predicted negotiations until ``the early hours'' of Saturday
to try and conclude the deal.
	   ``The progress established is not in the least a resounding
success,'' Links told a news conference. ``To say that we were
satisfied with the offer by the Europeans would be not telling the
whole truth,'' he said.
	   Under the latest EU proposal, the EU would phase out duties on
95 percent of South African imports over 10 years. In turn, South
Africa proposes to phase out duties on 86 percent of EU imports
over 12 years.
	   The sensitive issues are agricultural goods and textiles.
	   South Africa wants the EU to improve an offer on opening its
markets to a number of South African agricultural products,
including fresh and canned fruits, and cut flowers.
	   Under the EU proposal, EU imports of these products from South
Africa would benefit from reduced-duty import quotas, not full
liberalization.
	   On a separate but crucial point, the EU wants South African
vintners to stop using the names ``sherry'' or ``port'' for any of
their wines. It argues that only Spain can produce wines called
sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto can be
labeled as port.
	   South Africa claims they have used those terms for 300 years.
	   The negotiators hope to reach an agreement this weekend or next
week. The EU's Commissioner for relations with South Africa Joao de
Deus Pinheiro wants a deal ready in time to be presented to a
meeting of EU foreign ministers scheduled Dec. 7.
	   Any deal would have to be endorsed by the EU countries and the
South African government.
	   The agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of EU-South Africa
trade, worth a total 17 billion European currency units (dlrs 19
million).

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The first part of the international
space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a
faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space
exploration and colonization.
	   A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its
initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the
unit was operating as planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or
Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous
with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched
Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project
cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central
Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday _ a year later
than planned.

Spain announces Cuban gov't intention to free two prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Foreign Minister announced Friday
that the Cuban government will release two political prisoners, a
week after he had lobbied in their favor during a four-day tour to
the Caribbean island.
	   Abel Matutes told reporters his Cuban counterpart Roberto
Robaina had informed him late Thursday that Jesus Chamber Ramirez
and Dessi Mendoza Rivero would be released for ``humanitarian
reasons.''
	   Chamber was sent to jail for 14 years in 1992, and Mendoza began
serving an eight year sentence last year. Both were convicted of
``propaganda in favor of the enemy.''
	   ``It is pleasing that the mediation of the minister has produced
the release of these two prisoners,'' a spokesman from the Foreign
Ministry said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Matutes, speaking before leaving the country to attend a
Spanish-French summit in France, said the two released prisoners
would soon travel to Spain, the state-owned news agency EFE
reported.
	   The visit of Matutes to Cuba formally sealed the end to two
years of bilateral tension ushered in by the election of
conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in 1996.
	   It also paved the way for a visit next spring of Spain's King
Juan Carlos.
	   The warm welcome given to the head of Spanish diplomacy was in
sharp contrast to the exchange of insults that followed Cuba's
rejection of Spain's proposed ambassador in November 1996.

Cattle corpses found in Jewish chapel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Jewish leader said Friday he has
suspended a contract with a kosher butcher after cattle corpses
were found in a chapel in a Jewish cemetery in northern Romania.
	   The cemetery watchman also owns a meat company that supplies
kosher beef to the 400-member Jewish community in the Transylvanian
city of Cluj.
	   The daily Evenimentul Zilei reported Friday that the
unidentified man was slaughtering cattle while on duty at the
cemetery, and the chapel served as a natural refrigerator.
	   The rear ends of six freshly slaughtered cattle were found
Wednesday on the floor of the chapel, where coffins are held
awaiting burial, said Nicolae Kallos, leader of the Jewish
community in Cluj, some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   Kallos declined to identify the cemetery watchman or provide
other details of the incident.
	   The Jewish community immediately suspended the contract with the
company and also informed health authorities, who fined the
watchman, Kallos said.

Stars donate a bit of their time to charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ever wanted to walk around on the arm of Leonardo
di Caprio, George Clooney or Cindy Crawford?
	   For those unable to realize that ambition, now there is at least
the chance to walk around with something that has been on the arm
of a heartthrob.
	   A total of 75 stars of cinema, sport, the catwalk and politics
have donated their watches for a New York auction to raise money
for charity, watch auctioneer Antiquorum announced Friday.
	   The Famous Faces Watch Auction, organized by Antiquorum and
retailer Tourneau, will take place Feb. 24.
	   All the money raised from the sale of each watch will go to a
charity nominated by the donor. Their choices range from the
Children of Chernobyl Foundation to the Palm Beach School of Arts.
	   Among the watches is a ``Desert Storm'' watch, worn by Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War.
	   He told Antiquorum he always wore two watches, one on his left
arm set to Saudi Arabian time and the watch to be auctioned on his
right arm, set to Eastern Standard Time.
	   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey donated her cherished Breguet
Marine gold self-winding watch, while U.S. comedian Bob Hope handed
over his ``red, white and blue watch'', worn on his Christmas
tours.
	   The idea for the sale came after a watch formerly owned by jazz
musician Duke Ellington made dlrs 673,500 at an auction last year,
Antiquorum marketing director Gloria Teresi said.
	   ``It was an important watch, but it made an amazing price and we
realized that the connections between celebrities and fine pieces
was very, very magnetic.''
	   Although not all the watches are valuable in themselves, some of
them will fetch six- or seven-figure sums, said Teresi.
	   A display of the watches will tour Geneva, Hong Kong, Tokyo and
cities across the United States from January.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma on Friday
ordered a probe into allegations that the country's nuclear power
plants concealed profits from using nuclear fuel supplied by Russia
under a disarmament program.
	   Ukraine has received dlrs 1.1 billion worth of Russian nuclear
fuel in exchange for surrendering nuclear warheads to Russia for
dismantling under a 1994 agreement mediated by the United States.
	   However, Ukraine's nuclear power plants have failed to pay taxes
on most of the revenues they earned from using the Russian fuel,
Kuchma told a meeting of the presidential council for combating
organized crime, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear plants, which together account for more
than 40 percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity
production.

Milosevic's party criticizes NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Slobodan Milosevic's ruling party
denounced NATO Friday for blaming both ethnic Albanian militants
and Serbian security forces for the increase in Kosovo tensions.
	   The target of the Socialist Party main board was NATO's
statement Thursday which voiced ``deep concern'' about the upsurge
in violence in Kosovo this month and condemned both sides in the
conflict for it.
	   ``Since the beginning of November there has been a sharp
increase in tension resulting from incidents created, in some cases
by Serbian security forces and in other cases by armed Kosovar
elements,'' the statement from NATO ambassadors said.
	   The Socialists, who are led by Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, said in a statement that NATO failed to differentiate
between Kosovo Albanian ``terrorists'' and ``legal'' Serbian forces
``which are protecting personal property and security of the people
who live in Kosovo.''
	   ``The cause of tensions in Kosovo is actions of the terrorist
bandits, and not legal and legitimate actions of the security
forces,'' the statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency
said.
	   Since the Oct. 12 deal U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck
with Milosevic over Kosovo, there have been an increasing number of
attacks in which Serb police or fighters from the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army have been killed.
	   The Socialists also claimed that each time members of an
international monitoring team meet Kosovo Albanian rebels, ``the
terrorist crimes multiply'' because the ``terrorists are
encouraged'' by such meetings.

U.N. weapons teams in Iraq inspect on Muslim Sabbath

	    &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams went into the field for
the third consecutive day on Friday, usually a day of rest in the
Muslim world.
	   ``We're going to be working seven days a week,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
weapons inspections. ``We want to get on with things and get as
much done in as short a period of time as possible.''
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts.
	   Neither side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons
inspectors returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been
evacuated last week amid fears of a U.S. missile strike.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will
lift the trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The inspectors, who generally have not worked on Friday, the
Muslim Sabbath, refused to talk with reporters. Ms. Cross would not
say where they were going.
	   Charles Duelfer, deputy director of UNSCOM, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday that this
was intentional.
	   ``We're coming out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying
to keep the temperature down as much as possible.''
	   In sermons at Friday prayers, mosque preachers addressed the
standoff that almost led to the American attack.
	   ``We thank God that the crisis ended,'' said Imam Bakr
al-Samerai at the Abdel-Khader al-Gailani Mosque.
	   Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at the 14th of Ramadan Mosque,
urged Arabs to ``stand by Iraq and tell America that we will not
allow this oppression and aggression to continue.''
	   The United States and Britain had threatened military action if
Iraq did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the
work of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging
full cooperation with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the
council of its compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to
an easing or lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales
and crippled the economy.
	   But the acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter
Burleigh, made it clear earlier this week that the United States
does not see the review as leading automatically to an end of the
sanctions.

Brazilian star will not start against Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo, the Brazilian superstar of
Internazionale, will not start in Sunday's crucial game against
Fiorentina, missing his seventh league match out of ten this
season.
	   His absence will prevent the Milan powerhouse from testing the
long-awaited duo of Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
	   Both players have been often sidelined with knee tendinitis in
the initial months of the Italian soccer season and have played
only samples of games together.
	   Inter officials said Friday that the Brazilian striker will not
play against the league leader in Florence as a result of his
questionable condition, following a streak of knee problems.
	   ``He's healed and must only improve his form,'' a spokesman for
Inter said.
	   ``Ronaldo may be fielded in Wednesday's Champions Cup game
against Real Madrid,'' he added.
	   The Inter-Real Madrid match at San Siro may decide the qualifier
from Group C for the quarterfinals and is expected to attract a
sell-out crowd of 80,000.
	   In Ronaldo's absence Inter's offense against Fiorentina will be
led by Baggio in a team with Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano
and France's Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Fiorentina will also miss a key player, Portuguese midfielder
Manuel Rui Costa who suffered a left thigh strain in Wednesday's
Portugal-Israel friendly.

Ex-Navy chief, peace activists enter Pakistan at border post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WAGAH, India (AP) _ Led by a former navy chief, Indian peace
activists entered into Pakistan at the largest border post between
the two hostile neighbors Friday in a small attempt to soothe
bitter relations between the two nuclear nations.
	   The group of 130 people, led by former Chief of Naval Staff
Admiral L. Ramdass, was described by Indian officials as the
largest ever delegation to drive past the heavily protected Wagah
border in the northern Punjab state, into Pakistan.
	   The delegation includes writers, filmmakers, women's right
activists, journalists and representatives of voluntary groups,
organizers said.
	   Quibbling over a range of knotty disputes including their
sharply divergent claims to the frontier mountainous region of
Kashmir, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed in peace talks this months
to let more of their people meet each other by loosening visa
restrictions.
	   The activists of the Pakistan-India People's Forum for Peace and
Democracy said they were headed for a two-day conference with their
counterparts in the Pakistani city of Peshawar Nov. 21-22.
	   ``The convention is taking place in the wake of the nuclear
tests by the governments of the two countries which has added
another dimension to their conflict and therefore inflated their
sense of insecurity,'' the forum said in a statement in New Delhi.
	   The rival tests in May by New Delhi and Islamabad heightened
fears of the world's first nuclear conflict in South Asia, a region
already rocked by three wars between India and Pakistan in the last
50 years.
	   ``Our main objective ... is to promote peace and harmony between
the two nations,'' Ramdass told The Associated Press.
	   Also Friday, India's Foreign Office said an Indian delegation
would visit Islamabad from Nov. 24 through 27 to discuss a power
sale deal, and talks would be held Dec. 1 through 4 on a bus
service between Delhi and the Pakistani city of Lahore.

Hundreds of youth protest planned anti-drug legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ There was an unmistakable sweet smell
in the air in Budapest's downtown Voeroesmarty Square Friday, where
a couple of hundred young people demonstrated against the
government's plan to tighten anti-drug legislation.
	   The amendment of the existing law would punish not only drug
dealers, but also users, and the center-right government is hopeful
the measure will help decrease drug consumption.
	   The government is proposing that anyone caught with even the
smallest amount of any drug could face time in prison. No date to
discuss the proposal has been set.
	   ``Don't criminalize us,'' a banner said.
	   According to surveys, some 20 percent of teen-agers already have
tried drugs, and more than 40 billion forints (dlrs 180 million)
was spent on drugs in the past year.
	   ``I smoke marijuana, and don't think I'm a criminal, and don't
want to go to prison,'' said 19-year-old Robi, who didn't give his
last name.
	   Organizers of the demonstration agree that drug consumption
should be reduced, but ``not by handling the question as a penal
case,'' teacher Gabor Tajta said.
	   It has long been debated in Hungary whether a partial
liberalization of laws regulating the use of soft drugs, or a total
ban on all drugs, would be desirable.
	   This year, 28 people already have died from overdosing on
heroin, twice as many as in 1997.
	   ``The extremely low number of hard-drug addicts in the
Netherlands show that it was a good decision from the authorities
to start to differentiate between hard and soft drugs,'' Martin
Hommenga, spokesman for the Dutch Health Institute, told the daily
Nepszabadsag.
	   At the end of the protest, demonstrators lighted candles in
memory of those who have died from a drug overdose.

Kurdish rebel leader freed from custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. LEADS throughout to Recast, UPDATE with Turkish premier
saying Italy `will pay. &QL;

 &UR; By ALESSANDRA RIZZO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court freed a Kurdish rebel leader on Friday
pending a ruling on his appeal for political asylum from Turkey,
drawing immediate threats of retaliation against Italy by angry
Turkish leaders.
	   Hundreds of Abdullah Ocalan's supporters danced in a central
piazza at news of his release from a military hospital in Rome,
where Ocalan had been held since his flight landed at Rome's
international airport on Nov. 12.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Turks to stay calm,
saying, ``the Turkish government will resolve this situation.''
	   ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish
state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' he said of
Italian leaders.
	   Yilmaz also appealed to NATO for support in the clash between
the two NATO partners, calling Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the
century.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition, but Italy's law prohibits
it from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the
death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insisted he wouldn't be
intimidated.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told
reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Germany announced Wednesday that it would not seek the
extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany on
charges of terrorism since 1990. The decision meant Italy no longer
needed to detain Ocalan on the German-issued arrest warrant.
	   ``It is clear that we will review our economic and trade
relations with a government, which by keeping the murderer of
30,000 people and providing him haven, is becoming an accomplice to
his crimes,'' Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin said from
Ankara.
	   ``I am amazed,'' Turkey's ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, told
the AGI news agency. ``The head of a terrorist organization, a
notorious assassin is treated by your country like a welcome
guest.''
	   In a written statement, Ocalan appealed to the thousands of
Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity to return
home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic
means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior that might reflect
badly on the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a Kurdish
spokesman in Rome, Akif Hasan.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated Turks.
Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy in
Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Friday's court decision said Ocalan is free to move around Rome
but he will have to notify authorities of any plans to leave his
residence. Ocalan's camp has said it expects a ruling on the asylum
request in about a month.

Ukraine's parliament reschedules coal mines' debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday approved
legislation that would restructure the mounting tax debts of coal
mines and write off the mines' tax fines.
	   Deputies voted 234-11 to reschedule 1.9 billion hryvna (dlrs 554
million) in mine debts and write off 126 million hryvna (dlrs 37
million) in fines for late tax payments, the independent UNIAN news
agency said.
	   Of the total debt sum, 1.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 320 million) in
tax debts to the federal budget has been rescheduled for repayment
by 2003, and 800 million hryvna (dlrs 233 million) that the mines
owe to the federal Pension Fund is to be repaid by early 2000.
	   Ukraine's largely state-owned coal industry is plagued by
inefficient management and outdated technology, and relies on
government subsidies to make up for its heavy losses.
	   Despite frequent miners' protests, the former Soviet republic's
cash-strapped government has not allocated enough funds to
modernize the mines and increase coal production.

Detective appeals for public help three months after Omagh
</HEADLINE>
atrocity &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The detective leading the
investigation into Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack
appealed Friday for public help, three months after Irish
Republican Army dissidents killed 29 people with a car bomb.
	   In an emotional press conference, Det. Chief Superintendent Eric
Anderson said his detectives were coming up dry and emphasized that
they needed Catholic opponents of the police to finger the bombers.
	   Police have arrested 42 people _ 11 in British-ruled Northern
Ireland, 31 in the Irish Republic _ on suspicion of involvement in
the Aug. 15 attack in the religiously mixed town of Omagh.
	   But none have been charged, despite the emergency passage of
tougher anti-terrorist laws in both Britain and Ireland designed to
make convictions easier.
	   Anderson said he was certain residents in three predominantly
Catholic border counties could help corroborate who the bombers
were, but were withholding assistance.
	   Many Catholics are hostile to Northern Ireland's predominantly
Protestant police. And the IRA has previously killed people accused
of ``informing'' about IRA activities to detectives in either part
of Ireland.
	   ``I promise you, you will not be badgered, you will not be
harassed, you will not be followed, and we will observe the utmost
confidentiality,'' Anderson said.
	   ``I want you to think about this on your own, perhaps even in
church on Sunday. ... It may be an appropriate time to reflect on
what you may know,'' he said.
	   At one point, his voice breaking, he explained, ``We do try not
to show emotion in these things but I'm afraid, such was the scene
of devastation, it was so harrowing, that it is difficult to get
away from that.''
	   Also Friday, David Trimble, the Protestant politician selected
to lead a new coalition government for Northern Ireland, discussed
the difficulties in achieving that goal with Ireland's prime
minister, Bertie Ahern, in Dublin.
	   Trimble shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of
his achievement in delivering majority Protestant support for
April's peace accord. But he has refused to form any government
that includes the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party unless the IRA starts
disarming.
	   The IRA called a truce in July 1997, but has insisted it will
retain its extensive network of hidden arms dumps. April's
agreement specified that the IRA should fully disarm by mid-2000.

Trade dispute does not threaten Mercosur: Foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The burgeoning trade dispute between
Brazil and Argentina does not threaten the six-nation South
American trading bloc known as Mercosur, Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Friday.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Lampreia said the
dispute is a by-product of the economic slowdown affecting both
countries, and predicted it would be solved through negotiations,
including presidential talks next month.
	   Lampreia disagreed with Brazilian press accounts describing the
dispute between South America's two largest nations as a ``tariff
war.''
	   ``It is far from being a tariff war,'' he said. ``It is nothing
dramatic. It is nothing that really threatens the permanence of the
Mercosur, which has been a successful experience.''
	   The dispute involves Argentine concerns over Brazilian steel and
paper exports, and newly imposed Brazilian sanitary controls on
imports of foodstuffs. Brazil objects to new Argentine regulations
requiring importers to make hefty cash deposits before being
allowed to import Brazilian products. And the Brazilian dairy
industry worries about alleged subsidies on Argentine dairy
exports.
	   Lampreia said the dispute involves only about 20 percent of the
dlrs 20 billion annual trade between the two countries. He pointed
out there is ``no problem'' with trade in automobiles, wheat and
oil which account for the bulk of the two countries' trade.
	   In addition to Argentina and Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are
members of Mercosur. Chile and Bolivia are associate members.
	   Lampreia said the ``recession in Brazil and slower economic
growth in Argentina'' had generated pressures in both countries to
protect domestic industries from real and perceived threats.
	   ``We have real problems,'' he said, ``but not strong enough to
threaten what we have already achieved.''
	   Lampreia noted that 10 years ago there was virtually no trade
between the two giant neighbors and both had tightly regulated
economies. Today, trade with Argentina accounts for over 10 percent
of Brazil's international commerce, and Brazil accounts for over 30
percent of Argentina's global trade, he said.
	   The presidents of all six Mercosur countries are scheduled to
meet in Rio de Janeiro Dec. 9-10, and Lampreia said Presidents
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Carlos Menem of Argentina
will take up the trade issue at that time.
	   Lampreia said Mercosur is still far from being a common market
such as the European Union, and predicted that a common currency
for Mercosur members is ``more than a decade away.''
	   He said Mercosur today covers only merchandise trade, and would
have to cover capital flows, services, free movement of labor,
educational standards and other areas before becoming a true common
market with a unified currency.
	   Stressing the need for negotiated solutions to the dispute with
Argentina, Lampreia said it would be inappropriate to apply
``automatic'' mechanisms such as ``those used in dealings between
the United States and Japan'' which he said ``sometimes produce
brusque results.''
	   Commenting on efforts by Spain and other countries to extradite
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from Britain,
Lampreia said Brazil had maintained a ``discreet attitude,''
consistent with ``supporting democracy in Chile.''

Two policemen killed, four wounded in Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic's ruling party assailing NATO for
criticizing both sides in violence &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels were accused
of ambushing a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others in the latest outbreak of
violence in Kosovo.
	   As fresh white snow blanketed this troubled province of Serbia,
making roads hazardous and disrupting aid convoys, the low level of
conflict that has persisted despite an official cease-fire
continued.
	   The official Serb Media Center said ``Albanian extremists''
struck early Friday near Prilep, on the road from Pec to Djakovica
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the center said, when guerrillas fired an anti-tank round
into their vehicle and then opened up with small arms.
	   The dead were identified as Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos
Cizmadzija, 45. Three of their colleagues were badly wounded and
transported to the hospital in Pristina. A fourth suffered light
injuries.
	   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but it typifies
the violence between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels since last month's cease-fire and the Oct. 12 agreement
between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and President
Slobodan Milisevic.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded in the same area Wednesday.
Another was reported abducted earlier this week in Podujevo,
northeast of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the two million
people living in the province. Their political leadership is
seeking independence from Serbia. Hundreds of Albanians, mostly
civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during a
government crackdown from February to October.
	   Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party on Friday denounced NATO for
blaming both sides for the increase in violence this month.
	   ``The cause of tensions in Kosovo is actions of the terrorist
bandits, and not legal and legitimate actions of the security
forces,'' the statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency
said.

German neo-Nazi convicted of defaming Jewish leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ A convicted neo-Nazi was found guilty
Friday of defaming a Jewish leader and threatening to kill a
policeman. He was sentenced to four years and nine months in
prison.
	   The Mannheim state court convicted Guenter Deckert, 58, of
defaming Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, by calling him a ``Jewish Fuehrer.''
	   Deckert, former leader of the radical rightist National Party of
Germany, was also found guilty of threatening to kill a police
officer sent to arrest him in 1995.
	   Deckert is currently serving a four-year, three-month term for
denying the Holocaust took place, defamation and incitement.

Canonica, Valera and Drummond lead European qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Emanuele Canonica of Italy, Spain's
Francis Valera and Ross Drummond of Scotland topped European Tour
qualifying school after Friday's third round in southern Spain.
	   Canonica shot a 7-under 65 with a 5-under 67 for Valera and
3-under 69 for Drummond _ all in at 10-under 206 for three rounds.
	   England's 18-year-old Justin Rose, trying to earn his European
Tour card after failing to make the cut in his first eight
professional tournaments, shot a 2-under 70 for a three-round total
of 221 _ 15 shots behind the leaders.
	   Rose finished fourth in the British Open four months ago, just
two strokes behind winner Mark O'Meara.
	   The field will be cut to the top 75 after Saturday's fourth
round. After three rounds, Rose was about a dozen spots away from
making that cut.
	   Of the 75 who qualify for the final two rounds Sunday and
Monday, only the top 35 finishers and ties will earn tour cards.

France ready to put up ``barbed wire'' to stop Wallabies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A year after its humiliating 52-10
defeat by South Africa, France's rebuilt team is on a high as it
faces its toughest test of the year Saturday against Australia.
	   Since France was pounded by South Africa, it has bounced back
with eight consecutive victories, winning a second successive Five
Nations Grand Slam in the process.
	   ``It will be an exciting match a year before the World Cup,''
said team manager Jo Maso. ``It falls at a point that allows us to
judge ourselves.''
	   The Wallabies, on a brief 13-day tour, have injury and illness
concerns.
	   Winger Jason Little (flu) and flyhalf Steve Larkham (knee) are
expected to play. However, Australia will be without seven top
players, meaning starts for fullback Chris Lathan, center Nathan
Grey and prop Patricio Noriega.
	   For France, Philippe Bernat-Salles replaces the injured Emile
Ntamack, while Thomas Castaignede, Christian Califano and Jean-Luc
Sadourny are also out.
	   In a move to improve the team's kicking, Christophe Lamaison
comes in for Franck Comba.
	   ``For us, it's the hour of truth. We have made a lot of progress
but I can't say if we can follow through,'' said coach Jean-Claude
Skrela.
	   France beat Argentina 34-14 last week, but knows it must improve
to beat the Australians, who have won the last two meetings between
the countries.
	   ``Since those two games, the Australians have made even more
progress and are playing modern and complete rugby. They are used
to playing at the highest level in their hemisphere and that gives
them great confidence in their game,'' Skrela said.
	   ``We will have to put up barbed wire to prevent the Australians
developing their moving game,'' said second row forward Fabien
Pelous.
	   Pierre Villepreux, one of Skrela's assistants, said Australia
doesn't have any weaknesses.
	   ``But if we can push them back it is possible to force errors.
But to do that we have to chain up their game.''

EU, South Africa step up efforts to clinch trade deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and South Africa on
Friday stepped up efforts to clinch a trade deal they have been
negotiating for four years, in a last-ditch attempt to wrap up the
accord by the end of the year.
	   Emerging from several hours of talks with the EU's top
negotiator Philip Lowe, South Africa's ambassador to the EU, Elias
Links, predicted negotiations until ``the early hours'' of Saturday
to try and conclude the deal.
	   ``The progress established is not in the least a resounding
success,'' Links told a news conference. ``To say that we were
satisfied with the offer by the Europeans would be not telling the
whole truth,'' he said.
	   Under the latest EU proposal, the EU would phase out duties on
95 percent of South African imports over 10 years. In turn, South
Africa proposes to phase out duties on 86 percent of EU imports
over 12 years.
	   The sensitive issues are agricultural goods and textiles.
	   South Africa wants the EU to improve an offer on opening its
markets to a number of South African agricultural products,
including fresh and canned fruits, and cut flowers.
	   Under the EU proposal, EU imports of these products from South
Africa would benefit from reduced duty import quotas, not full
liberalization.
	   On a separate but crucial point, the EU wants South African
vintners to stop using the names ``sherry'' or ``port'' for any of
their wines. It argues that only Spain can produce wines called
sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto can be
labeled as port.
	   South Africa claims they have used those terms for 300 years.
	   The negotiators hope to reach an agreement this weekend or next
week. The EU's Commissioner for relations with South Africa, Joao
de Deus Pinheiro, wants a deal ready in time to be presented to a
meeting of EU foreign ministers scheduled Dec. 7.
	   Any deal would have to be endorsed by the EU countries and the
South African government.
	   The agreement would cover roughly 90 percent of EU-South Africa
trade, worth a total 17 million European currency units (dlrs 19
million).

Far-right leader to appeal conviction in move to skirt ban

<TEXT>
	   SAINT CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
said Friday he will appeal his assault conviction, a maneuver that
should allow him to skirt a one-year political ban and run in
European parliamentary elections next year.
	   ``I will be at the head of the list in European elections'' in
June 1999, a defiant Le Pen told a news conference. ``And even the
(French) presidential elections of 2002.''
	   Le Pen, the flamboyant leader of the anti-immigrant National
Front, lambasted an appeals court decision Tuesday upholding his
April assault conviction for attacking a Socialist politician
during a campaign rally.
	   He called the decision ``laughable,'' ``derisory'' and ``without
any foundation.''
	   Although it upheld the conviction, the appeals court reduced the
punishment from a two-year ban to a one-year ban on voting, running
for office or holding office.
	   Now, the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court, will
consider the decision _ a process that usually takes at least a
year. Until then, the decision is suspended.
	   ``This makes me completely eligible'' for the 1999 European
elections, Le Pen said.
	   However, the move could backfire on him.
	   The Cour de Cassation could prolong the process until less than
a year before presidential elections in 2002, then uphold the ban,
rendering him ineligible for that race. Or, it could decide to
reimpose the original two-year ban, also rendering him ineligible.
	   Le Pen's legal problems had put him on a collision course with
his party's No. 2 man, Bruno Megret, who opposed Le Pen's plan to
put his wife, Jany, in his place at the top of the list for
European elections if he couldn't run.
	   Megret has said repeatedly that he, not the politically
inexperienced Mrs. Le Pen, should be the top candidate.
	   Le Pen said Friday that he still might place his wife somewhere
on the list.
	   Megret, for his part, was circumspect. During a visit to the
Lorraine region Friday he called Le Pen's decision to appeal ``a
good thing'' and added: ``My ambition in life is not to be the head
of the list.''

Retired brigadier arrested for allegedly forging residence permits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-FEA-Greece-Prostitution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A retired police brigadier general was
arrested for allegedly issuing fake residence permits to illegal
immigrants, it was announced Friday.
	   It was the latest arrest in a police crackdown against
widespread prostitution and protection rackets thought to involve
members of the security forces.
	   According to a police announcement, retired Brig. Gen. Spyridon
Borotis, 59, was forging documents needed by illegal immigrants to
receive temporary residents permits under a recent government
amnesty for unregistered aliens.
	   His arrest late Thursday came just hours after a policeman and
retired officer were taken into custody for allegedly providing
shelter and protection for two Ukrainian prostitutes.
	   Earlier this month a public prosecutor issued charges against 16
people, including senior police officers. They were accused of
involvement in nightclub protection rackets and selling residence
permits to illegal aliens, including prostitutes and wanted foreign
criminals.

Con artist cons Portuguese pensioner out of savings

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A con artist posing as a banker
smooth-talked a pensioner out his savings by playing on the elderly
man's ignorance about the European single currency, police said
Friday.
	   The swindler, wearing a dark suit and driving a sports car,
talked the 75-year-old pensioner into handing over the cash he
stashed at home _ escudos 1 million (about dlrs 5,800) _ in
exchange for new euros, a police spokesman said.
	   The sleek, mustachioed conman convinced the unamed pensioner
that escudos were going out of circulation, as the country prepares
to adopt the European single currency, spokesman Paulo Soares said
by phone.
	   The scam occurred Nov. 18 in the remote village of Courelas de
Toura, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Lisbon, Soares said.
	   Portugal has a program aimed at publicize such euro ripoffs, in
order to alert elderly residents in isolated regions who are
considered particularly vulnerable, Soares said.
	   The euro is due to be launched on Jan. 1, although euro notes
and coins will only come into circulation three years later at the
same time as national currencies are phased out.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The second round of Senate
elections began Friday, with one-third of 81 seats in the upper
house of parliament at stake and the opposition poised to winner.
	   The Senate vote is largely considered a test of support for
Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government, which took over from
former Premier Vaclav Klaus after elections in June. The stagnant
economy and poor law enforcement are among the top issues.
	   But the upper chamber is by far the less important of the two
legislative bodies in the Czech Republic, and even if Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party makes a strong showing in this election, it will
have little impact on the country's political landscape.
	   In a first round of voting for a third of the Senate's 81 seats,
last Friday and Saturday, the Civic Democratic Party advanced 22
out of 27 candidates to the second round, the most of any party
competing.
	   The governing Social Democrats are in runner-up position with 15
candidates in the second round, a showing they called
dissapointing.
	   A coalition of four opposition center-right parties led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union finished third with 14
candidates, while the Communists made it in three districts.
	   Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to win the election
outright last Friday and Saturday or face a run-off between the two
top finishers.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent in the
first-round vote, meaning runoff elections were necessary in all 27
districts. Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than in the
first Senate elections in 1996.
	   Unofficial results were expected late Saturday.
	   The upper house was created in 1996 as a safety mechanism to
ensure the country could function in case of a constitutional
crisis. It can pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution,
should the 200-seat lower chamber be dissolved.
	   Since its formation, the Senate has been criticized by all
members of the political spectrum for not being effective enough.
Several parties, including the Communists and the ultra-nationalist
Republican, have even called for its abolition.
	   Before the vote, the conservative Civic Democratic Party
controlled 29 seats in the Senate. Twelve of those seats are up for
grabs in the current vote.
	   There were 26 Social Democrat Senators, six of whom were up for
re-election.
	   The rest of the seats were held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, The Freedom Union and the
Communists.

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Leaning out of jeep windows,
Palestinian policemen triumphantly hoisted assault rifles into the
air Friday and fired quick volleys to celebrate their takeover of
this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to town greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and
villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat full or partial
control over an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank and took
him one step closer to his final goal _ statehood.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles (2,380 square kilometers).
	   However, support for the land-for-security agreement is slipping
in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government, and
Israeli media said Friday the prime minister might call early
elections in the spring, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   In the month since the signing of the accord in Washington,
Israel and the Palestinians have incessantly argued about each
others' obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind
schedule because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.
	   Last-minute glitches also threatened to hold up the pullback
itself. Without informing the Palestinians, Israel made changes in
the redeployment map Thursday night, such as keeping several roads,
including the one to Qabatieh, under full Israeli control for the
time being, rather than handing them to the Palestinians.
	   When Palestinians raised questions, Israeli soldiers stopped
busy moving 130 brown-and-yellow road markers to delineate the new
borders
	   Maps in hand, Israel's army commander in the West Bank, Maj.
Gen. Moshe Yaalon, flew by helicopter to Arafat's headquarters. The
two looked at the maps, Arafat gave his okay and the crisis was
over.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, usually a tough critic of
the Israeli government, said that the arguments of recent weeks may
have brought the two sides closer.
	   But more needed to be done, he said. ``We have to concentrate
... and have to exert maximum efforts to build the trust required
between us.''
	   On Friday afternoon, Palestinian police took up their new
positions in 36 towns and villages near Jenin and the West Bank
town of Nablus.
	   In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 residents, two teen-agers jumped
onto the roof of a jeep in a convoy and hoisted a large Palestinian
flag.
	   Officers in blue camouflage uniforms hanging out of the windows
raised their Kalashnikov assault rifles and fired quick volleys
into the air. Half a dozen Qabatieh residents joined in the chorus,
firing their own machine guns, M-16 assault rifles and pistols.
	   In Qabatieh, a stronghold of resistance to Israeli occupation
during the Palestinian uprising, hundreds of residents cheered as
vigilantes strung up the body of a suspected collaborator with
Israel on an electricity pole in 1988.
	   On that pole, residents on Friday draped a banner reading
``Today Qabatieh, tomorrow Jerusalem,'' a reference to Palestinian
hopes to establish their capital in the holy city.
	   At the ``Abu Halala Cafe'' on main street, patrons were divided
over the impact of new rulers.
	   Teissir Mansour, a 50-year-old merchant sitting on a chair on
the sidewalk, puffing on a cigarette, said it was time police end
rampant lawlessness.
	   His neighbor in the cafe, 55-year-old Khalil Abu Rub, was upset
he would still have to pass an Israeli checkpoint on his way to
Jenin. ``I think nothing will change.''
	   The withdrawal isolated several Jewish settlements and Israeli
troops began reinforcing them with cement trenches and shooting
positions.
	   In Ganim, a community of 51 families, many were thinking about
leaving. Ilan Amar, 34, who had just moved to Ganim with his wife
Rikki and three children three months ago, said he felt cheated.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Amar, who sells car paint in the Israeli
port city of Haifa.
	   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including
150 criminals. Arafat had demanded freedom for Palestinians who
fought Israeli occupation.
	   In a third step, Israel and the Palestinians signed the protocol
for operating Yasser Arafat International Airport in the Gaza
Strip. The airport, a symbol of fledgling Palestinian independence,
will open Tuesday.

Deadly explosion hits Swaziland deputy prime minister's office

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ An explosion possibly caused by a bomb
demolished part of a building containing the deputy prime
minister's office Friday, killing at least one person and wounding
six others, police said.
	   It was not immediately clear if Deputy Prime Minister Arthur
Khoza was in the area. Police spokeswoman Leckina Magagula said
seven people were taken to a hospital and that one of them _ a
security guard _ died there.
	   The explosion rocked the capital Mbabane just before 5 p.m.
(1500 GMT), destroying a rear section of the two-story building and
shattering glass in nearby buildings.
	   It was the second bomb attack in Swaziland, a country of 1
million people sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, in
less than a month and came amid recent protests against a ban on
political parties.
	   Hundreds of onlookers gathered as police and firemen searched
the rubble for victims and survivors. The blast also destroyed a
security guard hut.
	   Magagula said police suspected the explosion was caused by a
bomb but had no immediate confirmation.
	   Some of the damaged offices housed government administration
offices.
	   On Oct. 28, an explosion damaged a bridge two hours after King
Mswati III crossed it, injuring one person.
	   In that case, police said they were investigating a possible
connection to political activists who have been protesting the ban
on political parties.
	   Police on Wednesday questioned Sithole, secretary general of the
Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions and one of the monarchy's
fiercest critics, for six hours in connection with the attack.
Sithole's organization had called for a boycott of parliamentary
elections in October to protest the ban on political parties.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man accused of orchestrating the
U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man
Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the
permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.
	   The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on
Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.
	   ``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,''
Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The
Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in
the Afghan capital, Kabul. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a
man without sin. ... He is a free man.''
	   The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban
information minister said in a statement Friday.
	   The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions
that bin Laden is a rich man, saying the Saudi dissident has had
his foreign assets frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated.
	   In a statement Friday, the U.S. State Department said there is
abundant evidence linking bin Laden to terrorism. The statement
also urged the Taliban to expel bin Laden, ``who has been formally
charged in the cold- blooded murder'' in the embassy bombings.

EU president spurs return project and democratic reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Croatian premier's remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia must improve refugee returns and
democratically reform its electoral law and state-run media before
it can be considered to join the European Union, the acting EU
council president said Monday.
	   Following a meeting with his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic,
Austrian Foreign Minister, Wolfgang Schuessel said reform is a
``step by step process,'' and Croatia is showing progress.
	   ``But there are many more steps ahead,'' warned Schuessel, who
is also acting EU council president, while Austria holds the
rotating EU presidency.
	   All relevant parties in Croatia must be able to have access to
radio and TV, he said, referring to the tight grip that Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman holds on state-run media.
	   ``When Croatia begins moving in this direction, then moving
towards the EU is a possibility,'' the Austrian Press Agency quoted
him saying.
	   Another major issue for Croatia's acceptance into Europe is
refugee return. More that 250,000 Serbs and Croats remain exiled
from their homes since the 1991-95 Serbo-Croat war. Under intense
international pressure, the government introduced a return program
earlier this year, which has enabled almost 50,000 Serbs to return.
	   Schuessel also said Croatian authorities need to be more
``concrete and energetic in facilitating and implementing the
return program.''
	   Croatia ``is open for constructive cooperation and
suggestions,'' Premier Zlatko Matesa said after meeting Schuessel
later Friday.
	   But he emphasized that the requirements coming from Western
governments ``must not go beyond Croatian national interests and
have to be the same as for other European nations.''
	   Government officials often imply that the EU is demanding more
from Croatia than from other candidate countries and its members.
Matesa said they were ``afraid that the double standards still
exist.''
	   The Austrian foreign minister arrived in Zagreb Friday to
partake in the two-day forum of the Central European Initiative, a
16-member organization aimed at keeping Europe's richer nations
from closing the door on countries climbing out of communism.
	   The CEI countries include Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, Croatia,
Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia. Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and
Montenegro, is not a member.
	   Austria and Italy are the only active EU members in the
association, but they have lobbied hard in recent years to
integrate their neighbors to the south and east into Western
structures.
	   Schuessel is to meet Tudjman later in the day.

OSCE accuses distribution firm of stifling free media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A few days after an independent weekly
announced it would shut down because of a huge unpaid debt from its
main distributor, Europe's largest security agency accused the
distributor Friday of trying to stifle media freedom.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in
a statement that ``direct censorship is not the only way of
muzzling free and independent media. It can also be stifled through
economic and legal means.''
	   It pointed at Tisak, the nearly monopolistic media distribution
company, accusing it of repeatedly withholding sales revenue it
owes certain newspapers.
	   This week, Nacional, a weekly that is highly critical of the
government, announced it would cease publication because Tisak has
not paid dlrs 533,000 it owes the paper.
	   Without the money, Nacional cannot pay the dlrs 116,000 it owes
the printing company Hrvatska Tiskara.
	   The paper accused President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party of
working to destroy it.
	   The OSCE, which oversees human rights and media freedom, said,
``the selective withholding of such revenue amounts to a form of
pressure which is widely, and inevitably, perceived as having a
political motivation.''
	   Tisak is Croatia's biggest distribution company and owns the
vast majority of kiosks throughout the country.
	   Tisak owner Miroslav Kutle is a member of Tudjman's party. Kutle
rose virtually overnight from a small restaurant owner to a media
mogul and major shareholder in banks, hotels and factories.
	   Tudjman's government controls most of Croatia's media, including
the only nationwide television station. A few independent media
have faced repeated technical or bureaucratic obstacles. Up to 500
reporters have been sued for their articles, which many see as an
attempt by the authoritarian government to silence its critics.
	   The OSCE said some newspapers ``were being financially drained''
by huge fines after losing defamation lawsuits brought by
government officials.
	   ``Given the number and size of these fines, as well as the
identity of many of the plaintiffs, there is again a widespread
perception that political motives are involved,'' the OSCE said.
	   The independent weekly Feral Tribune reported earlier this month
that government officials and their associates have filed 50
lawsuits against the paper, seeking a total of dlrs 2.5 million in
punitive damages.
	   Croatia aspires to become a European Union member, but has been
criticized for its treatment of minorities, media and opposition
parties.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices soared on the London Stock Exchange
Friday, gaining more than 100 points for the second consecutive
day.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed up 111.3 points, or 2.0 percent, at 5,717.5 points and the
provisional volume for the whole market was 836.2 million shares.
	   Although the leading index has gained nearly 250 points in two
days, dealers said the market isn't getting carried away. Volume
was still on the low side, and Wall Street has been providing much
of the market's momentum, one dealer said.
	   Volume was 836.2 million shares compared with 850.0 million on
Thursday.

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Leaning out of jeep windows,
Palestinian policemen triumphantly hoisted assault rifles into the
air Friday and fired quick volleys to celebrate their takeover of
this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to town greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and
villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat control over an
additional 2 percent of the West Bank and upgraded his authority in
7 percent of the land. Most importantly, it took him one step
closer to his final goal _ statehood.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels were accused
of ambushing a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others in the latest outbreak of
violence in Kosovo.
	   As fresh white snow blanketed this troubled province of Serbia,
making roads hazardous and disrupting aid convoys, the low level of
conflict that has persisted despite an official cease-fire
continued.
	   The official Serb Media Center said ``Albanian extremists''
struck early Friday near Prilep, on the road from Pec to Djakovica
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the provincial capital,
Pristina.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the center said, when guerrillas fired an antitank round
into their vehicle and then opened up with small arms.
	   The dead were identified as Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos
Cizmadzija, 45. Three of their colleagues were badly wounded and
transported to the hospital in Pristina. A fourth suffered light
injuries.
	   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but it typifies
the violence between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels since last month's cease-fire and the Oct. 12 agreement
between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded in the same area Wednesday.
Another was reported abducted earlier this week in Podujevo,
northeast of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the two million
people living in the province. Their political leadership is
seeking independence from Serbia. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians,
mostly civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced
during a government crackdown from February to October.
	   Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party on Friday denounced NATO for
blaming both sides for the increase in violence this month.
	   ``The cause of tensions in Kosovo is actions of the terrorist
bandits, and not legal and legitimate actions of the security
forces,'' the statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency
said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was forced to divert three aid convoys
Friday carrying food, blankets and mattresses. The supplies
originally were destined for distribution points west of Pristina,
but were sent instead to Podujevo after a snowfall of between 20
and 50 centimeters (8 and 20 inches), said spokesman Fernando del
Mundo.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says no refugees now
live in the open. Many found shelter with friends and relatives or
have managed to rebuild a warm room in their damaged houses. But
they still need supplies to survive the winter, Del Mundo said.
	   ``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain
areas,'' he said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are
sharing food with displaced people. ... Until the next harvest,
they will need support.''
	   The UNHCR says about 60,000 refugees have returned to their
homes over the last few weeks. But High Commissioner Sadako Ogata
said the fragile peace ``is marred by virtually daily incidents.''
	   Mrs. Ogata, speaking in Geneva, urged countries hosting Kosovo
refugees to be patient and for the Yugoslav authorities and ethnic
Albanians to refrain from violence.
	   The UNHCR estimates that 68,000 Yugoslav citizens, mostly Kosovo
Albanians, have applied for asylum in Western Europe this year.
Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have the largest numbers.
	   Meanwhile, the top U.S. mediator for Kosovo dismissed the idea
that Serbian President Milan Milutinovic had rejected a U.S. draft
plan that reportedly would give ethnic Albanians virtual self-rule.
	   ``We don't consider the Serbs have rejected our agreement and
expect to be talking to them in the next few days,'' mediator
Christopher Hill said in Lisbon, Portugal.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic on Wednesday dismissed the
U.S. proposal for giving too much power to independence-minded
ethnic Albanians.

Thailand's Tamarine falls to Li in quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) _ China's Li Fang eliminated Thailand's
best hope Friday, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 in
the quarterfinals of the Volvo Women's Open.
	   The two women will carry their respective country's aspirations
in the upcoming Asian Games in Bangkok in December.
	   Tamarine, seeded fourth, wasted more than her share of break
points in the first set. She and Li _ seeded fifth _ exchanged a
couple of service games before both started to hit their pace,
pushing the opening set into a tiebreaker.
	   Tamarine, ranked No. 38 on the WTA Tour, fumbled many scoring
opportunities close to the net, and lost the tiebreaker when she
sent a two-handed backhand wide.
	   Li, ranked 45th, controlled the second set to wrap up the match
in 2 hours, 5 minutes.
	   ``I was so tired as she moved me around the court. But I just
went for every ball. I never give in easily,'' the 25-year-old Li
said.
	   She will next meet Silvija Talaja of Croatia, who upset
seventh-seeded Olga Barabanschikova 6-4, 6-1 Friday.
	   ``It is a good warm-up for the Asian Games. Now I think I am in
with a more than fair chance of winning the gold,'' said Li, who
lost in the first round on her previous three appearances in
Pattaya.
	   Li's victory improved her head-to-head record with Tamarine to
3-1.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court on Friday extended by four
days the detention of an Israeli man suspected of planning to
attack Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Outside the magistrate's court in the northern town of Acre,
several ultra-Orthodox Jews chanted and read psalms to show support
for the suspect, Shabtai Bloch, 48, a member of the ultra-Orthodox
Chabad group.
	   Bloch allegedly plotted to attack Netanyahu during the prime
minister's Thursday visit to the northern town of Safed. Police
gave no further details. Bloch's lawyer told Israel radio that his
client opposes violence.
	   Chabad members demonstrated against Netanyahu in Safed during
the visit, angry over last month's Israel-Palestinian agreement
under which Israel is to hand over territory in the West Bank.
Israel radio said Bloch organized the protest.
	   At Chabad headquarters in New York, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a
spokesman for the movement, said ``Violence, even the threat of
violence, is anathema'' to Chabad.
	   Most Chabad members supported Netanyahu in Israel's 1996
election, but now feel that Netanyahu has betrayed them by agreeing
to hand over West Bank land to Palestinian control.

Italian court frees Kurdish rebel leader, enraging Turkey

Albright urging extradition, trial for Ocalan. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court freed a Kurdish rebel chief Friday
pending a ruling on his appeal for political asylum from Turkey,
drawing immediate threats of retaliation against Italy by Turkish
leaders.
	   Hundreds of Abdullah Ocalan's supporters danced in a central
piazza at news of his release from a military hospital in Rome,
where Ocalan had been held since his flight landed at Rome's
international airport on Nov. 12.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told his people to stay
calm, saying, ``The Turkish government will resolve this
situation.''
	   ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish
state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' he said of
Italian leaders, without specifying what that price might be.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Turkey has demanded his extradition but Italy's law prohibits it
from extraditing someone to a country where he may face the death
penalty, as is the case with Ocalan.
	   Yilmaz appealed to NATO for support in the clash between the two
NATO partners, describing as Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the
century.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright backed Turkey's stand
on Ocalan, telling a Washington news conference, ``It is very
important that he be brought to justice'' _ if not in Turkey, then
in Italy or Germany.
	   Germany said Wednesday that it would not seek the extradition of
the rebel chief, who also has been wanted there on charges of
terrorism since 1990. The decision meant Italy no longer needed to
detain Ocalan on the German-issued arrest warrant.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema insisted he wouldn't be
intimidated by Turkey's threats.
	   ``We will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told
reporters during a visit to Florence.
	   Ocalan appealed to the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to
Rome in a show of solidarity to return home and sustain the Kurdish
cause through legal and democratic means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior that might reflect
badly on the Kurdish people,'' Ocalan said in a statement read by a
spokesman in Rome.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated Turks.
Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy in
Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods.
	   ``It is clear that we will review our economic and trade
relations with a government, which by keeping the murderer of
30,000 people and providing him haven, is becoming an accomplice to
his crimes,'' Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin said from
Ankara.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
	   Friday's court decision said Ocalan is free to move around Rome
but he will have to notify authorities of any plans to leave his
residence. Ocalan's camp has said it expects a ruling on the asylum
request in about a month.

Brazilian will not start against Fiorentina

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian striker Ronaldo will not start in
Internazionale's crucial game against Fiorentina on Sunday, missing
his seventh of 10 Italian league matches this season.
	   His absence will prevent the Milan powerhouse from testing the
long-awaited ``Ro-Ro'' combination of Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
	   Both players frequently have been sidelined with tendinitis in
their knees this season and have played only together
intermittently.
	   Inter officials said Friday that Ronaldo striker will not play
in Florence due to questionable conditioning, which has been caused
by inactivity due to a series of knee problems.
	   ``He's healed and must only improve his form,'' an Inter
spokesman said. ``Ronaldo may be fielded in Wednesday's Champions
Cup game against Real Madrid.''
	   The Inter-Real Madrid match at San Siro may decide who advances
from Group C to the quarterfinals and is expected to attract a
sell-out crowd of 80,000.
	   In Ronaldo's absence, Inter's offense against Fiorentina will be
led by Baggio in a team with Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano
and France's Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Fiorentina also will miss Portuguese midfielder Manuel Rui
Costa, who suffered a left thigh strain in Wednesday's
Portugal-Israel friendly.

	   ROME (AP) _ Max Biaggi said Friday he was negotiating with
Yamaha to ride with the Japanese manufacturer in next year's World
Motorcycle Championship.
	   ``I hope to reach an agreement soon,'' the Italian told the
Italian television channel Rai-2.
	   Biaggi, a former world 250 cc champion, made his debut in the
500 cc class this year with Honda, finishing second to Australian
Michael Doohan in the championship standings.

German leader admits weak start for new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder acknowledged
Friday that he had made mistakes by pushing his government's
center-left program too hastily since taking office last month.
	   ``We want our program and we will push it through,'' he said in
a ARD television interview. ``But it doesn't have to happen in the
first three months.''
	   ``I would self-critically accept that maybe we wanted too much
too soon,'' he said. ``This allowed the occasional mistake in
workmanship to slip in.''
	   Schroeder said recent squabbling inside his Social Democrats
over taxes on low-wage jobs may not be the last time he has to
intervene to assert his authority over the party chaired by his
rival, Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine.
	   The Social Democrats won Sept. 27 elections, ending 16 years of
conservative rule by Helmut Kohl. The new government, which also
includes the environmentalist Greens party, has ambitious plans for
fighting unemployment, bolstering social programs and overhauling
taxes. Also planned are steps to scrap nuclear power.

Two policemen killed, four wounded in Kosovo violence

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels were accused
of ambushing a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others in the latest violence in
Kosovo.
	   As fresh white snow blanketed this troubled province of Serbia,
making roads hazardous and disrupting aid convoys, the low level of
conflict that has persisted despite an official cease-fire
continued.
	   The official Serb Media Center said ``Albanian extremists''
struck early Friday near Prilep, on the road from Pec to Djakovica
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the center said, when guerrillas fired an anti-tank round
into their vehicle and then opened up with small arms.
	   The dead were identified as Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos
Cizmadzija, 45. Three of their colleagues were badly wounded and
transported to the hospital in Pristina. A fourth suffered light
injuries.
	   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but it typifies
the violence between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels since last month's cease-fire and the Oct. 12 agreement
between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded in the same area Wednesday.
Another was reported abducted earlier this week in Podujevo,
northeast of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the two million
people living in the province. Their political leadership is
seeking independence from Serbia. Hundreds of Albanians, mostly
civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during a
government crackdown from February to October.
	   Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party on Friday denounced NATO for
blaming both sides for the increase in violence this month.
	   ``The cause of tensions in Kosovo is actions of the terrorist
bandits, and not legal and legitimate actions of the security
forces,'' the statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency
said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was forced to divert three aid convoys
Friday carrying food, blankets and mattresses. The supplies
originally were destined for distribution points west of Pristina,
but were sent instead to Podujevo after a snowfall of between 20
and 50 centimeters (8 and 20 inches), said spokesman Fernando del
Mundo.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says no
refugees now live in the open. Many are sheltering in the homes of
friends and relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in
their damaged houses. But they still need supplies to survive the
winter, Del Mundo said.
	   ``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain
areas,'' he said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are
sharing food with displaced people. ... Until the next harvest,
they will need support.''
	   The UNHCR says about 60,000 refugees have returned to their
homes over the last few weeks. But High Commissioner Sadako Ogata
said the fragile peace ``is marred by virtually daily incidents.''
	   As many as 2,000 unarmed civilian ``verifiers'' are supposed to
be dispatched to Kosovo in the coming weeks to insure that the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement is adhered to. Mrs. Ogata told
reporters her organization was ``insisting'' that they be deployed
quickly.
	   Speaking in Geneva, she called on countries hosting Kosovo
refugees to be patient and for the Yugoslav authorities and ethnic
Albanians to refrain from violence.
	   The UNHCR estimates that 68,000 Yugoslav citizens, mostly Kosovo
Albanians, have applied for asylum in Western Europe this year.
Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have the largest numbers.
	   In Washington, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the
1,500-member rescue force designed to protect the verifiers would
consist entirely of Europeans, under a French general's command.
	   Meanwhile, the top U.S. envoy for Kosovo dismissed the idea that
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic had rejected a U.S. draft plan
that reportedly would give ethnic Albanians virtual self-rule.
	   ``We don't consider the Serbs have rejected our agreement and
expect to be talking to them in the next few days,'' envoy
Christopher Hill said in Lisbon, Portugal.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic on Wednesday dismissed the
U.S. proposal for giving too much power to independence-minded
ethnic Albanians.

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy who had been detained
by security officials in Indian-held Kashmir died Friday and his
body showed signs of a severe beating, a doctor said.
	   The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Shafat
Ahmad Rather was brought unconscious and badly bruised to Srinagar
Hospital by police Thursday. Relatives of the boy said had been
detained for questioning last week by military troops.
	   A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the boy had been held but said he was handed over to
police Thursday in ``good condition.'' He would not comment
further.
	   The death sparked a peaceful protest by about 1,000 people in
Srinagar Friday.
	   Troops sent to Kashmir to quell a militant Muslim uprising are
often accused of torturing detainees and of other human rights
abuses.
	   Also Friday, at least nine people suffered minor injuries when
an unidentified attacker lobbed a grenade at the jeep of the
paramilitary Border Security Force outside the city's historic Jama
Masjid mosque. The grenade missed the vehicle and exploded on the
road, wounding passersby, Inspector-General of Police P.S. Gill
said.
	   Nearly 100,000 people attended the Friday prayers at the mosque,
held during a week of worshipping in which a revered relic _ a
strand of hair believed to have belonged to Prophet Mohammad _ is
exhibited to the devout.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - American Nicole Bobek, who has had a an-and-down
skating career lately, took the lead in the women's short program
at the Lalique Trophy competition Friday, one of the skating Grand
Prix series.
	   Bobek skated a clean program to Flamenco music from the movie
`Zorro' to put her in first ahead of Ukraine's Elena Liashenko,
winner of Skate Canada, and European champion Maria Butyrskaya, who
beat Bobek at Skate America.
	   Bobek landed a superb triple lutz-double toe loop and a triple
toe loop. She received marks from 5.3 to a high of 5.8 and earned a
4-3 decision on judges over Liashenko, who also skated clean.
	   Bobek was the U.S. champion in 1995 but has had an checkered
career since. After her coach Carlo Fassi died at the 1997 world
championships, Bobek fell apart in the long program at Lausanne,
Switzerland.
	   She rebounded at the 1998 U.S. championships where she placed
third to Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski with talk of a U.S. sweep
at the Olympics.
	   However at Nagano she barely stood up in her short program and
long program and finished 17th.
	   ``I've had plenty of downs followed by ups,'' said Bobek. ``And
ups followed by downs''
	   ``Now it's time to tie the ups together,'' she her new coach
Richard Callahan, who trained Lipinski last year.
	   In the pairs, the French couple of Sarah Abitbol and Stephane
Bernadis took the short program edging Russia's former world
champions Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov.
	   All the top couples tried triple toe loop jumps and throw triple
moves with only slight mistakes separating them, such as Bushkov
putting a hand down to steady himself after a jump.
	   The long programs of all the events will be held on Saturday.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

	   FLESQUIERES, France (AP) _ Archeologists unearthing a World War
I British tank discovered under a vegetable patch scraped and
shoveled for a second day Friday, pulling canned goods, wine
bottles and other vestiges of the Great War from its rusty carcass.
	   Dozens of young and old crowded around the site on the edge of
this northern French town to witness the slow, meticulous removal
of red earth from the war machine abandoned by the British in 1917,
then turned into a bunker by the Germans.
	   By Friday, it was fully exposed, though still sitting in a hole.
	   Rusty and twisted from its 81 years underground, the Mark IV
tank is a chilling reminder of the Battle of Cambrai, near this
farm town by the Belgian border, one of the bloodiest conflicts of
World War I.
	   British troops abandoned the tank on Nov. 20, 1917. German
soldiers then buried it for use as a bunker.
	   As the dig progressed, details of the lives of soldiers at war
emerged: a corroded can of corn beef, a bullet-ridden water
canteen, a whisky flask and wine bottles.
	   Archeologists stacked flat British helmets atop rounded German
ones.
	   On Thursday, they uncovered British and German silverware, lamps
and helmets, as well as unexploded grenades.
	   ``World War I can often feel distant to us,'' said Alan Venthon,
48, an accountant, who made the trip here from his home in Redhill,
Britain, to witness the dig.
	   ``But to find a mechanical device like this makes the war much
easier to imagine late in the 20th century.''
	   French bagpipers in kilts played at a ceremony Friday attended
by officials and about 100 civilians.
	   Brig. Andrew Gadsby, the British Embassy's military attache in
Paris, laid a large poppy wreath on the tank to commemorate the
British war dead. A British cemetery is perched on a hill nearby.
	   ``I've seen World War I tanks in museums before,'' Gadsby said.
``But it's extraordinary to see one unearthed from the
battlefield.''

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A stick of dynamite thrown from the street
exploded on a terrace inside the U.S. Embassy in Quito, causing
minor damage, police said Friday.
	   No injuries were reported, but the explosion Thursday night
damaged floor tiles on the terrace and broke a water pipe, said
Gen. Jorge Villarroel, chief of Ecuador's National Police.
	   The dynamite was apparently thrown into the diplomatic compound
from a small street behind the embassy, an embassy official who
requested anonymity told The Associated Press.
	   The embassy is located in a residential zone with five-star
hotels nearby.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack and police have
not determined the motive, Villarroel said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mariko Iwanami shivered as she strained to see past
the crowd and barricade of police officers.
	   She and a friend had spent most of their lunch hour on this
bright, chilly Friday waiting with about 1,000 other Tokyoites in
hopes of catching a glimpse of visiting President Bill Clinton.
	   ``I saw him on TV last night,'' explained the 23-year-old office
worker. ``But I would rather have seen Hillary. She probably didn't
want to come.''
	   Even without sharply worded trade disputes to roil emotions,
many in Japan remained as transfixed as ever with visiting U.S.
leader _ and only partly because of his stature in world affairs.
	   Like many Americans, the Japanese public has had a morbid
fascination with the details of Clinton's relationship with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Newspapers rushed translations of prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation. The release earlier this week of Lewinsky's taped
phone conversations with Linda Tripp was a lead item on Tokyo news
broadcasts.
	   Adultery was the biggest topic of conversation among those who
turned out Friday in Tokyo's posh Ginza district, where Clinton
shared a private lunch of tempura with his host, Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
	   ``It's so American to get upset about an extra-martial affair,''
said Kenichi Shinzaki, a 40-year-old salesman who said he was
happily married.
	   ``I'm sure all Japanese politicians have mistresses,'' he said.
	   But not all Japanese are as sympathetic. In a televised town
meeting Thursday night, one housewife from Osaka told Clinton she'd
never forgive her husband if he had an affair.
	   The Japanese media have been more discreet during Clinton's
whirlwind two-day visit, focusing on other issues, such as the
economy.

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Congolese rebels, continuously snubbed
at peace talks by President Laurent Kabila, said Friday that unless
he comes to the negotiating table there will be no alternative to
his overthrow.
	   Rebel leader Bizima Karaha said the insurgents have enough
weapons to keep fighting until Kabila's government is toppled and
were ready to move on Kabila's traditional stronghold, the
southeastern Congolese town of Lubumbashi, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, made his comments to
reporters in Gabarone, where he and other rebel leaders were
meeting with officials from the few countries in the region not
involved in the three-month-long Congo war.
	   The rebels are demanding direct talks with Kabila, who did not
send representatives to the meeting.
	   At the meeting, the rebels supported a draft ceasefire
agreement, SAPA reported, citing unnamed sources at the talks. No
details were immediately available.
	   However, unless the rebels and Kabila's government come to terms
themselves, the agreement is unlikely to carry much weight. Kabila
has ruled out talks with the rebels.

	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Estonia's government said on Friday that
it opposes a Swedish proposal to recover bodies trapped inside the
wreck of the ferry Estonia.
	   The Estonia sank en route from Tallinn to Stockholm, Sweden, in
1994, killing 852 people. Only 95 of the bodies have been recovered
and many victims' relatives say they cannot complete their mourning
unless the bodies brought up.
	   A panel appointed by the Swedish government recommended last
week that an effort be made to bring up as many bodies as possible.
	   Estonian government spokesman Daniel Vaarik said the decision to
oppose the proposal took into account overwhelming opposition to
the idea in Estonia.
	   ``Our decision is based on the opinions of the relatives of
victims, of religious leaders and opinion makers here,'' he said.
``There was very strong opposition everywhere.''
	   In an official statement, the Estonian government said it wanted
a 1995 agreement between Sweden, Finland and Estonia declaring the
shipwreck a sanctuary to remain in effect.
	   ``This agreement and other legal acts that proceed from it
stipulate that the wreck and its surroundings must remain the last
resting place of the victims,'' it said. ``The Estonian government
does not consider it necessary to change this trilateral
agreement.''
	   Estonian President Lennart Meri also opposed the body-retrieval
plan, saying it runs counter to the seafaring traditions of
Estonia.
	   ``The place where a person has had his life taken by the sea is
just as sacred as any graveyard next to a church,'' Meri told
journalists last week.
	   Most Estonian newspapers also denounced the plan.
	   Estonia's Postimees daily said any attempt recover the bodies
would come as many Estonians were beginning to come to terms with
the tragedy.
	   ``There is no urgent need to now rip open the wounds of the
victims' families who have only recently dried their tears of
mourning,'' the daily wrote.
	   The mother of Avo Piht, an off-duty ship captain who went down
with the ferry, said many family members would have supported a
plan to recover the bodies in the months after the accident.
	   ``But it wouldn't be right to do it now, over four years
later,'' Eesti Paeveleht quoted Meira Piht as saying. ``If they
raised the bodies of loved ones now, it wouldn't even be possible
to recognize them anymore.''

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus' authoritarian government on
Friday barred a reporter honored by the Committee to Protect
Journalists from traveling to New York to accept a press freedom
award.
	   Pavel Sheremet, Minsk bureau chief for Russia's ORT television
and chief editor of the newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, has
endured arrest and imprisonment while covering Belarus'
increasingly strict government.
	   He was to be among the recipients of the International Press
Freedom Award at a ceremony in New York on Nov. 24.
	   But Belarus' visa department refused to give him an exit visa,
citing orders from the administration of President Alexander
Lukashenko.
	   Belarusian citizens still need to get an exit visa to leave the
country, a practice left over from Soviet times that has been
abolished in most other former Soviet republics.
	   ``This is a logical conclusion of what has been going on in
Belarus,'' Sheremet said Friday. ``I feel the authorities are
trying to block me all the way. I'm used to that.''
	   ``The fact that I wasn't allowed to go to New York is far from
being the most horrible thing that could have happened in this
country where people are detained for 15 days just for taking part
in an innocent trade union demonstration,'' he said.
	   Sheremet was also denied an exit visa to travel to Yugoslavia in
June, he said.
	   Sheremet sent a videotape with his award acceptance speech in
Russian and in English to the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists.
	   ``I am very proud and happy that I have been given such award,''
he said.
	   Lukashenko has frequently complained about Russian news coverage
of his country, and has claimed on several occasions that Sheremet
and other journalists were trying to harm the image of Belarus.
	   Despite protests by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and human
rights activists, Belarusian authorities held Sheremet in jail for
2 1/2 months and then gave him a two-year suspended sentence for a
report on Belarus' lax border controls.

Ukrainian president blames central bank for capital flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's president and chief prosecutor
attacked the central bank Friday for failing to prevent massive
capital flight from the former Soviet republic.
	   President Leonid Kuchma said money is escaping Ukraine ``through
one official institution,'' referring to the National Bank, and
demanded measures to stop it.
	   The total capital flight from Ukraine since independence from
the Soviet Union in 1991 is estimated in the billions of dollars.
	   Kuchma spoke at a special session of his council for combating
corruption and organized crime, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Prosecutor General Mykhailo Potebenko told the session that many
criminals were using accounts with Ukrainian branches of foreign
banks for laundering money and transferring it abroad.
	   That, he said, testifies to ``the lack of control over and the
lack of responsibility of Ukraine's National Bank.''
	   In the first 10 months of 1998, 323 officials in the banking,
monetary and credit spheres have faced criminal convictions,
Potebenko said.
	   Over the same period, authorities have uncovered 124 fictitious
companies that have transferred abroad about 350 million U.S.
dollars, more than 4 million hryvna (dlrs 1.2 million) and more
than 90 billion Russian rubles (about dlrs 5.2 million at Friday's
rate), he said.
	   The embattled National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko, who also
was present at the meeting, spoke of his bank's high level of
security. He said the bank's computer system had thwarted four
infiltration attempts over the past four years, Interfax reported.
	   Friday's attacks on Yushchenko followed a Ukrainian parliament
session the day before at which Kuchma assailed the bank's tight
monetary policies and called for limiting its independence to ease
Ukraine's economic crisis.
	   However, both days Kuchma stopped short of urging the ouster of
Yushchenko, whom he called a ``professional devoted to Ukraine.''

UN warns of food crisis in Somalia; appeals for aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The U.N. World Food Program warned Friday of a major
food crisis in Somalia, saying three years of failed harvests could
mean hunger for hundreds of thousands of people.
	   Food shortages already have driven at least 7,000 Somalis from
their homes to the coast and to the border with Kenya, the
Rome-based World Food Program said.
	   The United Nations appealed for dlrs 18 million for emergency
assistance for more than 300,000 people in southern and central
Somalia.
	   ``We know that the situation has reached a critical level when
people start to migrate in search of food. We must help these
people now to curb an even greater humanitarian crisis,'' said
Burke Oberle, the WFP's representative for Somalia.
	   The food shortages have been worsened by fighting for control of
the southern port of Kismayo and violence in the capital,
Mogadishu, the United Nations said.
	   Somalia has lacked a central government since the ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Rival clan-based militia have
since divided the country into armed fiefdoms.

Pakistan prime minister declares emergency to end violence in port

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs with MQM to challenge the decision in
supreme court and fresh quotes. Minor edits. No Pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister suspended
civil rights Friday in a southern province and ordered the army to
quell violence in the port city of Karachi, where 1,000 people have
died in factional fighting.
	   Nawaz Sharif called in the army in the Sindh province to aid the
government and set up military courts in the port city of Karachi
to try those behind the factional violence. These courts will
decide cases within days, not weeks and months, he said.
	   ``The step has been taken because the terrorists were becoming
more and more powerful,'' he said in a news conference. ``We want
to get Karachi out of this hell.''
	   Sharif last month dismissed the elected provincial government of
Sindh after widespread political violence killed more than 1,000
people in Karachi this year, paralyzing economic activity. He
instituted direct federal rule of the province.
	   Sharif accused his former ally, the Muttahida Qami Movement
(MQM), of most of the bloodletting in Karachi including last
month's murder of former governor Hakim Said _ a charge denied by
the MQM.
	   The MQM, which speaks for the rights of Urdu speaking people who
migrated from India at independence from Britain in 1947 and their
descendants, has controled politics in the city for more than a
decade.
	   The party, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, is
locked in a bloody conflict with its dissident faction called the
MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have died in tit-for-tat killings by
the militants of these two factions in recent months. The party
broke into two groups several years ago.
	   The main party is controlled by Altaf Hussain, who has lived in
London since 1992.
	   Aftab Sheikh, a MQM spokesman, said Friday his party will
challenge the decision in the Supreme Court of Pakistan on
Saturday.
	   ``The government is targeting just one ethnic group,'' he said.
``Special anti-terrorists courts already exist. There is no need
for the military courts.''
	   Hussain, in a statement, said Sharif is trying to bring the
Mohajirs face-to-face against the army.
	   On Friday, human rights groups and other opposition parties also
said the move was unconstitutional and threatened democracy.
	   ``It is an undeclared martial law,'' said Asma Jehangir, the
chairwomen of independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who
urged Sharif to resign. Calling in the army ``is an acceptance of
incompetence by the government.''
	   Sharif said the state of emergency is in the larger interest of
the city and the country. President Rafiq Tarar invoked Article 245
of the constitution, which allows the suspension of civil rights,
bans political meetings and strikes and prevents military court
rulings from being challenged in civilian court.
	   Since the imposition of federal rule in October, the provincial
government has arrested 490 people for involvement in terrorist
activities.
	   Sharif said military courts are needed in Sindh because
``terrorists threatened the witnesses, judges and their families''
and had paralyzed the justice system.
	   ``It is also a part of Islamic justice which says speedy justice
should be provided at the door step. These courts will be a lesson
for the criminals and terrorists,'' he said.
	   Opposition parties are bitter over the Oct. 30 dismissal of the
provincial government which Sharif said was done after the MQM
refused to support a government plan to end the violence.
	   Senator Iqbal Haider, a member of the main opposition Pakistan
People's Party, said the government is not justified in imposing a
state of emergency.
	   ``It is a mini-martial law,'' he said.

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Hermann Maier, bidding for his second
victory in as many starts this season, led Austrian teammate
Stephan Eberharter after the first run of men's World Cup giant
slalom on Friday.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup overall and giant slalom
champion, completed the first leg down C.B.'s Run in 1 minute, 7.02
seconds, .35 faster than Eberharter. They were 1-2 in the
season-opening GS at Solden, Austria last month.
	   Switzerland's Steve Locher, the first racer of the day, was
third in 1:07.72, followed by another Austrian, Christian Mayer, in
1:07.90 and Marco Buechel of Liechtenstein in 1:07.97.
	   Italy's Patrick Holzer was sixth, 1.05 seconds back, followed by
Bode Miller of the United States, in 1:08.28. Miller was an unknown
when he shocked the World Cup circuit in this race a year ago,
placing 11th.
	   Rounding out the top 10 were former overall champion Kjetil
Andre Aamodt of Norway (1:08.31) and, tied for ninth, Siegfried
Voglreiter of Austria and another former overall champion, Lasse
Kjus of Norway.
	   Although the Austrians placed four racers in the top 10 and six
in the top 30 qualifiers for the afternoon run, they didn't have it
all their own way. Hans Knauss, Rainer Salzgeber and Fritz Strobl
failed to complete the first run.

Sides talking again, but there might not be much movement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's devlopments. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Amid an atmosphere of extreme pessimism,
American National Basektball Association club owners and players
resumed collective bargaining talks Friday with both sides saying
they would not be making new proposals.
	   It was the first full negotiating session in more than three
weeks, but neither side indicated the long delay had caused a
softening of their stances.
	   ``I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We
certainly want to, but I don't have my hopes up right now.''
	   Equally gloomy was Seattle SuperSonics center Jim McIlvaine, a
member of the union's bargaining team.
	   ``There's a sense that nothing's going to be done right now,''
he said.
	   The sides met for about two hours before breaking for lunch.
	   After talking to players on conference calls for the past two
weeks, union officials said their orders were to withhold any more
concessions until the owners showed an inclination to compromise.
	   With that mindset, Hunter sent a letter to every owner, team
president and general manager outlining the offers each side has
put on the table and warning that it would be ``an enormous
miscalculation to further test the players' resolve.''
	   The letters arrived at team offices Thursday.
	   ``I agree with none of his characterizations,'' Granik said.
``But that's his privilege to send it out.''
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which apply to all teams and players and sets things like minimum
salaries, pension and health insurance benefits, roster limits and
a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   Friday's bargaining session evolved from a telephone call NBA
commissioner David Stern placed to Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta
Hawks earlier this week. That led to a two-hour meeting Tuesday
that included Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing, Stern and
Granik.
	   While both sides agreed that almost nothing was accomplished
Tuesday, they decided to try to see if bringing both committees to
New York might give the process a boost.
	   ``Absolutely nothing has happened to suggest that the players
are ready to make anything like what we consider to be a fair deal,
unless something has changed in the last couple of days,'' Granik
said as he arrived Friday morning.
	   Hunter arrived 15 minutes later and said: ``I guess the issue is
discussing the proposals that were on the table and seeing whether
or not there's any possible movement. As I've said before, if they
are inclined to move off their position, then we are prepared to
discuss whether we're ready to move.''
	   Players received 57 percent of the NBA's revenues in salaries
last season.
	   Owners want a new system to reduce the percentage to 50 percent
but the latest offer the players have put forth wants to begin to
cap players salaries when the percentage reaches 60 percent.
	   ``Personally, I have some doubts whether the current structure
can ultimately be the basis for a deal,'' Granik said. ``When
something sits out there long enough and nobody finds a way to
bridge the gap, maybe you're better off admitting that it's not
going to work and starting over.
	   ``But there really are no secret potions here, it's just about
the overall dollars. And ultimately what has to be done here has to
affect the highest salaried players whose expectations have reached
a level that the business just can't support.''

Ukraine's president blasts police for poorly fighting crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma on Friday
lashed out at law-enforcement bodies and the court system for being
slow and inefficient in fighting crime.
	   Hopes that the number of crimes will decrease ``aren't coming
true at all'' and that ``lowers popular trust in the authorities,''
Kuchma told a meeting of the presidential council for combating
organized crime.
	   He also criticized the judiciary for handing down too many soft
punishments, making battling crime in Ukraine less effective, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``People are losing faith in the state and the authorities,''
because police fail in their efforts to uncover many serious crimes
and take insufficient measures to fight organized crime, Kuchma
added.
	   ``Enough talk about your awareness of large criminal groups,''
he said. ``If you know about them, then destroy them.''
	   Ukrainian police have uncovered more than 3,000 organized
criminal gangs, which have committed 21,700 crimes over the past
three years, Kuchma's press service said.
	   Yet despite these police efforts, organized criminal groups are
increasing in number, and now account for every 10th crime
registered in Ukraine's financial and banking sectors.
	   Corruption in the government has contributed to the growth of
organized crime as more and more government officials succumb to
bribery, the presidential press service said.
	   Police have uncovered nearly 7,000 instances of bribe-taking by
Ukrainian government officials in the past three years.

Albanian police on alert as key referendum nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police went on full alert Friday to guard
against unrest ahead of a weekend referendum on Albania's first
post-communist constitution, which the opposition vehemently
rejects.
	   Police sharpshooters surveyed Tirana streets from rooftops and
sandbags fortified government buildings amid fears that opposition
supporters will intimidate voters into abstaining.
	   Leaders of the opposition Democratic Party repeated calls for a
boycott that could blur the referendum results.
	   Western officials, who maintain that a constitution is a
necessary cornerstore for democracy, urged Albanians to vote en
masse.
	   ``Western nations are very, very strongly calling for a massive
participation in the referendum Sunday,'' said Daan Everts, the
ambassador for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``But there is a lot of intimidation tactics and wild
disinformation. Voter turnout is uncertain. If people don't vote
for whatever reason, it will be hard to assess support'' for the
draft.
	   The Democratic Party vows to gather 50,000 people in a protest
rally in downtown Tirana on Saturday in violation of laws
prohibiting campaigning 48 hours before the vote. And Saturday
night, leading Albanian musicians plan to stage a concert in Tirana
in thinly veiled support of the governing Socialists.
	   Albania and Belarus are the only two European countries without
a constitution.
	   The government-proposed constitution, drafted after a year of
talks with European constitutional experts, would outline private
property rights and give Albanians the right to legally change
their religion and identify themselves as a member of an ethnic
minority.
	   The Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha said those
clauses are ``anti-Albanian'' and will encourage citizens to turn
away from Islam, the national religion, hoping to emigrate to
richer, non-Muslim European countries.
	   Observers say the boycott gives the proposal certain victory,
since Albanians opposed to the constitution refuse to vote. A
simple majority of those who vote is required for it to be adopted;
the government recently scrapped a law requiring more than 50 per
cent turnout.
	   Nonetheless, Everts said low turnout could undermine the
authority of the government, already rocked by rioting in Tirana in
September and the recent resignation of Fatos Nano as prime
minister.
	   ``If turnout is 40 percent to 50 percent, that would be
maneagable,'' said Everts. ``But 20 percent or 30 percent would be
a problem for the government.''
	   Westerners say many Albanians may fear approaching polling
booths Sunday. Besides the opposition's harsh statements, alleged
plots to mar the elections with violence have been reported by
pro-government newspapers in recent days.
	   An anonymous group has plastered the northern city of Shkodra
with posters implying retaliation against those who vote.
	   ``Don't vote Sunday,'' read the posters. ``We know who you are
and we will be watching.''

U.N. weapons teams work, Iraqis enjoy weekend break

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams carried out field
inspections Friday while Iraqis, relieved that the threat of U.S.
airstrikes was over, flocked to outdoor markets, amusement parks
and picnic grounds.
	   The inspectors' working on the Muslim sabbath is a change of
policy. Traditionally they took Fridays off. But Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission that oversees
disarmament efforts, said teams would work seven days a week in
future.
	   ``We want to get on with things and get as much done in as short
a period of time as possible,'' Cross said.
	   The inspectors were believed to be checking the monitoring
equipment they had installed at known weapons sites before the
recent crisis.
	   The more contentious inspections _ when the U.N. experts make
surprise visits to sites where they suspect evidence of banned
weaponry is hidden _ are not expected until next week. The
inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift the
punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The inspectors resumed work on Wednesday, after flying back from
Bahrain, where they went last week amid fears of airstrikes.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened to use force if
Iraq did not reverse its decisions in August and October that
effectively put an end to inspections.
	   Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging full cooperation with
UNSCOM. U.S. President Bill Clinton has said he will maintain
forces in the Gulf to ensure Iraq follows through.
	   In his Friday sermon, Bakr al-Samerai, the preacher at the
Abdel-Kader al-Gailani Mosque, said: ``We thank God that the crisis
ended.''
	   But others expressed concern at the U.S. presence in the Gulf
and its threat to strike without warning if Iraq breaks its pledge
of cooperation.
	   Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at the 14th of Ramadan Mosque,
urged other Arab nations to ``stand by Iraq and tell America that
we will not allow this oppression and aggression to continue.''
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar
Hamdoon, told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that ``it
is not unlikely for the crisis to erupt again.''
	   He suggested the United States would try to provoke the Baghdad
regime, but he said the Iraqi government was ``keen on warding off
a crisis because we want the (U.N.) comprehensive review to take
place as soon as possible.''
	   Iraq hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' of its
progress on disarmament will lead to an easing or lifting of the
sanctions, which have limited oil sales and crippled the economy.

Primakov criticizes predecessors for not improving productivity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with officials saying gap between
spending and revenues in 1999 budget too huge to be called
``deficit,'' other details. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The gap between revenues and spending in Russia's
1999 budget will be too monstrous to even be called a ``deficit''
and the government has no idea where to find money to plug the
hole, an official said Friday.
	   The government was putting together three versions of a budget
draft Friday evening, ahead of a Saturday session that would
finalize the draft.
	   The versions put the disparity between revenues and spending at
either 150 billion rubles (dlrs 9 billion), 280 billion rubles
(dlrs 16 billion), or 360 billion rubles (dlrs 21 billion), said a
senior government official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
	   Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and
credit-regulation department, said Russia had no sources to plug
the gap, which is beyond a simple ``deficit.''
	   ``This difference can't be called a budget deficit, because
according to economic theory, a deficit has known sources that are
used to cover it with,'' Pochinok told reporters.
	   ``But we don't have sources to finance this hole, and therefore
we can't call it a deficit.''
	   Pochinok didn't give figures for revenues or spending for the
1999 budget. The 1998 budget called for a deficit of dlrs 22
billion, which was 4.7 percent of gross domestic product, but the
government had foreign credits and issued treasury bonds to cover
the deficit.
	   Now, foreign aid has been frozen and nobody wants to buy
Russia's bonds, after the government defaulted on existing ones in
August. Next year's GDP is also expected to be considerably lower,
so a deficit the same size would take up a larger chunk of the
overall budget.
	   The government will likely simply print money to cover the gap,
the first official said _ confirming earlier gloomy warnings by
many analysts, who say it will lead to hyperinflation.
	   Even the optimistic budget draft calls for printing 60 billion
rubles (dlrs 3.5 billion), and 30 percent inflation, the official
said. But that draft envisages more foreign aid _ something that
creditors have not indicated they plan to provide.
	   The pessimistic draft envisages no international credits to
Russia and lower tax collections than this year. That plan foresees
printing 320 billion rubles (dlrs 18.6 billion), and 180 percent
inflation, the official said.
	   Inflation was less than 1 percent a month before the crisis hit
in August.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said Friday that
Russia will ask the International Monetary Fund for new terms on
repaying the dlrs 4.6 billion due to the lending organization next
year.
	   New IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August. The IMF
has insisted it will not release any more money until the
government comes up with a comprehensive plan to combat the
economic crisis and starts implementing it.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov blamed his
reform-minded predecessors for the West's skepticism about Russia's
economic recovery plan.
	   He said the liberal reformers had failed to boost the nation's
productivity, and that their ability to stabilize the economy had
been based on high world prices for oil, Russia's biggest export
earner.
	   When oil prices fell, the reformers suffered ``a spasm of
fear,'' Primakov said in an interview to the daily Izvestia
published Friday. But now the West regards them as ``oracles,''
Primakov complained.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Over the past month, the number of Russians living below
the official poverty line of 644 rubles (less than dlrs 40) a month
has reached 42 million, or 29 percent of the population, compared
to 31 million (21 percent) a year ago, the State Statistics
Committee said.

Prosecutor: Botha may still stand trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A prosecutor on Friday left
open the possibility that former apartheid President P.W. Botha
would be put on trial for abuses committed during white rule.
	   Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient
evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information collected by the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated
apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether
charges would ultimately be brought.
	   Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its
findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the African
National Congress' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a
Johannesburg building housing an anti-apartheid group.
	   When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people
were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed.
	   The commission can grant amnesty to those who fully confess to
politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has
said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty.
	   Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of contempt of court for
refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a
suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000 rand (dlrs 5,700)
fine. He has appealed the decision.

Clinton raises specter of a more hostile North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Bill Clinton is emphasizing
security in a visit to South Korea after questioning whether
communist North Korea is cheating on a nuclear agreement and
``moving toward a more hostile posture.''
	   ``We are quite concerned about some of the news,'' the president
said as he wrapped up a visit to Tokyo and flew here Friday for a
two-day stay. ``There are some disturbing signs there.''
	   North Korea rebuffed U.S. appeals to inspect an underground site
suspected of being used to construct nuclear missiles, demanding
dlrs 300 million simply for the right to look. Clinton said the
conditions were ``completely unacceptable.''
	   In another destabilizing move, North Korea fired a missile over
Japanese territory in August, rattling nerves in Tokyo, Seoul and
Washington. There are concerns North Korea is accelerating its
ballistic missile program.
	   After a late-night arrival, Clinton meets Saturday with
President Kim Dae-jung, the longtime dissident and democracy
advocate elected president last December on his fourth try.
	   Speaking to reporters earlier, Kim said he would urge Clinton
not to press North Korea too hard about the suspected nuclear site.
Kim has advocated a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement toward North
Korea.
	   ``We need patience when dealing with North Korea,'' Kim said.
``Without any conclusive evidence, it is not a good idea to blow up
the problem.''
	   North Korea considers the United States an enemy and remains in
a technical state of war with South Korea 45 years after the Korean
War cease-fire.
	   In a reminder of U.S. military muscle, Clinton on Saturday will
visit a training center near the demilitarized zone and inspect
combat vehicles such as Apache attack helicopters, M-1 Abrams tanks
and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. He also will stop at Osan Air Base,
host to U.S. Air Force U-2 spy planes that keep an eye on North
Korea.
	   The emphasis on security here follows talks in Tokyo about
Asia's economic collapse and Japan's responsibility to get its
financial house in order and help lift the rest of the region.
	   Hammered by failing banks and businesses, South Korea was one of
the hardest-hit countries. Its recession-bound economy is expected
to shrink about 7 percent this year.
	   Presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling said South Korea
``has much to be complimented on'' for accepting belt-tightening
conditions in an International Monetary Fund rescue package.
	   ``There is obviously further work to do in ensuring that
everyone, including the large conglomerates, are doing their
part,'' Sperling said. The conglomerates, known as the chaebol,
have resisted government prodding to slim down and restructure.
	   Clinton arrived as U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman concluded
a two-day meeting in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and
rejected demands for dlrs 300 million for the right to inspect a
large underground site situated in a mountainside at Keumjongri, 25
miles (40 km) northeast of Yongbyon, North Korea's main nuclear
complex.

Human rights group announces campaign to block Pinochet's return to
</HEADLINE>
Chile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Madrid-based human rights group on Friday
launched a campaign to prevent former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet returning to Chile from London, where he has been held
since Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish judge.
	   Britain's highest court is due to rule on Wednesday whether
Pinochet is immune from prosecution as a former head of state, and
so protected from the attempt to extradite him to Spain.
	   ``If English justice decides to guarantee him (Pinochet)
immunity and not proceed with his extradition, it must be stressed
that this does not apply beyond British borders,'' the Argentine
Association for Human Rights said in a statement to announce a
campaign aimed at obstructing the former despot's return to Chile.
	   ``His movement through the air space of any country, or
temporary stay in any airport, should be considered as part of an
escape and lead to his detention,'' the statement read.
	   The campaign calls for a worldwide lobby on governments to
refuse authorization for any flight carrying Pinochet.
	   The association contributed evidence to the Spanish judicial
probes underpinning the attempt to extradite Pinochet on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism on the bases of crimes committed
during his 1973 to 1990 regime.
	   In its statement, the group stressed that judicial process
against Pinochet, whose dictatorship is blamed for the murder and
disappearance of over 3,000 people, are underway in France and
Switzerland as well as Spain.
	   Wednesday's expected ruling on the immunity issue by the British
Law Lords coincidentally falls on Pinochet's 83rd birthday.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ An explosion possibly caused by a bomb
demolished part of a building containing the deputy prime
minister's office Friday, killing at least one person and wounding

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The second round of Senate
elections began Friday, with the Czech opposition poised the win
most of the seats in the upper house of parliament.
	   The Senate vote is largely considered a test of support for
Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government, which took over from
former Premier Vaclav Klaus after elections in June. The stagnant
economy and poor law enforcement are among the top issues.
	   But the upper chamber is not a powerful legislative body in the
Czech Republic and will have little impact on the country's
political landscape even if Klaus' Civic Democratic Party makes a
strong showing in this election.
	   In a first round of voting for a third of the Senate's 81 seats
last week, the Civic Democratic Party advanced 22 out of 27
candidates to the second round, the most of any party competing.
	   The governing Social Democrats are in second with 15 candidates
in the second round, a showing they called disappointing.
	   A coalition of four opposition center-right parties led by the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union finished third with 14
candidates, while the Communists made it in three districts.
	   Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to win the election
outright last week or face a run-off between the two top finishers.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent in the
first-round vote, meaning runoff elections were necessary in all 27
districts. Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher than in the
first Senate elections in 1996.
	   Unofficial results were expected late Saturday.
	   The upper house was created in 1996 as a safety mechanism to
ensure the country could function in case of a constitutional
crisis. It can pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution,
should the 200-seat lower chamber be dissolved.
	   Since its formation, the Senate has been criticized by all
members of the political spectrum for not being effective enough.
Several parties, including the Communists and the ultra-nationalist
Republican, have even called for its abolition.
	   Before the vote, the conservative Civic Democratic Party
controlled 29 seats in the Senate. Twelve of those seats are up for
grabs in the current vote.
	   There were 26 Social Democrat Senators, six of whom were up for
reelection.
	   The rest of the seats were held by four smaller parties,
including the Christian Democrats, The Freedom Union and the
Communists.

Duma condemns Kalmyk call for autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 6 grafs with comments by Yeltsin, interview
with Ilyumzhinov. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of Russia's parliament on Friday
condemned a southern regional leader's call for greater autonomy
from Moscow.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, 36, the president of Kalmykia, said Tuesday
on Russian television that the federal government had failed to
deliver subsidies to his republic and that he would push for
secession.
	   Later in the week, he backpedaled, saying he did not mean a
political secession but was using the term loosely in an attempt to
draw attention to the region's economic woes.
	   Still, the response to Ilyumzhinov's call has been furious. On
Friday, by a vote of 355 to one, with one abstention, the State
Duma adopted a statement calling Ilyumzhinov's move
``provocative,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Duma called on President Boris Yeltsin and the government to
take measures to ``suppress anti-constitutional acts that create
the threat of spreading separatism in Russia.''
	   Lawmaker Mikhail Gutseriyev, who is in charge of domestic policy
affairs, said he thought Ilyumzhinov's secession threat was
``somewhat exaggerated,'' but still welcomed the Duma resolution,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin strongly denounced Ilyumzhinov's statements Friday,
saying that ``any attempts to revise the federal structure of
Russia, or rewrite our constitution are very dangerous in our
situation,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   Earlier Friday, the liberal Yabloko party called on the Russian
government to impose a state of emergency in Kalmykia, Interfax
reported.
	   Ilyumzhinov, an extravagant leader and head of the International
Chess Federation (FIDE), said Friday that government has not played
a good game, concentrating only on one move instead of devising a
strategy that would benefit the entire country.
	   ``If this were a chess game you could see that Russia is not
playing well,'' he said. ``They thought only of their first move
and maybe, at maximum, their second move. But the political game
has many moves, looking ahead, and they have not looked ahead.''
	   ``I have not raised only Kalmykia's problems, but the general
problems of all the republics, all the regions that are suffering
from the way we are handled by the Moscow bureaucrats.''

Deployment of NATO force could be delayed to comfort Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - The deployment of a NATO rapid reaction
force in Macedonia for Kosovo could be delayed for several days
until Yugoslav resistance to the idea is softened, a French envoy
said Friday.
	   Jacques Huntzinger, the French ambassador to Macedonia, said
``everything should be done to avoid causing problems between
Yugoslavia and Macedonia because of the creation of these forces.''
	   ``Even if this brings a delay of several days in the schedule,
it is worth doing everything to smooth away the problems that might
occur,'' he told reporters.
	   Yugoslavia last week strongly protested to Macedonia over the
planned deployment of some 1,700 NATO combat troops to assist about
2,000 verifiers in neighboring Kosovo, saying it jeopardizes
security and could lead to worsening relations between the two
Balkan countries.
	   The verifiers are being assigned to Kosovo to ensure a
cease-fire holds between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Speaking in Washington, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said the force would not intervene in any fighting or confrontation
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   The troops, with helicopters and tanks, are scheduled to start
arriving Dec. 1 and are meant to come to the aid of unarmed
observers in Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province,
should they be menaced or face danger.
	   ``It is important for Belgrade to understand that this force is
not an imposing one,'' Huntzinger said, adding that it would act
``for humanitarian reasons, as the last resource in case Yugoslav
authorities could not ensure security for the verifiers.''
	   ``This force is not aimed at fighting Serbian soldiers or
policemen. The main weapon of the force will be their
helicopters,'' said Huntzinger, who met Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday.
	   The force could be used for complete extraction of verifiers,
``in case of massive hostilities,'' urgent medical help, taking of
hostages and problems with land mines, he added.
	   Huntzinger said French Gen. Marcel Valentin probably will
command the force, which will include French, British, Italian,
Dutch and German soldiers. Its bases will be near the northern
Macedonian town of Kumanovo, near the Yugoslav border, and at
Skopje's airport.
	   No Americans will be involved, Solana said. ``This will be the
first time an all-European force goes on a particular mission.
Americans will be on the horizon but not deployed on the ground.''
	   Macedonia's new government is expected to give a formal go-ahead
for the arrival of the NATO troops within 10 days.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels were accused
of ambushing a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others in the latest outbreak of
violence in Kosovo.
	   As fresh white snow blanketed this troubled province of Serbia,
making roads hazardous and disrupting aid convoys, low-level
conflict persisted despite an official cease-fire.
	   The official Serb Media Center said ``Albanian extremists''
struck early Friday near Prilep, on the road from Pec to Djakovica
about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the provincial capital,
Pristina.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the center said, when guerrillas fired an anti-tank round
into their vehicle and then opened up with small arms.
	   The dead were identified as Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos
Cizmadzija, 45. Three of their colleagues were badly wounded and
transported to the hospital in Pristina. A fourth suffered minor
injuries.
	   The attack could not be independently confirmed but it typifies
the violence between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels since last month's cease-fire and the Oct. 12 agreement
between American negotiator Richard Holbrooke and President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded in the same area Wednesday.
Another was reported abducted earlier this week in Podujevo,
northeast of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million
people living in the province. Their political leadership is
seeking independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were killed and
hundreds of thousands displaced during a government crackdown from
February to October.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was forced to divert three aid convoys
Friday carrying food, blankets and mattresses. The supplies
originally were destined for distribution points west of Pristina,
but were diverted because of snow, said spokesman Fernando del
Mundo.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says no refugees now
live in the open. Many are sheltering in the homes of friends and
relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in their damaged
houses.
	   ``Until the next harvest, they will need support,'' del Mundo
said.
	   The UNHCR says about 60,000 refugees have returned to their
homes over the last few weeks. But High Commissioner Sadako Ogata
said the fragile peace ``is marred by virtually daily incidents.''
	   Meanwhile, the top U.S. envoy for Kosovo dismissed the idea that
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic had rejected a U.S. draft plan
that reportedly would give ethnic Albanians virtual self-rule.
	   ``We don't consider the Serbs have rejected our agreement and
expect to be talking to them in the next few days,'' Christopher
Hill said in Lisbon, Portugal.
	   Milutinovic told reporters Wednesday the U.S. proposal gave too
much power to independence-minded ethnic Albanians.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The U.S. first lady was
in the Dominican Republic on Friday to show U.S. support for
hurricane relief efforts and the Caribbean country's progress under
democracy.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived late Thursday from Guatemala,
continuing a tour of storm-ravaged Central America and the
Caribbean.
	   The chancellor for foreign affairs, Eduardo de la Torre, and
other dignitaries greeted her at Santo Domingo's international
airport.
	   Mrs. Clinton was expected to visit a vocational education center
Friday and meet with leaders of civic organizations before
attending receptions with President Leonel Fernandez and diplomatic
leaders. She also was to visit San Pedro de Macoris, about 70 miles
(110 kilometers) east of the capital, to tour a hospital being
rebuilt with U.S. help.
	   Mrs. Clinton's planned September visit was pre-empted by
Hurricane Georges, which killed at least 283 Dominicans and left
thousands homeless. Dominicans are hoping her visit will spur a new
infusion of U.S. aid.
	   The trip also was seen as support for the Dominican Republic's
steps toward a stronger democracy following more than 30 years
under the heavy-handed rule of former President Joaquin Balaguer.
	   Fernandez, elected in 1996 in the cleanest elections in the
country's history, has won international praise for his moderate
government but has been struggling to push his programs through a
hostile legislature.
	   ``She'll be showing support for this experiment in democracy
that has been progressing well since 1996,'' said Michael Stanton,
a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo.
	   Fernandez, a U.S.-educated lawyer, will be reaffirming ties to
the United States after his government's recent friendly overtures
to Cuba drew a cool response from Washingon. Mrs. Clinton's visit
comes nearly three months to the day after a historic tour of the
Dominican Republic by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
	   She was to leave Saturday for Haiti.

Germany's Deutsche Bank wants to buy Telecom's cable television

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest
commercial bank, wants to buy Deutsche Telecom's cable television
networks, which have a total of 18 million customers, a newspaper
said Friday.
	   In a report that is to appear in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung's
weekend editions, the newspaper said that Deutsche Bank had sent a
written offer to Telecom to pay up to 9 billion marks (dlrs 5.4
billion) for the rights to the networks.
	   The bank wants to go into partnership with others to build up a
multi-media network, the report said, including access to the
Internet.
	   A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on the report, and
no one was immediately available at Deutsche Telecom to comment.
	   However, Telecom said in a statement Friday that investment
bankers Rothschild &AMP; Sons will act as the group's consultant in the
screening process of potential investors for its broad-band cable
business.
	   The group also said it would release details about the state of
the spin-off once a decision on the final procedure of the selling
process has been reached.
	   Deutsche Telekom had earlier said it plans to spin off its cable
business but won't allow one investor to hold a majority interest
in all resulting regional units.
	   Earlier this year, Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board approved
the management's May decision to unbundle its loss-making
broad-band cable business on Jan. 1, 1999, by founding
subsidiaries.
	   Telekom then plans to sell stakes in these individual units. It
would be possible for a single investor to acquire a
majority-holding on a regional basis, but not in all regions.
Telekom didn't specify the number of regional units it will
establish from its cable business which stretches across Germany.

France ready to put up ``barbed wire'' to stop Wallabies

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A year after its humiliating 52-10
defeat by South Africa, France's rebuilt team is on a high as it
faces its toughest test of the year Saturday against Australia.
	   Since France was pounded by South Africa, it has bounced back
with eight consecutive victories, winning a second successive Five
Nations Grand Slam in the process.
	   ``It will be an exciting match a year before the World Cup,''
said team manager Jo Maso. ``It falls at a point that allows us to
judge ourselves.''
	   The Wallabies, on a brief 13-day tour, have injury and illness
concerns.
	   Winger Jason Little (flu) and flyhalf Steve Larkham (knee) are
expected to play. However, Australia will be without seven top
players, meaning starts for fullback Chris Lathan, center Nathan
Grey and prop Patricio Noriega.
	   For France, Philippe Bernat-Salles replaces the injured Emile
Ntamack, while Thomas Castaignede, Christian Califano and Jean-Luc
Sadourny are also out.
	   In a move to improve the team's kicking, Christophe Lamaison
comes in for Franck Comba.
	   ``For us, it's the hour of truth. We have made a lot of progress
but I can't say if we can follow through,'' said coach Jean-Claude
Skrela.
	   France beat Argentina 34-14 last week, but knows it must improve
to beat the Australians, who have won the last two meetings between
the countries.
	   ``Since those two games, the Australians have made even more
progress and are playing modern and complete rugby. They are used
to playing at the highest level in their hemisphere and that gives
them great confidence in their game,'' Skrela said.
	   ``We will have to put up barbed wire to prevent the Australians
developing their moving game,'' said second row forward Fabien
Pelous.
	   Pierre Villepreux, one of Skrela's assistants, said Australia
doesn't have any weaknesses.
	   ``But if we can push them back it is possible to force errors.
But to do that we have to chain up their game.''

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the U.S. first lady, announced dlrs 14.2 million in additional
American disaster relief to the Dominican Republic on Friday, and
defended tougher regulation of immigration and deportation laws.
	   The money, coming on top of dlrs 35 million already pledged by
the United States, would pay for building materials, food, farm
tools and seed as well as campaigns to prevent disease and provide
clean water.
	   The Dominican Republic was devastated by Hurricane Georges in
September. Dominicans had been hoping the first lady's visit would
spur a new infusion of aid.
	   ``I could see some of the damage on my way from the airport last
night. I know what this has meant to the hopes and dreams of your
people,'' Mrs. Clinton told a forum of civic organizations in Santo
Domingo.
	   Earlier in her trip, Mrs. Clinton visited Central American
nations that were hit hard last month by Hurricane Mitch. She
leaves Saturday for Haiti.
	   Responding to questions at the forum, Mrs. Clinton said it was
important to stringently enforce immigration laws as ``the lack of
enforcement could endanger the openness that has been a hallmark of
the U.S. immigration system.''
	   Some 800,000 Dominicans have legally emigrated to the United
States since the early 1980s, the U.S. Embassy here said. Most live
in New York City.
	   Mrs. Clinton also said the United States would not halt a
stepped-up program to deport foreign convicts but would ``consult
with the Dominican government to minimize the impact.''
	   The United States has infuriated Caribbean leaders by deporting
increasing numbers of criminals whom islanders blame for a surge in
violent crimes. The United States has deported 1,508 Dominican
inmates this year.
	   Mrs. Clinton had planned to visit the Dominican Republic in
September, but was pre-empted by Hurricane Georges, which killed at
least 283 Dominicans and left thousands homeless.
	   In addition to the disaster aid, she announced the United States
would give dlrs 1.5 million to encourage democratic education
programs in Dominican schools.
	   Her trip was seen as support for Dominican democracy following
more than 30 years under the heavy-handed rule of former President
Joaquin Balaguer.
	   President Leonel Fernandez, a U.S.-trained lawyer who grew up in
New York City, was elected in 1996 in the cleanest elections in the
country's history. He planned a reception for the first lady later
Friday.

Belarus admits buying Russian treasury bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian banks bought tens of millions
of dollars in Russian treasury bonds before Moscow defaulted on
them in August, which seriously hurt Belarus' already ailing
economy, President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday.
	   But Lukashenko insisted that Russia has helped Belarus ``settle
the problem'' because of the close ties between the neighboring
former Soviet republics.
	   Russia defaulted on its treasury bond debt in August, which
helped lead to the country's current economic meltdown. Western
banks that bought the bonds have been frantically negotiating with
Russian officials to restructure the debt, but have not reached a
final agreement.
	   Lukashenko did not elaborate on how Russia settled the debts to
Belarusian banks.
	   ``I have to public express gratitude to the leadership of Russia
and the central bank for assisting us in settling the problem
quickly, and only for Belarus, because of our good relations with
Russia,'' Lukashenko told a five-hour meeting of Belarus' Academy
of Sciences.
	   Lukashenko has pushed for closer ties to Russia, its largest
trading partner, and has blocked most serious economic reforms in
Belarus, leaving things much as they were in Soviet times.
	   The country was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a
dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to order
strict price controls. That led to a boom in exports and to
frequent shortages of staple goods, including meat and dairy
products, within Belarus. Some cities are issuing ration cards.

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked
suspected guerrilla hideouts Friday following a series of clashes
in south Lebanon. Four guerrillas were reportedly killed.
	   Guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Amal group attacked Israeli and
allied militia positions in the Israeli-occupied zone at daybreak,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   Three guerrillas were killed in the assaults, said an Israeli
army spokesman in Jerusalem.
	   Amal claimed responsibility for the raids, but said none of its
fighters was killed.
	   Shortly afterwards, two Israeli jets fired two missiles at
targets between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, 23 kilometers
(14 miles) southeast of Tyre, Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) strike was the 100th Israeli air raid on
south Lebanon this year, the officials said.
	   Later the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group launched at least two
attacks on Israeli forces, including a roadside bomb that was
detonated as an Israeli infantry patrol was passing near Sojod on
the edge of the occupied zone, Lebanese officials said.
	   In response, Israeli and allied militia artillery pounded the
Iqlim al-Tuffah area, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the zone.
	   In Jerusalem, a military spokesman said Israeli and militia
forces attacked two groups of guerrillas who were laying land mines
in the central and northeastern areas of the occupied zone.
	   In the northeastern clash, which occurred Friday evening, at
least one guerrilla was killed, the Israeli spokesman said.
	   Numerous explosives were retrieved from the clash sites, he
added.
	   In a statement issued in Beirut, Hezbollah did not mention any
losses, but said its fighters had inflicted ``heavy casualties'' on
the Israeli forces.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in
Israeli casualties.
	   The clashes come at a time of heightened tension in south
Lebanon. On Monday, a Hezbollah roadside bomb killed three Israeli
soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Crown Prince Frederik, the heir to
Denmark's throne, plans to take part in a 3,500-kilometers
(2,170-mile) dog-sled trek to mark the 50th anniversary of a Danish
Navy unit that patrols along Greenland's northern fringe.
	   The trip, set for February 2000, is planned to set off from
Qaanaaq, north of the U.S. Air Force base in Thule, 500 kilometers
(310 miles) south of the North Pole. The crew will follow the
coastline and are expected to arrive in June in Ittoqqortoormiit,
1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northeast of the Greenland capital of
Nuuk.
	   The crown prince, 30, is a member of the navy's elite frogman
unit and has taken part in Arctic drills.
	   Frederik's personal secretary was quoted as telling newspapers
on Friday that the crown prince would take part in the expedition
on the same conditions as the others. ``He is part of the team,''
Per Thornit was quoted as saying by the Berlingske Tidende daily.
	   The six-person expedition will include three sleds, each
weighing about 450 kilograms (990 pounds), pulled by a total of 42
dogs.
	   The trip is to commemorate the founding in 1950 of the Sirius
patrol, which monitors to nothern fringes of the Danish territory.

Human rights group announces campaign to block Pinochet's return to
</HEADLINE>
Chile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A human rights group began efforts Friday
to prevent former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from returning
to Chile from London, where authorities have detained him for more
than a month.
	   Pinochet has been held at a London hospital since Oct. 16 on a
warrant by a Spanish judge who wants to extradite him to face
charges of genocide and murder.
	   Britain's highest court is due to rule Wednesday on whether
Pinochet is immune from prosecution as a former head of state and,
therefore, protected from extradition to Spain.
	   ``If English justice decides to guarantee him (Pinochet)
immunity and not proceed with his extradition, it must be stressed
that this does not apply beyond British borders,'' the Madrid-based
Argentine Association for Human Rights said in a statement.
	   ``His movement through the air space of any country, or
temporary stay in any airport, should be considered as part of an
escape and lead to his detention,'' the statement read.
	   The human rights group called for all governments to refuse
authorization for any flight carrying Pinochet.
	   The group contributed evidence to the Spanish judicial probes
behind the attempt to extradite Pinochet. The charges against the
former dictator are based on crimes committed while he held power
from 1973 to 1990. Pinochet's regime is blamed for the murder and
disappearance of over 3,000 people.

Brazil's central bank head says direct investment unaffected by
</HEADLINE>
crisis
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Central Bank President Gustavo
Franco painted an upbeat picture of the Brazilian economy Friday,
saying that direct investment in the country has never been higher.
	   According to Franco, direct investment into Brazil was not
affected by the recent turbulence rocking emerging markets around
the world. He said that in September _ at the height of the crisis
_ Brazil received dlrs 3.6 billion in direct investment.
	   ``This shows the divorce between the real world and the
financial world,'' said Franco, who expected Brazil would receive
about dlrs 24 billion in direct investment in 1998 _ and about the
same amount next year.
	   Direct investment, which usually involves companies buying or
building factories, stores and other infrastructure, is considered
a better sign of confidence in a country's economy than stock
market or fixed-income investments which are easier to take out in
hard times.
	   In September, Brazil was hemorrhaging foreign reserves at a rate
of more than dlrs 1 billion a day, causing the reserves to drop to
around dlrs 40 billion from around dlrs 70 billion in August.
	   Franco said that Brazil would use the money from the recently
awarded dlrs 41.5 billion International Monetary Fund-led rescue
package to bolster the foreign reserves.
	   The first tranche of dlrs 9 billion is expected in December.
	   The official also said Brazil would get another boost from its
privatization program which should yield another dlrs 40 billion
for the country.
	   He said a good chunk of that money should come from abroad
because the next wave of privatizations would include the banks
Banespa and Banestado.
	   ``In bank auctions, the biggest interest is from foreigners that
want to get into Brazil,'' Franco explained.
	   Franco also made clear that Brazil would not alter its foreign
exchange policy to devaluate the currency more rapidly than many
have been expecting.
	   Brazil currently devaluates its currency, the real, in small
increments about twice weekly for a total annual devaluation of
around 7 percent.

Report: Portugal asks U.N. to suspend E. Timor talks following
</HEADLINE>
report of massacre &QL; 
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal on Friday asked for the
temporary suspension of its U.N.-brokered dialogue with Indonesia
over East Timor, following reports of a massacre in the disputed
territory earlier in the day, news reports said.
	   An unidentified diplomatic source quoted by the Portuguese news
agency Lusa said the allegations of the massacre had prompted
Portugal to ask U.N. envoy to East Timor Jamsheed Marker, ``to
suspend the talks until the U.N. clears up what actually
happened.''
	   The source said that the alleged massacre involved a ``possibly
high,'' number of civilians, Lusa reported.
	   Portuguese Foreign Ministry officials were not immediately
available for comment.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after invading the
half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Jakarta
during a civil war that broke out at the end of Portuguese colonial
rule.
	   The U.N., which still regards Portugal as the legitimate
authority in East Timor, is brokering talks between the former
colonial power and the post-colonial invaders to resolve the
dispute.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
widespread abuses, such as firing on pro-independence protesters in
the East Timorese capital Dili in 1991 killing 200 people.
	   An East Timor resistance spokesman in Lisbon, Roque Rodrigues,
said his group was trying to contact sources in Dili to ``assess
the magnitude,'' of the latest alleged massacre.
	   Also Friday, military sources in the Indonesian capital Jakarta
said the situation in the East Timor village of Alas was tense,
following a clash Tuesday between Indonesian soldiers and rebels
who are waging a small-scale guerrilla war in favor of
independence.
	   After the May resignation of the authoritarian President
Suharto, Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control of
its defense, economic and foreign policy.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal.
	   Portugal provides a haven for East Timorese pro-independence
activists, and has insisted that a referendum be held in the
territory to decide its future.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams carried out field
inspections Friday while Iraqis, relieved that the threat of U.S.
air strikes was over, flocked to outdoor markets, amusement parks
and picnic grounds.
	   The inspectors' working on the Muslim sabbath is a change of
policy. Traditionally they took Fridays off. But Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission that oversees
disarmament efforts, said teams would work seven days a week in
future.
	   ``We want to get on with things and get as much done in as short
a period of time as possible,'' Cross said.
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad. The inspectors refused to talk to reporters,
and Cross would not say where they were going.
	   But the Iraqi authorities said the inspectors had visited nine
sites, the official Iraqi News Agency reported late Friday.
	   The inspectors were believed to have checked the monitoring
equipment they had installed at these places before the recent
crisis.

Baikonur launch pad: From Soviet showcase to ghost city

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The Baikonur launch site that sent up
the first piece of an international space station Friday was
showered with money and glory during the Soviet era. Now, broken
windows and creaky outhouses greet visitors to this remote spot on
the wind-swept steppe.
	   Faded makeshift posters proclaiming that ``Russia has been, is
and will remain the great space power,'' decorate intersections in
the lonely desert.
	   There is little left at Baikonur to indicate greatness.
	   In the heat of the Cold War space race, the Soviet government
built a string of launch pads, administrative buildings and living
quarters flung out across Baikonur in northern Kazakstan. Russia
now rents the base from its neighboring former Soviet republic.
	   Today, a freshly-built conference hall that housed post-launch
celebrations is surrounded by lines of deserted apartment buildings
and offices, their broken windows gaping open.
	   An observation point that housed journalists during the launch
featured a spartan barrack used as a shelter from fierce winds and
a lonely wooden outhouse.
	   Black smoke billowed from a building just across the street from
the conference hall, where dignitaries from the 16 nations taking
part in the international space station were meeting Friday.
Jubilant officials took no notice. The source of the smoke was
unclear.
	   Russia's space agency has been hit with severe funding cuts
since the 1991 Soviet collapse, and Baikonur is not the only thing
that has suffered.
	   Russia's crucial participation in the multibillion-dollar
international space station has been hampered by the country's
financial problems. The launch of the first segment was postponed
repeatedly, mainly because of Russia's cash shortages.
	   Russian officials see taking part in the new station as the only
hope for survival for the embattled space program. The Khrunichev
company that built the module that went up Friday already has put
some of its earnings into the most pressing repairs of Baikonur's
ramshackle infrastructure.

Bobek, Weiss lead in short program at Lalique

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Americans Nicole Bobek and Michael Weiss surprised
Russia's world and European champions by taking the lead in the
short programs at the Lalique Trophy competition Friday, one of the
skating Grand Prix series.
	   Bobek, who has had a up-and-down skating career lately, skated a
clean program to Flamenco music from the movie `Zorro.' That put
her in first ahead of Ukraine's Elena Liashenko, winner of Skate
Canada, and European champion Maria Butyrskaya, who beat Bobek at
Skate America.
	   Weiss, second in the U.S. championships to Todd Eldredge the
last two years, skated early and saw his lead hold up over world
champion Alexei Yagudin.
	   Bobek landed a superb triple lutz-double toe loop and a triple
toe loop. She received marks from 5.3 to a high of 5.8 and earned a
4-3 decision on judges over Liashenko, who also skated clean.
	   Bobek was the U.S. champion in 1995 but has had an checkered
career since. After her coach Carlo Fassi died at the 1997 world
championships, Bobek fell apart in the long program at Lausanne,
Switzerland.
	   She rebounded at the 1998 U.S. championships where she placed
third to Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski with talk of a U.S. sweep
at the Olympics.
	   However at Nagano she barely stood up in her short program and
long program and finished 17th.
	   ``I've had plenty of downs followed by ups,'' said Bobek. ``And
ups followed by downs''
	   ``Now it's time to tie the ups together,'' she her new coach
Richard Callahan, who trained Lipinski last year.
	   Weiss skated second in the men's short and had marks of 5.4 to
5.7 for his routine to Van Halen music. He included a triple
flip-triple toe loop as well as an optional triple axel, new to the
short program this year.
	   ``It is always hard to skate early and then watch the rest of
the skaters,'' Weiss said.
	   He plans a quadruple toe loop in the long program.
	   ``I have been doing it a lot lately and it feels good,'' Weiss
said.
	   He has just missed it in Skate America where he was second to
Yagudin.
	   Yagudin, who came into Lalique with four victories in four
events, faltered for the first time this year, barely holding his
triple axel and tacking on only a double toe loop. He had been
consistent this season landing a triple-triple easily.
	   Then he scaled down a triple lutz to a double and scored
technical marks in the 4.9 to 5.4 range. His presentation marks
were higher, up to 5.8 but Weiss took six of the seven judges,
losing only the Russian judge.
	   In the pairs, the French couple of Sarah Abitbol and Stephane
Bernadis took the short program edging Russia's former world
champions Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov.
	   All the top couples tried triple toe loop jumps and throw triple
moves with only slight mistakes separating them, such as Bushkov
putting a hand down to steady himself after a jump.
	   The long programs of all the events will be held on Saturday.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Italian court frees Kurdish rebel leader, enraging Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to ADD ruling voided Turkish arrest warrant
on grounds of law barring extradition in death penalty cases,
UPDATE with Italy saying Ocalan will be free man if no extradition
request received from Germany, promising to keep him under

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court on Friday set free a Kurdish rebel
leader detained when he came to Italy seeking asylum, drawing
immediate threats of retaliation against Italy from outraged
Turkish leaders.
	   The court threw out a Turkish arrest warrant for Abdullah Ocalan
under a law barring extradition in death penalty cases. Although
the court ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome, Justice Minister Oliviero
Diliberto said the rebel chief would be a totally free man on Dec.
23 if Germany chose not to pursue extradition on its own warrant
against him by then.
	   Hundreds of Ocalan's supporters danced in a Rome piazza at news
of his release from a military hospital, where he had been held
since his flight landed at Rome's international airport on Nov. 12.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told his people to stay
calm, saying, ``the Turkish government will resolve this
situation.''
	   ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish
state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' Yilmaz said
of Italian leaders. He did not specify what that price might be.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Ocalan, a fugitive overseas during much of the conflict, is on
trial in absentia on capital charges in Turkey, which had demanded
his extradition.
	   Yilmaz appealed to NATO for support in the clash between the two
NATO partners, describing as Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the
century.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright backed Turkey's stand
on Ocalan, telling a Washington news conference, ``It is very
important that he be brought to justice'' _ if not in Turkey, then
in Italy or Germany.
	   Ocalan has been wanted in Gerrmany on charges of terrorism since
1990. Germany, however, said it would not seek the extradition of
the rebel chief, at least not for now.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema promised Italy would keep Ocalan
under surveillance to ``guarantee that he can't carry out terrorist
activities or any hostile activities against Turkey.''
	   Ocalan asked the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to Rome to
show solidarity to return home and sustain the Kurdish cause
through legal and democratic means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior that might reflect
badly on the Kurdish people,'' Ocalan said in a statement read by a
spokesman.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated Turks, who
know him as the leader of terror bombings and guerrilla warfare.
Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy in
Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Families of soldiers killed in the Kurdish conflict urged the
government Friday to do everything necessary to bring ``this
murderer'' to Turkey.
	   ``The blood of our children and our husbands will not be left
unanswered,'' the families said in a statement.
	   Additionally, ``It is clear that we will review our economic and
trade relations with a government, which by keeping the murderer of
30,000 people and providing him haven, is becoming an accomplice to
his crimes,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said from Ankara.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''

President's son quits Parliament, warning of communist and racist

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The pro-American son of Guyana's
U.S.-born president resigned from Parliament Friday, saying the
governing party was led by geriatric communists and warning that
the country's racist politics will cause more turmoil.
	   Cheddi Jagan Jr. became a reluctant politician last year after
his father, then President Cheddi Jagan, died, and his mother, a
Chicago native who has lived in Guyana for half a century, won
disputed December 1997 elections.
	   On Friday, he quit.
	   ``I am resigning from the People's Progressive Party because I
have come to the conclusion that I can't in clear conscience hold a
party card which binds me to Marxism and Leninism and operates
under the principles of democratic centralism,'' Jagan, 49, told a
news conference.
	   He predicted more trouble unless the country's two major parties
work for racial harmony between Guyanese of East Indian and African
descent.
	   Guyana exploded in race riots and bombings earlier this year in
disputes over the election, which was won by Janet Jagan's East
Indian-supported People's Progressive Party.
	   This month government workers are threatening to call a general
strike in a dispute over the dismissal of a black customs officer.
Most labor leaders are black and support the opposition People's
National Congress.
	   The younger Jagan, a dentist who graduated from Howard
University in Washington D.C., has been an outspoken critic of the
party and of his parents, once hard-line Marxists who said they had
adopted more centrist views since communism collapsed a decade ago.
	   But Jagan said Friday that the party was led by ``fossils'' and
``geriatrics'' who maintain a Marxist-Leninist ideology. His mother
celebrated her 78th birthday last month.
	   Jagan Jr. repeated criticisms that their politics is preventing
Guyana from learning from the United States.
	   ``The U.S. is a place that works,'' he told reporters. ``I would
want us to emulate the U.S. because it works.''
	   Last year, Jagan suggested selling the inefficient state
electricity utility to a U.S. company for one dollar. That was
after he staged his own protest of frequent blackouts, by lying
down across the entrance to the utility office in Georgetown,
Guyana's capital.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An assassination attempt was made Friday on a
liberal lawmaker who plans to run for president in Russia's next
elections, a news report said.
	   Galina Starovoitova of the reformist party Democratic Russia was
attacked in an apartment building in St. Petersburg along with her
aide, the Interfax news agency reported. It gave no other details.
	   Starovoitova tried to run for president in the 1996 elections
but her registration was turned down for technical reasons. She has
said she will run again in 2000.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams carried out field
inspections Friday while Iraqis, relieved that the threat of U.S.
air strikes was over, flocked to outdoor markets, amusement parks
and picnic grounds.
	   The inspectors' working on the Muslim sabbath is a change of
policy. Traditionally they took Fridays off. But Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission that oversees
disarmament efforts, said teams would work seven days a week in the
future.
	   ``We want to get on with things and get as much done in as short
a period of time as possible,'' Cross said.
	   At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on
the edge of Baghdad. The inspectors refused to talk to reporters,
and Cross would not say where they were going.
	   But the Iraqi authorities said the inspectors had visited nine
sites, the official Iraqi News Agency reported late Friday.
	   The inspectors were believed to have checked the monitoring
equipment they had installed at these places before the recent
crisis.

Albright applauds Israeli troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Friday that she believed Israel and the Palestinians
would implement the latest peace accord after Israel had begun
withdrawing troops from the West Bank as outlined in the agreement.
	   Albright said in an interview with Israel television that she
had just spoken by phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
about the withdrawal, which was outlined in the land-for-security
agreement signed Oct. 23 at the White House.
	   Israel transferred 9.1 percent of the West Bank to full or
partial Palestinian control earlier in the day as part of the
three-phase pullback to be completed by the end of January.
	   ``I think that we need to see this in a positive way in the fact
that things are actually happening that people thought would not
happen,'' Albright said.
	   The secretary of state admonished Israeli and Palestinian
leaders against making provocative statements as they had earlier
in the week.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon had called on Jewish
settlers ``to move, to run, to grab more hills, expand the
territory'' in the West Bank to prevent the lands from being
transferred to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Monday that ``our rifles
are ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Both Sharon and Arafat later retracted or clarified their
statements.
	   ``I think there are examples of a few too much rhetoric,
frankly, from both sides,'' Albright told the television.
	   ``It's very important to look at the actions and the actions are
moving very much in a positive direction,'' she added.
	   The peace accord worked out at the Wye Plantation in Maryland
also details several Palestinian actions against anti-Israeli
militants and incitement.
	   The Israeli Cabinet approved Friday's withdrawal only after
verifying that the Palestinian Authority had begun to carry out
several of the security measures.
	   The Wye Memorandum effectively ended almost two years of
deadlock in the peace process, caused largely by anti-Israeli
attacks and Israeli demands for a tougher Palestinian stance
against Islamic militants.

Italian court frees Kurdish rebel leader, enraging Turkey

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court on Friday set free a Kurdish rebel
leader detained when he came to Italy seeking asylum, drawing
immediate threats of retaliation against Italy from outraged
Turkish leaders.
	   The court threw out a Turkish arrest warrant for Abdullah Ocalan
under a law barring extradition in death penalty cases. Although
the court ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome, Justice Minister Oliviero
Diliberto indicated the rebel chief would be freed from even that
restriction on Dec. 23 if Germany chose not to pursue extradition
on its own warrant against him by then.
	   Hundreds of Ocalan's supporters danced in a Rome piazza at news
of his release from a military hospital, where he had been held
since his flight landed at Rome's international airport on Nov. 12.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared: ``Italy risks
facing the eternal enmity of Turkey.''
	   ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish
state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' Yilmaz said
of Italian leaders. He did not specify what that price might be.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Ocalan, a fugitive overseas during much of the conflict, is on
trial in absentia on capital charges in Turkey, which had demanded
his extradition.
	   Yilmaz appealed to NATO for support in the clash between the two
NATO partners, describing as Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the
century.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright backed Turkey's stand
on Ocalan, telling a Washington news conference, ``It is very
important that he be brought to justice'' _ if not in Turkey, then
in Italy or Germany.
	   Ocalan has been wanted in Gerrmany on charges of terrorism since
1990. Germany, however, said it would not seek the extradition of
the rebel chief, at least not for now.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema promised Italy would keep Ocalan
under surveillance to ``guarantee that he can't carry out terrorist
activities or any hostile activities against Turkey.''
	   Ocalan asked the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to Rome to
show solidarity to return home and sustain the Kurdish cause
through legal and democratic means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior that might reflect
badly on the Kurdish people,'' Ocalan said in a statement read by a
spokesman.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated Turks, who
know him as the leader of terror bombings and guerrilla warfare.
Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy in
Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Families of soldiers killed in the Kurdish conflict urged the

Four reported killed in series of Israeli-guerrilla clashes

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked
suspected hideouts of guerrillas on Friday after a series of
clashes in southern Lebanon. Four guerrillas were reported killed.
	   In the first attack, guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Amal group
attacked Israeli and allied militia positions in the
Israeli-occupied zone at daybreak, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   Three guerrillas were killed in the assaults, an Israeli army
spokesman said in Jerusalem.
	   Amal claimed responsibility for the raids but said none of its
fighters was killed.
	   Shortly afterwards, two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface
missiles at targets between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, 14
miles southeast of Tyre, Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity. The strike was the 100th Israeli
air raid on southern Lebanon this year, the officials said.
	   Later, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group launched at least two
attacks on Israeli forces, including a roadside bomb detonated as
an Israeli infantry patrol passed near Sojod on the edge of the
occupied zone, Lebanese officials said.
	   In response, Israeli and allied militia artillery pounded the
Iqlim al-Tuffah area, a Hezbollah stronghold adjacent to the
Israeli-occupied zone.
	   In Jerusalem, a military spokesman said Israeli and militia
forces attacked two groups of guerrillas who were laying land mines
in the central and northeastern areas of the occupied zone.
	   In the northeastern clash, which occurred Friday evening, at
least one guerrilla was killed, the Israeli spokesman said.
	   In a statement issued in Beirut, Hezbollah did not mention any
losses, but said its fighters had inflicted ``heavy casualties'' on
the Israeli forces.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases almost
daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in Israeli
casualties.
	   The latest clashes come at a time of heightened tension in
southern Lebanon. On Monday, a roadside bomb planted by Hezbollah
killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others. The
casualties were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern
towns against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Three police officers suspended over death of Zairian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three French police officers were suspended Friday
pending the results of an investigation into the suspicious death
of a Zairian man who died during questioning earlier this month.
	   Sidney Manoka, a 25-year-old boxer who had been living for 14
years in France, was detained by police on Nov. 6 in Tourcoing,
northern France, after getting into an altercation with another
driver.
	   Two police officers demanded Manoka's papers, but he refused to
comply after which reiforcements were brought in. He was then
handcuffed and made to lie on the ground, according to police
records. Soon after he lost consciousness.
	   An autopsy later revealed that Manoka died of suffocation.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne announced the suspensions
in a statement.

	   Gourdine jumped 24 feet, 8 1/2 inches (7.4-meter) at the
Helsinki Games and finished second to fellow American Jerome
Biffle, an army private who came out of two-year retirement to win
in 24-10 (7.45-meters).
	   Gourdine's ex-wife, June Hubbard of Laurel, Maryland, said he
had been suffering from diabetes, and had lost his vision and one
leg.
	   He was undergoing twice-weekly dialysis treatments at the time
of his death, Hubbard said.
	   ``That man, he never gave up no matter what. When he was losing
his eyesight, when he lost the feeling in his hands,'' she said.
``He just kept on and on despite his disabilities.''
	   Meredith Gourdine Jr. of Houston said his father died at St.
Joseph's Hospital in Houston.

Marlins acquire Fabregas from Mets for Henriquez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Now that the Wayne Huizenga era is nearly over, the
Florida Marlins' payroll is on the rise.
	   Florida's catcher next season will be Miami native Jorge
Fabregas, who is in the final year of a two-year contract that will
pay him dlrs 1.85 million in 1999. The Marlins acquired him Friday
from the New York Mets for right-handed reliever Oscar Henriquez
and cash.
	   Gregg Zaun, who made dlrs 280,000 as Florida's starting catcher
last season, was designated for assignment Thursday.
	   The Marlins' payroll sank to dlrs 13 million by the end of the
season, but with the sale of the team to commodities broker John
Henry awaiting approval from baseball owners, a payroll of about
dlrs 24 million is planned for next year.
	   The Marlins are the fifth team in two years for Fabregas, 29, a
former Miami Hurricanes star.
	   The 28-year-old Fabregas, a left-handed hitter, has a career
average of .255, but an ankle injury limited his effectiveness and
playing time last season. He hit .199 in 50 games for expansion
Arizona and .188 in 20 games for the Mets.
	   Fabregas broke into the major leagues with the California Angels
in 1994 and was traded to the Chicago White Sox in May 1997. That
was his best year, when he hit .258 with seven homers and 51 RBIs
in 360 at-bats.
	   Henriquez, 24, was 0-0 with an 8.55 ERA in 15 relief appearances
with the Marlins this year. He struck out 19 in 20 innings but
allowed 26 hits and 22 runs. In addition, he was 1-0 with a 2.56
ERA and 11 saves at Triple-A Charlotte of the International League.

Bobek, Weiss lead in short program at Lalique
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with ice dance &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Americans Nicole Bobek and Michael Weiss surprised
Russia's world and European champions by taking the lead in the
short programs at the Lalique Trophy competition Friday, one of the
skating Grand Prix series.
	   French couples led in both the ice dance and pairs to
temporarily stop the Russian advance, who won all four titles at
last week's meet.
	   Bobek, who has had a up-and-down skating career lately, skated a
clean program to Flamenco music from the movie `Zorro.' That put
her in first ahead of Ukraine's Elena Liashenko, winner of Skate
Canada, and European champion Maria Butyrskaya, who beat Bobek at
Skate America.
	   Weiss, second in the U.S. championships to Todd Eldredge the
last two years, skated early and saw his lead hold up over world
champion Alexei Yagudin.
	   Bobek landed a superb triple lutz-double toe loop and a triple
toe loop. She received marks from 5.3 to a high of 5.8 and earned a
4-3 decision on judges over Liashenko, who also skated clean.
	   Bobek was the U.S. champion in 1995 but has had an checkered
career since. After her coach Carlo Fassi died at the 1997 world
championships, Bobek fell apart in the long program at Lausanne,
Switzerland.
	   She rebounded at the 1998 U.S. championships where she placed
third to Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski with talk of a U.S. sweep
at the Olympics.
	   However at Nagano she barely stood up in her short program and
long program and finished 17th.
	   ``I've had plenty of downs followed by ups,'' said Bobek. ``And
ups followed by downs''
	   ``Now it's time to tie the ups together,'' said new coach
Richard Callahan, who trained Lipinski last year.
	   Weiss skated second in the men's short and had marks of 5.4 to
5.7 for his routine to Van Halen music. He included a triple
flip-triple toe loop as well as an optional triple axel, new to the
short program this year.
	   ``It is always hard to skate early and then watch the rest of
the skaters,'' Weiss said.
	   He plans a quadruple toe loop in the long program.
	   ``I have been doing it a lot lately and it feels good,'' Weiss
said.
	   He has just missed it in Skate America where he was second to
Yagudin.
	   Yagudin, who came into Lalique with four victories in four
events, faltered for the first time this year, barely holding his
triple axel and tacking on only a double toe loop. He had been
consistent this season landing a triple-triple easily.
	   Then he scaled down a triple lutz to a double and scored
technical marks in the 4.9 to 5.4 range. His presentation marks
were higher, up to 5.8 but Weiss took six of the seven judges,
losing only the Russian judge.
	   Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France fell in the
original dance when he was swinging her around on a lift and lost
about .4 from each judge for their composition marks. That dropped
them down to the 5,1 to 5.4 range.
	   For presentation the marks were mostly 5.7 to 5.8s which held
them in first. The skated to the ``Masquerade'' Waltz.
	   The Italian couple of Barbara Fusar-Poli and Marizio Margaglio
came close but were not able to overtake them in the marks.
	   Despite the fall, the French team took six of seven judges over
the Italians.
	   In the pairs, the French couple of Sarah Abitbol and Stephane
Bernadis took the short program edging Russia's former world
champions Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov.
	   All the top couples tried triple toe loop jumps and throw triple
moves with only slight mistakes separating them, such as Bushkov
putting a hand down to steady himself after a jump.
	   The long programs of all the events will be held on Saturday.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Rennes slips in title race with 2-1 loss at PSG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Surprise early-season title challenger Rennes lost
ground on the league leaders Friday with a 2-1 defeat at Paris
Saint-Germain.
	   Eric Rabesandratana headed in a 38th minute corner to give PSG
the lead.
	   Third-placed Rennes, coached by former PSG centerback Paul Le
Guen, made it 1-1 in the 65th minute with a Shabani Nonda strike,
but Jerome Leroy secured the points for PSG within two minutes.
	   Rennes stays nine points off the top after the loss.
	   On Thursday, leader Marseille lost its unbeaten record, losing
2-0 at Lyon. Bordeaux closed the gap at the top to one point, with
a fine 2-0 win at Monaco.
	   With none of the other top teams in action, attention turned to
the fight to avoid relegation.
	   In a match between the two bottom teams, Lorient beat Toulouse
1-0.
	   Patrice Loko, bought from PSG earlier this week, scored in the
25th minute after a Lorient penalty had bounced off the post.
	   Toulouse's Ahmed Maharzi missed a crucial second half penalty.
	   Sochaux, which started two places off the bottom, had Bernard
Maraval and Didier Lang sent off in the first half, yet amazingly
salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Strasbourg.
	   Strasbourg scored in the 50th through Frederic Arpinon.
	   But the nine-man home side levelled in the 70th minute with a
Koffi Fiawoo goal.
	   The results leave Toulouse in last place with 11 points, behind
Lorient on goal difference.
	   Further up the standings, Nantes and Montpellier drew 1-1.
	   Montpellier defender Franck Silvestre scored with a 25-yard
(meter) free kick before Eric Decroix equalized for the Canaries.
	   Lens, preparing for a vital Champions League match at Arsenal on
Wednesday, scored a 1-0 win against a Bastia team reduced to nine
players for the last 20 minutes.
	   Michael Debeve scored with a 25-meter (yard) drive in the final
minute.
	   In other games: Auxerre 1, Metz 0; Nancy 1, Le Havre 0.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for
president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St.
Petersburg, a news report said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's

Maier falls, Eberharter wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second run &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Austria's Stefan Eberharter won a men's
World Cup giant slalom on Friday by doing something teammate
Hermann Maier couldn't _ finish.
	   Eberharter was standing at the bottom, having already posted a
time of 2 minutes, 14.75 seconds for two runs down the C.B.'s Run
course, when Maier charged out of the starting gate.
	   Maier, the Olympic and World Cup champion, led the first run by
.35 seconds over Eberharter and seemed well on his way to winning
his second race of the season in as many starts. But he hooked a
ski on a gate and skied off the course, giving victory to
Eberharter.
	   Maier, furious with himself, slammed down his skis and poles,
vaulted a plastic safety fence and charged away through the crowd.
Eberharter, meanwhile, showed little emotion, then bent down to
take off his skis.
	   Although Maier won the Olympic and World Cup GS titles, it is
now Eberharter who has the advantage in that discipline by winning
two of the last three races. He won the final GS of last season and
placed second to Maier in the season opener last month at Solden,
Austria.
	   Maier's crash allowed another teammate, Christian Mayer, to
claim second in 2:15.27. Marco Buechel of Liechtenstein, fifth
after the opening run, got third, his best-ever result, in 2:15.68.
He celebrated by pumping his fists in the air and flopping onto his
back in the snow.
	   Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, eighth after the morning session,
was fourth in 2:15.83 and Italy's Patrick Holzer rounded out the
top five in 2:15.98.
	   Jure Kosir of Slovenia, Siegfried Voglreiter of Austria, Bode
Miller of Franconia, New Hampshire, Lasse Kjus of Norway and
Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland completed the top 10.
	   Miller, an unknown when he surprised with an 11th-place finish
here a year ago, was seventh in the morning only to struggle a bit
in the afternoon. Yet he only dropped one spot and, with an eighth,
posted a career best.
	   Von Gruenigen, the 1996 and 1997 World Cup GS champ and second
to Maier last season, was only 22nd in the morning. The fastest
time of the afternoon, 1:07.18, vaulted him 12 places in the
standings.
	   Paul Casey Puckett of Boulder, Colorado, was 25th in 2:17.75 and
Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, New York, was 27th in 2:19.19.
	   Canada's Thomas Grandi, 17th in the morning, finished 14th in
2:16.87.

After Israeli withdrawal, Arafat one step closer to statehood

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Leaning out of jeep windows,
Palestinian policemen triumphantly hoisted assault rifles into the
air Friday and fired quick volleys to celebrate their takeover of
this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to town greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and
villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat control over an
additional 2 percent of the West Bank and upgraded his authority in
7 percent of the land. Most importantly, it took him one step
closer to his final goal _ statehood.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles, roughly the size of New York City's five boroughs.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   ``I think we need to see this in a positive way in the fact that
things are actually happening that people thought would not
happen,'' Albright told Israel television in an interview.
	   ``The actions are moving very much in a positive direction,''
Albright added.

UN receives responses to document request, but no documents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with UN receiving two letters in
response to request for documents, but no documents yet. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Iraq hasn't turned over documents detailing its
weapons of mass destruction, as demanded by the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, but did send two letters about the request Friday, U.N.
officials said.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, Gustavo Zlauvinen,
declined to describe the content of the letters from Iraq's deputy
foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi. ``We are studying them and we
are analyzing what we should do,'' he said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton specifically cited one of the
requested documents _ an air force log detailing munitions used
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ in his speech Sunday that
detailed what information Iraq must provide to avoid airstrikes.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler formally requested the log in a
letter Wednesday to Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Two other
letters asked for documents relating to biological weapons and
other programs.
	   His requests came after Iraq _ facing threatened U.S. and
British airstrikes _ pledged over the weekend to resume full
cooperation with Butler's U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which
is charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Baghdad severed all cooperation on Oct. 31.
	   The Security Council imposed sanctions in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, sparking the Gulf war. Sanctions can only be lifted
once inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles used to deliver
them.
	   The United States and Britain have said the military threat
remains to ensure that Baghdad cooperates fully.
	   Butler said Thursday that he would ``happily'' tell the Security
Council that he had accounted for all of Iraq's banned arms if
Baghdad provided the documents that answer questions about what
types of weapons of mass destruction Iraq produced and where the
weapons are now.
	   ``They are the history. They are the palpable record of what is
actually happened with some hideous and illegal weapons,'' Butler
told the Overseas Press Club.
	   Inspectors discovered the air force document in July but were
prevented from taking it.
	   The Iraqi responses to the first two of Butler's three requests
were received as inspectors returned to work for a third day.
	   Over the next week, Butler said, he will start compiling teams
who will go on unannounced searches of suspected weapons sites _
visits which have been the most confrontational but also have given
inspectors some of their best information over the past seven
years.
	   Butler said he planned to conduct the ``whole spectrum'' of
inspections before reporting back to the council on the level of
Iraq's cooperation in three to four weeks.
	   The council has said it would conduct a complete overview of
Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions once Butler has reported
that inspectors have received that cooperation.
	   Iraq hopes the so-called ``comprehensive review'' will lead to a
lifting of the eight-year-old U.N. oil embargo, which has
devastated its economy.
	   But U.N. and Western diplomats noted that the more Iraq
cooperates with inspectors in the short term _ by turning over
documents, for example _ the more it could actually hurt its
chances of having sanctions lifted if that cooperation reveals that
its arms programs have not been dismantled.
	   With more information, countries that take a harder line against
Baghdad, particularly the United States, would have that much more
ammunition to justify keeping sanctions in place until their stated
goal of ousting Saddam Hussein is met, the diplomats said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for
president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St.
Petersburg, a news report said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's
parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked
in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the
Interfax news agency reported. Linkov was seriously injured, it
said.
	   The report gave no other details.
	   A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment on the
report.
	   Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 1996
elections but her registration was turned down for technical
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues
and was on the human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet.
	   Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was
trained as a psychologist and later received a doctorate in
history. She was divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who
in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official was attacked earlier this
week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's
parliament speaker was shot in the head last month.

 &UR; Iraq calls UN request for documents provocative, lays out
conditions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraq calling request for documents provocative,
says portions of documents may only be viewed in presence of UN
envoy. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' on Friday and laid out conditions for arms
inspectors to see one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a
letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the
document in question was beyond the scope of UNSCOM's mandate.
	   Nevertheless, he wrote, UNSCOM experts can view ``relevant
portions'' of it in the presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in
Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   The document is an air force diary detailing munitions destroyed
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq. It was discovered during a July
weapons search.
	   UNSCOM spokesman Gustavo Zlauvinen said inspectors were studying
the response and were ``analyzing what we should do.''
	   A U.S. official said Washington was awaiting Butler's response.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton cited the document in his speech
Sunday that detailed what information Iraq must give inspectors if
it is to see sanctions lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which sparked the Gulf War, can only be lifted once inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons _ and the missiles used to deliver them.
	   Baghdad severed all cooperation with the inspectors on Oct. 31
and only resumed in the face of threats of a military strike. The
United States has warned that airstrikes are still an option if
Iraq reneges on its weekend promise to cooperate with the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged with dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Butler formally requested the diary in a letter Wednesday to
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Two other letters asked for
documents relating to biological weapons and other weapons issues.
	   ``The request you made at this time, which is of a general
nature, seems to be provocative rather than professional,''
al-Qaisi wrote. Some of the requested documents don't exist, others
have been destroyed, and yet others have already been requested and
whatever information available has been submitted, he wrote.
	   ``We hope that UNSCOM will discard this unprofessional approach
which would unjustifiably lead to the prolongation of work, and
thereby maintaining the inequitable embargo on the people of
Iraq,'' he wrote.
	   Iraq's deputy ambassador, Saeed Hassan, said Iraq was still
committed to cooperating with UNSCOM and said Iraq's willingness to
allow inspectors to view the air force document showed its
eagerness to do so.
	   ``What they want is full submission, and they will never, never
get it,'' he said. ``Full cooperation is different than full
submission.''
	   U.N. and Western diplomats have noted that the more Iraq
cooperates with inspectors in the short term _ by turning over
documents, for example _ the more it could actually hurt its
chances of having sanctions lifted if that cooperation reveals that
its arms programs have not been dismantled.
	   Countries that take a harder line against Baghdad, particularly
the United States, would have that much more ammunition to justify
keeping sanctions in place until their stated goals of ousting
Saddam Hussein is met, the diplomats said.

Israeli who allegedly wanted to attack premier brought to court

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli court on Friday extended by four
days the detention of an Israeli man suspected of planning to
attack Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Outside the magistrate's court in the northern town of Acre,
several ultra-Orthodox Jews chanted and read psalms to show support
for the suspect, Shabtai Bloch, 48, a member of the ultra-Orthodox
Chabad group.
	   Bloch allegedly plotted to attack Netanyahu during the prime
minister's visit to the town of Safed in northern Israel on
Thursday evening. Police gave no further details. Bloch's lawyer
told Israel radio that his client opposes violence.
	   Chabad members demonstrated against Netanyahu in Safed during
the visit, angry over last month's Israel-Palestinian agreement
that calls on Israel to hand over territory in the West Bank.
Israel radio said Bloch organized the protest.
	   At Chabad headquarters in New York, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a
spokesman for the movement, said ``Violence, even the threat of
violence, is anathema'' to Chabad.
	   Most Chabad members supported Netanyahu in Israel's 1996
election, but members now feel that Netanyahu has betrayed them by
agreeing to hand over West Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   On Friday, 7th pvs

	   Russia launched the first module of the International Space
Station, a propulsion unit, on Friday. Other components will be
sent up on dozens of trips over the next several years, but the
timeline is likely to change because of Russia's financial turmoil.
	   Representatives from the 16 nations taking part are scheduled to
meet early next month to settle on yet another assembly schedule.
Among the next major stages planned:
	   _1998 to mid-1999: The first U.S.-built component, Unity, or
Node-1, will be launched on Dec. 3 on the space shuttle Endeavour.
The Russian Service Module, the first Russian-built and
Russian-financed component is to be launched in July or August.
	   _Early 2000: Tentative arrival date of the first three-man crew,
two Russians and an American captain.
	   _Mid-2000: The U.S. laboratory module will be in place. A
portion of the Canadian mechanical arm is to arrive.
	   _Late 2001 to 2002: The Japanese laboratory module scheduled to
be sent up.
	   _2003: European laboratory module to be launched.
	   _2004: The International Space Station set to be completed.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A liberal lawmaker who planned to
run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death
Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's
parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked
the entry way of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor
found the body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an
ambulance, they said.
	   The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also
seriously injured.
	   Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 1996
elections but her registration was turned down for technical
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues
and was on the human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet.
	   Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was
trained as a psychologist and later received a doctorate in
history. She was divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who
in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official was attacked earlier this
week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's
parliament speaker was shot in the head last month.

Polish parliament begins NATO ratification debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament on Friday opened a debate on
ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty, a necessary legal step that
will allow Poland to join NATO next year.
	   The government-proposed resolution, which would authorize
President Aleksander Kwasniewski to ratify the 1949 treaty,
received support from all political parties in parliament.
	   Speaking to reporters during a break, Kwasniewski stressed that
all NATO membership plans receive support from all major political
forces in Poland.
	   ``This is a guarantee that our entry into NATO is based on
strong political agreement and widespread social backing,'' said
Kwasniewski.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, has been
invited to join NATO on the pact's 50th anniversary in April, but
Polish leaders and NATO officials have hinted the new nations could
become members even earlier.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister in the Solidarity-led
government, stressed that NATO expansion will mean an end to the
Cold War era division of Europe established by the Allied
Conference in Yalta at the end of World War II, which put eastern
Europe under Soviet domination.
	   Ever since toppling the communists in 1989, Solidarity has
pushed for integration with Western security and economic
structures.
	   Poland is also among six nations currently negotiating
membership terms with the European Union.

Denmark's crown prince to go on four-month expedition in Greenland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Crown Prince Frederik, the heir to
Denmark's throne, plans to take part in a 3,500-kilometer
(2,170-mile) dog-sled trek to mark the 50th anniversary of a Danish
navy unit that patrols along Greenland's northern fringe.
	   The trip, set for February 2000, is planned to set off from
Qaanaaq, 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the North Pole. The
crew will follow the coastline and are expected to arrive in June
in Ittoqqortoormiit, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northeast of the
Greenland capital of Nuuk.
	   The crown prince, 30, is a member of the navy's elite frogman
unit and has taken part in Arctic drills.
	   Frederik's personal secretary was quoted as telling newspapers
on Friday that the crown prince would take part in the expedition
on the same conditions as the others. ``He is part of the team,''
Per Thornit was quoted as saying by the Berlingske Tidende daily.
	   The six-person expedition will include three sleds, each
weighing about 450 kilograms (990 pounds) and pulled by a total of
42 dogs.
	   The trip is to commemorate the founding in 1950 of the Sirius
patrol, which monitors to northern fringes of the Danish territory.

Maier falls, Eberharter wins giant slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Austria's Stefan Eberharter won a men's
World Cup giant slalom on Friday by doing something teammate
Hermann Maier couldn't _ finish.
	   Eberharter was standing at the bottom, having already posted a
time of 2 minutes, 14.75 seconds for two runs down the C.B.'s Run
course, when Maier charged out of the starting gate.
	   Maier, the Olympic and World Cup champion, led the first run by
.35 seconds over Eberharter and seemed well on his way to winning
his second race of the season in as many starts. But he hooked a
ski on a gate and went off the course, giving victory to
Eberharter.
	   Maier, furious with himself, slammed down his skis and poles,
vaulted a plastic safety fence and charged away through the crowd.
Eberharter, meanwhile, showed little emotion, then bent down to
take off his skis.
	   ``If I am skiing the best I can, I will win a lot of races,''
Eberharter said. ``I was very happy with both of my runs today.
	   ``The snow conditions were perfect and I was skiing very well. I
knew I would at least make the podium'' for placing in the top
three.
	   But for a string of German expletives, Maier had nothing to say
as he bulled away.
	   Although Maier won the Olympic and World Cup GS titles, it is
now Eberharter who has the advantage in that discipline by winning
two of the last three races. He won the final GS of last season and
placed second to Maier in the season opener last month at Solden,
Austria.
	   Maier's crash allowed another teammate, Christian Mayer, to
claim second in 2:15.27. Marco Buechel of Liechtenstein, fifth
after the opening run, got third, his best-ever result, in 2:15.68.
He celebrated by pumping his fists in the air and flopping onto his
back in the snow.
	   ``I am very excited to put Liechtenstein on the podium,''
Buechel said. ``I skied my best race for a while.''
	   It was the second big result in as many days for the
postage-stamp-sized country in the middle of Europe. Birgit Heeb
was third in the women's GS on Thursday.
	   Mayer was a bit surprised to gain the second step on the podium.
	   ``I felt very good on the second run, but I knew Stefan and
Hermann still had to go. I am very excited that I skied well, but I
can do better.''
	   Mayer hurt himself with a morning run that left him .88 seconds
behind, a large margin in the micro-second world of ski racing.
	   Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, eighth after the morning session,
was fourth in 2:15.83 and Italy's Patrick Holzer rounded out the
top five in 2:15.98.
	   Jure Kosir of Slovenia, Siegfried Voglreiter of Austria, Bode
Miller of Franconia, New Hampshire, Lasse Kjus of Norway and
Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland completed the top 10.
	   Miller, an unknown when he surprised with an 11th-place finish
here a year ago, was seventh in the morning only to struggle a bit
in the afternoon. Yet he only dropped one spot and, with an eighth,
posted a career best.
	   Von Gruenigen, the 1996 and 1997 World Cup GS champ and second
to Maier last season, was only 22nd in the morning. The fastest
time of the afternoon, 1:07.18, vaulted him 12 places in the
standings.
	   Paul Casey Puckett of Boulder, Colorado was 25th in 2:17.75 and
Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, New York, was 27th in 2:19.19.
	   Canada's Thomas Grandi, 17th in the morning, finished 14th in
2:16.87.

New lawsuit filed against Pinochet in Chile

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A group of neighborhood organizations on
Friday became the latest party to file a lawsuit against Gen.
Augusto Pinochet. The group accuses him of involvement in the
deaths of 76 of its members during his regime.
	   The move by the Metropolitan Federation of Communal and
Neighboring Organizations raised to 14 the number of lawsuits
pending in Chile against the embattled 82-year-old former dictator.
	   The group's president, Jose Hidalgo, said 70 of the victims were
killed by police and military forces working to supress protests
against Pinochet during the 1980s. Hidalgo said the other six are
among the more than 1,000 suspected dissidents who are unaccounted
for following their arrests by the dictator's secret police force.
	   Thirteen lawsuits have been filed against Pinochet in recent
months by the relatives of victims of his 1973-90 military regime.
	   Pinochet is being held at a London hospital on a warrant by a
Spanish judge who wants to extradite him to face charges of
genocide and murder. His legal fate now rests with Britain's House
of Lords, which has set Nov. 25, Pinochet's 83rd birthday, to rule
whether he qualifies for state immunity.
	   The government insisted Friday that Pinochet should be allowed
to return to Chile immediately if the House of Lords rules in his
favor.
	   Upon his return, the former ruler is expected to face increased
pressure in the courts, despite his immunity to prosecution in
Chile as a senator-for-life and the further protection afforded him
by an amnesty law that his regime issued.
	   However, some of the crimes outlined in the 14 lawsuits occurred
after the 1973-78 period covered by the amnesty law.
	   On Friday, Chile's Catholic Church supported the growing demands
for justice in the human rights violations under Pinochet.
	   The nation's bishops said the most serious cases ``should be
thoroughly investigated and clarified.''
	   In a statement they called ``Hope and Reconciliation,'' the
bishops said the situation ``is especially painful'' for the
relatives of the dissidents still missing.

Albright applauds Israeli troop withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Friday that she believed Israel and the Palestinians would
implement the latest peace accord, noting that Israel had begun
withdrawing troops from the West Bank as outlined in the agreement.
	   Albright said in an interview with Israel television that she
had just spoken by phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
about the withdrawal, which was outlined in the land-for-security
agreement signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   Israel transferred 9.1 percent of the West Bank to full or
partial Palestinian control earlier in the day as part of a
three-phase pullback to be completed by the end of January. Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan in 1967.
	   ``I think that we need to see this in a positive way in the fact
that things are actually happening that people thought would not
happen,'' Albright said.
	   The secretary of state admonished Israeli and Palestinian
leaders against making provocative statements as they had earlier
in the week.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon had called on Jewish
settlers ``to move, to run, to grab more hills, expand the
territory'' in the West Bank to prevent the lands from being
transferred to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Monday that ``our rifles
are ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Both Sharon and Arafat later retracted or clarified their
statements.
	   Albright told the television that there was ``too much
rhetoric'' from both sides.
	   ``It's very important to look at the actions, and the actions
are moving very much in a positive direction,'' she added.
	   The peace accord worked out at the Wye Plantation in Maryland
also details several Palestinian actions against anti-Israeli
militants and incitement.
	   The Israeli Cabinet approved Friday's withdrawal only after
verifying that the Palestinian Authority had begun to carry out
several of the security measures.
	   The Wye Memorandum effectively ended almost two years of
deadlock in the peace process, caused largely by anti-Israeli
attacks and Israeli demands for a tougher Palestinian stance
against Islamic militants.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' on Friday and laid out conditions for arms
inspectors to see one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a
letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the
document in question was beyond the scope of the inspectors'
mandate.
	   Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N. experts can view ``relevant
portions'' of it in the presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in
Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   The document, discovered during a July weapons search, is an air
force diary detailing munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton mentioned it in his speech Sunday,
listing what information Iraq must hand over if it is to see
sanctions lifted.
	   The United States has warned that airstrikes are still an option
if Iraq reneges on its weekend promise to cooperate with the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged with dismantling
Iraq's weapons programs.
	   UNSCOM spokesman Gustavo Zlauvinen said inspectors were studying
Iraq's response and were ``analyzing what we should do.''
	   A U.S. official said Washington was awaiting Butler's response.
	   U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which sparked the Gulf War, can only be lifted once inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons _ and the missiles used to deliver them.
	   Baghdad severed all cooperation with the inspectors on Oct. 31
and only resumed in the face of threats of a military strike.
	    &UR; Butler formally ... PICKUP 10th graf pvs.

Report: Liberal lawmaker and presidential hopeful killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police not commenting on motive, background on
other attacks, more detail on her. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ An outspoken liberal lawmaker who
planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to
death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's
parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked
the entry way of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor
found the body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an
ambulance, they said.
	   The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also
seriously injured.
	   Police would not speculate on a motive for the killing.
	   Starovoitova, 52, was scheduled to attend a session of the
Northern Capital political movement Saturday, Interfax said.
	   Starovoitova tried to run for president in the 1996 elections
but her registration was turned down for technical reasons. She had
said she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in
1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle _ and was on the
human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. She was
elected to that body from Yerevan, Armenia, in 1988.
	   Starovoitova earned a reputation as one of the most outspoken
reform supporters among the members of the Russian parliament. In
1990 she won an unprecedented libel suit against Pravda when the
former official Soviet newspaper published a story accusing her of
calling for the forcible elimination of the government.
	   Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was
trained as a psychologist and later received a doctorate in
history. She was divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who
in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official's car was bombed last week
and a top banker was killed last week, and police attributed both
attacks to business deals. An aide to Russia's parliament speaker
was shot in the head last month in what police suspect was a
contract hit.
	   Contract killings are often used to settle business disputes in
Russia, and such hits have become increasingly widespread in recent
years.
	   It was unclear whether Starovoitova had any major business
dealings.

Estonian government says it opposes recovery of ferry victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonia's government said on Friday that
it opposes a Swedish proposal to recover bodies trapped inside the
wreck of the ferry Estonia.
	   The Estonia sank in international waters en route from Tallinn
to Stockholm, Sweden, in 1994, killing 852 people. Only 95 of the
bodies have been recovered, and relatives of many of the victims
say they cannot complete their mourning unless the bodies are
retrieved.
	   A panel appointed by the Swedish government recommended last
week that an effort be made to recover as many bodies as possible.
	   Estonian government spokesman Daniel Vaarik said the decision to
oppose the Swedish proposal took into account the overwhelming
opposition to the idea in Estonia.
	   ``Our decision is based on the opinions of the relatives of
victims, of religious leaders and opinion makers here,'' he said.
``There was very strong opposition everywhere.''
	   In an official statement, the Estonian government said it wanted
a 1995 agreement that declared the shipwreck a sanctuary to remain
in effect. Sweden, Finland and Estonia were all party to the
accord.
	   Estonian President Lennart Meri said the plan to retrieve the
bodies also runs counter to the seafaring traditions of Estonia.
	   ``The place where a person has had his life taken by the sea is
just as sacred as any graveyard next to a church,'' Meri told
journalists last week.
	   Most Estonian newspapers also denounced the plan.
	   The mother of Avo Piht, an off-duty ship captain who went down
with the ferry, said many family members would have supported a
plan to recover the bodies in the months after the accident.
	   ``But it wouldn't be right to do it now, over four years
later,'' Eesti Paeveleht quoted Meira Piht as saying. ``If they
raised the bodies of loved ones now, it wouldn't even be possible
to recognize them anymore.''

Britain seeks clarification on Zimbabwe farm seizures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Friday that it is seeking urgent
clarification of reports the Zimbabwe government has ordered
compulsory acquisition of 841 farms, most of them owned by white
farmers.
	   A farmers' group in Zimbabwe says the government in Harare has
begun issuing seizure orders in violation of a recent agreement to
postpone the acquisition for two years.
	   ``If the reports of the acquisition orders are true, we are
concerned it appears to run counter to the document agreed by
parties including the Zimbabwean government and (aid) donors at the
Land Conference in Harare in September,'' a Foreign Office
spokesman said.
	   ``Our high commissioner in Harare is seeking urgent
clarification of what it means,'' he said on customary terms of
anonymity.
	   Black families have illegally occupied farms around the
Zimbabwean capital in the past two weeks, complaining the country's
land reform program was taking too long.
	   One year ago, President Robert Mugabe's government released a
list of 1,471 white-owned farms it wanted to nationalize. The move
brought harsh international criticism and caused a severe economic
downturn.
	   At a conference with international donors in September, Zimbabwe
removed 512 farms from the list and made arrangements to buy 118
others.
	   The government agreed to wait two years before pursuing the
remaining 841 properties.
	   Western donors and international financial institutions are
concerned that the land seizure could disrupt food production and
bring further harm to the nation's crumbling economy.

After Israeli withdrawal, Arafat one step closer to statehood

	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Leaning out of jeep windows,
Palestinian policemen triumphantly hoisted assault rifles into the
air Friday and fired quick volleys to celebrate their takeover of
this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to town greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and
villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat control over an
additional 2 percent of the West Bank and upgraded his authority in
7 percent of the land. Most importantly, it took him one step
closer to his final goal _ statehood.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   ``I think we need to see this in a positive way in the fact that
things are actually happening that people thought would not
happen,'' Albright told Israel television in an interview.
	   ``The actions are moving very much in a positive direction,''
Albright added.

Report: Portugal asks U.N. to suspend E. Timor talks following
</HEADLINE>
report of massacre &QL; 
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal on Friday asked to temporarily
suspend its U.N.-brokered dialogue with Indonesia over East Timor,
following reports of a massacre in the disputed territory earlier
in the day, news reports said.
	   An unidentified diplomatic source quoted by the Portuguese news
agency Lusa said allegations of the massacre had prompted Portugal
to ask the U.N. envoy to East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, to stop the
talks until the United Nations can clear up what actually happened.
	   The source said that the alleged massacre involved a ``possibly
high'' number of civilians, Lusa reported.
	   Portuguese Foreign Ministry officials were not immediately
available for comment.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after invading the
half-island territory at the end of Portuguese colonial rule.
	   The United Nations, which still regards Portugal as the
legitimate authority in East Timor, is brokering talks between the
former colonial power and the Indonesians to resolve the dispute.
The territory is 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Indonesia's
capital, Jakarta.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
widespread abuses, such as killing 200 people by firing on
pro-independence protesters in the East Timorese capital Dili in
1991.
	   An East Timor resistance spokesman in Lisbon, Roque Rodrigues,
said his group was trying to contact sources in Dili to ``assess
the magnitude,'' of the latest alleged massacre.
	   Also Friday, military sources in Jakarta said the situation in
the East Timorese village of Alas was tense after a clash on
Tuesday between Indonesian soldiers and local rebels fighting for
independence.
	   After the resignation in May of the authoritarian President
Suharto, Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but it insisted on retaining control
of its defense, economic and foreign policies.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal.
	   Portugal provides a haven for East Timorese pro-independence
activists, and has insisted that a referendum be held in the
territory to decide its future.

Livent stock plunges after three-month trading halt ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Shares in Livent Inc. _ producer of ``Ragtime''
and other hit musicals _ plunged precipitously Friday when trading
in the troubled company resumed for the first time in three months.
	   Livent shares were valued at dlrs 10.15 on Aug. 7 when trading
was stopped on the Toronto Stock Exchange because of allegations of
widespread irregularities in the company's financial records.
	   The TSE is continuing the halt on its main exchange, but trading
did resume on an over-the-counter exchange called the Canadian
Dealing Network.
	   Within a half-hour, Livent shares plunged to below 30 cents as
investors liquidated their positions. The stock closed the day at
44 cents.
	   The cease-trade order on Livent stock was lifted by the Ontario
Securities Commission after the company announced Thursday it would
seek protection from its creditors in Canada under the Companies
Creditors' Arrangement Act.
	   The company made a similar legal move Wednesday in the United
States in an attempt to gain time to restructure of its operations.
	   Livent has been in disarray ever since its new principal owners
_ investment banker Roy Furman and former Walt Disney executive
Michael Ovitz _ revealed in August that an internal audit had
uncovered ``serious accounting irregularities.''
	   Livent's co-founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, were
suspended in August and fired on Wednesday. The new management also
filed a dlrs 225-million ( dlrs 146 million U.S.) lawsuit accusing
them of extensive fraud that cost Livent dlrs 97 million ( dlrs 63
million U.S.) over the last five years.
	   Among the accusations was a claim that Drabinsky and Gottlieb
pocketed dlrs 7.5 million (dlrs 5 million U.S.) in kickbacks.
	   The two men responded with countersuits, demanding dlrs 210
million (dlrs 136 million U.S.) in damages from Ovitz, Furman and
their associates.
	   Livent claims its net income in 1996, 1997 and the first quarter
of 1998 was actually dlrs 85.1 million ( dlrs 55 million U.S.) less
than reported while Drabinsky and Gottlieb were in charge.
	   On Thursday, Livent announced it had received dlrs 5 million
U.S. in short-term financing from its board of directors to pay
bills during its restructuring drive.
	   But the company said it would need a ``substantially larger''
infusion of cash by the end of the month for a successful
reorganization.
	   In October, Livent shelved plans for a 1,400-seat theater in
downtown Toronto. A month later, it abandoned a bid to build a
500-seat theater, restaurant and office complex in New York's Times
Square district.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' on Friday and laid out conditions for arms
inspectors to see one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a
letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the
document in question was beyond the scope of the inspectors'
mandate.
	   Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N. experts can view ``relevant
portions'' of it in the presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in
Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   The document, discovered during a July weapons search, is an air
force diary detailing munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton mentioned it in his speech Sunday,
listing what information Iraq must hand over if it is to see
sanctions lifted.
	   The United States has warned that airstrikes are still an option
if Iraq reneges on its weekend promise to cooperate with the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged with dismantling
Iraq's weapons programs.
	   A senior U.S. official in Washington said that the United States
was awaiting Butler's assessment and was looking at Baghdad's
response in light of its promise of full cooperation.
	   UNSCOM spokesman Gustavo Zlauvinen said inspectors were studying
Iraq's response and were ``analyzing what we should do.''

At nuclear talks, India complains about U.S. blacklist of

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India, angry that the United States has
blacklisted Indian companies as punishment for New Delhi's nuclear
tests, complained Friday to a top U.S. negotiator trying to
persuade it to sign a nuclear test ban treaty, officials said.
	   Washington this month named 40 Indian companies and 200
subsidiaries that will be denied access to U.S. dual-use
technology. India alleges that the U.S. move violated the World
Trade Organization's philosophy and rules.
	   India made its complaint after talks between U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Indian negotiator Jaswant
Singh that were aimed at nudging New Delhi to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   The talks began after India tested five nuclear devices in May,
provoking rival tests by Pakistan and bringing down international
economic sanctions against both countries.
	   Both sides acknowledged Friday that differences remain. In a
joint statement, they said they would meet again in New Delhi in
January.
	   The U.S. Commerce Department said the blacklist was meant to
clarify the responsibilities of U.S. exporters and help them comply
with the sanctions.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said that his
government has some doubts about the treaty but that New Delhi had
accepted the essence of the agreement by offering a unilateral
moratorium on nuclear testing.
	   The U.S. wants both India and Pakistan to sign the treaty and
take steps toward ending 50 years of hostility.
	   The test ban treaty must be signed and ratified by 44 countries
before it can go into effect.

O'Meara re-signs with IMG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Mark O'Meara, voted PGA Tour player of the year
Friday after becoming the oldest man to win two majors in one
season, has agreed to a new deal with International Management
Group, the agency said.
	   IMG has represented O'Meara since 1984, but the Masters and
British Open champion suggested three weeks ago that it may be time
for a new deal, even hinting that he might be ready for a change.
	   IMG did not disclose terms of the new agreement.
	   ``We have worked with Mark O'Meara for virtually all of his
professional career,'' said Alistair Johnston, head of IMG's golf
division. ``We have seen him progress to the top of the game now,
and we have the resources to ensure that Mark will continue to
maximize his opportunities at this stage of his career.''
	   O'Meara, 41, won the Masters in April and then the British Open
at Royal Birkdale. He also became the oldest player to win the
World Match Play Championship in England last month, where he beat
Tiger Woods 1-up in a 36-hole final.
	   He previously won the PGA of America player of the year, decided
by points. He won the Nicklaus Award on Friday, which is voted on
by the PGA Tour players.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the U.S. first lady, announced dlrs 14.2 million in additional
American disaster relief to the Dominican Republic on Friday and
defended tougher enforcement of immigration and deportation laws.
	   The money, coming on top of dlrs 35 million already pledged by
the United States, would pay for building materials, food, farm
tools and seeds as well as efforts to prevent disease and provide
clean water.
	   The Dominican Republic was devastated by Hurricane Georges in
September. Dominicans had been hoping the first lady's visit would
spur a new infusion of aid.
	   Mrs. Clinton was joined by Chicago Cubs baseball star Sammy Sosa
in his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris, where a New York City
agency is helping rebuild a hospital.
	   ``In times of disaster, we really find out what we are made of,
and the Dominican people have shown they are made of strong
stuff,'' Mrs. Clinton said after viewing the recovery work.
	   Sosa, recently named the National League's most valuable
baseball player, provided a pleasant distraction for Dominicans.
	   ``I want to share this triumph with you because God has given me
too much,'' Sosa said of his award.
	   Before arriving in the Dominican Republic, Mrs. Clinton visited
Central American nations hit hard last month by Hurricane Mitch.
She was to leave Saturday for Haiti.
	   Responding to questions at a forum in Santo Domingo Friday, Mrs.
Clinton said it was important to stringently enforce immigration
laws. ``The lack of enforcement could endanger the openness that
has been a hallmark of the U.S. immigration system,'' she said.
	   Some 800,000 Dominicans have legally emigrated to the United
States since the early 1980s, the U.S. Embassy here said. Most live
in New York City.
	   Mrs. Clinton also said the United States would not halt a
stepped-up program to deport foreign convicts but would ``consult
with the Dominican government to minimize the impact.''
	   The United States has infuriated Caribbean leaders by deporting
increasing numbers of criminals whom islanders blame for a surge in
violent crimes. The United States has deported 1,508 Dominican
inmates this year.
	   Mrs. Clinton had planned to visit the Dominican Republic in
September, but was pre-empted by Hurricane Georges, which killed at
least 283 Dominicans and left thousands homeless.

Tourist killer destroyed all key forensic evidence, police believe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The killer of Japanese tourist Kayo
Matsuzawa has covered their tracks so well they must have forensic
knowledge, police believe.
	   The decomposed and naked body of 29-year-old Kayo Matsuzawa was
found in a locked closet in a downtown office building Sept. 22.
Police said the body had been there for at least a week, and they
had to use dental records from Japan to identify the body.
	   Matsuzawa, who came from Yamagata in northern Japan, arrived in
New Zealand late last year for an extended holiday and was based in
Christchurch.
	   She checked into a backpackers' hostel on her arrival in
Auckland Sept. 11, paying a deposit for a room, where she put her
belongings.
	   Her body was found in a locked closet in a building only a few
hundred meters (yards) from the Queen Street Backpackers hostel.
	   Detectives now say the killer _ most likely a man _ had gone to
extraordinary lengths to dispose of evidence and throw police off
his trail.
	   They say Matsuzawa's killer stripped her naked and disposed of
her clothing and backpack, concealed her body so that by the time
it was found more than a week later, left very little, if any, DNA
evidence and killed her in a manner which left a forensic
pathologist unable to determine a cause of death.
	   The detective in charge of the inquiry, Kevin Baker, said,
``We're dealing with someone who's forensically aware,
undoubtedly.''
	   The inquiry team was attempting to build up a profile of the
killer.
	   ``We don't think it's a serial offender _ the modus operandi
hasn't shown up in other crimes _ but we can't rule anything out
completely.''
	   Baker said he had held back certain details of the case because
the killer was probably following police progress through the media
and he did not want to give anything away.
	   He said there had been no evidence that the killing was sexually
motivated and it was still not known where Matsuzawa was killed or
how she died.
	   This made it impossible for investigators to confidently draw up
a picture of the offender.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ An outspoken liberal lawmaker who
planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to
death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, one of the most prominent women members of
the lower house of Russia's parliament, was attacked in the entry
way of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor found the
body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance,
they said.
	   The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also
seriously injured. It said Starovoitova was in St. Petersburg to
attend a session of the Northern Capital political movement
Saturday.
	   A pistol and automatic rifle were found at the scene, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Police would not speculate on a motive for the killing.
	   Boris Yeltsin ordered the interior minister, the head of
Russia's main intelligence service and the prosecutor general to
take urgent measures to investigate the attack, Interfax quoted
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as saying. Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin was ordered to go to St. Petersburg
immediately.
	   Starovoitova, 52, of the reformist party Democratic Russia,
tried to run for president in 1996 but her registration was turned
down for technical reasons. She had said she would run again in
2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in
1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle _ and was on the
human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. She was
elected to that body from Yerevan, Armenia, in 1988.
	   Starovoitova earned a reputation as one of the most outspoken
reform supporters in the Russian parliament, where she frequently
sparred with hard-liners including ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
	   In 1990 she won an unprecedented libel suit against Pravda when
the former official Soviet newspaper published a story accusing her
of calling for the forcible elimination of the government.
	   Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was
trained as a psychologist and later received a doctorate in
history. She remarried earlier this year and had one son and a
grandson, according to a recent interview with the magazine Profil.
	   ``I'm an independent woman. I'm accustomed to earning my own
money, coming and going as I wish. When I don't feel like it, I
don't cook, I don't clean,'' she said in the interview, which
focused on her recent marriage.
	   Her husband, Andrei Volkov, said in the interview that when he
first saw Starovoitova on television he was impressed with her
eloquence and thought to himself: ``There are actually smart women
in our country?''
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official's car was bombed last week
and a top banker was killed last week, and police attributed both
attacks to business deals. An aide to Russia's parliament speaker
was shot in the head last month in what police suspect was a
contract hit.
	   Contract killings are often used to settle business disputes in
Russia, and such hits have become increasingly widespread in recent
years.
	   It was unclear whether Starovoitova had any major business
dealings, though she led a relatively modest lifestyle compared to
many fellow lawmakers. She said in the Profil interview that most
of her money was in Russian banks that have frozen accounts because
of the country's latest economic troubles.

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Two top officials
in Gov. Roy Schneider's lame-duck administration have resigned.
	   Dean Luke, the territory's commissioner of property and
procurement announced his resignation Thursday and Friday was his
last day on the job.
	   Earlier in the week, Dr. Jose Poblete, the commissioner of
health, announced his resignation but did not give a date.
	   Two others have been fired by the governor, who lost the general
election this month. Eddie Donoghue, the Education Department's
public relations director, said he was fired and would challenge
the dismissal in court, contending it was politically motivated.
	   And William Quetel, director of the Small Business Development
Agency, said he received a letter of immediate dismissal on
Wednesday.

Portugal suspends talks with U.N. and Indonesia over E. Timor

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal on Friday suspended a New York
meeting with the United Nations and Indonesia over East Timor,
following intelligence reports of a massacre in the disputed
territory, officials said Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told Portuguese negotiators to
suspend a meeting scheduled for Friday between the U.N., Portugal
and Indonesia because of information received from East Timorese
sources about an alleged massacre of civilians, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Horacio Cesar said.
	   At the negotiating table was a U.N. proposal to grant a broad
autonomy for the half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200
miles) from the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
	   The number of casualties, the site and the exact date of this
week's alleged massacre in the former Portuguese colony were not
immediately clear, Cesar said.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General's personal envoy to East Timor,
Jamsheed Marker, was to meet the Portuguese and Indonesian
negotiators Saturday in New York to brief them on the U.N.'s
attempt to verify the reports, he added.
	   A U.N. spokesman in New York, Manuel de Almeida, said by phone,
``There is a pause (in the talks), while the U.N. verifies this
information.''
	   Also Friday, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres sent Annan a
message expressing Portugal's ``apprehension and condemnation,
should the reports of a new massacre of the East Timorese people be
confirmed,'' the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Hopes for a solution to the East Timor dispute were raised by
the resignation of Indonesia's strongman President Suharto in May,
but have since been dampened by the failure of his successor,
President B.J. Habibie, to fulfill promises to reduce Indonesian
military presence.
	   Earlier Friday, military sources in the Indonesian capital
Jakarta said the situation in the East Timor village of Alas was
tense, following a clash Tuesday between Indonesian soldiers and
rebels who are waging a low intensity guerrilla war in favor of
independence.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after invading the
Southeast Asian territory during a civil war that broke out at the
end of Portuguese colonial rule.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
widespread abuses, such as firing on pro-independence protesters in
the East Timorese capital Dili in 1991 killing 200 people.
	   An East Timor resistance spokesman in Lisbon, Roque Rodrigues,
said his group was trying to contact sources in Dili to ``assess
the magnitude,'' of the latest alleged massacre.
	   Indonesia has proposed granting some degree of autonomy to East
Timor, but Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence activists
rejected the proposal, insisting that a referendum be held.
	   The U.N. still regards Portugal as the legal authority in East
Timor. Portugal has asked for a permanent U.N. mission to be opened
in East Timor, but the Indonesian government has rejected the idea.

Hull files lawsuit against Toronto Sun, Moscow Times
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELLEVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ Former ice hockey star Bobby Hull has
filed a lawsuit against a Moscow newspaper and the Toronto Sun for
stories that quoted Hull making racial slurs and praising Adolf
Hitler.
	   The suit was filed Friday in Hull's hometown.
	   On Aug. 25, the English-language Moscow Times quoted Hull as
saying ``Hitler had some good ideas, he just went a little bit too
far.''
	   The story also said Hull made remarks about the black population
in the United States and suggested the Nazis' plan to build a
master race was not entirely flawed.
	   The Toronto Sun picked up on the story the following day with
the headline ``Hockey Legend Shoots Off Mouth.''
	   ``He's suing for libel and slander, he's suing for malicious and
injurious falsehood. He's also claiming for punitive damages,''
Hull's lawyer Tim Danson said Friday in Toronto.
	   ``Witnesses to the interview have confirmed to me what Bobby
Hull has always said, that it's not just what he said but the way
in which he said it; that his demeanor, tone of voice, facial
expression communicated nothing but contempt and hatred for Adolf
Hitler.''
	   A call to the Toronto Sun's legal counsel was not immediately
returned. A person answering the telephone at The Moscow Times on
Friday said no one was in the office who could comment.
	   Hull, 59, led the National Hockey League in goals scored for
seven season while playing with the Chicago Blackhawks and won the
Hart Trophy as the league's MVP twice. The Golden Jet, as he is
known, was among the players who launched the World Hockey
Association.
	   He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983 and is a
member of the Order of Canada.
	   Hull makes his living as a cattle rancher and by marketing his
name and reputation.
	   ``It has had (a) devastating impact on him both personally and
financially in his business and he's been left with no
alternative,'' said Danson. ``He asked for retractions and
apologies, it didn't come, so he's been very much forced into
this.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' on Friday and laid out conditions for arms
inspectors to see one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a
letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the
document in question was beyond the scope of the inspectors'
mandate.
	   Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N. experts can view ``relevant
portions'' of it in the presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in
Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   The document, discovered during a July weapons search, is an air
force diary detailing munitions used during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war.

O'Meara wins player of the year; Irwin sweeps Senior awards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. AUGUSTINE, Florida (AP) _ Mark O'Meara will have to make
room on the mantle for another trophy he never imagined winning at
age 41.
	   O'Meara, the oldest man to ever win two majors in the same year,
on Friday won the Jack Nicklaus Award over David Duval as the PGA
Tour player of the year.
	   ``Wow,'' he said upon accepting the award at the World Golf
Village. ``I never would have dreamed that when I was 41 years of
age I would be ... accepting the player of the year award. A lot of
people probably would have thought that at the age I was, maybe it
wasn't possible. It just goes to show you golf is a game for
everyone.''
	   That wasn't the case on the Senior PGA Tour, where Hale Irwin
made it a clean sweep after the greatest season ever on the
50-and-over circuit. Irwin also won the Nicklaus award, voted on by
the players, as well Arnold Palmer and Byron Nelson awards for
leading the money list and having the lowest scoring average.
	   Bob Burns was the Nike Tour player of the year.
	   The comeback player of the year award went to Scott Verplank on
the PGA Tour and Jim Colbert on the Senior Tour. Steve Flesch won
the PGA Tour rookies of the year, while Joe Inman won that award on
the Senior Tour.
	   Sam Snead was awarded the PGA Lifetime Achievement Award.
	   O'Meara capped off a 1998 season that few thought imaginable at
the start of the year, when the PGA Tour looked like it would be
dominated by the youth of Duval, Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard and
Ernie Els.
	   He won the Masters with birdies on three of the last four holes,
then won the British Open at Royal Birkdale in a playoff over Brian
Watts.
	   ``I do take a few moments to glance at the claret jug and the
Masters trophy,'' he said. ``Who would have ever thought this would
happen to Mark O'Meara? I'm very thankful for what's happened in
1998.
	   O'Meara didn't win the most tournaments _ Duval won four times
and a record dlrs 2,591,031 _ but he won the most important ones.
He became only the third player to win two majors in a year this
decade, and he had a chance to become the first player since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three majors at the PGA Championship, where he
tied for fourth.
	   The Nicklaus Award had been the source of great debate in the
past month. Was it O'Meara and his two majors, or Duval and his
four victories, 69.13 scoring average and record earnings?
	   The voting wasn't released, but most players had said that two
majors is difficult to overlook. That O'Meara won the award Friday
was not terribly surprising _ nor was the manner in which he
accepted the award.
	   This time, he didn't raise both arms over his head to celebrate
another remarkable accomplishment. He simply rose from the table
and walked straight to Duval for a handshake and then a hug, a
gracious gesture by one of the classiest players in golf.
	   ``That's just Mark,'' Duval said. ``I would expect no less.''
	   Duval didn't walk away empty-handed, having won the money title
and had the lowest scoring average on tour.
	   ``Those weren't given to me,'' Duval said when asked if the
Palmer and Nelson awards were any consolidation. ``I earned
those.''
	   Duval became the first player since Greg Norman in 1990 to win
the money and scoring titles but not the player of the year. He
also became only the second player to win four PGA Tour events but
not the Nicklaus award _ Phil Mickelson in 1996 was the other _
since it began in 1990.
	   Irwin won seven times and set a Senior Tour record with a 68.59
scoring average. He finished with dlrs 2,861,945, the most money a
professional golfer has ever won in one year.
	   ``No doubt, I've played some of the best golf of my career,''
said Irwin, a three-time U.S. Open champion.
	   For Flesch, it was his first victory of the year. He became the
first PGA Tour rookie of the year to win the award without winning
an event. He finished 35th on the money list. Inman finished 26th
on the money list and also won once.
	   Verplank didn't win, either. But after three elbow surgeries
since 1991 and a continuing battle against diabetes, the former
U.S. Amateur champion had a record year with dlrs 1.2 million and
finished 18th on the money list.
	   Colbert, a two-time Senior Tour player of the year, recovered
from prostate cancer and won for the first time in two years.

massacre report &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's government on Friday
suspended a meeting with U.N. and Indonesian officials over East
Timor, following intelligence reports of a massacre in the disputed
territory.
	   Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told Portuguese negotiators to
suspend the Friday meeting in New York due to information from East
Timorese sources about an alleged massacre of civilians, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said.
	   At stake is a U.N. proposal to grant broad autonomy for the
half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of the
Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976,
a year after invading it when Portuguese colonial rule ended. The
U.N. still regards Portugal as the legal authority in East Timor.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
widespread abuses, such as killing 200 people by firing on
pro-independence protesters in the East Timorese capital Dili in
1991.
	   The number of casualties, location and date of this week's
alleged massacre in the former Portuguese colony were not
immediately clear, Cesar said.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal envoy to East
Timor, Jamsheed Marker, was to meet Portuguese and Indonesian
negotiators Saturday in New York to brief them on efforts to verify
the reports, he added.
	   A U.N. spokesman in New York, Manuel de Almeida, said by
telephone that there was ``a pause'' in the talks while the United
Nations tried to verify the information.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres sent Annan a message expressing
Portugal's ``apprehension and condemnation'' should the reports of
a new massacre prove true, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   Earlier Friday, military sources in Jakarta said the situation
in the East Timorese village of Alas was tense after a clash on
Tuesday between Indonesian soldiers and local rebels fighting for
independence.
	   After the resignation in May of the authoritarian President
Suharto, Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to
East Timor and its 800,000 people, but it insisted on retaining
control of its defense, economic and foreign policies.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal.
	   Portugal provides a haven for East Timorese pro-independence
activists, and has insisted that a referendum be held in the
territory to decide its future.

Tourist killer destroyed all key forensic evidence, police believe

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The killer of Japanese tourist Kayo
Matsuzawa destroyed key evidence of the crime and must have had
expert forensic knowledge, police believe.
	   The decomposed and naked body of 29-year-old Kayo Matsuzawa was
found in a locked closet in a downtown office building Sept. 22.
Police said the body had been there for at least a week, and they
had to use dental records from Japan to identify the body.
	   Matsuzawa, who came from Yamagata in northern Japan, arrived in
New Zealand late last year for an extended holiday and was based in
Christchurch.
	   She checked into a backpackers' hostel on her arrival in
Auckland Sept. 11, paying a deposit for a room, where she put her
belongings.
	   Her body was found in a locked closet in a building only a few
hundred meters (yards) from the Queen Street Backpackers hostel.
	   Detectives now say the killer _ most likely a man _ had gone to
extraordinary lengths to dispose of evidence and throw police off
his trail.
	   They say Matsuzawa's assailant stripped her naked, disposed of
her clothing and backpack, and killed her in a manner which left a
forensic pathologist unable to determine a cause of death.
	   ``We're dealing with someone who's forensically aware,
undoubtedly,'' said Kevin Baker, the detective in charge of the the
inquiry.
	   The inquiry team was attempting to build up a profile of the
killer.
	   ``We don't think it's a serial offender _ the modus operandi
hasn't shown up in other crimes _ but we can't rule anything out
completely.''
	   Baker said he had held back certain details of the case because
the killer was probably following police progress through the media
and he did not want to give anything away.
	   He said there had been no evidence that the killing was sexually
motivated and it was still not known where Matsuzawa was killed or
how she died.
	   This made it impossible for investigators to confidently draw up
a picture of the offender.

Maier falls, Eberharter wins giant slalom

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Ice beat Fire.
	   Stefan Eberharter, a cool, calm, introspective Austrian, won a
men's World Cup giant slalom on Friday when his bombastic teammate
cum rock star, Hermann Maier, crashed out while leading.
	   Eberharter was standing at the bottom, having already posted a
time of 2 minutes, 14.75 seconds for two precise runs down the
C.B.'s Run course, when Maier charged out of the starting gate.
	   Maier, the Olympic and World Cup champion, seemingly banged
every gate in taking the first-run lead by .35 seconds over
Eberharter. Maier was well on his way to winning his second race of
the season in as many starts, only to hook a ski on a gate and skid
off the course, giving victory to Eberharter.
	   Maier, furious with himself, slammed down his skis and poles,
vaulted a plastic safety fence and charged away through the crowd.
Eberharter, meanwhile, showed little emotion, then bent down to
take off his skis.
	   ``I didn't get a chance to speak with Hermann,'' Eberharter
deadpanned. ``He, uh, left the finish area.''
	   Last year, as Maier hung up 10 victories in rolling to the World
Cup overall, giant slalom and super-G titles, Eberharter was often
a lone voice insisting that Maier wasn't unbeatable. He said it
again Friday.
	   ``I say it all the time; he is not unbeatable,'' Eberharter
said. ``Today I had the better hand.
	   ``If I am skiing the best I can, I will win a lot of races,''
Eberharter said. ``I was very happy with both of my runs today. The
snow conditions were perfect, and I was skiing very well. I knew I
would at least make the podium'' for placing in the top three.
	   But for a string of German profanities, Maier had nothing to say
as he bulled away.
	   Although Maier won the Olympic and World Cup GS titles, it is
now Eberharter who has the advantage in that discipline by winning
two of the last three races. He won the final GS of last season and
placed second to Maier in the season opener last month at Solden,
Austria.
	   Maier's crash allowed another teammate, Christian Mayer, to
claim second in 2:15.27. Marco Buechel of Liechtenstein, fifth
after the opening run, got third, his best-ever result, in 2:15.68.
He celebrated by pumping his fists in the air and flopping onto his
back in the snow.
	   ``I am very excited to put Liechtenstein on the podium,''
Buechel said. ``I skied my best race for a while.''
	   It was the second big result in as many days for the
postage-stamp-sized country in the middle of Europe. Birgit Heeb
was third in the women's GS on Thursday.
	   Mayer was a bit surprised to gain the second step on the podium.
	   ``I felt very good on the second run, but I knew Stefan and
Hermann still had to go. I am very excited that I skied well, but I
can do better.''
	   Mayer hurt himself with a morning run that left him .88 seconds
behind, a large margin in the micro-second world of ski racing.
	   Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, eighth after the morning session,
was fourth in 2:15.83 and Italy's Patrick Holzer rounded out the
top five in 2:15.98.
	   Jure Kosir of Slovenia, Siegfried Voglreiter of Austria, Bode
Miller of Franconia, New Hampshire, Lasse Kjus of Norway and
Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland completed the top 10.
	   Miller, an unknown when he surprised with an 11th-place finish
at Park City a year ago, was seventh in the morning only to
struggle a bit in the afternoon. Yet he only dropped one spot and,
with an eighth, posted a career best.
	   Von Gruenigen, the 1996 and 1997 World Cup GS champ and second
to Maier last season, was only 22nd in the morning. The fastest
time of the afternoon, 1:07.18, vaulted him 12 places in the
standings.
	   Paul Casey Puckett of Boulder, Colorado was 25th in 2:17.75 and
Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, New York was 27th in 2:19.19.
	   Canada's Thomas Grandi, 17th in the morning, finished 14th in
2:16.87.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian policemen triumphantly
hoisted rifles into the air Friday and fired quick volleys to
celebrate their takeover of this West Bank farming town after
Israel's troop pullback. Israel's departure from Qabatieh and 35
other small towns and villages gave Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat control over an additional 2 percent of the West Bank and
upgraded his authority in 7 percent of the land. Most importantly,
it took him one step closer to his final goal _ statehood. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the Israeli
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' on Friday and laid out conditions for arms
inspectors to see one of the more contentious items. Iraq's deputy
foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a letter to chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler that the document in question was
beyond the scope of the inspectors' mandate. Nevertheless, he
wrote, U.N. experts can view ``relevant portions'' of it in the
presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah. The
document, discovered during a July weapons search, is an air force
diary detailing munitions used during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
The United States has warned that airstrikes are still an option if
Iraq reneges on its weekend promise to cooperate with the U.N.
weapons inspectors. (UN-IRAQ)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's government on Friday
suspended a meeting with U.N. and Indonesian officials over East
Timor, following intelligence reports of a massacre in the disputed
territory. Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told Portuguese negotiators
to suspend the Friday meeting in New York due to information from
East Timorese sources about an alleged massacre of civilians,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said. At stake is a U.N.
proposal to grant broad autonomy for the half-island territory
1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of the Indonesian capital,
Jakarta. Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after
invading it when Portuguese colonial rule ended.
(PORTUGAL-INDONESIA)
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister suspended
civil rights Friday in a southern province and ordered the army to
quell violence in the port city of Karachi, where 1,000 people have
died in factional fighting. Nawaz Sharif called in the army in the
Sindh province to aid the government and set up military courts in
the port city of Karachi to try those behind the factional
violence. These courts will decide cases within days, not weeks and
months, he said. Sharif accused the Muttahida Qami Movement (MQM),
of most of the bloodletting in Karachi including last month's
murder of former governor Hakim Said _ a charge denied by the MQM,
which speaks for the rights of Urdu speaking people who migrated
from India at independence from Britain in 1947 and their
descendants. (PAKISTAN-MILITARY COURTS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Breaking from their solidly pro-impeachment
counterparts on the House Judiciary Committee, two Republican
congressmen said Friday they will vote against removing President
Clinton from office and believe more Republican lawmakers will join
them. Rep. John Edward Porter estimated that as many as 50
Republicans in the House might not support impeachment if it
reached the floor. Another anti-impeachment Republican lawmaker,
Peter King of New York, put the number at 15 to 40. With polls
showing a large marjority of the public opposed to impeachment, the
White House is content for the time-being to wait for an overture
to put the issue to rest short of a vote to remove Clinton from
office. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The stock market's dramatic rebound from its
summer selloff was extended Friday, led by rising bank and
financial services stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed
103.50, or by 1.1 percent, to close at 9,159.55, reaching its
highest level since July 21. The Dow is now 178.42 points, or less
than 2 percent, below the record 9,337.97 set July 17. (US-CLOSING

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With a dlrs 206 billion tobacco deal winning
unanimous support from the states, the industry said Friday it will
sign the biggest U.S. civil settlement Monday. ``It's a great day
for attorneys general,'' said Christine Gregoire, attorney general
for the state of Washington and the leader of the state
negotiators. The deal is designed to resolve remaining state claims
for health costs of treating sick smokers. Gregoire led a team of
eight states through five months of negotiations with four big
tobacco companies. The settlement calls for companies to make
payments to 46 states over 25 years and finance antismoking
programs in exchange for resolving remaining state claims for the
cost of treating sick smokers. (US-TOBACCO DEAL)
	   PARSIPPANY, New Jersey (AP) _ Cendant Corp. is selling its
consumer software business to French media company Havas SA for
dlrs 1 billion to help raise money as the franchising and marketing
company recovers from a massive accounting fraud. Under the deal
announced Friday, Havas will gain entertainment and educational
software sold under names such as Knowledge Adventure, Blizzard
Entertainment, Davidson and Associates and Sierra On-Line.
Paris-based Havas is a subsidiary of Vivendi SA, a French utility
and communications company. Cendant, which owns brand names such as
Ramada, Avis and Century 21, is shedding businesses following years
of acquisitions, seeking to raise cash and boost its stock price by
focusing on its main businesses. (US-CENDANT-SOFTWARE SALE)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Siding with European central bankers,
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that the
success of Europe's single currency, the euro, depends on the
credibility of the new central bank that will watch over it.
Pointing to the German mark, Greenspan said its strength was based
on the reputation of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. ``If
the European Central Bank fails to inherit the reputation'' of the
Bundesbank, then the euro could be ``undercut,'' Greenspan said via
a video link from Washington to a banking conference in Frankfurt.
But he also said ``I have considerable confidence that the advent
of the euro will be a successful one.'' (GERMANY-GREENSPAN)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is in danger of becoming an oil importer
after years of being one of the world's largest oil producers, a
top official was reported as saying Friday. First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is in charge of economic policy, said
oil production has been falling for the past 10 years and urgent
action was needed to reverse the decline, according to the Interfax
news agency. Oil is Russia's largest source of export earnings.
(RUSSIA-OIL)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission said
Friday it will support a U.S. proposal aimed at resolving the
banana trade dispute through the World Trade Organization if
Washington lifts a related threat to impose sanctions against the
15-nation EU. The EU executive Commission said it will support an
accelerated WTO dispute settlement procedure for the banana dispute
if the United States lifts a threat to impose 100 percent duties on
a range of EU imports. The U.S. threat was in response to a new EU
banana import system that the U.S. administration claims is in
violation of WTO rules and unfairly favors imports from former
European colonies. (EU-US-BANANAS)

Albanian opposition launches protest on eve of constitution vote

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Defying a ban on election-eve
campaigning, the opposition planned a mass protest this weekend
while police braced for unrest ahead of a referendum on Albania's
first post-communist constitution.
	   Police sharpshooters watched the capital's streets from rooftops
and sandbags fortified government buildings amid fears the
opposition would foment violence to intimidate voters into staying
home Sunday.
	   The opposition Democratic Party is urging a nationwide boycott
of the referendum, with hopes of forcing new elections if low
turnout reveals weak support for the ruling Socialists and their
draft constitution.
	   The Democrats pledged to gather as many as 50,000 people in
downtown Tirana Saturday in violation of laws prohibiting
campaigning 48 hours before the vote.
	   In another wink at the ban, reflecting the intensity of the
campaign, nationally known musicians planned to stage a concert in
Tirana Saturday night in thinly veiled support of the government.
	   Western officials, who maintain that a constitution is a
necessary cornerstore for democracy, urged Albanians to vote en
masse.
	   Albania and Belarus are the only two European countries without
constitutions.
	   ``Western nations are very, very strongly calling for a massive
participation in the referendum Sunday,'' Daan Everts, the
ambassador for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, said Friday.
	   ``But there is a lot of intimidation tactics and wild
disinformation. Voter turnout is uncertain. If people don't vote
for whatever reason, it will be hard to assess support'' for the
draft.
	   The constitution, drafted after a year of talks with European
constitutional experts, would outline private property rights and
give Albanians the right to legally change their religion and
identify themselves as a member of an ethnic minority.
	   The Democratic Party calls those clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
says they will encourage citizens to turn away from Islam, the
national religion, hoping to emigrate to richer, non-Muslim
European countries.
	   Observers say the boycott gives the proposal certain victory,
since the Socialists scrapped a 50 percent turnout requirement and
only a simple majority is required for passage.
	   Nonetheless, Everts said low turnout could undermine the
authority of the government, already rocked by rioting in Tirana in
September and the recent resignation of Fatos Nano as prime
minister.
	   An estimated 25 percent of eligible voters will automatically be
considered abstentions as they live abroad, mostly in neighboring
Greece, and will not be able to vote.
	   Participation in national elections since the fall of Albania's
isolated communist regime in 1991 has ranged between 60 percent and
70 percent. But Westerners say many may fear approaching polling
booths Sunday.
	   Observers say the boycott allows easy identification of
government supporters, particularly in the remoter regions and
towns of Albania often ruled by the force of guns.

Christo and Jeanne-Claude achieve 30-year-old dream

	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ It hardly compares with the grandeur
of Germany's Reichstag or the scale of the Miami coastline, but for
artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude the wrapping of 163 trees in a
stately Swiss park is a 30-year-old dream come true.
	   In their their latest feat of a long career, the
husband-and-wife double act have draped 55,000 square meters
(461,000 square feet) of woven silver-gray polyester fabric and 23
kilometers (14 miles) of rope over the cherry, oak, plum and
chestnut trees that grace the grounds of Riehen's Beyeler museum.
	   ``Our works of art have no purpose, no function, no utility,''
declares Jeanne-Claude proudly. ``They are just works of art.''
	   The ``Wrapped Trees'' exhibition, which opened to the public
Nov. 21 and lasts for 10 weeks, is expected to attract about
500,000 visitors and submerge this affluent suburb of Basel in
international fame.
	   The display coincides with a ``Magic of Trees'' exhibition of
some 120 works including Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Marc
Chagall and Paul Cezanne inside the museum, home to one of the
world's largest private collections of modern art.
	   Christo and Jeanne-Claude devised the concept after studying
gardeners draping fabric on trees against winter snow and frost in
Japan, but were rejected in previous attempts to realize it.
	   The Saint Louis Museum of Art in Missouri and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York turned them down in the 1960s. Paris nixed a
1969 bid to wrap the 330 trees along the Champs Elysees.
	   ``After 33 years of effort with this idea which came out of our
hearts and heads, we are finally doing it,'' says Jeanne-Claude,
her red hair flaming against the bitter gray cold.
	   At a presentation of the project, Jeanne-Claude does most of the
talking, although it is her husband who invariably grabs most of
the headlines.
	   The couple, both born June 13, 1935, have been married and
worked as an inseparable team for 40 years. He came from a family
of wealthy Bulgarian industrialists and she was born into a French
military family. Both are now U.S. citizens.
	   Their projects have included draping a million square feet of
fabric over the Sydney coastline, hanging a massive valley curtain
over Rifle Gap in Colorado and surrounding 11 small islands in
Miami's Biscayne Bay with ``floating skirts'' of bright pink
polypropylene.
	   In 1995 they grabbed the global imagination with the sensational
wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin. This involved 100,000 square
meters (1 million square feet) of fabric and 200 tons of steel.
	   Future dreams _ erecting 15,000 steel gates draped with fabric
in New York's Central Park and wrapping the Arkansas river in
Colorado _ are still mired in bureaucratic obstacles and concern
about the environmental impact.
	   To underline their ecological credentials, Christo and
Jeanne-Claude have invited Greenpeace and World Wide Fund for
Nature to stage projects highlighting the plight of the Brazilian
rain forest at their exhibition.
	   The couple waited until the leaves fell before starting. The
wraps will be removed in January so as not to interfere with
budding.
	   The material will then be shredded and recycled as the lining
for mattresses.
	   ``So that people can sleep comfortably,'' says Jeanne-Claude.
``And dream about wrapped trees.''
	   Beat Privat, head of administration at the museum, says he
expects up to 20,000 art-lovers on a typical weekend day. The
museum can cope with at most 3,000 visitors at a time.
	   ``People can still look at the trees from outside the museum
gates,'' Privat says.
	   Such is the interest that the museum's phone system routinely
collapses under the deluge of inquiries, including a sudden flood
from the United States.
	   The advice to foreign tourists is to book in advance and as part
of an air and hotel package.
	   For those who do get to see the exhibit, the effort is worth it,
especially when rare rays of sun transform the almost ghostly gray
silhouettes into a shimmering show of light.
	   In contrast to most of the other projects where nearly all the
design work was done in advance, it was impossible to shape the
form of the trees beforehand, said Christo.
	   ``That's the exciting thing about this project,'' he says.

Red tape may bar many from registering to vote in South Africa

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Standing in lines that snake
through Home Affairs offices, South Africans are fighting red tape
for the right to vote next year.
	   At the main office here Friday, several would-be voters lost the
battle with bureaucracy, sent home because they lacked the proper
documents or the correct number of photos.
	   Post-apartheid South Africa is approaching a sobering milestone
in its infant democracy. The government's ambitious plan is to
create the first national voters roll by registering 25 million
people in just three days _ next Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
	   To register, people must use bar-coded identity books introduced
in 1986 to gradually replace the older versions, which remain valid
for other purposes. Therein lies the problem.
	   Up to 5.6 million voters _ or over 20 percent of the electorate
_ lack the documents, according to a public opinion poll released
earlier this month.
	   Given the long lines and confusion over the process, it is
unlikely that many of them will have the proper ID _ or a special
receipt saying they applied for one _ by Friday.
	   The problems with bar-coded ID books could have political
consequences. Fewer whites _ the bulwark support of opposition
parties _ have the proper documents than blacks, which could mean a
boon for the governing African National Congress.
	   It's a far cry from the nation's first euphoric ballot in 1994,
when voters only needed to show up on election day with any
identity document, at any polling place. Registration was scrapped
to reduce tensions before the historic vote.
	   The problems involved in providing proper identity books to so
many people _ many of them poor blacks who can ill afford repeated
trips through officialdom _ demonstrate the difficulties this
country has in its transition to full-fledged democracy.
	   Requiring the bar-coded IDs to register was the brainchild of
the Independent Electoral Commission, which has since tried to
reverse the plan after learning about Home Affairs' backlogs.
	   But the ANC government believes the backlogs are not that bad,
and has stuck by the idea, inviting criticism that it wants to
exclude white voters.
	   More than 80 percent of blacks have the bar-coded documents,
compared to 65 percent of whites.
	   It was more in the interest of blacks to obtain them. As
apartheid was falling and the ``homeland'' system for blacks was
dismantled, many of them rushed to obtain the universal bar-coded
ID to replace their apartheid-era documents.
	   ``The only sinister thing is that the ANC, knowing they are
benefiting from people having bar-coded IDs, are not willing to
reconsider allowing other documentation,'' Anneke Greyling of
Markinor told The Associated Press.
	   Record numbers of people are queuing for new IDs, up 60 percent
over last year, said Home Affairs spokesman Manafe Makewla.
	   That doesn't mean they get them.
	   A dejected Edwin Rasekwere, 40, who is black, was told at the
Home Affairs window he needed a birth certificate from a
magistrate's court.
	   ``Maybe I'm going to spend the whole day there,'' he said.
	   Gary Gilmore, 46, a white South African, was turned away because
he didn't have enough photographs.
	   ``So now I have to decide if I want to come back into this
queue,'' he said. ``And that will depend on my workload next
week.''
	   Budgetary constraints forced the election commission to cut back
16 registration days to only three, but even that appeared
threatened by a shortfall of 220 million rand (dlrs 39 million) to
pay registrars.
	   The government agreed last week to supply 70,000 civil servants.
	   ``The truth of the matter is that right from beginning we said
we are in the business of enfranchising people, not
disenfranchising them,'' said commission spokesman Victor Dlamini.
``But there are obvious constraints and it is very expensive.''

	   NAHAL OZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ There was no fanfare, no
Palestinian officials making speeches. Just a few relatives who
heard the news on the radio turned out to greet Palestinian
prisoners at this crossing from Israel into the Gaza Strip.
	   Dozens of prisoners freed from Israeli jails, some clutching
bags, silently passed the Israeli and Palestinian checkpoint.
	   Most of those freed Friday under the new Mideast peace agreement
were common criminals, despite demands by the Palestinian Authority
that all those released be Palestinians who had served long terms
for fighting Israeli occupation.
	   ``This is a big trick,'' said Amni Shaban, 47, who waited _ in
vain _ for her husband, who was sentenced to life in jail for
anti-Israeli activities. ``We weren't waiting for those kinds of
criminals,'' she said, pointing at the returnees.
	   In all, 250 prisoners were freed Friday, including 150 criminals
such as car thieves and drug dealers. Several had only a short time
left on their sentences or were workers caught in Israel without
permits.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat suggested that Israel broke
its promise. ``Today, we would have loved to see Israel implement
the agreement with the prisoners. Unfortunately, Israel spoiled
this,'' he said.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, the Palestinian Authority official in charge
of negotiating prisoner releases, was more direct.
	   ``It's a shame and a defeat for the Palestinian people,'' said
Abdel Razek, who himself spent 19 years in Israeli custody for
trying to throw a grenade at Israeli soldiers. The grenade blew up
prematurely, burning parts of Abdel Razek's face.
	   Abdel Razek stayed home Friday, leaving the welcome at Nahal Oz
to relatives and Palestinian policemen who jotted down names and
checked them against their lists.
	   Still, there were joyful moments. Near the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a Palestinian woman in a gray robe held a stick high
above her hand and burst into the traditional Dabke folk dance when
she spotted a convoy of buses carrying prisoners.
	   At Nahal Oz, Palestinian TV cameraman Mahmoud Obeid was filming
the arrival of the prisoners when suddenly he dropped his camera _
his brother Ahmed, whom he had not seen in nearly a dozen years,
was among the silent men approaching.
	   Obeid ran to his brother and they hugged and kissed each other.
He had gotten no advance word that his brother was to be among
those released Friday.
	   Despite the reunion, Ahmed, 36, who served 11 years of a life
sentence for participating in a clash with Israeli soldiers near
the Jordanian border, had mixed feelings.
	   ``I am very sad because all of my colleagues, the heroes, are
still inside while they are releasing thieves,'' he said, crying
and wiping his eyes as his brother stood next to him.

	   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) _ The 24-ton Russian core of the
international space station cruised above the Earth on Saturday,
its first full day in orbit after a flawless launch, and settled in
to wait for an American companion module.
	   To the cheers of space officials from 16 nations taking part in
the unprecedented project, Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module
lifted off Friday into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles)
above Earth from Baikonur launching pad in the wind-swept steppe of
northern Kazakstan.
	   Zarya is to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the
project, providing propulsion, power and communications. It will
fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the U.S. space
shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the
Unity connecting module.
	   The Proton booster rocket carrying Zarya soared into the cloudy
sky, and its huge roar reverberated for dozens of miles across the
empty plain. Space official said the launch was successful.
	   The launch _ a year later than planned _ ushers in a new era of
cooperation among former space-race rivals. Space officials
expressed optimism that cooperation would further promote world
stability following the end of the Cold War.
	   ``We still have some contradictions, we still have combat
missiles aimed at each other, but the predominant trend is the
state of cooperation and doing things together,'' said Yuri
Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company.
	   U.S. astronaut Michael Foale, a veteran of the Russian Mir space
station, who watched the launch, said: ``During the Cold War era,
the countries were launching individually as much as they could to
show the rest of the world what they could do. This day is the day
when countries were working together to show what the world can
do.''
	   The heads of the space agencies of the participating nations
watched the liftoff from about seven kilometers (four miles) away.
At the launch site, Russian Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had
prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning
by the highly toxic rocket fuel.
	   The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to
Russia's beleaguered Mir, is due to be completed by 2004. It will
not be inhabitable until at least early 2000, following the launch
of a Russian-made crew module which is set to blast off next July
or August.
	   Russian and U.S. officials, who will jointly control the Zarya
from Moscow and Houston, said the successful launch was just the
first step to getting the massive space station working.
	   ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space
walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual
respect ... the international space station is going to be a
reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after
the launch. NASA broadcast the launch live via its satellite TV
system.
	   Goldin's Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch was a
vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry.
	   ``The Russian space industry is alive and well,'' he said.
	   Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the
country's financial problems, which also contributed to the delay
of Zarya's launch.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will
serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for
at least 15 years.
	   Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.

A charming city celebrating its 750th birthday

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Peace Palace is aptly named.
Surrounded by manicured gardens and fenced off from the surrounding
neighborhood, the cathedral-like building oozes calm.
	   Even when international lawyers are engaged in what amounts to
frenzied battle before the World Court in the palace's Great Hall
of Justice, voices are rarely raised. Politeness is paramount.
	   The Peace Palace symbolizes The Hague as a whole _ diplomatic,
generally tranquil and slightly withdrawn.
	   This city, celebrating its 750th birthday this year, offers an
oasis of calm to visitors to the Netherlands who prefer tiptoeing
through The Hague's tulips to enduring the bustle of the bohemian
capital, Amsterdam.
	   Just an hour's train ride from the capital, The Hague _ home to
the Netherlands' parliament and royal family _ often feels a world
away.
	   In the spring, you can stretch the journey there by taking the
train through the vividly colored tulip fields and stopping off at
the Keukenhof, the world's largest bulb garden.
	   A short drive or taxi ride away, you'll find the dunes and
beaches of the churning North Sea. Be sure to bring along a sweater
and an umbrella. If you require sunshine with your sand, you're
better off in the Netherlands Antilles than in rainy Holland.
	   Students from nearby Leiden University, the Netherlands' oldest
and most prestigious school, give guided tours around the Peace
Palace, home to the International Court of Justice (better known as
the World Court.) If the 15-judge panel is hearing a case, you can
even sit in for a taste of international political intrigue.
	   A 15-minute walk away, along one of The Hague's many tree-lined
avenues, the legal proceedings are less sedate. At the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, U.N. judges hear cases against those accused of
atrocities committed during the recent wars in the former
Yugoslavia. The curious are welcome to watch there, too, but be
forewarned: It's no place for the fainthearted.
	   Helping resolve international disputes made The Hague famous. In
1899, it hosted the first international peace conference, and it's
the future home of the new permanent International Criminal Court.
	   But this city of 440,000 people has much more to offer visitors,
notably an ever-evolving architectural heritage and a treasure
trove for art lovers.
	   Just around the corner from the war crimes court is The Hague
Municipal Museum, home to the world's largest collection of
paintings by Dutch-born abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian. It also
features works by Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh.
	   The building itself, designed in 1935 by Dutch architect Hendrik
Berlage, is considered part of the museum's collection. The museum,
fresh from a two-year renovation and showing off the newly acquired
``Victory Boogie Woogie'' by Mondrian, reopens to the public late
this month.
	   The Dutch art trail continues in a 17th century downtown mansion
next to the houses of parliament.
	   The Mauritshuis museum houses some of the highlights of Dutch
Golden Age painting in elegant high-ceilinged rooms overlooking
parliament and an ornamental lake which runs along one side of the
main parliament building. It boasts 16 paintings by Rembrandt and
works by other Dutch masters including Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals
and Jan Steen.
	   Next year, the museum plays host to a blockbuster exhibition of
self-portraits by Rembrandt, including 45 paintings, a dozen
sketches and over 30 etchings. The exhibition debuts in London's
National Gallery before moving to The Hague in September 1999.
	   The Hague, meanwhile, is promoting itself as a work of art.
	   With a downtown once described as resembling plates of uneaten
food piled on top of each other, the city has been spending
billions of dollars on a facelift _ some say a total makeover. It's
an attempt to right the many architectural wrongs suffered during
attempts to repair areas devastated by heavy bombardments during
World War II.
	   The jewel in the crown of The Hague's ``New Center'' is the
gleaming atrium of the town hall, library and records office
designed by U.S. architect Richard Meier. It features dizzying
aerial walkways and a clinical all-white color scheme.
	   Meier reportedly protested when the municipality tried to add a
splash of color to the austere interior of the 350 million guilder
(dlrs 175 million), 11-story building, saying the walls could be
any color the city wanted _ as long as they were white.
	   ``Castalia,'' blending engineering ingenuity and the Dutch
passion for recycling, is a former office block that was stripped
to its concrete shell and then rebuilt inside and out to provide a
new home for the Dutch Health Ministry.
	   There are walking routes that pick their way around the muddy
building sites that still litter the city to reveal the multitude
of building styles that make up The Hague. The walks can be
followed with a guide or _ more cheaply _ by buying a printed
booklet and map.
	   One commentator called the redevelopment ``a dressing on the
wound of an injured city.'' But local architect Jan de Graaf says
that's a good reason to take a look.
	   ``Cities like Amsterdam can become almost museums,'' he says.
``People should be able to see cities where it all went right, but
also bits where it went wrong.''

Split leadership of Spanish Socialist party reach unity deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The two men competing to lead Spain's
opposition Socialist party reached an agreement late Friday aimed
at restoring the unity the party enjoyed under Felipe Gonzalez.
	   The deal between the party's secretary-general Joaquin Almunia
and its candidate for prime minister Josep Borrell was announced by
Socialist spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, National Spanish Radio
reported.
	   The party, which governed Spain for 14 consecutive years under
Gonzalez, has been troubled by confusion and division over ever
since losing the 1996 general elections to the conservative Popular
Party.
	   Over the past month the chronic problems have developed into an
open struggle for the leadership between Almunia and Borrell, both
of whom believed they held a mandate to be party chief.
	   Rubalcaba told reporters, waiting for news of the negotiations
called to seek an end to the leadership crisis, that a solution had
been found mediated by regional party bosses, the radio reported.
	   He said the deal reflected the ``generosity'' and
responsibility'' of the two leaders, but declined to give further
details until it was discussed by the party's Federal Committee of
200 delegates due to meet Saturday, the radio said.
	   Gonzalez doubled as premier and secretary-general throughout the
Socialist's years in government between 1982 and 1996.
	   After losing the 1996 elections, Almunia was voted in to replace
Gonzalez as secretary general when he stepped down at a party
congress later that year.
	   But in 1997 the succession scheme was upset when Almunia
unexpectedly lost to Borrell when the party's rank and file voted
on who should be candidate for premier.
	   Over the following months conflicts began to emerge in the
two-pronged leadership, with supporters of Borrell, who is seen as
the more dynamic and progressive of the two leaders, complaining
that his mandate as candidate was being sidelined. Almunia's
backers retorted that the party required an agenda free of personal
political ambition.
	   Observers believe the Socialists have little chance of regaining
office in the next general elections, scheduled for 2000, as long
has they lack a single unified leadership.

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: The Hague is a one-hour train ride from
Amsterdam. A full-fare, round-trip adult ticket from the capital
costs about 28 guilders (dlrs 16). The Hague also is easily
accessible by train from the nearby cities of Rotterdam and
Utrecht. To ride through the blooming tulip fields in spring, take
the train from Amsterdam via Haarlem. The Keukenhof gardens, open
from March 25 through May 19 in 1999, can be reached by bus from
either Haarlem or Leiden station.
	   TOURS: Information on guided tours or printed tour guides and
maps can be obtained from The Hague Visitors and Convention Bureau
at (31-70) 361-8814 or from Wils and Co. Architecture Platform at
(31-70) 362-5948. For details of Peace Palace tours, call the
Carnegie Foundation at (31-70) 302-4137.
	   HOTELS: All major hotel chains are present in The Hague, but
they can be expensive, and budget accommodations can be hard to
find. The seaside suburb of Scheveningen, a short tram ride from
the center, has many cheaper hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns.
	   RESTAURANTS: There are plenty of eateries downtown, particularly
clustered around the central square (Plein) outside the houses of
parliament. For a taste of Dutch colonial past, try an Indonesian
rice table _ a selection of small but spicy dishes served with rice
and noodles. Restaurants tend to close their kitchens early in the
Netherlands, so don't plan on dining too late in the evening.
	   WEATHER: The Netherlands has a maritime climate with few
temperature extremes, but it gets its fair share of rain. The
average summer temperature is 67 degrees F (20 C); in winter,
temperatures average 37 F (3 C). Come prepared for rain _ even in
the summer _ and don't forget your umbrella.

A tour of a traditional country jam farm

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GIREMOUTIERS, France (AP) _ The ancient stone farm house seems
to spring out of nowhere as the traveler emerges from a winding,
pasture-lined road.
	   The only advertisement for the delicious jam ahead is a crooked
sign at the front gate of the ``Ferme de Corbeville.''
	   But the success of Corinne and Antoine Heusele's homemade jam
and jellies has nothing to do with ads.
	   Word-of-mouth has introduced their products to more than 20
specialty shops and markets in the suburban areas around Paris.
	   Buying one of their white-topped jars with the purple-script
label at the market is fine, but to really experience the jam, you
have to meet its maker.
	   When I rang the large bell hanging above the front door, a
little boy appeared around one corner of the house, a dog started
barking, and Mrs. Heusele came out of a side passage to greet me.
	   Immediately, she pushed open a heavy door leading into a dim,
above-ground cellar. Her creations line the shelves of a wooden
hutch: Green tomato and onion are the eye-catchers.
	   ``The tomato is very popular with the English,'' Mrs. Heusele
said. ``And the onion is often used here in France to accompany
pate.''
	   But if your tastes are more traditional, she also has
strawberry, peach, cherry, pear, apricot, raspberry, blueberry,
apple, plum ... the list goes on.
	   In fact, the selection often has to do with the French climate.
Sometimes that can mean lots of one type of fruit and hardly any of
another. Local farmers donate their surplus fruit to the Heuseles
each year and the summer months are a time of mass production.
	   Last year, the couple produced 11,000 jars of jam and won the
Public's Prize at France's ``Days of Patrimony'' celebration.
	   The venture began seven years ago in an effort to save fruit.
The region's Bureau of Agriculture announced a surplus, and that
inspired Mrs. Heusele. She wanted to leave her marketing job to
spend more time with her children, so that seemed to be the perfect
opportunity, she said.
	   Her husband already produced cider on their farm.
	   Since that time, Mrs. Heusele has worked to perfect the art of
jam-making. Fresh fruit is essential, she said.
	   ``Each fruit contains of course pectin and acid,'' Mrs. Heusele
explained. ``The pectin and acid are what cause the jam to come
together. Using damaged fruit doesn't produce the best result
because the fruit has lost most of its pectin.''
	   Her laboratory is in a former stable, connected to the
farmhouse. Her equipment: two enormous heating pots and a machine
that dispenses the finished jam into the jars.
	   The process begins with the important step of weighing, because
the cooker can hold only 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of fruit at a
time. This is followed by about 20 minutes of heating at exactly
104 degrees (219.2 degrees Farenheit.) Mrs. Heusele stirs the
mixture continuously and adds sugar.
	   Fifty percent sugar and 50 percent fruit is her formula for
success _ and the ratio that keeps her product accredited by an
association (Produits et Terroirs) that recognizes food produced
``the old-fashioned way.''
	   ``The cooking time for the jams is very delicate,'' said Mrs.
Heusele. ``They can be ruined almost instantly if heated too
long.''
	   The hot jam is poured into jars, sealed by hand and turned
upside-down, which begins pasteurization.
	   ``If unopened, the jam will keep for three years,'' Mrs. Heusele
said. ``We haven't had the chance to keep it on our shelves that
long because it sells too quickly.''
	   A taste sampling at the end of my tour explained why.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IF YOU GO: The Ferme de Corbeville is located in Giremoutiers,
about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Paris. It is open year-round
Monday through Friday, 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 p.m. to 7
p.m. by appointment only. Jams of all flavors are on sale for about
dlrs 3.50 (20 francs) a jar. Telephone: 01.64.03.21.82.

Nicaragua declares health emergency due to Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODOLFO GARCIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The government declared a health
emergency Friday in much of the hurricane-devastated northern part
of Nicaragua, due to heightened fears of disease.
	   The declaration by Nicaragua's health minister, Marta McCoy,
comes a day after the director of the Pan American Heath
Organization warned that the situation in Central America was
``grave'' due to Hurricane Mitch.
	   Doctors from the United States, Cuba, Japan, France and other
nations are traveling to Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras to help
the impoverished nations cope with the aftermath of a storm that
officials say killed about 10,000 people.
	   Health Minister Marta McCoy complained that some Nicaraguan
doctors have balked at her agency's attempt to coordinate health
treatment _ apparently referring to a medical union affiliated with
the leftist Sandinista Front. The party has accused the
conservative government of mishandling disaster response and
allotting aid for political reasons.
	   ``This is not the moment to seek political arguments,'' she
said.
	   Her ministry announced on Thursday that at least seven people
had died from what is suspected to be leptospirosis _ a disease
picked up from water contaminated by infected animals. The illness
can cause kidney and liver damage.
	   At least 68 suspected cases of leptospirosis have been detected
in Chinandega _ the region in which a volcano's storm-swollen
crater lake collapsed early this month, causing a landslide that
killed hundreds of people.
	   The agency also reported 17,000 cases of acute diarrhea, 39,000
of respiratory infections, 554 of dengue fever and 459 of malaria.
	   There were at least 190 confirmed cases of mosquito-borne
cholera _ 115 of them in the capital, which was affected by the
flooding of Lake Managua.

	   SANTA FE, New Mexico (AP) _ You can spend a small fortune
visiting Santa Fe. Or not.
	   While an elegant downtown hotel suite, a four-star restaurant
and a dlrs 2,000 silver-studded souvenir concha belt might have
cachet, you don't _ as they say _ have to go there.
	   For starters, the best things about this town are free: the
brilliant sunshine _ about 300 days of it a year _ the dazzlingly
blue sky, the clear air, the mountain views, the sense that you're
someplace different.
	   It's a great place to walk, people-watch, window-shop,
gallery-hop or just sit on a park bench under a tree _ and nobody's
figured out how to charge for those yet.
	   ``Frequently we hear that people are turned off about Santa Fe
because they have a perception it's very, very expensive,'' says
Holly Kenney, general manager of the moderately priced El Rey Inn.
	   The little city of 60,000 remains one of the United States' most
popular travel destinations, ranked third this year by Conde Nast
Traveler magazine readers.
	   Fall is a good time to visit. Many hotels lower their rates _ at
least until the December holiday season _ and the exotic scent of
burning pinyon logs is already in the air.
	   Downtown Santa Fe, anchored by the Plaza, is the most historic,
scenic, tourist-oriented part of town. A budget-minded traveler,
then, must stop a few miles (kilometers) short of it when searching
for lodging.
	   Many of the more affordable motels are on Cerrillos Road, a main
artery into the city from the Interstate 25 highway that resembles
any other commercial strip.
	   Some of them have banded together to advertise, and provide a
central number to call for budget lodging.
	   ``We have rates as low as dlrs 50 a night,'' says Mark Brown of
New Mexico Central Reservations, which handles the calls for
Affordable Properties of Santa Fe. Weekly rates make some places
cheaper.
	   Other budget motels that don't participate in the joint
advertising can be found by cruising Cerrillos Road.
	   And for the seriously frugal, there's the Santa Fe International
Hostel, with its dlrs 15 dormitory rooms, shared kitchen and
morning chores.
	   The most charming of the older, non-downtown lodges is the El
Rey Inn, a 1930s motor court that combines Southwestern-style
character and modern comfort on five beautifully landscaped acres
(2 hectares).
	   While a couple of the more affordable motels are an easy walk
from the Plaza, the El Rey and others are a few miles (kilometers)
out. Visitors can save the cost and hassle of downtown parking by
taking city buses, which operate daily except Sundays.
	   One of the best deals in town is a dlrs 10 pass that gets
visitors into four state-owned museums and the private museum
devoted to painter Georgia O'Keeffe. The pass is good for four
days.
	   Even better, the three that are downtown _ the historical Palace
of the Governors, the Museum of Fine Arts and The Georgia O'Keeffe
Museum _ are free on Friday evenings.
	   The Museum of International Folk Art _ with its extraordinary
display of 10,000 pieces of folk art from around the world _ and
the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture are well worth the two-mile
(3.2-kilometer) drive along the Old Santa Fe Trail from downtown,
and they're part of the dlrs 10 deal.
	   The Institute of American Indian Arts has a downtown museum that
features contemporary Indian artists. The charge is dlrs 4 for
adults, dlrs 2 for elders and students.
	   Kids under 17 are free at all six museums. But budget in an
extra dlrs 2 per child _ dlrs 3 for adults _ and visit the Santa Fe
Children's Museum for a wonderful afternoon of hands-on activity.
It's open Thursday through Sunday.
	   Art galleries, of course, are free _ and plentiful. They often
host openings for artists' shows on Friday nights, and offer
refreshments to those who stroll in.
	   The sprawling, new Gerald Peters Gallery is a must: 8,500 square
feet (790 sq. meters) of exhibition space, plus a sculpture garden.
It features 19th- and 20th-century art of the U.S. West _ Frederic
Remington, for example _ as well as work by contemporary artists. A
Picasso exhibit can be viewed through mid-November.
	   The nearby state Capitol is a showcase for the best of New
Mexico's arts and crafts, traditional and contemporary. A gallery
just outside the governor's office offers changing exhibits.
Visitors can wander at will or take a free tour.
	   Footsore and weary from all the walking? Locals love to soak in
the outdoor hot tubs at Ten Thousand Waves, a Japanese spa in the
tree-covered hills on the road to the Santa Fe Ski Area. Private
tubs start at dlrs 18 per person per hour. But there's a coed,
communal tub, and a women-only tub, for dlrs 13 _ no time limit,
and saunas are adjacent. If you're lucky, a few snow flakes will
drift your way as you sit in a steamy tub.
	   For shoppers, the portal of the Palace of the Governors, on the
downtown Plaza, is the place to find reasonably priced, genuine
Indian crafts _ jewelry, handmade pottery, weavings, carvings,
drums and sandpaintings. Artists and craftspeople from New Mexico's
nearly two dozen tribes have been spreading their wares on brightly
colored blankets under the portal for generations.
	   Being on a budget doesn't relegate visitors to fast-food joints,
although Santa Fe has plenty of them. There are many locally owned,
moderately priced restaurants that specialize in northern New
Mexico's red- or green-chili-smothered cuisine.
	   The Frito pie at the Five and Dime General Store on the Plaza is
a local institution _ dlrs 3.50 for the combination of ground beef,
red chili, and chopped onions poured over corn chips.
	   For high-end ambiance, hit the lobbies and bars of the town's
fanciest hotels and enjoy a drink or a snack _ and watch those
concha belts go by.

Police raid illegal abortion clinic in Brazil, arresting 22 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police raided an illegal abortion
clinic in a middle-class neighborhood Friday, arresting 15 women
and seven staff, officers said.
	   The 22 people were being questioned by police, said police
officer Fiero Adivinculo.
	   The clinic was hidden behind false walls at a legal medical
center.
	   Under a 1940 Brazilian law, abortions are only allowed in cases
of rape or when a mother's life is threatened.
	   But 1.4 million clandestine abortions take place in Brazil every
year, according to a report published September by the National
Network of Women's Health. Brazil has a population of 160 million
people.

Outlaw treehouse resort owner going legit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY306 &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAKILMA, Oregon (AP) _ For the past eight years, Michael
Garnier's treehouses have made him feel like a bed-and-breakfast
outlaw.
	   He went so far as to rig a getaway cable from his bedroom to a
towering oak in case deputies ever came in the night to arrest him
for putting up guests in his ``Out 'N' About Treesort'' without the
proper permits.
	   Now that he is on the verge of clearing the last regulatory
hurdle to bring his hotel in the branches up to code, treehouse
builders are proclaiming him a pioneer and a visionary.
	   But Garnier, a veteran of the elite Green Berets commando unit
who once made his living hawking boxes of Fantasy Flakes cereal in
a hippie medicine show, is afraid some of the fun will go out of it
all once he is finally legit.
	   ``The thing about treehouses is they were always a little
forbidden,'' he says.
	   The path less traveled has always attracted Garnier, who came to
the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon in 1972 to work for a
free health clinic that served local hippies.
	   Listen to him tell the tale of how he got involved in
treehouses, and it sounds like a religious awakening. ``I walked
across this open meadow and saw the oak tree _ I wanted to build a
treehouse in it.''
	   After his first attempt to open a conventional bed-and-breakfast
inn on the ground drew few customers, he decided in 1990 to build
one in the trees.
	   ``Everybody thought I was crazy, but I built it and they came,''
Garnier says.
	   The first of what are now nine treehouses _ four can support
overnight guests _ was the Peacock. Named for the carved image on
the front door, it is a one-room cabin with a double bed, sink and
a chamber pot perched in some white oak trees and reached by a
towering two-story staircase.
	   The Swiss Family Robinson soon followed, with a main house with
French doors for the parents and a tiny treehouse connected by a
swinging bridge for the kids.
	   The crowning achievement was the Tree Room Schoolhouse, which
boasts a full bathroom with a claw-footed tub, a kitchenette, a
queen-sized bed and a deck.
	   Josephine County building authorities were not amused, and
Garnier had to reach deep into his medicine show bag of tricks to
keep operating.
	   For example, when the county told him he could no longer rent to
strangers, it didn't say anything about him bringing in his friends
to stay for free.
	   So Garnier began selling ``tree-shirts'' for dlrs 70 to dlrs 125
that allowed his newfound friends _ known as Tree Musketeers _ to
stay for a sleep-over.
	   ``I'm a little naughty myself, and I enjoyed that outlaw
aspect,'' Ferron Mayfield, a fishing guide from Merlin, said after
his stay.
	   As the county tried harder to shut him down, Garnier's fame
grew. The Peacock graced the cover of Peter Nelson's book,
``Treehouses.'' Articles appeared in ``The New York Times
Magazine,'' ``Smithsonian,'' and a Fodor guide, ``Nights to
Imagine, Magical Places to Stay in America.'' TV crews showed up.
	   Betsy Glanville of Monterey Park, California, and her husband,
Lou, were aware of Garnier's legal problems when they spent a night
in his treehouse last summer. Veterans of the counterculture
themselves now studying Christian leadership and theology, they
enjoyed feeling like they had walked back into the '60s.
	   ``Everybody enjoyed being out in the country in a place that was
just a little bit different,'' Mrs. Glanville says.
	   Meanwhile, Garner had hired an engineer to certify the strength
of the treehouses and even held a party where he piled 10,847
pounds (4,920 kilograms) into the Peacock.
	   ``We had 66 people, two dogs, a cat and I'm not sure if the
hummingbird lighted or not,'' Garner says.
	   On another occasion, they jammed 116 people and a chicken into
the Swiss Family Robinson Complex.
	   ``The suite probably could have gotten 200 people, but we only
got 116 people to show up,'' Garnier says.
	   Garnier finally built the treehouse in the big oak that first
drew him to the property. He figured he could hole up there for a
few days if the county ever came after him.
	   The county took Garnier to court in 1997 seeking an injunction
to tear his treehouses down. The judge let them stand, and Garnier
continued to flout the law and sell his ``treeshirts'' while
working to meet the county's code demands.
	   Now that Garnier's on his way to becoming legit there are no
hard feelings, says County Counsel Steve Rich.
	   ``We didn't have any intent to bludgeon anybody with this,''
Rich says. ``If he can be a successful businessman and generate
tourism for the local economy, that's fine.''
	   Meanwhile, Garnier has founded the Treehouse Institute of
Takilma, dedicated to teaching people to build better treehouses,
and created a Web site at www.treehouses.com. Working with an
engineer, he has created what he calls the artificial limb, a
collared bolt for supporting beams.
	   But he wistfully recalls the old days.
	   ``You meet a lot of interesting people who are willing to stay
someplace that is not quite legal,'' he said.

Mexican peace effort delayed due to claim of military intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; SCC101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A meeting meant to
break a two-year impasse in peace efforts in southern Mexico was
delayed Friday due to claims that the army interfered with a convoy
bringing rebel delegates to the talks.
	   The commission organizing the talks here charged that soldiers
intercepted an International Red Cross vehicle carrying members of
the Zapatista National Liberation Army.
	   The government and army had pledged not to impede Zapatista
delegates to the talks, which congressmen hope could lead to a
resumption of direct talks between the government and rebels.
	   However, the meeting was supposed to be rescheduled for later in
the day.
	   The conflict in the southern state of Chiapas has shadowed the
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, who took office a year
after the Zapatistas staged a January 1994 uprising here in the
name of greater democracy and rights for Indians.
	   Negotiations between the government and the rebels have stalled
since 1996, when the Zapatistas accused of government of failing to
honor a partial peace accord signed that year.
	   The Mexican army denied any attempt to block the vehicle
carrying the Zapatistas. A spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``there was a misunderstanding in that some
soldiers were circulating on the same road which carried them near
the convoy with the Zapatistas.''
	   Javier Guerrero Garcia, a member of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, said the action ``was nothing more than an
error'' and that three soldiers asked the names of people inside
the vehicles.
	   But Hector Cuevas, a spokesman for the pro-Zapatista organizing
committee, called the army action ``a roadblock'' and said ``the
act of frank provocation halted the convoy,'' though the Zapatistas
eventually continued on to San Cristobal.
	   Zapatista delegates said they would delay the start of this
weekend's meeting until they received greater assurances of
security.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army does not pose a major
military threat to the government, but its continued presence in
Chiapas has left Zedillo open to criticism at home and abroad that
he is not doing enough to help Mexico's poor Indians.
	   In an interview published this week by the daily La Jornada,
Subcomandante Marcos, the charismatic leader of the Zapatista
movement, repeated charges that the government was stalling peace
efforts.
	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida responded Friday that the
Zapatistas are the ones ``who are detaining the process and those
who are impeding the end of the conflict.''

Volunteers to celebrate the New Year at archaeological dig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EIN GEDI, Israel (AP) _ Amateur archaeologists are invited to
bring in the New Year at a major archaeological dig in the sunny
desert oasis of Ein Gedi on the shore of the Dead Sea.
	   The dig will take place from Dec. 27 to Jan. 29, 1999 under the
leadership of Dr. Yizhar Hirschfeld and jointly sponsored by the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Hartford in
Connecticut.
	   Ein Gedi, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Jerusalem and 12
miles (19 kilometers) north of Masada, is set in a lush and exotic
oasis in the Negev Desert with high rocky cliffs, a pounding
waterfall, tropical flora in and around a nature reserve, and a
kibbutz-like garden village. It was here that young David hid from
the wrath of King Saul some 3,000 years ago.
	   When excavations began at Ein Gedi about 26 years ago, a series
of sixth-century synagogues was discovered, exposing one zodiac
mosaic floor. Volunteers recently uncovered an entire ssection of
this isolated ancient community _ a street, the entjrance to the
village, multistoried homes. shops, a ritual bath and many
artifacts.
	   Plan to work if you join the dig. The volunteers dig, pick,
sift, wash and sort from early morning to early afternoon five days
a week.
	   Minimum stay is one week. A room and full board costs dlrs 180-
dlrs 300 a week, depending on the type of accommodations.
	   The deadline for registration is Dec. 15. For more information
call the Israel Ministry of Tourism InfoCenter at 1-88-77-ISRAEL
within Israel, or e-mail info (at) goisrael.com.

 &UR; National Parks are becoming year-round travel destinations
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The number of people viewing the Liberty
Bell increased significantly this year and the National Park
Service credits aging baby boomers.
	   Even though there was a slump in summer attendance, the park
service counted 30,000 more visitors the first 10 months of the
year as compared with last year.
	   The park service attributes the growth to a national trend: The
children of the baby boom generation are growing up, freeing their
parents to travel during months when school is in session.
	   ``It's really becoming more of a year-round destination,'' said
Phil Sheridan, a spokesman for the Independence National Historic
Park.
	   Edie Shean-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the northeast region of
the National Park Service, said the national parks are seeing more
visitors showing up during what used to be the slow season, from
April to early June and from September to early November.
	   In the 1980s, these months were so quiet at the Cape Cod
National Seashore in Massachusetts that the park service didn't
even bother to keep the visitors' center open.
	   That changed in the early 1990s, Ms. Shean-Hammond said.
	   ``Try getting a weekend at a desirable spot on the Cape in
September,'' she said. ``You can't; it's booked.''

 &UR; Iditarod committee auctioning opportunities to ride
	   WASILLA, Alaska (AP) _ Adventurers who would like to ride a sled
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Race, yelling ``mush'' behind 16 Alaska
huskies, have a chance if they have the money.
	   The Iditarod Trail Committee is auctioning off opportunities to
ride along for the first 11 miles (18 kilometers) of the race and
meet Iditarod champions Martin Buser, Jeff King, Doug Swingley and
Rick Swenson.
	   The Idita-Rider telephone auction began Nov. 2 and will continue
to Jan. 29, 1999. Information about the auction is available by
calling 1-800-IDITAROD (434-2763) within the United States. To make
a bid or check on the status of the bids, call 1-800-566-SLED
(7533), within the United States.
	   Begun in 1973, the Iditarod begins in Anchorage, Alaska, and
ends 1,049 miles (1,688 kilometers) northwest in Nome. The Iditarod
Trail, a historic mail route originally blazed in 1910, is one of
the most rugged race courses in the world, crossing two mountain
ranges, running through rural villages and following the ice-packed
Norton Sound.

Caribbean immigrants gain political clout in U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Immigrants from the
small islands of the Eastern Caribbean have not always found a warm
welcome in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but this month's election shows
that the community has come of age, a senator said.
	   When the 23rd Legislature convenes in this U.S. Caribbean
territory next year, a third of its 15 members will trace their
roots to islands elsewhere in the region.
	   For Sen. David Jones, a native of Dominica and now a senator
representing St. Croix, the change shows that Eastern Caribbean
immigrants ``are moving into leadership to make a contribution.''
	   About 31 percent of the approximately 110,000 residents of the
territory were born on neighboring islands, according to the 1995
Population and Housing Survey published by the University of the
Virgin Islands' Eastern Caribbean Center.
	   That share of the population has brought political clout.
	   ``In the past, those from the Eastern Caribbean trying to vie
for public office were pummeled,'' said Sen. Roosevelt David, a
native of Nevis.
	   Jones said those political defeats were partially due to ``a
little insecurity and fear, which is unfounded.''
	   But David said this year's election represents growing
acceptance of immigrants.
	   ``It's not necessarily that we're from the Eastern Caribbean,
it's that we have something to offer,'' David said.
	   Last year, David found himself debating Sen. Adelbert Bryan over
government subsidies for a local cricket program. Bryan protested
that government funding should support American sports such as
baseball and football rather than those from abroad, such as
cricket.
	   David won the funding, and with more allies in the next
Legislature, he will have more support in such debates.
	   The strength of the immigrant legislators may now be
institutionalized. Jones said there has been discussion about
establishing an Eastern Caribbean caucus within the Democratic
Party on the islands.

Fujimori won't run for re-election, leading rival predicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori's most likely rival
for the presidential campaign in the year 2000 said he doesn't
believe that Fujimori will run in that election, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   ``I don't think he has the support to do it at this moment. I
personally don't think he will run,'' the popular mayor of Lima,
Alberto Andrade, was reported as saying in Gestion, the nation's
leading financial newspaper.
	   Andrade's comment came on the heels of a recent poll results
that put Fujimori's approval rating at 32 percent, one of its
lowest levels in his eight-year tenure as president.
	   A poll by the company Apoyo revealed that if the two candidates
ran against one another, Andrade would win by a wide margin. The
poll surveyed 975 people in Peru on Nov. 13-14 and had a margin of
error of 3.1 percentage points.
	   Alberto Andrade was easily re-elected as mayor last month and is
considered a possible presidential candidate in 2000. He has not
officially declared his candidacy.
	   Fujimori has not yet declared his intention to run for a third
consecutive term in 2000, but his ruling party in congress has
eliminated constitutional obstacles that would prevent him from
running again.
	   Fujimori was elected as a political outsider in 1990 and
re-elected in a landslide in 1995.

Davenport to face Graf next
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED with late match &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's top-ranked player has another date
with the Corel WTA Tour's hottest player.
	   Lindsay Davenport will take on Steffi Graf in Saturday's
semifinals at the Chase Championships.
	   The Madison Square Garden meeting comes six days after Graf beat
Davenport in the final of a tournament in Philadelphia. Saturday's
winner advances to a unique best-of-5-sets final in this
season-ending event, the only time during the year that women play
more than three sets.
	   Davenport booked her semifinal spot by easily defeating
eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-0, 6-3 Friday night.
	   Graf advanced Thursday night with a dramatic 1-6, 6-4, 6-4
victory over No. 5 Monica Seles in the best match of the
tournament. It ran Graf's match winning streak to 12 as the
29-year-old German seeks her third title in three weeks.
	   In Friday night's second quarterfinal, No. 2 Martina Hingis of
Switzerland played No. 6 Mary Pierce of France. The winner plays
Romania's Irina Spirlea in the semifinals.
	   Davenport raced through the opening set in 19 minutes. While
Tauziat provided much stiffer opposition in the second set, there
was no question as to who would win, only what the final score
would be.
	   As Davenport won game after game, Tauziat captured the Madison
Square Garden crowd, which is always pulling for the underdog. Very
little worked for Tauziat, the oldest player in the select
16-person field. And when she did win a hard-earned point, the
crowd responded warmly.
	   The loudest cheer came 30 minutes into the match when the
Frenchwoman won her first game.
	   After hitting a good approach shot deep into a corner and
heading to the net, only to see yet another Davenport winner go
whizzing past, Tauziat at one point shook her head from side to
side in exasperation and slapped her thigh. On another point, one
where the ball tipped the top of the net during the rally, which
she lost, she pointed to the net and hit her forehand while
muttering to herself.
	   The final point of the night was a microcosm of the entire
match.
	   Tauziat pounded what she thought was a winner deep into the
corner. Somehow, Davenport got to the ball and lifted a defensive
backhand lob into the lights. The ball bounced just inside the
sideline halfway between the service and baselines.
	   Tauziat lined it up, prepared properly, then pounded the ball
into the middle of the net.
	   It was the 14th meeting between the two, a series Davenport has
dominated. However, in recent matches, Tauziat has created problems
for the world's top-ranked player, beating the right-hander from
Newport Beach, California indoors at the Grand Slam Cup last month.
	   Prior to the match, Davenport had her right foot worked on after
the two had warmed up. The blister was the last thing that bothered
Davenport this night.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The top eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's
blue carpet. The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

Volunteers to celebrate the New Year at archaeological dig
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REMOVES phone number from first item, which may not be

<TEXT>
	   EIN GEDI, Israel (AP) _ Amateur archaeologists are invited to
bring in the New Year at a major archaeological dig in the sunny
desert oasis of Ein Gedi on the shore of the Dead Sea.
	   The dig will take place from Dec. 27 to Jan. 29, 1999 under the
leadership of Dr. Yizhar Hirschfeld and jointly sponsored by the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Hartford in
Connecticut.
	   Ein Gedi, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Jerusalem and 12
miles (19 kilometers) north of Masada, is set in a lush and exotic
oasis in the Negev Desert with high rocky cliffs, a pounding
waterfall, tropical flora in and around a nature reserve, and a
kibbutz-like garden village. It was here that young David hid from
the wrath of King Saul some 3,000 years ago.
	   When excavations began at Ein Gedi about 26 years ago, a series
of sixth-century synagogues was discovered, exposing one zodiac
mosaic floor. Volunteers recently uncovered an entire ssection of
this isolated ancient community _ a street, the entjrance to the
village, multistoried homes. shops, a ritual bath and many
artifacts.
	   Plan to work if you join the dig. The volunteers dig, pick,
sift, wash and sort from early morning to early afternoon five days
a week.
	   Minimum stay is one week. A room and full board costs dlrs 180-
dlrs 300 a week, depending on the type of accommodations.
	   The deadline for registration is Dec. 15. For more information

 &UR; National Parks are becoming year-round travel destinations
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The number of people viewing the Liberty
Bell increased significantly this year and the National Park
Service credits aging baby boomers.
	   Even though there was a slump in summer attendance, the park
service counted 30,000 more visitors the first 10 months of the
year as compared with last year.
	   The park service attributes the growth to a national trend: The
children of the baby boom generation are growing up, freeing their
parents to travel during months when school is in session.
	   ``It's really becoming more of a year-round destination,'' said
Phil Sheridan, a spokesman for the Independence National Historic
Park.
	   Edie Shean-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the northeast region of
the National Park Service, said the national parks are seeing more
visitors showing up during what used to be the slow season, from
April to early June and from September to early November.
	   In the 1980s, these months were so quiet at the Cape Cod
National Seashore in Massachusetts that the park service didn't
even bother to keep the visitors' center open.
	   That changed in the early 1990s, Ms. Shean-Hammond said.
	   ``Try getting a weekend at a desirable spot on the Cape in
September,'' she said. ``You can't; it's booked.''

 &UR; Iditarod committee auctioning opportunities to ride
	   WASILLA, Alaska (AP) _ Adventurers who would like to ride a sled
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Race, yelling ``mush'' behind 16 Alaska
huskies, have a chance if they have the money.
	   The Iditarod Trail Committee is auctioning off opportunities to
ride along for the first 11 miles (18 kilometers) of the race and
meet Iditarod champions Martin Buser, Jeff King, Doug Swingley and
Rick Swenson.
	   The Idita-Rider telephone auction began Nov. 2 and will continue
to Jan. 29, 1999. Information about the auction is available by
calling 1-800-IDITAROD (434-2763) within the United States. To make
a bid or check on the status of the bids, call 1-800-566-SLED
(7533), within the United States.
	   Begun in 1973, the Iditarod begins in Anchorage, Alaska, and
ends 1,049 miles (1,688 kilometers) northwest in Nome. The Iditarod
Trail, a historic mail route originally blazed in 1910, is one of
the most rugged race courses in the world, crossing two mountain
ranges, running through rural villages and following the ice-packed
Norton Sound.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A boat packed with school children on a field
trip capsized in a frigid lake in the Andes mountains Friday,
police said. Eleven children drowned.
	   The small motor boat was built to hold 10 passengers, but it
carried 16 children and an adult. It flipped over when the children
moved to the bow of the boat to have their picture taken, said
Maximo Ripa, a police spokesman in the nearby town of Uripa.
	   The children, most of whom could not swim, plunged into the
37-degrees-Fahrenheit (3-degrees-Celsius) water of Lake Pacucha,
270 miles (430 kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   The children, who ranged in age from 6 to 14, screamed for help
165 feet (50 meters) from shore. There was no lifeguard or life
preservers at the remote lake, Ripa said.
	   Police and students who had remained on shore saved five
children and the driver. The students were from a primary school in
Uchipa.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil will forgive Nicaragua's dlrs 179
million debt to help the Central American country devastated by
hurricane Mitch, the foreign ministry said Friday.
	   According to Luiz Felipe Lampreia, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso will ask Congress to approve the decision urgently.
	   Nicaragua is apparently the only Central American country that
owed money to Brazil.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) - The burgeoning trade dispute between
Brazil and Argentina does not threaten the six-nation South
American trading bloc known as Mercosur, Brazilian Foreign minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Friday.
	   In an interview with the Associated Press, Lampreia said the
dispute is a by-product of the economic slowdown affecting both
countries, and he predicted it would be solved through
negotiations, including presidential talks next month.
	   Lampreia disagreed with Brazilian press accounts describing the
dispute between South America's two largest nations as a ``tariff
war''. He said the dispute only involves about 20 percent of the
dlrs 20 billion in annual trade between the two countries.
	   The dispute involves Argentine concerns over Brazilian steel and
paper exports and Brazil's new sanitary controls on imports of
foodstuffs. Brazil objects to new Argentine regulations requiring
importers to make hefty cash deposits before being allowed to
import Brazilian products. And the Brazilian dairy industry worries
about alleged subsidies on Argentine dairy exports.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Heavily armed men ambushed federal
lawmen in an area known for drug trafficking, wounding at least two
of the agents.
	   Six agents of the federal attorney general's office were driving
up a rural road on a mission to serve arrest warrants on Thursday
when gunmen opened fire on them, according to Guerrero state
police.
	   Two of the agents were wounded in the attack, about 100 miles
(160 kms) northwest of Acapulco.
	   Although guerrilla bands also have been active near the region,
police said they suspected the attack was related to drug
trafficking.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President Rafael Caldera urged the
winner of December's presidential elections to honor the
constitution that permits his victory _ a message most likely
directed at a former coup plotter now leading in the polls.
	   ``We demand of those who are elected that the same
constitutional norms that have served as a path for the conquest of
power be respected,'' Caldera, 82, said in a speech Thursday to
commanders of the Air Force.
	   Hugo Chavez, 44, a former army paratrooper who took up arms
against the government six years ago, has capitalized on public
anger over corruption and declining living standards to become the
front-runner in the presidential race.
	   His candidacy has polarized Venezuela, with the poor flocking to
his support and the wealthy fearing he will install a leftist
dictatorship.

Leftist rebels attack rightist militias, at least 18 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A leftist rebel attack on a northern
stronghold of right-wing paramilitary groups has claimed at least
18 lives, the defense minister said Friday.
	   The fighting began about a week ago in Pavarando, a remote town
in Antioquia state about 310 miles (500 kilometers) from Bogota.
	   A major center for arms and drug trafficking, the region is
hotly disputed by the guerrillas and militias backed by landowners.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said rebels from the country's
most powerful guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, attacked a private estate serving as a base for
paramilitary fighters.
	   Government soldiers who reached the scene of the clashes Friday
found 18 bodies in two mass graves and were scouring the area for
more victims, Lloreda said.
	   The figure did not include possible guerrilla deaths, and it was
unclear whether it included civilians.

Media workers lead march in protest of prime minister's statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Scores of media workers led a
march of more than 1,000 people through the streets of the capital
Friday to protest comments by Prime Minister Basdeo Panday that
were seen as attacks on the press.
	   The media workers were joined by other union and civic
organization members and a few opposition politicians.
	   ``This is democracy right here on the streets,'' shouted Nicole
Duke-Westfield, through a bullhorn. Duke-Westfield is a newspaper
reporter and executive board member of the Media Association of
Trinidad and Tobago, which organized the demonstration.
	   The protest was a response to Panday's ``declaration of war'' on
the media in a speech two weeks ago. Several reporters said they
were roughed up by Panday's supporters immediately after he made
his speech.
	   Panday has called the media biased and racist on other
occasions. The twin-island Caribbean nation is roughly split
between citizens of East Indian and African descent.
	   Friday's march followed a series of semi-organized protests
around the country that included flaming roadblocks on a key
highway leading to Trinidad's oil fields. The protesters complained
about unemployment, poor roads and other issues.
	   The march ended at Woodford Square, where about 2,000 people
listened to speeches warning about a curtailment of press freedom.
	   ``It's getting closer and closer and I want us all to be
vigilant,'' said Errol Pilgrim of the state-owned Trinidad and
Tobago Television.

Union endorses Mexican governor for 2000 presidential elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Manuel Bartlett, the hard-line Mexican
politician who broke a decades-long tradition by openly campaigning
for the ruling party's presidential nomination, won an endorsement
Friday from one of Mexico's biggest unions.
	   Alberto Juarez, leader of the Revolutionary Federation of
Workers and Peasants said Bartlett, the governor of the central
state of Puebla, would be an ideal candidate for the 2000
presidential elections, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   Bartlett, like the union known as CROC, represents the ruling
party's hard-line faction and often finds himself at odds with
party reformers. As Mexico's Interior Secretary in 1988, he was
accused of rigging the vote that brought President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari to power.
	   ``It is an enormous distinction,'' Bartlett was quoted by
Notimex as saying.
	   Bartlett's campaign is highly unusual in a country where
presidential hopefuls within the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party are expected to downplay _ or even deny _ their presidential
aspirations.
	   The endorsement came on Revolution Day, which commemorates the
Mexican Revolution of 1910.
	   Another early candidate for the presidency is Guanajuato Gov.
Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and a member of the
pro-business National Action Party. He declared himself a possible
presidential candidate after last year's midterm elections.

Davies devastates par-5s again for midway lead in elite event

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Laura Davies, using her length off the tee on
the holes where it counted most, continued her domination of the
par-5s Friday for a 5-under 67 and a four-shot lead midway through
the LPGA Tour Championship.
	   Davies, who hasn't made anything worse than birdie on a par-5 in
two days, had an eagle and three birdies on the long holes at the
Desert Inn Country Club to move to 11-under after two rounds of the
season-ending event.
	   ``Obviously, if I keep driving it down the middle 280, 290, 300
yards (255, 264, 273 meters) on the par-5s, it's going to make this
game pretty easy for me,'' Davies said. ``I'm playing the par-5s
like par-4s.''
	   Tina Barrett shot a 66 to move into second place, while Karrie
Webb was another shot back after a 69. Juli Inkster and Dottie
Pepper were tied for fourth, seven shots behind.
	   Annika Sorenstam, looking to wrap up the player of the year
award, improved to a 71 but was 12 shots back, while rookie
sensation Se Ri Pak shot a 77 that pretty much eliminated her
chances of passing Sorenstam for player of the year.
	   Booming drives of up to 300 yards (275 meters), Davies doubled
the two-shot lead she held to begin the day under near perfect
conditions on the course bordering the glittering casinos of the
Las Vegas Strip.
	   Still, after a deep slump that has kept her winless on the LPGA
Tour in 20 months, she wasn't quite ready to claim the dlrs 215,000
first prize with two rounds to go.
	   ``I'm not really that comfortable,'' Davies said. ``Now I've got
a bigger lead so there's more to blow. At what point I feel
comfortable again, I don't really know. I still felt a bit nervous
out there today.''
	   In two days of play, Davies has three eagles and five birdies on
the par-5s. She played the holes a total of 11-under, while playing
the other holes even par.
	   It could have been even better for Davies, who narrowly missed
back-to-back eagles on the ninth and 10th holes. Her chip on the
ninth hole hit the pin and stopped a few feet away for birdie, then
Davies sank a 30-footer (9 meters) from the fringe for eagle on the
next hole.
	   Davies hit a 9-iron to the final par-5, the 15th, and just and
missed a 12-footer (3.6 meters) for another eagle. She finished the
day with a rare birdie on a par-4, sinking a 30-footer (9 meters)
on the 18th hole.
	   ``If this was three years ago, I'd be pretty confident,'' Davies
said. ``But I'm not. The only way I can get confidence is if I
win.''
	   Barrett, whose average drive of 230 yards (209 meters) is about
50 yards (45 meters) less than Davies, also had success on the
par-5s, but in a different way.
	   She hit wedges to 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) or less on the first
three par-5s for birdies, and was 6-under for the day after making
a 12-footer (3.6 meters) on the par-4 12th. Barrett parred the rest
of the holes to finish at 7-under for two rounds.
	   ``There's an A-plus level and an A level on tour. Laura is
really in the A-plus level,'' Barrett said. ``We aspire to get to
that top level but I haven't gotten there yet.''
	   Barrett, who needed a second place finish in the Japan Classic
to even make the field of top 30 money winners in the tournament
sponsored by PageNet, hasn't won since her rookie year in 1989.
	   ``I kind of feel like I'm due,'' she said. ``I'm so much better
than I was in 1989 it's unbelievable. But now I also know a lot
more about how hard it is to win out here.''

Sides talking again, expecting to go late into the night
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a morning of pessimistic predictions, the
slightest signs of progress emerged from National Basketball
Association lockout talks Friday as players and owners met for a
long negotiating session.
	   ``We could go late _ and that's a good thing,'' a person
involved in the talks told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity. Another participant also predicted talks lasting well
into the evening.
	   In the first full negotiating session in more than three weeks,
the sides began talking around 10:30 a.m., broke for lunch about
two hours later and worked for another four hours before taking
another break. It was believed the players showed some movement
first, and the owners made a reciprocal move several hours later.
	   Around lunchtime, union president Patrick Ewing was heard saying
to a league official: ``Let's get back in there. I want to play.''
	   Still, people involved in the talks said the sides were merely
tweaking their earlier proposals and were avoiding the weightiest
issues _ especially the big question of what would be a fair split
of revenues. The owners have been insisting upon an eventual 50-50
split, while the players have offered some concessions that would
not kick in unless they received 60 percent.
	   Neither side made any public statements during a one-hour break
that ended about 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT).
	   Earlier in the day, both sides arrived spewing words of extreme
pessimism.
	   ``I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We
certainly want to, but I don't have my hopes up right now.''
	   Equally gloomy was Jim McIlvaine of the Seattle SuperSonics, a
member of the union's bargaining team.
	   ``There's a sense that nothing's going to be done right now,''
he said.
	   After talking to players on conference calls for the past two
weeks, union officials said their orders were to withhold any more
concessions until the owners showed an inclination to compromise.
	   But obviously, something happened inside the conference room at
a midtown Manhattan hotel that kept the sides talking.
	   Friday's bargaining session, the first since Oct. 28 to include
the full negotiating teams, evolved from a telephone call NBA
commissioner David Stern placed to Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta
Hawks earlier this week. That led to a two-hour meeting Tuesday
that included Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing, Stern and
Granik.
	   While both sides agreed almost nothing was accomplished Tuesday,
they decided to see if bringing both committees to New York might
jump-start the process.
	   ``Absolutely nothing has happened to suggest that the players
are ready to make anything like what we consider to be a fair deal,
unless something has changed in the last couple of days,'' Granik
said as he arrived in the morning.
	   Hunter arrived 15 minutes later and said: ``I guess the issue is
discussing the proposals that were on the table and seeing whether
or not there's any possible movement. As I've said before, if they
are inclined to move off their position, then we are prepared to
discuss whether we're ready to move.''
	   So far, the first month and a half of the season has been
canceled, and an agreement would need to be reached in the next
week or so in order to start the season before Christmas.
	   When the sides made some progress three weeks ago on the
framework for a new deal, they talked about implementing many of
the union's concessions in the first two or three years of the new
agreement in order to halt salary growth from outpacing revenue
growth.
	   If the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries failed to drop
below an agreed-upon level _ and what that level would be is one of
the biggest points of contention _ most players would contribute up
to 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund, with the money
going back to the owners if the designated percentage was exceeded.

Hull files lawsuit against Toronto Sun, Moscow Times
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sun comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELLEVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ Former hockey star Bobby Hull has
filed a lawsuit against a Moscow newspaper and the Toronto Sun for
stories that quoted Hull making racial slurs and praising Adolf
Hitler.
	   The suit was filed Friday in Hull's hometown.
	   On Aug. 25, the English-language Moscow Times quoted Hull as
saying ``Hitler had some good ideas, he just went a little bit too
far.''
	   The story also said Hull made remarks about the black population
in the United States and suggested the Nazis' plan to build a
master race was not entirely flawed.
	   The Toronto Sun picked up on the story the following day with
the headline ``Hockey Legend Shoots Off Mouth.''
	   ``He's suing for libel and slander, he's suing for malicious and
injurious falsehood. He's also claiming for punitive damages,''
Hull's lawyer, Tim Danson, said Friday in Toronto.
	   ``Witnesses to the interview have confirmed to me what Bobby
Hull has always said, that it's not just what he said but the way
in which he said it; that his demeanor, tone of voice, facial
expression communicated nothing but contempt and hatred for Adolf
Hitler.''
	   The Sun, which must respond within 20 days, didn't do anything
wrong, said Alan Shanoff, the newspaper's lawyer.
	   ``We didn't report the remarks as being accurate or
inaccurate,'' he said. ``It's a news story that was going around
the world. It was on the Internet, it was on all international wire
services, it was everywhere.
	   ``We reported on it and I don't see that the Toronto Sun caused
any harm to Bobby Hull.''
	   The Moscow Times said no one was in the office who could
comment.
	   Hull, 59, led the National Hockey League in goals scored for
seven season while playing with the Chicago Blackhawks and won the
Hart Trophy as the league's MVP twice. The Golden Jet, as he is
known, was among the players who launched the World Hockey
Association.
	   He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983 and is a
member of the Order of Canada.
	   Hull makes his living as a cattle rancher and by marketing his
name and reputation.
	   ``It has had (a) devastating impact on him both personally and
financially in his business and he's been left with no
alternative,'' said Danson. ``He asked for retractions and
apologies, it didn't come, so he's been very much forced into
this.''

Former Nike Tour golfer leads PGA qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Jonathan Kaye's bogey-free 8-under
64 Friday moved the former Nike Tour member into a two-shot lead
after three rounds of the PGA Tour's final qualifying tournament.
	   Kaye, 28, from Phoenix, managed eight birdies on the La Quinta
Resort Dunes Course to finish 54 holes of the 108-hole tournament
at 16-under 200.
	   Greg Chalmer of England, also playing the Dunes Course, shot a
67 for second at 202.
	   Two-time PGA Tour winner Rick Fehr of Redmond, Washington, Brent
Schwartzrock of Winter Park, Florida and Tim Loustalot of
Scottsdale, Arizona were tied for third.
	   The bottom half of the field after two rounds played the Dunes
Course, with the top half playing the Weiskopf Course at PGA West.
	   Kaye avoid the high rough and mastered the slick greens of the
Dunes for five birdies on the back nine, which he played first. He
completed his round with three birdies on the front nine, though he
made only pars on the par-5s at the 7th and 9th holes.
	   Chalmer's 67 featured a double-bogey on the par-4 17th at the
Dunes, but he rallied with five birdies and a bogey on the front
nine.
	   Players will switch course for Saturday's fourth round, then be
re-paired by score for Sunday's fifth round.
	   The top 35 players and ties at the end of Monday's play earn PGA
Tour exemptions. The next 50 players will be fully exempt for the
1999 Nike Tour, the PGA Tour's developmental circuit. The rest of
the golfers in the 169-player field have conditional status for the
Nike Tour.

Israeli withdrawal brings Arafat one step closer to statehood

<TEXT>
	   QABATIEH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite days of delays and
last-minute glitches, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has come a
solid step closer to fulfilling his dream of statehood for the
Palestinians.
	   An Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank went smoothly
Friday, giving the Palestinians control over an additional 2
percent of the territory and upgrading their authority in 7 percent
of the land.
	   The pullback from Qabatieh and 35 other small towns and villages
earned praise for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yet it
made his government more fragile than ever.
	   Palestinian policemen leaned out of jeep windows and fired their
rifles victoriously into the air Friday to celebrate their takeover
of this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to Qabatieh greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   ``I think we need to see this in a positive way in the fact that
things are actually happening that people thought would not
happen,'' Albright told Israel television in an interview.
	   ``The actions are moving very much in a positive direction,''
Albright added.
	   However, support for the land-for-security agreement is slipping
in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government, and
Israeli media said Friday the prime minister might call early
elections in the spring, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   In the month since the signing of the accord in Washington,
Israel and the Palestinians have incessantly argued about each
others' obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind
schedule because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.
	   Last-minute hitches also threatened to hold up the pullback
itself. Without informing the Palestinians, Israel made changes in
the redeployment map Thursday night, such as keeping several roads,
including the one to Qabatieh, under full Israeli control for the
time being, rather than handing them to the Palestinians.
	   When Palestinians raised questions, Israeli soldiers stopped
moving 130 brown-and-yellow road markers to delineate the new
borders
	   Maps in hand, Israel's army commander in the West Bank, Maj.
Gen. Moshe Yaalon, flew by helicopter to Arafat's headquarters. The
two looked at the maps, Arafat gave his okay and the crisis was
over.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, usually a tough critic of
the Israeli government, said that the arguments of recent weeks may
have brought the two sides closer.
	   But more needed to be done, he said. ``We have to concentrate
... and have to exert maximum efforts to build the trust required
between us.''
	   On Friday afternoon, Palestinian police took up their new
positions in 36 towns and villages near Jenin and the West Bank
town of Nablus. In Qabatieh, a town of 17,000 residents, two
teen-agers jumped onto the roof of a jeep in a convoy and hoisted a
large Palestinian flag.
	   Qabatieh was a stronghold of resistance to Israeli occupation
during the Palestinian uprising, and hundreds of residents cheered
as vigilantes strung up the body of a suspected collaborator with
Israel on an electricity pole in 1988.
	   On that same pole, residents draped a banner on Friday reading
``Today Qabatieh, tomorrow Jerusalem,'' a reference to Palestinian
hopes to establish their capital in the holy city.
	   At the ``Abu Halala Cafe'' on main street, patrons were divided
over the impact of new rulers.
	   Teissir Mansour, a 50-year-old merchant, said it was time police
end rampant lawlessness.
	   His neighbor in the cafe, 55-year-old Khalil Abu Rub, was upset
he would still have to pass an Israeli checkpoint on his way to
Jenin. ``I think nothing will change.''
	   The withdrawal isolated several Jewish settlements and Israeli
troops began reinforcing them with cement trenches and shooting
positions.
	   In Ganim, a community of 51 families, many were thinking about
leaving. Ilan Amar, 34, had just moved to Ganim with his wife Rikki
and three children three months ago.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Amar, who sells car paint in the Israeli
port city of Haifa.
	   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including
150 criminals. Arafat had demanded freedom for Palestinians who
fought Israeli occupation.
	   In a third step, Israel and the Palestinians signed the protocol
for operating Yasser Arafat International Airport in the Gaza
Strip. The airport, a symbol of fledgling Palestinian independence,
will open Tuesday.

UN chief disturbed by reports of civilian casualties in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday
he was seriously disturbed by reports of civilian casualties in
East Timor and called for Indonesian armed forces and Timorese
rebels to show maximum restraint.
	   The appeal came as Portugal's government suspended a meeting
Saturday in New York with U.N. and Indonesian officials over the
disputed territory following intelligence reports of a massacre of
civilians, Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said in Lisbon.
	   The number of casualties, location and date of this week's
alleged massacre in the former Portuguese colony were not
immediately clear, Cesar said.
	   The United Nations is trying to establish the veracity of the
reports of casualties, Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``He calls for an end to all military operations by all sides
and for respect for the safety and security of unarmed civilians,''
Eckhard said.
	   The talks were to discuss a U.N. proposal to grant broad
autonomy for the half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200
miles) east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Indonesia annexed
East Timor in 1976, a year after invading it when Portuguese
colonial rule ended. The United Nations still regards Portugal as
the legal authority in East Timor.
	   After the resignation in May of the authoritarian President
Suharto, Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to
East Timor and its 800,000 people, but it insisted on retaining
control of its defense, economic and foreign policies.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal.
	   Portugal provides a haven for East Timorese pro-independence
activists, and has insisted that a referendum be held in the
territory to decide its future.

Iraq asks for two month extension of oil-for-food, UN chief
</HEADLINE>
suggests six &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In another sign that Iraq hopes to have
sanctions lifted soon, Baghdad asked Friday that the U.N. program
that lets it buy food and medicine with proceeds from oil sales be
extended only for two more months.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended in a report Friday that
the ``oil-for-food'' program be prolonged for another six months _
as it has been regularly extended since its inception in 1996 _ to
better provide for Iraqis suffering under the harsh U.N. measures.
	   But in a letter to Annan, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Said
al-Sahaf said Baghdad wanted the program extended only for 60 days
and asked that the Security Council committee that approves
contracts for goods speed up their work.
	   Iraq has routinely criticized the oil-for-food program as an
excuse for the international community to maintain sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait that bar it from freely
exporting oil.
	   The Security Council established ``oil-for-food'' in 1996 to
allow limited oil sales in order to pay for food, medical supplies,
war reparation and other humanitarian needs for Iraq's 22 million
people.
	   The council won't lift the embargo until U.N. weapons inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council was expected to take up Annan's report next
week. They must approve a new phase of the oil-for-food program as
the current 6-month period expires Nov. 25.
	   The council had allowed Iraq to sell up to dlrs 5.2 billion in
oil over the past six months. But because of low oil prices and
Iraq's poor oil production facilities, it was only able to export
about dlrs 3 billion worth.
	   Al-Sahaf suggested that the current six-month phase of the
program be extended for two more months so Iraq could reach that
dlrs 5.2 billion ceiling.
	   Council diplomats, however, have been cool to the idea of a
brief extension, which had been suggested informally by Iraqi
diplomats for the past few weeks.
	   In his report to the council, Annan said that on the whole,
oil-for-food has continued to provide more food for the Iraqi
people.
	   An improvement in infant malnutrition in three northern
governerates where Baghdad has less control has been sustained, he
said.
	   ``However, in the center and south of Iraq, infant malnutrition
while not worsening, continues to be a grave concern,'' Annan
wrote.

Iraq calls UN request for documents provocative, lays out
</HEADLINE>
conditions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with U.S. saying response
insufficient; Butler reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' and laid out conditions for arms inspectors to see
one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, on Friday told
the chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that many of the
requested documents were destroyed or never existed. Whatever
information was available about other documents has already been
submitted, he wrote in two letters.
	   The United States, which has threatened Iraq with military
action if it doesn't cooperate with inspectors, called the Iraqi
responses insufficient and said Baghdad needs to provide more
information about its weapons program.
	   The dispute was the first glitch between Iraq and the U.N.
Special Commission since Baghdad announced Saturday that it would
reverse its Oct. 31 decision to halt cooperation with the weapons
experts charged with destroying Iraq's lethal weapons. The
announcement staved off what U.S. officials have said were imminent
U.S. airstrikes.
	   Based on Iraq's weekend pledge, the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, sent Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz three letters this week asking for documents about its
missiles, and chemical and biological weapons programs.
	   Inspectors must certify that those weapons have been destroyed
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf war.
	   Inspectors worked for a third day in Iraq on Friday.
	   In particular, Butler asked for an Air Force diary, which
inspectors discovered during a July search but were prevented from
taking, that detailed munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton mentioned the document in his speech
Sunday, listing what information Iraq must hand over if it is to
see sanctions lifted.
	   In his letter Friday, al-Qaisi said the document was beyond the
scope of the inspectors' mandate. Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N.
experts could view ``relevant portions'' of it in the presence of
the U.N. chief's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   Butler's request to view other archives from the Defense
Ministry ``seems to be provocative rather than professional,'' he
wrote.
	   Butler responded late Friday by sending yet another letter to
Aziz asking for ``a constructive reply'' to his request.
	   In a separate letter to the council, Butler said the Air Force
document was directly related to UNSCOM's mandate because it dealt
with Iraq's use of bombs and rockets that were filled with chemical
agents.
	   He noted that the council has already demanded Iraq deliver the
contentious document to the Special Commission.
	   Washington agrees with Butler's views that these responses are
not sufficient and that Iraq needs to provide further disclosure, a
U.S. official said, speaking on condition he not be identified.
	   Butler said he was also concerned with Iraq's responses to his
request for documents about its biological weapons program.
Inspectors have consistently said Baghdad's declarations about the
program are far from complete.
	   ``Iraq's reply seems to indicate that it is not prepared to do
any further disarmament work with the commission in the biological
weapons area, unless required to do so by the Security Council,
following a comprehensive review,'' Butler wrote.
	   The council promised the review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions in return for Iraq's resumption of cooperation with
inspectors. Iraq hopes the process will lead to a lifting of the
oil embargo which has devastated its economy.
	   Butler also contested al-Qaisi's determination that all records
on its production of VX had been turned over to inspectors. Butler
said such records only go through 1988. ``Iraq's declared
production of VX in 1990 remains unverified,'' he wrote.
	   Iraq's deputy U.N. ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said Iraq was still
committed to cooperating with UNSCOM and said Iraq's willingness to
allow inspectors to view the Air Force document showed its
eagerness to do so.
	   ``What they want is full submission, and they will never, never
get it,'' he said. ``Full cooperation is different than full
submission.''

Italian court frees Kurdish rebel leader, enraging Turkey

	   ROME (AP) _ Kurds and their supporters danced for joy after a
Rome court granted conditional freedom to a Kurdish rebel leader
detained when he came to Italy seeking asylum.
	   In Turkey, the response to Friday's release was outrage.
Turkey's prime minister made unspecified threats, and relatives of
Turkish soldiers killed fighting Kurdish separatists urged their
government to do everything necessary to bring ``this murderer'' to
Turkey.
	   The Italian court threw out a Turkish arrest warrant for
Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition in death penalty
cases. The court ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome, but Justice
Minister Oliviero Diliberto indicated that the rebel chief would be
freed from even that restriction on Dec. 23 if Germany chose not to
pursue extradition on its own warrant against him by then.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Ocalan, a fugitive overseas during much of the conflict, is on
trial in absentia on capital charges in Turkey, which had demanded
his extradition.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema promised that Italy would keep
Ocalan under surveillance to ``guarantee that he can't carry out
terrorist activities or any hostile activities against Turkey.''
	   Hundreds of Ocalan's supporters danced in a Rome piazza at news
of his release from a military hospital, where he had been held
since his flight landed at Rome's international airport on Nov. 12.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared: ``Italy risks
facing the eternal enmity of Turkey.''
	   ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish
state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' Yilmaz said
of Italian leaders. He did not specify what that price might be.
	   Yilmaz appealed to NATO for support in the clash between the two
NATO partners, describing Ocalan as ``the worst terrorist of the
century.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright backed Turkey's stand
on Ocalan, telling a Washington news conference, ``It is very
important that he be brought to justice'' _ if not in Turkey, then
in Italy or Germany.
	   Ocalan has been wanted in Gerrmany on charges of terrorism since
1990. Germany, however, said it would not seek the extradition of
the rebel chief, at least for now.
	   Ocalan asked the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to Rome to
show solidarity to return home and sustain the Kurdish cause
through legal and democratic means.
	   ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting
themselves on fire, and I don't want any behavior that might
reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' Ocalan said in a statement
read by a spokesman.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated Turks, who
know him as the leader of terror bombings and guerrilla warfare.
Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy in
Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods.
	   ``The blood of our children and our husbands will not be left
unanswered,'' families of Turkish soldiers killed by Kurds said in
a statement.
	   Additionally, ``It is clear that we will review our economic and
trade relations with a government, which by keeping the murderer of
30,000 people and providing him haven, is becoming an accomplice to
his crimes,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said from Ankara.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling
the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''

Lava begins to flow at Mexican volcano
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo COL101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLIMA, Mexico (AP) _ Lava surged upward Friday in the crater of
the rumbling Colima Volcano, leading experts to predict that the
smoking peak would undergo a ``low-intensity'' emission of molten
rock rather than the explosive eruption some had feared.
	   The appearance of the lava, detected during a helicopter flight
by researchers over the 3,820-meter (12,533-foot) peak, forced
authorities in southern Colima state to postpone plans to allow
residents of an evacuated village to return to their homes.
	   ``The developments indicate that a low intensity lava flow has
begun ... If it continues, it would overflow onto one of the
volcano's slopes,'' the state government said in a press statement.
	   Such a flow would increase the risk to the village of Yerba
Buena, on the volcano's southern flank about 8 kilometers (5 miles)
from the crater.
	   All 140 residents of the village were evacuated from Yerba Buena
Wednesday, after the volcano gave signals of an impending eruption
stronger than any seen in decades.
	   In 1913 the volcano exploded, shattering windows and showering
ash in towns several miles away.
	   However, geologists say that the current eruption will be more
like a 1991 incident in which lava flows didn't even reach the
lower slopes of the volcano _ also known as the Volcan de Fuego,
Spanish for Volcano of Fire.
	   Residents evacuated from two hamlets on the northern flanks of
the volcano in neighboring Jalisco state will be allowed to return
to their homes, authorities said. The release of lava through the
crater may reduce pressure building up under the peak and reduce
risks to those hamlets.

Waugh and Healy punish England with centuries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Steve Waugh and Ian Healy scored
centuries Saturday and combined for an unbeaten 170-run wicket
stand to put Australia in control of the first cricket test against
England at the Gabba.
	   Resuming on the second day at 246 for five, the pair moved the
score to 348 for five at lunch.
	   Waugh was on 107 with Healy on 105. The experienced pair, both
playing in their 107th tests, rescued an innings that had slumped
to 106 for four and then 178 for five, after Mark Taylor had
decided to bat first.
	   Waugh, who provided the backbone of an Australian batting
recovery, made slow progress to his 16th test century and his sixth
against England, after resuming the day on 69.
	   The Australian vice-captain was happy to play second fiddle to
local hero Healy, who dominated the stand with a pugnacious
innings.
	   Both batsmen were dropped just before stumps on the first day
and Healy received another stroke of luck Saturday before posting
his fourth test hundred.
	   Healy played a back foot defensive shot against Darren Gough on
62 and the ball spun back off the wicket to hit the stumps but
failed to dislodge a bail.
	   It was a heartbreaking morning for Gough, easily England's best
bowler. He beat both Waugh and Healy repeatedly outside off-stump.
	   Waugh's innings has lasted 11 minutes over five hours and
included 13 boundaries.
	   Allan Mullally and Dominic Cork have taken two wickets apiece
costing 73 and 69 runs respectively.

Chinese premier promises currency will remain stable in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Premier Zhu Rongji on Friday pledged not to
devalue the country's currency and for the first time said that
promise will extend through 1999.
	   Zhu told a group of Canadian businessmen that the Chinese
government will be able to keep the yuan stable during next year.
	   The premier also said China's target of 8 percent growth this
year can be achieved and that the economy was likely to grow at a
comparable pace next year.
	   Beijing is confident in its currency and the fundamentals
supporting it. China's top central bankers have said in recent days
they see no reason to adjust the yuan's rate, which is now at about
8.28 to the dollar.
	   The yuan is only semi-convertible, so the government, not the
markets, exerts control over the currency. Yet its impact has been
felt in markets nonetheless, mainly because a mandated devaluation
would be likely to weaken other Asian currencies.
	   Over the course of this year, speculators have questioned
Beijing's resolve to keep the yuan stable, particularly when the
yen was quickly losing value and China's exports were sliding.
	   In the past few months, the Chinese government has plugged
loopholes in its capital account because too much foreign exchange
was being moved abroad amid fears the yuan would be devalued,
making overseas loan payments and imports much more expensive.
	   The government has also increased subsidies to Chinese
exporters.
	   China reported a dlrs 38.4 billion trade surplus in the first 10
months of 1998 and has about dlrs 141 billion in foreign exchange
reserves to buffer its currency exchange rate.
	   Zhu said at a Canada-China Business Council banquet, also
attended by visiting Prime Minister Jacques Chretien, that the
Asian financial crisis, which has battered currency values and
weakened regional demand, will be hard on China, too.
	   Exports have slowed sharply this year and are not expected to
recover any time soon.
	   Zhu said the government has increased money supply and
infrastructure spending to stimulate domestic spending in an effort
to compensate for weak overseas sales of its goods.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Leftist rebels met
Friday with a congressional mediation group for talks meant to
break a two-year impasse in peace efforts in southern Mexico.
	   The talks had been delayed for several hours after
representatives of the leftist Zapatista National Liberation Army
and legislators claimed that an army patrol stopped a Red Cross
convoy bringing 29 rebel delegates here for the meeting.
	   ``Every time there is a signal of hope in the dialogue for
peace, the government and the army stage provocations to make the
peace initiatives fail,'' a rebel leader known as Comandante David
claimed in a speech before the talks began.
	   The government and army had pledged not to impede Zapatista
delegates traveling to the talks, which congressmen hope could lead
to a resumption of direct negotiations between the government and
rebels
	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida said the Zapatistas are
the ones ``who are detaining the process and those who are impeding
the end of the conflict.''
	   The conflict in the southern state of Chiapas has cast a shadow
over the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, who took
office a year after the Zapatistas staged a January 1994 uprising
here in the name of greater democracy and rights for Indians.
	   Negotiations between the government and the rebels have stalled
since 1996, when the Zapatistas accused of government of failing to
honor a partial peace accord signed that year.
	   The first round of the closed-door meetings, scheduled to
continue through Sunday, lasted about 45 minutes, and legislators
left with frowns and furrowed brows.
	   The rebels, wearing black ski masks or handkerchiefs covering
their faces, limited the meeting to a reading of a list of
complaints about the lack of logistical and security preparation
for the talks.
	   The Mexican army denied any attempt to block the convoy with the
Zapatistas. A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``there was a misunderstanding in that some soldiers were
circulating on the same road which carried them near the convoy
with the Zapatistas.''
	   Hector Cuevas, a spokesman for the pro-Zapatista organizing
committee, called the army action ``a roadblock'' and said ``the
act of frank provocation halted the convoy,'' though the Zapatistas
eventually continued on to San Cristobal.
	   While the Zapatista National Liberation Army does not pose a
major military threat to the government, its continued presence in
Chiapas' Lacandon jungle has left Zedillo open to criticism at home
and abroad that he is not doing enough for peace and to help
Mexico's poor Indians.

Clinton meets Kim, who urges cautious approach to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous, UPDATES with Clinton-Kim meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton began
meetings in South Korea Saturday on a note of caution from his
host, President Kim Daejung, who doesn't want to ``blow up the
problem'' of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   After flying in from Tokyo where he raised questions about a
possible increasingly hostile posture from North Korea, Clinton met
with Kim on regional security and planned to discuss the Korean
economy with Seoul community leaders.
	   The two leaders made no public statements before their private
meetings at the South Korean presidential Blue House.
	   Kim, the longtime dissident and democracy advocate who was
elected president last December, told reporters he would urge the
American president not to press North Korea too hard about a
suspected nuclear site U.S. officials want to inspect.
	   Kim has advocated a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement toward
North Korea, which considers the United States an enemy and remains
in a technical state of war with South Korea 45 years after the
Korean War cease-fire.
	   A number of contacts have been taking place in recent months,
including a visit to North Korea in recent days by a State
Department delegation led by special envoy Charles Kartman for
talks on possible inspections
	   ``We need patience when dealing with North Korea,'' Kim said.
``Without any conclusive evidence, it is not a good idea to blow up
the problem.''
	   Clinton, at a news conference in Tokyo with Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, expressed concern about news reports on North Korea,
including one that it planned more long-range missile tests.
	   ``There are some disturbing signs there,'' Clinton said,
criticizing a North Korean demand for dlrs 300 million to allow
inspection of the large underground site in a mountainside at
Keumjongri, 40 kms northeast of Yongbyon, North Korea's main
nuclear complex.
	   Clinton rejected North Korean terms for inspections of the site
as ``completely unacceptable.''
	   North Korea fired a missile over Japanese territory in August,
rattling nerves in Tokyo, Seoul and Washington.
	   In a reminder of U.S. military muscle, Clinton planned a visit
to a training center near the demilitarized zone and inspection of
combat vehicles such as Apache attack helicopters, M-1 Abrams tanks
and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. He also will stop at Osan Air Base,
host to U.S. Air Force U-2 spy planes that keep an eye on North
Korea.
	   The emphasis on security here follows talks in Tokyo about
Asia's economic collapse and Japan's responsibility to get its
financial house in order and help lift the rest of the region.
	   Hammered by failing banks and businesses, South Korea was one of
the hardest-hit countries. Its recession-bound economy is expected
to shrink about 7 percent this year.
	   U.S. presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling said South
Korea ``has much to be complimented on'' for accepting
belt-tightening conditions in an International Monetary Fund rescue
package.
	   ``There is obviously further work to do in ensuring that
everyone, including the large conglomerates, are doing their
part,'' Sperling said. The conglomerates, known as the chaebol,
have resisted government prodding to slim down and restructure.

Ver, former chief aide of Marcos, dies in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former military chief of staff Gen.
Fabian Ver, once the chief aide to the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos, has died in a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand following a
long illness, a family spokesman said. He was 78.
	   Ver was one of the most powerful figures during the 20-year
Marcos administration, heading the presidential security force
before being appointed by Marcos as his chief of staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after Marcos was ousted
in the ``people power'' revolt in February 1986.
	   Mel Amado Jr., a spokesman for the Ver family, told radio
station DZMM that the former general succumbed to a ``lung
malfunction complication'' early Saturday in an undisclosed Bangkok
hospital.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, quoting a Philippine embassy
officer in Bangkok, said the Ver family is making arrangements to
fly the former general's remains to Manila.
	   Former President Corazon Aquino, who succeeded Marcos, had
banned the return of Ver and his three sons, all former military
officers, on grounds that they posed a security threat.
	   Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino, continued the ban. Ramos was
Ver's deputy under the Marcos regime but later led rebel troops in
the 1986 revolt.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver was accused of involvement in the 1983 assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., Mrs. Aquino's husband, at
Manila's airport but was acquitted while Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
The trial, however, failed to determine whether Marcos or his
associates ordered the assassination.
	   Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in his
absence and the case against him has been shelved.
	   During his week radio program Saturday, President Joseph Estrada
said police and military intelligence have determined the Vers are
no longer a threat to security.
	   He said he has ordered that passports be given to members of the
Ver family so they can return home.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos follower, had said that although Ver
would have to face charges in the Aquino murder, he could not be
forced to identify the mastermind of the assassination.
	   Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she was ``deeply saddened'' by Ver's
death.
	   ``The last time I spoke to him on the telephone, I was telling
him that I am praying so that you will be able to come home and
finally find ultimate vindication,'' Mrs. Marcos said.

Former champ Frazier seeks dlrs 84 million in suit
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MICHAEL RUBINKAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ As promised, lawyers for ``Smokin' '' Joe
Frazier filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking payment for 140 acres of
land that Frazier owned in the 1970s.
	   The former heavyweight champion is seeking more than dlrs 84
million from the companies and individuals involved in a deal to
sell the tract in Northampton, Bucks County, to an Ambler resident.
Frazier claims he never received a dime in payment for the land and
was defrauded by the people he was paying to protect his interests.
The defendants denied his allegations.
	   Frazier, sharply dressed in a dark gray suit and black fedora,
told a news conference Friday that he's not out to hurt anybody.
But he said he wants his land back.
	   ``I don't want to rush anybody out of their home,'' he said. But
he said the homes would be his if the matter isn't worked out.
	   Frazier's attorney and daughter, Jacquelyn Frazier-Lyde, had
sent a letter to property owners last week that cited a
``fraudulent transfer'' and warned they were on his property.
	   ``I think the homeowners are all a little bit disturbed and
distressed about it,'' said Edward Wild, a lawyer for a homeowners'
association representing some property owners. ``They don't
understand why they've been sued. They all paid good money for
their homes.''
	   Wild called the prospect of people being put out of their homes
``unlikely,'' but said the lawsuit will make it extremely difficult
to sell a home or even refinance a mortgage.
	   Frazier-Lyde, saying her seven-year investigation had turned up
evidence of fraud ``that would blow your mind,'' wouldn't rule out
going after the homes on the land.
	   ``I could see it going to that extent because, I have to tell
you, this is not a pretty situation,'' she said. ``People have to
be held responsible. Joe worked very hard to have something, and no
one had the right to transfer his land without his consent.''
	   The lawsuit said Frazier bought the disputed tract in 1973 with
dlrs 834,000 of his boxing money. Years later, he entered into an
agreement with a company called Abcon Inc. _ whose principal was
Ambler resident Werner Fricker _ to sell it.
	   The lawsuit said that Greit Realty Trust, a real estate

Davenport, Hingis advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis-Pierce match &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis blunted the power game of Mary
Pierce 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 Friday night to gain a spot in the semifinals
of the Chase Championships.
	   The second-seeded Hingis will next play Romania's Irina Spirlea,
with the winner advancing to the unique best-of-5-sets final in
this season-ending event, the only time during the year pro women
play more than three sets.
	   In the other semifinal, the world's top-ranked player, Lindsay
Davenport, has another date with the Corel WTA Tour's hottest
player, Steffi Graf. The Madison Square Garden meeting comes six
days after Graf beat Davenport in the final of a tournament in
Philadelphia.
	   ``She is obviously playing the best tennis right now, and you
always want to kind of go up against the best, and she has
definitely been doing that her last couple of tournaments,'' Hingis
said of Graf. ``Sometimes it is great to kind of get back out there
against someone that you recently lost to and some of the stuff is
still fresh in your mind.''
	   Davenport advanced to the semifinals by easily defeating
eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-0, 6-3 in Friday night's
opener.
	   Graf advanced Thursday night with a dramatic 1-6, 6-4, 6-4
victory over No. 5 Monica Seles in the best match of the
tournament. It ran Graf's match winning streak to 12 as the
29-year-old German seeks her third title in three weeks.
	   ``Last night's match was unbelievable tennis, I thought,''
Davenport said.
	   The Hingis-Pierce match was a replay of last year's
quarterfinals, which Pierce won in three sets. This time, Hingis
didn't let it get that far.
	   She traded heavy groundstrokes with her French opponent, somehow
finding yet another angle, a winning one. She had more variety to
her game, and showed it, mixing in drop shots and regularly going
to the net to put away a winning volley.
	   Pierce called for a trainer in the first set and later iced the
back of her neck and her groin at every changeover. But it didn't
seem to bother her mobility, which is much improved over last year.
	   At one point, Pierce left the court for a few minutes. Hingis
kept limber by playing against a ball boy, who used one of her
rackets.
	   Hingis, who is assured of finishing the year ranked No. 2 behind
Davenport, is seeking her second trip to the final in her three
trips to the Garden. In her debut in 1996, she lost in five sets to
Graf.
	   Davenport raced through the opening set of her match in 19
minutes. While Tauziat provided much stiffer opposition in the
second set, there was no question as to who would win, only what
the final score would be.
	   As Davenport won game after game, Tauziat captured the Madison
Square Garden crowd, which is always pulling for the underdog. Very
little worked for Tauziat, the oldest player in the select
16-person field. And when she did win a hard-earned point, the
crowd responded warmly.
	   The loudest cheer came 30 minutes into the match when the
Frenchwoman won her first game.
	   The final point of the night was a microcosm of the entire
match.
	   Tauziat pounded what she thought was a winner deep into the
corner. Somehow, Davenport got to the ball and lifted a defensive
backhand lob into the lights. The ball bounced just inside the
sideline halfway between the service and baselines.
	   Tauziat lined it up, prepared properly, then pounded the ball
into the middle of the net.
	   It was the 14th meeting between the two, a series Davenport has
dominated. However, in recent matches, Tauziat has created problems
for the world's top-ranked player, beating the right-hander from
Newport Beach, California indoors at the Grand Slam Cup last month.
	   Prior to the match, Davenport had her right foot worked on after
the two had warmed up. The blister was the last thing that bothered
Davenport this night.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The top eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's
blue carpet. The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting now the longest of the lockout, sides
making proposals &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a morning of pessimistic predictions,
small signs of progress emerged from National Basketball
Association labor talks Friday as players and owners held their
longest negotiating session of the 143-day-old lockout.
	   By 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT), the sides had spent almost nine hours
speaking face to face, 30 minutes more than their session on Oct.
28, when Michael Jordan tried to help broker a deal.
	   At lunchtime, union president Patrick Ewing stood outside the
conference room and was heard saying to a league official: ``Let's
get back in there. I want to play.''
	   The players soon made the first move, making a change to their
earlier proposal for a possible escrow tax on player salaries in
years 4, 5 and 6 of a seven-year deal.
	   The owners later make a counterproposal that included the
change, a union spokesman said, and the players came back with yet
another offer before the sides broke for dinner.
	   The talks were expected to continue late into the night.
	   Participants in the session, speaking on condition of anonymity,
cautioned that the sides were avoiding some of the weightiest
issues _ especially the big question of what would be a fair split
of revenues. The owners have been insisting upon an eventual 50-50
split, while the players have offered some concessions that would
not kick in unless they received 60 percent.
	   ``I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said as he arrived
in the morning. ``We certainly want to, but I don't have my hopes
up right now.''
	   Equally gloomy was Jim McIlvaine of the Seattle SuperSonics, a
member of the union's bargaining team.
	   ``There's a sense that nothing's going to be done right now,''
he said.
	   After talking to players on conference calls for the past two
weeks, union officials said their orders were to withhold any more
concessions until the owners showed an inclination to compromise.
	   Friday's bargaining session, the first since Oct. 28 to include
the full negotiating teams, evolved from a telephone call NBA
commissioner David Stern placed to Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta
Hawks earlier this week. That led to a two-hour meeting Tuesday
that included Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing, Stern and
Granik.
	   While both sides agreed almost nothing was accomplished Tuesday,
they decided to see if bringing both committees to New York might
jump-start the process.
	   ``Absolutely nothing has happened to suggest that the players
are ready to make anything like what we consider to be a fair deal,
unless something has changed in the last couple of days,'' Granik
said as he arrived in the morning.
	   Hunter arrived 15 minutes later and said: ``I guess the issue is
discussing the proposals that were on the table and seeing whether
or not there's any possible movement. As I've said before, if they
are inclined to move off their position, then we are prepared to
discuss whether we're ready to move.''
	   So far, the first month and a half of the season has been
canceled, and an agreement would need to be reached in the next
week or so in order to start the season before Christmas.
	   When the sides made some progress three weeks ago on the
framework for a new deal, they talked about implementing many of
the union's concessions in the first two or three years of the new
agreement in order to halt salary growth from outpacing revenue
growth.
	   If the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries failed to drop
below an agreed-upon level _ and what that level would be is one of
the biggest points of contention _ most players would contribute up
to 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund, with the money
going back to the owners if the designated percentage was exceeded.

Inquiry finds former Rwandan armed forces receiving guns despite
</HEADLINE>
embargo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite an arms embargo on Rwanda, former
government forces and Hutu militants are receiving weapons from
throughout the region to use in neighboring Congo's civil war, a
U.N. report said Friday.
	   The new relationship between Congolese President Laurent Kabila
and Interahamwe militants and former Rwandan government troops has
conferred a legitimacy on the forces responsible for Rwanda's 1994
state-sponsored genocide that killed 500,000 people, said the
report.
	   ``This is a profoundly shocking state of affairs,'' said the
report from the International Commission of Inquiry.
	   The report recommended the U.N. Security Council strengthen its
embargo to apply not on Rwanda per se but to former Rwandan
government forces and militia.
	   ``The situation in the Great Lakes region is rapidly heading
towards a catastrophe of incalculable consequences which requires
urgent, comprehensive and decisive measures on the part of the
international community,'' the report concluded.
	   ``The danger of a repetition of tragedy comparable to the
Rwandan genocide of 1994 but on a subregional scale cannot be ruled
out.''
	   The United Nations imposed an arms embargo on Rwanda in May 1994
following the start of the Hutu massacres.
	   The commission was established in 1995 to look into violations
of the embargo. Fearing a new outbreak of violence in Rwanda, the
Security Council in April decided to reactivate the commission.
	   In its report, commission members said they had evidence that
the former government forces had received arms from armed groups in
Angola, Burundi, Uganda and elsewhere.
	   ``Most of the African governments with which the commission has
raised this question neither monitor nor report on the sale or
movement of small arms on their territories or across their
borders,'' the report said.
	   It noted that because of the war in Congo, where rebels are
trying to oust Kabila from power, their report can only be
considered as incomplete.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton began
meetings in South Korea Saturday on a note of caution from his
host, President Kim Daejung, who doesn't want to ``blow up the
problem'' of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   After flying in from Tokyo where he raised questions about a
possible increasingly hostile posture from North Korea, Clinton met
with Kim on regional security and planned to discuss the Korean
economy with Seoul community leaders.
	   The two leaders made no public statements before their private
meetings at the South Korean presidential Blue House.
	   Clinton signed the guest book: ``It is an honor to be back here
with the friendship between our nations strong and Korea moving
forward under the leadership of a true champion of freedom.''

Flyers down Hurricanes; Sabres top Maple Leafs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Ron Hextall became
Philadelphia's all-time victory leader Friday night, making 19
saves as the Flyers beat the slumping Carolina Hurricanes 3-1.
	   Hextall, now the backup to John Vanbiesbrouck, passed Bernie
Parent with his 233rd victory as the Flyers won their third
straight with a dominating performance. Parent set the previous
mark in 486 games in the 1960s and '70s, while Hextall has played
in 15 fewer games.
	   Southeast Division-leading Carolina has lost five of seven and
fell below .500 with the loss to Philadelphia, a team the
Hurricanes played to a 1-1 tie in Greensboro on Oct. 17.
	   Daniel McGillis, Petr Svoboda and Colin Forbes scored for
Philadelphia. Ray Sheppard scored for Carolina.
 &UR; Senators 4, Capitals 1
	   In Washington, the Ottawa Senators broke a six-game winless
streak, feasting on the Washington defense for the second time in
two weeks, as Alexei Yashin had a goal and an assist in a victory
over the Capitals.
	   Unlike the 8-5 loss at Ottawa on Nov. 7, this time the Senators
scored a lot and held on to win. Steve Martins, Bruce Gardiner and
Andreas Dackell also scored, with all four goals the result of
glaring mistakes by the Capitals' defense. Several nice saves by
Washington goaltender Rick Tabaracci kept the margin as close as it
was.
	   Damian Rhodes made 33 saves for the Senators, including
back-to-back close-range stops of Peter Bondra, as Washington tried
to turn up the energy in a vain effort to make up a three-goal
deficit in the third period.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Maple Leafs 1
	   In Buffalo, New York, the Sabres continued their dominance of
Toronto and grabbed a share of first place in the Northeast
Division from the Maple Leafs as Dominik Hasek made 32 saves.
	   Curtis Brown, Michal Grosek, Matthew Barnaby and Dixon Ward
scored for Buffalo, which extended its unbeaten streak to nine
games (6-0-3), including three wins over Toronto. Hasek gave up
only a second-period goal to Fredrik Modin.
	   Buffalo swept a home-and-home series with Toronto in October and
has an eight-game home unbeaten streak against the Maple Leafs
(6-0-2). Overall, the Sabres are 10-1-4 in the last 15 games
between the teams.

South Korea accuses North Korea of military provocation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea on Saturday accused North
Korea of infiltrating a ship into its waters and demanded the
communist state stop its ``reckless and provocative moves.''
	   A suspected North Korean boat crossed the fog-shrouded buffer
zone into South Korean waters on the west coast early Friday but
sped away after South Korean marines fired at it.
	   On Saturday, military investigators concluded the boat planned
to land or ferry back espionage agents in South Korea. They
believed the boat's mission was thwarted before it reached shore.
	   ``This is a clear violation of the armistice treaty and a grave
military provocation,'' the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
``We sternly warn that the North stop its reckless and provocative
moves.''
	   The infiltration attempt led South Korean marines and navy to go
on alert in Kanghwa, an island county just south of the border and
50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Seoul.
	   Soldiers were seen late Friday at check points along the roads
between Inchon and Seoul, where President Clinton was visiting.
They stood down Saturday.
	   An armistice, not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War
and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Progress in NBA lockout talks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with progress made, Stern quotes. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Progress was finally made in National Basketball
Association labor talks Friday, with players and owners making
several compromises during the longest negotiating session of the
143-day-old lockout.
	   ``I would say there has been some movement from both sides,''
commissioner David Stern said after returning from a dinner break.
``I think it's fair to say that there's an evident spirit of an
attempt to reach (agreement) on both sides.''
	   Stern tempered his enthusiasm by pointing out that the sides
remain far apart on many issues, but his comments were both
surprisingly optimistic and clearly indicative there was real
progress in trying to settle the most damaging labor dispute in
league history.
	   Asked if a deal could be reached this weekend, Stern replied:
``It's going to be hard, but everybody is determined to put in the
time.
	   ``There has been no acrimony. The only raised voices have been
in the passion of the deal, and we're trying to see whether we
can't make some progress. Everybody seems to be determined to sit
here and sit here and sit here.''
	   By the time they broke for dinner around 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT),
the sides had spent almost nine hours speaking face to face, making
it longer than their 8 1/2-hour session on Oct. 28, when Michael
Jordan tried to help broker a deal.
	   Sources involved in the talks, speaking on the condition they
not be identified, told The Associated Press each side had moved a
couple of points off its desired salary percentages. The owners had
been demanding 50 percent, while the players wanted 60.
	   The owners also agreed to accept, with conditions, the idea of a
10 percent limit on the amount of an ``escrow tax'' that could be
withheld from players' paychecks in years four, five and six of a
seven-year deal, sources said.
	   Owners continued to ask for a four-year rookie scale with a
right of first refusal in the fifth year and a 5 percent limit,
down from the old 20 percent, on yearly salary increases for
players without Larry Bird exception rights.
	   At lunchtime, union president Patrick Ewing stood outside the
conference room and was heard saying to a league official: ``Let's
get back in there. I want to play.''
	   One participant said statements made by Washington owner Abe
Pollin and union director Billy Hunter helped move the process
along, and one player said Phoenix Suns owner Jerry Colangelo was
responsible, too.
	   After players made the first move _ a change to their escrow tax
plan _ owners made a counterproposal that included the change. The
players then came back with yet another offer.
	   Talks were expected to continue late into the night on Friday.

Iraq calls UN request for documents provocative, lays out
</HEADLINE>
conditions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES 8th graf to show that diary was from Iraqi Air
Force &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq called a U.N. request for documents
about its banned weapons program ``provocative rather than
professional'' and laid out conditions for arms inspectors to see
one of the more contentious items.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, on Friday told
the chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that many of the
requested documents were destroyed or never existed. Whatever
information was available about other documents has already been
submitted, he wrote in two letters.
	   The United States, which has threatened Iraq with military
action if it doesn't cooperate with inspectors, called the Iraqi
responses insufficient and said Baghdad needs to provide more
information about its weapons program.
	   The dispute was the first glitch between Iraq and the U.N.
Special Commission since Baghdad announced Saturday that it would
reverse its Oct. 31 decision to halt cooperation with the weapons
experts charged with destroying Iraq's lethal weapons. The
announcement staved off what U.S. officials have said were imminent
U.S. airstrikes.
	   Based on Iraq's weekend pledge, the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, sent Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz three letters this week asking for documents about its
missiles, and chemical and biological weapons programs.
	   Inspectors must certify that those weapons have been destroyed
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf war.
	   Inspectors worked for a third day in Iraq on Friday.
	   In particular, Butler asked for an Iraqi air force diary, which
inspectors discovered during a July search but were prevented from
taking, that detailed munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton mentioned the document in his speech
Sunday, listing what information Iraq must hand over if it is to
see sanctions lifted.
	   In his letter Friday, al-Qaisi said the document was beyond the
scope of the inspectors' mandate. Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N.
experts could view ``relevant portions'' of it in the presence of
the U.N. chief's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   Butler's request to view other archives from the Defense
Ministry ``seems to be provocative rather than professional,'' he
wrote.
	   Butler responded late Friday by sending yet another letter to
Aziz asking for ``a constructive reply'' to his request.
	   In a separate letter to the council, Butler said the Air Force
document was directly related to UNSCOM's mandate because it dealt
with Iraq's use of bombs and rockets that were filled with chemical
agents.
	   He noted that the council has already demanded Iraq deliver the
contentious document to the Special Commission.
	   Washington agrees with Butler's views that these responses are
not sufficient and that Iraq needs to provide further disclosure, a
U.S. official said, speaking on condition he not be identified.
	   Butler said he was also concerned with Iraq's responses to his
request for documents about its biological weapons program.
Inspectors have consistently said Baghdad's declarations about the
program are far from complete.
	   ``Iraq's reply seems to indicate that it is not prepared to do
any further disarmament work with the commission in the biological
weapons area, unless required to do so by the Security Council,
following a comprehensive review,'' Butler wrote.
	   The council promised the review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions in return for Iraq's resumption of cooperation with
inspectors. Iraq hopes the process will lead to a lifting of the
oil embargo which has devastated its economy.
	   Butler also contested al-Qaisi's determination that all records
on its production of VX had been turned over to inspectors. Butler
said such records only go through 1988. ``Iraq's declared
production of VX in 1990 remains unverified,'' he wrote.
	   Iraq's deputy U.N. ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said Iraq was still
committed to cooperating with UNSCOM and said Iraq's willingness to
allow inspectors to view the Air Force document showed its
eagerness to do so.
	   ``What they want is full submission, and they will never, never
get it,'' he said. ``Full cooperation is different than full
submission.''

Government to release budget, other figures for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has decided to start releasing key
financial data, including the national budget, for the first time,
a government official said Saturday.
	   ``It will help sustain the democratic rights of the people to
inspect and supervise the use and management of state funds to
encourage the practice of thrift and to curb wastfulness and
corruption,'' the official said.
	   Many of the figures that will be released traditionally have
been treated as state secrets in Vietnam, with officials who leaked
them subject to prosecution.
	   The decision, signed Friday by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung, is effective in 15 days.
	   Information to be released includes annual budget estimates,
revenues and spending at the national, provincial and local levels,
local newspapers reported. It will include development investment,
education and training, health care, culture, sports and other
national programs.
	   State-owned enterprises will have to release such figures as
their financial status, business results and income of their
employees.
	   Units under the armed forces or party organizations and units in
charge of national reserves are to release internally their regular
spending and revenue, the papers reported.
	   However, figures on national reserves and the assets, budget
estimates and spending for national defense and security are not
subject to publication, the papers reported.
	   Funds raised from the people by authorities will be subject to
annual reporting on the purposes, use and fund-raising methods, as
well the rights and obligations of the beneficaries and other
details.
	   Alleged abuse of such funds sparked rural unrest in several
areas last year when complaints about local corruption failed to
generate a response.
	   The government has since moved to increase accountability by
officials at all levels.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis threatens global epidemic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Kraig cq, 3rd graf
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Preventing the emergence of incurable
forms of tuberculosis and containing the epidemic will be the focus
of a four-day Global Congress on Lung Health opening Monday in
Bangkok, which brings together some 1,500 lung disease experts from
90 countries.
	   Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway and
new director general of the World Health Organization, will issue a
statement during the opening ceremony calling for support of a new
TB control initiative.
	   About one-third of the world's people are infected with
tuberculosis, the majority of them in Asia, said Kraig Klaudt,
acting chief of the WHO's policy and strategy arm of its global
tuberculosis program. Most of them never develop symptoms.
	   Yet 8 million people a year actually become sick with TB and
nearly 3 million die, Klaudt said. That makes TB the worst
infectious disease killer among people older than five years.
	   Childhood vaccinations for TB wear off in adulthood, Klaudt
said, but very few adults are aware of how vulnerable to TB they
are. There is no adult vaccine.
	   Tuberculosis is curable. The problem is, treatment is normally a
six-month program of taking medicine daily. Many people stop taking
the medicine after a month or so when the symptoms disappear and
they feel better.
	   That can leave the strongest TB bacilli still in the lungs,
resistant to drugs and ready to infect new people. This
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis _ MDR-TB to specialists _ costs
100 times more to treat and usually proves fatal.
	   ``This turns TB from an easily curable disease into an almost
incurable disease,'' Klaudt said.
	   The evolution of drug-resistant tuberculosis is converging with
the spread of AIDS, which destroys the immune system that normally
prevents TB infection from developing into illness.
	   Tuberculosis accounts for up to half of the AIDS deaths in Asia
and Africa, Klaudt said, but the TB epidemic would still be
spreading without it. Only 10 percent of TB deaths are AIDS
related.
	   Preventing the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis means
getting people infected with ordinary TB to finish their treatment.
The WHO is pushing a strategy called DOTS _ Directly Observed
Treatment, Short-course.
	   It means getting a health worker, volunteer or work supervisor
to observe a TB patient take medication every day and monitor their
progress until they are cured.
	   The WHO says countries that have DOTS systems have seen the TB
cure rate double from about 40 percent to 80 percent. Most
Southeast Asian countries and about half of China have them. India
just started one.
	   Though the system is labor intensive, the World Bank has judged
it cost-effective when the costs of drug-resistant TB treatment,
lost wages and other factors are taken into account.
	   In many countries, TB is an invisible problem since it usually
affects the poorest people. The affluent are able to afford
medication through the six-month period of treatment. But with the
drug-resistant strains, that could change _ the treatment costs 100
times as much.
	   ``TB could become more difficult to cure for all classes of
society,'' Klaudt said. ``We have a window of opportunity over the
next decade to implement the DOTS strategy and prevent the
emergence of MDR-TB.''

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army
left Hong Kong Friday after completing their terms and returned to
their hometowns, a statement from the PLA's Hong Kong office said
Saturday.
	   They will be replaced at the end of the month, a PLA spokesman
who gave his name only as Luo said. He said the number of troops
who left could not be disclosed for security reasons.
	   The troops who left had completed their terms according to the
People's Republic of China Military Service Law, the statement
said.
	   About 4,700 Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong
since the territory was returned to Chinese rule in July 1997.
	   With the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 still in their
memories, many Hong Kong people were wary of their arrival.
	   Apart from their march into the territory hours after the
handover, the troops have since stayed largely out of sight.
Thousands of local citizens have attended a handful of open houses
at PLA quarters since the handover.
