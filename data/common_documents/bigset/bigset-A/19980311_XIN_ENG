<HEADLINE> Egypt, Libya Sign Maritime Transport Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Libya signed a maritime
transport protocol Tuesday to push forward cooperation in this
field and facilitate trade between the two sides, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed in Libyan capital Tripoli by Lashin Al
Khakhni, secretary of the Libyan General Authority for Maritime
Transport and Harbors, and Fouad Sherin Al Kaddi, counselor for
maritime transport affairs at the Egyptian Transport and
Communications Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The officials, at the end of their three days of talks in
Tripoli, stressed the need to overcome all difficulties and
obstacles hindering movement of citizens and commodities in
maritime transport sector.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to exchange data on up-to-date technology in
maritime transport field.
</P>
<P>
The two sides further agreed to discuss a draft agreement on
cooperation between maritime transport companies in both countries
and to extend Casablanca (Morocco)-Tripoli maritime line to reach
northern Egyptian port Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Egypt and Libya have been languishing since the
U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargos on Tripoli in 1992
to force it to extradite two Libyans suspected of involvement in
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to the U.S. or Britain.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Egypt and the Arab League stepped up efforts to have
the sanctions lifted.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Hopes for Closer Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany hopes for closer economic
relations with Hong Kong, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was talking with Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, who is
on his first official visit to Germany since Hong Kong's return to
China last July.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, which focused on the present financial
turmoil in Southeast Asia, Kinkel said that despite the financial
crisis there, people still held great confidence in that region.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel stressed that Germany, being an export-led economy, paid
much attention to the financial crisis facing its Asian trading
partners. He noted that his country was a partner with Asia, and
the partnership was not merely to share good times.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that despite some impact from the financial turmoil,
Hong Kong's economy remains good. In particular, Hong Kong
successfully maintained its linked exchange rate, which was a
support for people's confidence in Hong Kong as a financial center.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Hong Kong was the world's biggest port for container
entrepot transport, and helped the rest of China by handling half
its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said Germany had the world's third largest ship building
industry. Shipyards in northern Germany, which led in the building
of special cargo vessels, had a great interest in strengthening
cooperation with Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Reject Bicommunal Talks for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of the Turkish
Cypriot regime in the Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus has
rejected further peace negotiations and Turkish Cypriot
participation in the European Union (EU) accession talks.
</P>
<P>
This position was contained in a resolution approved in the
parliament Tuesday, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, supported by right-wing parties backing Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, sets the recognition of the
self-declared state in northern areas as a precondition.
</P>
<P>
It echoes previous statements by Denktash who said he would not
participate in U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities unless his breakaway
Republic is recognized.
</P>
<P>
"From now on the Greek Cypriots should accept that there are
two states on the island," the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So far the U.N.-led peace negotiations between the two sides
have been held under the names of the two communities' leaders.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stepped up his intransigence in the peace efforts
last December when the EU confirmed that accession talks with the
Cyprus Republic will begin on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot side oppose Cyprus' accession to
the EU before Turkey joins the union.
</P>
<P>
Greece is already an EU member, while Turkey's accession
application has been frozen.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot position has been rejected by the EU,
which has said accession talks will be held as scheduled and at
the same time called on the Cypriot government to propose a
formula for Turkish Cypriot participation in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government is expected to submit its proposals
later this month, but it has set a precondition that the
accession talks will be carried out by its official delegation
and that Turkish Cypriots participating in the delegation must
back the Cyprus Republic's EU bid.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Soeharto's Re-election Helps Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- With the re-election of
Indonesian President Soeharto to his seventh term of office on
Tuesday, the 76-year-old retired general is expected to lead his
country into the 21st century, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Five factions in the People's Consultlative Assembly (MPR)
unanimously elected him to the 1998-2003 term of presidency in a
voice vote.
</P>
<P>
Most observers here said the significance of Soeharto's
re-election is that he is the only man at the moment who can
maintain political stability in his country which has been badly
hit by the worst financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who came to power in 1967, has run unopposed in all
the seven elections in this Southeast Asian country which has
17,500 islands that straddle the equator.
</P>
<P>
The president gets strong support from the ruling Golkar Party
which has 588 of the 1,000 seats in the MPR, the faction of the
Armed Forces with 75 seats and a number of regional
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for Soeharto's re-election is the remarkable
economic achievements over the past 20 years under his New Order
government, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto launched his economic program in 1969 with a five-year
short-term development mechanism coupled with a 25-year long-term
plan to develop the country's economy stage-by-stage towards a
take-off phase.
</P>
<P>
During the years between 1960 and 1965, the national economy
grew by a mere average of 2.1 percent annually. After the
stabilization and rehabilitation carried out by the Soeharto
government between 1966 and 1968, economic growth reached an
average of six percent.
</P>
<P>
The economy expanded at an average of seven percent a year
during the period of the first 25-year long-term development plan.
</P>
<P>
The MPR conferred the title of "the father of development" on
Soeharto in 1983 in recognition of his success in bringing the
nation out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country with a
population of over 200 million, now has a diversified economy. The
country's per capita income stood at 1,088 U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government's achievements in the past three
decades have won President Soeharto high prestige in the country
as well as in the world. Many people are pinning great hopes on
the elected president in overcoming the current monetary crisis
which has hit Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries since
July last year.
</P>
<P>
Along with the depreciation of other Asian currencies, the
Indonesian rupiah has also fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar,
reaching as low as 15,000 to 17,000 per dollar in January this
year. The rupiah was traded at about 2,400 to the dollar in July
1997 when the financial turmoil was about to hit the region.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil has resulted in price hikes, the increased number
of laid-off workers, the dented purchasing power of local
residents and a slowdown in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the crisis, the Indonesian government has taken
various measures including wide-ranging economic and financial
reform packages signed with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In his accountability speech at the opening of the MPR General
Session on March 1, Soeharto said his government was determined to
overcome the problems. "We shall fight all-out to extricate
ourselves from the crisis."
</P>
<P>
MPR members, who are attending the plenary session, Tuesday
expressed their belief that President Soeharto's re-election for
the 1998/2003 term will help ease the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"All people hope that he would have the strength to implement
the mandate given him by the Assembly," Chief of the Indonesian
Armed Forces (ABRI) Gen. Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Hari Sabarno, chairman of the ABRI faction at the MPR,
also said: "With such efforts, the economic situation is expected
to return to normal and the political and security stability to
remain under control in the near future or at the latest, by the
end of the present sixth five-year development plan (1994-1999)."

<HEADLINE> Tung: Asian Recovery Expected A Year or Two Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frankfurt, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Tuesday
said he expected that Asia would begin to recover from the current
financial turmoil one or two years later.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the Asian crisis to bottom out in a year or two
and we shall then witness a slow but sure road to recovery", he
said while speaking at a lunch hosted by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis in Asia has been painful to us all. But
the fundamentals of Asia have not changed", he said, citing young
and flexible workforce, the high savings rate, openness to trade
and ideas and people's indomitable will to improve themselves in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Tung is on his first official visit to Germany after Hong
Kong's return to China last July. He arrived in Germany on Sunday
evening and is scheduled to leave on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tung believed that social stability, strong and
accountable governments with sound macroeconomic policies are
particularly necessary for the recovery in the Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted the absence of sound macroeconomic policy and the
poor regulation of financial markets in the Asian countries which
have been badly affected by the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Tung reaffirmed that Hong Kong will stick to its linked
exchange rates, adding: "I do not believe we need to devalue the
Hong Kong dollar. It is not in Hong Kong's interest to do so."
</P>
<P>
Concerning Hong Kong's ties with the European Union (E.U.),
Tung told reporters after the lunch that while keeping up the
close link with Britain, he expects strengthened ties with
Germany, France and other E.U. member countries.
</P>
<P>
Tung also expressed the belief that Hong Kong will have a good
chance to achieve its objective to get visa-free access to all
E.U. member states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks Canada to Join In Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright asked Canada Tuesday to join the U.S. in
adopting new sanctions against Yugoslavia for its violence against
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"Today I will ask Canada to join us in adopting new sanctions
that can stop the killing, keep it from spreading and encourage a
real political solution to the crisis," she told a breakfast
gathering here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government announced Monday a series of sanctions
against Yugoslavia, including suspending Canadian export credits
to Yugoslavia and negotiations over Canadian landing rights for
Yugoslavian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral duty to do today what we have failed to do in
1991 when the war in the former Yugoslavia began," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The violence in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo is expected
to be one of the international issues that Albright will discuss
with her Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
She will also exchange views with Axworthy on a broad range of
topics including the United Nations, the Middle East and Haiti,
according to the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, bilateral issues such as Pacific salmon,
environmental cooperation and Canada-U.S. border collaboration
will also be discussed during Albright's brief visit here, the
first official one by a U.S. secretary of state in a decade.

Addressing a meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)

<HEADLINE> Canada's Corel Cuts Software Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ottawa-based Corel Corp. is
slashing prices for its flagship software to try and capture a big
share of the emerging market for cheap computers, reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This round of price cuts is expected to result in sales jump
that will help the software maker to be profitable in 1998,
according to Corel Vice-President of Sales Don Sylvester.
</P>
<P>
The lower prices coincide with an anticipated jump in sales of
new network computers, which are expected to sell for less than
1,000 U.S. dollars, Sylvester said.
</P>
<P>
An upgrade version of Corel's WordPerfect Suite 8 Professional
word processing package will now carry a suggested retail price of
179 U.S. dollars, compared to the 249 U.S. dollar tag the product
carried when it was first released last August.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the price reductions may not have much effect on
Corel's revenue since a lot of the WordPerfect software is already
being sold at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
The move looks a lot more like a repeat of the cut-rate
approach that led to Corel's re cord 162 million U.S. dollars loss
in fiscal 1997, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Kabbah Back in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone who was ousted in a coup last May 25 returned to the
capital Freetown Tuesday morning after nearly ten months
self-exile in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 jubilant Sierra Leoneans gathered at the
National Stadium in Freetown to celebrate Kabbah's comeback by
singing and dancing in a festive mood, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha, chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) and Nigerian head of state, was with
Kabbah at the National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was said to be warmly welcomed by the people who were
grateful to the overthrow of the military junta in Freetown by
the Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the gathering were Guinean President Lansana
Conte, Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare and Nigerien President
Mahamane Ousmane, as well as Zimbabwean foreign minister, who was
sent by President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, both Kabbah and Abacha are expected
to make a speech later Tuesday on the occasion, along with a
statement from United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
While the celebration of Kabbah's return was going on all over
the capital, the northern town Kenema, once the site of heavy
fighting between the runaway junta forces and civil defense
groups, was also a scene of jubilation.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people went out to the streets, displaying
banners, singing and dancing, and praising ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Like the people in other parts of the country, Kenema
residents also sent their representatives to Freetown to welcome
the return of President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
As life has begun to return normal across the country after
the fall of the junta in mid-February, Sierra Leoneans are in
high expectation that Kabbah and his government will do a good
job for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reconciliation of
the nation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Can Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore met here on Tuesday
to discuss Russia-U.S. cooperation on space and other economic and
technology areas.
</P>
<P>
The 10th meeting of the U.S.-Russian Commission on Economic and
Technological Cooperation is "an historic occasion", said Gore at
the opening session of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
that the commission has worked to "expand areas of cooperation and
to advance concrete practical joint projects that have...brought
our two great countries closer together."
</P>
<P>
"Time and again, the commission has demonstrated the dynamism
and potential of the U.S.-Russian partnership," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But "the dynamism and potential" are not easy to find in the
political and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to expand into the former Warsaw Pact countries has aroused
strong opposition from Russia, which feels threatened by the move.
</P>
<P>
On all occasions, the Russian authorities warned Washington
and its allies of severe consequences resulted from the
alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
The arms control process is slowed down. Russia's Duma, the
parliament, still refused to ratify the START II treaty between
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq weapons inspection crisis, Russia strongly opposed
the use of force by Washington and upheld a diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
A war was averted in the Gulf after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan signed an accord with Iraqi authorities. Some analysts say
the success is partly resulted from Russia's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia also have differences on the crisis in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo. After Washington insists that tougher
sanctions be imposed on Belgrade, Moscow is against the idea.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in London attended by foreign ministers from
Russia, Germany, the U.S., Britain, France and Italy, Russia
only agreed to accept two measures of the four, which are aimed
at intensifying pressures on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is against the denial of visas for senior officials
from Belgrade and the moratorium on government financed credit
support for trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
As more political and security disputes are building up, the
two great powers are seeking cooperation on economic, trade, and
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries so far has reached
seven billion U.S. dollars and the investment from the U.S. in
Russia turns to be the biggest among foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 10th meeting of the Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission,
the two sides are expected to map out economic cooperation plan
for the 21st century and sign about 20 contracts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that both Moscow and Washington are taking
practical attitudes in developing their relations. Russia needs
help from the U.S. in establishing a strong economy and eventually
recovering its status as a superpower while the U.S. needs
Russia's cooperation, not confrontation, on both international and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the essential differences of two countries' foreign
policies will certainly bring more disputes in their relations.
Washington claims it is the "world leader" and continue to pursue
the establishment of a one-polar world while Russia upholds that
the domination of one superpower should be avoided and a
multi-lateral world order be built.
</P>
<P>
The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission may facilitate the economic
and trade, science and technology relations between the two
countries, but will not be able to repair the whole relations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that even the cooperation on economic and trade,
science and technology could be in problem in future with the
growth of Russia's muscles.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Blames EU for Deadlock in Cyprus Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash Tuesday blamed the European Union (EU) for the deadlock
in U.N.-led intercommunal talks aimed at reaching a Cyprus
settlement.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in the Turkish-controlled northern part of
Nicosia with visiting U.S. State Department Special Coordinator
for Cyprus Thomas Miller, Denktash told reporters that "the EU
destroyed all chances for a solution in Cyprus," Cyprus
Broadcasting Corporation TV reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus' EU application was made in order to destroy
the balance between Greece and Turkey in Cyprus. If the
application proceeds, "then there will be two Cypruses on the map
in the future," Denktash warned.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question that his breakaway state unilaterally
declared in 1983 in northern Cyprus is not recognized by any
state other than Turkey, Denktash said "the fact that Turkey
recognizes us is our guarantee, it is sufficient for us. We will
go on for ever."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future of U.N.-led peace process aimed at
finding a resolution of the Cyprus problem, Denktash said that the
process, known as intercommunal talks, was destroyed by the EU
and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Denktash rejected the proposal for Turkish Cypriot
participation in EU accession talks, saying that he does not
recognize the government of the Republic of Cyprus, which is
recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
He also said he does not expect the EU to make any contacts
with him. "I am not making any contacts with the EU either," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Denktash refused to meet with EU External Relations
Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and British special envoy for
Cyprus David Hannay, who visited Cyprus last week, to protest
the EU over its decision to start accession talks with the
Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with Miller, Denktash said all aspects of the
Cyprus problem were discussed and the U.S. official was "a very
good listener."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island following a
failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bi-zonal and
bi-communal federal state, but so far no tangible results have
been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Tourism Delegation Attends Berlin Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A team of 31 Tanzanian
tourist company executives have left for Berlin to attend an
international tourist fair, said the acting managing director of
the Tanzania Tourist Board, Peter Mwenguo.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by the Minister for Natural Resources and
Tourism, Zakia Meghji, is to advertise Tanzania as one of the
best tourist destinations in Africa, Mwenguo told the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The annual tourist exhibition, known as the International
Tourism Exchange, usually attracts key tourist business
practitioners from all over the world to exhibit their tourist
products and services.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Berlin exhibition is the third of a series of
international tourist exhibitions this year. The first exibition
took place in Madrid, Spain, between January 28 and February 1
while the second was held in Milan, Italy, from February 25 to
March 1.
</P>
<P>
Other fairs where Tanzanian companies are expected to take
part in will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden, from March 19 to 22,
Arabian Travel Market, Dubai of United Arab Emirates, from May 5
to 8.
</P>
<P>
The companies will also participate in the European Incentive
and Business Travel and Meetings in Geneva, Switzerland, from May
12 to May 14, and the 23rd Africa Travel Association (ATA)
International Travel Congress and Trade Show in northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a major foregin exchange earner of Tanzania, which
brought the country 390 million US dollars last year. Statistics
place Tanzania in second place as a tourist destination in east
African countries, with 326,000 tourist arrivals after Kenya with
700,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Growth Slows to 1.7 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the U.S.
productivity slowed a bit to 1.7 percent in 1997, the Labor
Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the fourth quarter, 1.6 percent at an annual
rate, was revised down from last month's 2 percent estimate,
according to the department. And it was less than half the rapid
3.6 percent spurt in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the fourth-quarter change didn't affect the estimated
productivity gain of 1.7 percent for all of 1997, which followed a
1.9 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Judged by recent standards, productivity during the past two
years has been pretty good. Productivity advanced a paltry 1
percent a year, on average, from 1974 through 1995 after having
risen at a robust annual average of nearly 3 percent during the
1960s and earlier in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish productivity in the 1970s and 1980s has been
attributed to a host of economic problems, including widening
economic inequality and slipping purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, a key barometer of inflation pressures, rose
2.1 percent in 1997, not much more than the 1.9 percent increase
in 1996. But, they shot up 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter,
revised from last month's 3 percent estimate and the most since
the third quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Meet on Formation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An unusual and sensitive
two-day meeting by the National Salvation Council (NSC) on the
formation of administration for Mogadishu was concluded here late
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been assessing what has been accomplished from
the Cairo agreement by the Somali factions, their failures and
the obstacles they have met thus far.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by the majority of the NSC's executive
committee, including Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Ali Atto, was
chaired by Abdulkadir Mohamed Aden Zoppo, current chairman of the
council, who belongs to the Rahanwein communities of Bay and
Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
According to members of the council, Tuesday's meeting
analyzed a letter response they received Monday night from
Hussein Aidid's faction over earlier proposals they made
concerning the setting up of an administration for the capital
and the convening of the National Reconciliation Conference in
Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
NSC's proposal letter underlined Hussein Aidid's attitude
relating his claim of presidency broadcast on his radio.
</P>
<P>
The proposal letter also uncovered the need to minimize the
power of the future prime minister according to the proposed
amendments of the NSC in Addis Ababa after the Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's side called on the National Coordination
Committee to form a technical committee to discuss and conclude a
final decision in this regard. Hussein Aidid's faction also
pressed for the immediate formation of a coalition force to
secure the stability of the forthcoming conference in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The NSC meeting Tuesday fully endorsed Hussein Aidid's answers
to their quests which were made as precondition for the opening
of talks to establish an all-inclusive administration for
Mogadishu. The meeting then approved that the executive committee
of the NSC open talks with Hussein Aidid's faction from Wednesday
onwards over the immediate formation of Mogadishu's
administration.
</P>
<P>
Since their arrival from Cairo late last year, Hussein Aidid
and the NSC, have been busy holding separate meetings in the
search for a lasting solution for Somalia's multi-politicized
societies.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Reconciliation Conference due to be held
in Baidoa by the end of this month will not be convened unless an
administration is established for Mogadishu and that the air and
seaports be opened.
</P>
<P>
The people in the capital have been demoralized by the fact
that the leaders were merely engrossed in matters relating to the
reconciliation conference rather than the issue of the capital,
which would be a key to all solutions.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of Mogadishu has been set as precondition for
the release of all funds for the reconciliation conference by the
sympathizers of the Cairo peace accord.

BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bayer AG, one of Germany's leading
chemicals concerns, Tuesday reported a 20.4 percent increase in
its operating result last year, which reached 5.4 billion marks
(2.95 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Leverkusen-based company said the group net income rose 7.9

<HEADLINE> Most Nigerian States not Viable Economically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeira's Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) has said that 34 of the 36 states in the country
are not economically viable.
</P>
<P>
In the "1996 Socio-economic Profile of Nigeria", FOS pointed
out that only Lagos, the economic center, and Rivers state in the
south could support themselves without relying on allocation from
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
"In several states, the internally generated revenue was less
than 20 percent of total revenue or recurrent expenditure," it
said.
</P>
<P>
FOS therefore advised that efforts should be made by the
states to obtain more revenue from internal sources.
</P>
<P>
The organization also noted that there had increased
participation of men and women in the labor force although the
level of women participation was still very low in many states.
</P>
<P>
"To increase production and enhance their level of
empowerment, more women should be involved in economic
activities," FOS said.
</P>
<P>
It advised further that steps should be taken toward ensuring
that women are not discriminated against in employment matters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspections Experts to Visit Iraq in Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations weapons
experts will make their first visit in about two weeks to Iraq's
presidential sites under an agreement reached by Annan on
February 23, U.N. officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. experts will be accompanied by senior diplomats as
required by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first visits to all eight presidential compounds would be
so-called "baseline" surveys to set the groundwork for future
inspections of these sites, the U.N. official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday presented a detailed
plan for the U.N. inspections to the eight presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the first slew of inspections is to test Annan's
deal with the Iraqi leadership, which averted a threatened
military action by the United States and Britain late last month.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. and Britain have kept troops, planes and warships
in the Gulf region. Washington and London have said that they will
not withdraw the military forces until they see that the agreement
is being carried out.
</P>
<P>
The eight Iraqi compounds are spread over 12 square miles.
They include 1,058 residences, palaces, warehouses, garages and
other buildings.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Support Nigerians' Choice of Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) has urged the Nigerian government to keep faith with the
October 1 date for installing a democratically elected
government, but it will not interfere in who becomes the
president.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said here Monday that
the organization supported Nigeria's transition to civil rule but
it considered the choice of the president an entirely internal
affair.
</P>
<P>
"All we can say is that it is very important that the
commitment given by the Nigerian government to ensure the return
of the civilian administration by October this year is kept,"
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we have supported and this is what we will
continue to support," added Salim, who was on the way to Sierra
Leone to attend the reinstatement ceremony of the government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah billed for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition program, presidential election is to be
held on August in Nigeria. But it seems that all parties
concerned are waiting for the decision of the head of state
General Sani Abacha on whether or not he is to contest the polls.
</P>
<P>
To many Nigerians, if Abacha would run for the race, few could
have a victory over him.
</P>
<P>
However, the head of state has kept silence on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last week, pro-Abacha groups organized a two-day rally in the
capital of Abuja, a move observers see as the last resort to
press Abacha to come out for the election.
</P>
<P>
The government-supported two-million-man rally went on in good
order but an anti-Abacha rally, which the organizer wanted to
draw five million participants in the economic center of Lagos,
was dispersed by the police even before the meeting was
officially started.
</P>
<P>
While the protesters vowed to sue the government for the
depression of the Lagos rally, many people are expecting a
successful transition to civil rule as scheduled.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- King of Saudi Arabia Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz Tuesday received a letter from French President Jaques
Chirac on boosting further bilateral relations, Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine to Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chirac expressed desire to further boost the
warm and distinguished relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The message also dealt with the latest regional and
international developments and issues of mutual concern, namely
the international efforts to ensure Iraq's implementation of the
recent agreement with U.N. on arms inspections, the stalemate in
the Middle East peace process and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Chirac recently declared that he would not allow "phased dying
of the peace process," clearly referring to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bids to jeopardize the peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, political, economic and cultural ties between
France and Saudi Arabia have been promoted as France is making
efforts to expand its influence in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday night on a
three-day official visit, held talks with Saudi government
officials Tuesday on ways of promoting economic cooperation and
arms supply to Saudi Arabia, Saudi official sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal also
discussed other Arab issues such as Israel's occupation of
southern Lebanon and Iran's new foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged Against "Obscene Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) - The Tanzanian government
has urged citizens to support the fight against the prejudicial
religious preaching which threatens the national peace and
stability, local newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Yusuf Makamba said in
a meeting with residents here that Muslim worshipers should leave
the mosques immediately after their prayers and refrain from
listening to any following obscene preaching.
</P>
<P>
He also cited tribalism and racism as other vices which could
put the nation at a high risk of disorder and violence.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the accusations made by some Moslems that he was
an agent for the Christianity and enemy of Islam because of his
bloody handling of recent riots in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"I am more Muslim than these religious fundamentalists could
ever be," he argued. "If the Sheikhs at Mwembechai mosque were
real Muslims, they would not castigate the government."
</P>
<P>
On February 13, police opened fire at a rioting group near the
Mwembechai mosque in downtown Dar es Salaam, killing two people
and arresting more than 200 in the first bloody and large-scale
confrontation between police and citizens since Tanzania's
independence in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Last week, A group of members from the National Assembly
(parliament) requested their speaker to summon the Legal and
Constitution Committee to probe the recent police killings of
unarmed citizens.
</P>
<P>
But Pius Msekwa rejected Monday their demand, claiming that
there is no evidence to show that the Constitution was violated
as was accused in the MPs appealing letter and no special
committee can act on a matter which is still in the court.

honor and 21-gun salute when he arrived at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state talked in private for about 15 minutes,
but Mandela said afterwards that they had discussed nothing of
substance.
</P>
<P>
He joked that because Herzog was not an executive president,
and South Africa's "de facto president" Thabo Mbeki - who is the
vice president - had not been present, they talked about purely
ceremonial matters.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents watched as German Ambassador Uwe Kaestner
and South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed agreements
for German grants and loans totalling 87 million Deutsche Marks
(about 48.2 million U.S. Dollars) for urban low-cost housing
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The financing, from the German Development Loan Corporation,
will be channelled through the Development Bank of Southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Agreements were also signed on cultural and environmental
cooperation, investment protection, air transport, and one
designed to promote maritime cooperation and trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who arrived in South Africa from Namibia on Sunday,
will address parliament on Tuesday afternoon and will be given a
state banquet by Mandela in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the largest trade partner of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Development in China's Western Regions Urged to Sped Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
urged people in the less-developed China's central and the western
parts to speed up infrastructure construction and promote economic
and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Attending a panel discussion of NPC deputies for southwestern
Guizhou Province to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) in
session here since last Thursday, Li said infrastructural
development is vital to the growth of China's central and western
parts including Guizhou Province, he said.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of transport and telecommunications will facilitate
the investment environment and speed up exploitation of rich
natural resources there, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged local people and officials to make every possible
means to help a number of township and counties with no access to
telephones, electricity for lighting and roads to join the highway
networks.
</P>
<P>
Importance should be attached to the development of
intellectual property and, only when the related efforts to fight
poverty are integrated with the enhancement of local people's
educational level and cultural and technological standards, the
pace for local needy to becomed better off will be sped up, Li said.
And he described this as the fundamental policy in eliminating poverty.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Targets World Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is sparing no
efforts to promote its trade with other countries in the world,
Alec Erwin, Minister of the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI), said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing, Erwin said his department had worked out a
strategy to promote international dialogue and trade while trying
to attract more investment to speed up national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy was designed to make South African economy more
competitive," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
In a timetable provided by the DTI, the department will send
nine trade and investment missions to visit 17 countries in
southeast Asia, west Europe, west and east Africa, and north
America from March to September this year.
</P>
<P>
The countries to be visited are China, Holland, Belgium,
Luxemburg, Spain, the United States, Sweden, Norway, Finland,
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia,
Thailand and Canada.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/99 financial year, the department will also
participate in 17 international trade fairs and exhibitions due
to be held in Zimbabwe, Singapore, Canada, Britain, France,
Tanzania, Mozambique, China, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Argentina and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the impact of high crime rate in South Africa,
Erwin acknowledged the seriousness of the problem, but expressed
belief that crime would not hamper foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In his briefing, the minister said his department was also
trying to restructure itself so as to make it more efficient in
leading domestic industries to international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to DTI officials, export councils, which draw
together exporters and the government, are being established to
determine the export potential and international competitiveness
of various sectors, identify foreign market niches, and devise
measures to overcome barriers to export growth.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said, foreign potential buyers and investors
with export potential are being invited to visit South Africa to
explore trade, joint ventures and investment opportunities.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South African researchers
have created four new disease and drought resistant peanut
varieties using advanced genetic manipulation technology, South
African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lowveld Agricultural Research Unit said Tuesday that it
investigated 95 varieties of peanuts before refining the four new
sub-types to meet specific soil and weather conditions in
Mpumalanga Province in northeast South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The principal scientist of the unit, Cherian Matthews, said
all four varieties offered emergent and other small farmers
better yields, lower infestation of mhliwane (alectra parasite),
a larger seed size and a good nutty taste.
</P>
<P>
Matthews said the new varieties were designed to cut chemical
fertilizer and related costs for smaller commercial farmers,
while providing subsistence farmers with a reliable back-up crop
during dry periods.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is frequently struck by drought and the northern
rural areas are usually the hardest hit.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, who was hospitalized Monday, is in good health
conditions, Saudi Crown Prince announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement by Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz carried on Saudi Press
Agency said he was responding calls from Arab, Islamic and Western
leaders inquiring about the King's health condition.
</P>
<P>
The king was admitted to hospital in Riyadh Monday for a
medical check-up following a gall bladder infection. Reports said
he underwent a surgery.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, now 76, suffered a stroke in November 1995 which
resulted in a temporary hand-over of power to his younger
half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He was treated by a U.S. medical team during a 10-day stay at
hospital and underwent a medical checkup followed by a three-month
period of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, King Fahd resumed activities and received
several visiting foreign leaders. He has been governing the world
top oil producer and exporter since June 13, 1982.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prince did not say whether the King has left the
hospital or not.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is pumping 8.9 million barrels of oil per
day. Any instability or major changes in the Kingdom have
traditionally had swift effects on oil prices, and energy import
bills of oil-consuming countries.

PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China,
will pay a three-day visit to France from Wednesday, announced the
French Foreign Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tung will meet with President Jacques Chirac,
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, President of the French Senate Rene
Monory, France's business leaders and representatives of the
Chinese community in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Tung will also visit the industrial city of Lyon Thursday at
the invitation of the Mayor of Lyon, Raymond Barre.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Tung's visit,
the first of its kind, is aimed at reinforcing the already very
close relations between France and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This visit in France will mark our attachment, in the
particular context of the financial crisis which affects Asia, to
the principles of continuity and stability which marked the
retrocession of the territory to China," said the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 French nationals are living in Hong Kong and 500
French enterprises are established in Hong Kong, from where France
earns 13 billion francs (2.1 billion U.S. dollars) worth of trade
surplus each year.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong remains for France an essential supporting point of
our presence and our action in Asia," said the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Brussels
said on Tuesday that Tung will make a speech at a dinner to be

UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Saeed al-Sahaf is continuing his talks here with senior U.N.
officials on the new U.N. "oil-for-food" program, U.N. spokesman
Fred Echhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf, accompanied by deputy ministers from Iraq's oil, trade
and health ministries, discussed Monday technical issues of the
new program with new U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise
Frechette of Canada, including the country's capacity of oil
production, the spokesman told reporters at the regular press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister will continue his talks Tuesday
afternoon, and it is hoped that the talks be concluded Wednesday,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently allowed to sell only 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy basic food, medicine and
other goods for its impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan approved a
proposal to expand the current oil exporting level of Iraq to 5.2
billion U.S. dollars for six months to ease the worsening
humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the new program cannot be carried out until Annan approves
a detailed plan by Iraq to distribute the food and medicine under
the new program.

</P>
<P>
The Leverkusen-based company said the group net income rose 7.9

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations weapons
experts will make their first visit in about two weeks to Iraq's
presidential sites under an agreement reached by Annan on
February 23, U.N. officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. experts will be accompanied by senior diplomats as
required by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first visits to all eight presidential compounds would be
so-called "baseline" surveys to set the groundwork for future
inspections of these sites, the U.N. official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday presented a detailed
plan for the U.N. inspections to the eight presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the first slew of inspections is to test Annan's
deal with the Iraqi leadership, which averted a threatened
military action by the United States and Britain late last month.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. and Britain have kept troops, planes and warships
in the Gulf region. Washington and London have said that they will
not withdraw the military forces until they see that the agreement
is being carried out.
</P>
<P>
The eight Iraqi compounds are spread over 12 square miles.
They include 1,058 residences, palaces, warehouses, garages and
other buildings.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Companies' Earnings Big Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The revenue of Japanese
corporations in the October-December period last year declined 4.4
percent from the previouse year -- the biggest slump in nearly 40
years.
</P>
<P>
When releasing the results of a quarterly survey Wednesday, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) attributed the drop to sluggish personal
spending following last April's consumption tax hike, and to weak
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
The last time the revenue dropped that sharply was in the
April-June period in 1958, when it fell 4.7 percent, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Revenues fell broadly across the industrial spectrum. Sales by
manufacturers registered a 2.2 percent decline, the first drop
since the January-March period of 1994, while non-manufacturers'
sales fell by 5.3 percent, the third consecutive quarterly decline.
</P>
<P>
In addition, corporate pre-tax profits dropped nine percent in
the October-December period, the first drop in 14 quarters, with
manufacturers posting an 8.6 percent decline, the first fall in 15
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Non-manufacturers saw profits decrease by 9.4 percent, the
third consecutive quarterly fall.
</P>
<P>
The survey is based on a sample of 19,007 companies.
</P>
<P>
Another quarterly survey conducted by the MOF in February,
conducted to gauge private business prospects, showed the
ministry's business confidence index plunging to a minus 25.6
reading for major companies with capital of one billion yen (about
78.7 million dollars) or more. It was the worst score since the
ministry started it in 1983.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said here Wednesday that Israel is willing to
enhance military cooperation with India.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with visiting India's Army Staff Chief
Prakash Malik, Mordechai told reporters that this has been the
highest level visit in recent years by a senior Indian officer.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure we will continue to build the closer relationship
with India," he noted.
</P>
<P>
One of Mordechai's international relationship advisers stressed
that India is interested in Israel's military technology, and
both sides can cooperate in many fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting Malik invited Israeli military
officers to visit India, and hoped to keep contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Malik began his five-day tour in Israel Monday amid reports
over the past year that Israel has stepped up exports of weapons
and military technology to India.
</P>
<P>
With over 1 million full-time servicemen, India has the
world's third largest army. But the cash-strapped military has
been severely limited in its ability to modernize. Still, Israel
and India have developed promising defense markets, mostly
involving Israeli exports to India.
</P>
<P>
Local daily The Jerusalem Post reported that India purchased
two Super Dvora Mark II attack boats from Israel last year and has
been licensed to build another four.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman also visited India in January
1997. One of his aims was to push for an increase in defense
cooperation. During his trip, the two countries decided to
exchange military attaches.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Trade With Egypt Catching Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammad
Mahdi Saleh, praising Egypt's backing to Baghdad during its
recent standoff with the U.S., said Wednesday the volume of trade
between the two countries was gradually improving.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters on the sideline of the inauguration of the
31st annual Cairo International Fair that Iraq purchased 150
million dollars worth of Egyptian goods last year, hoping that
trade exchange would pick up soon.
</P>
<P>
Saleh hailed Egypt's "strong and nationalist stand which
rejected American and British blackmailing and left an impressive
effect on the people of Iraq and the Arab peoples."
</P>
<P>
He referred to the several batches of assistance supplies the
Egyptian government and people sent to Iraq and said it
demonstrated "the genuinity of this people and the depth of
relations" between Egypt and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saleh urged Egyptian companies to apply for the bids offered by
the different Iraqi ministries for food and medical supplies
within the framework of the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the
United Nations, the volume of which was recently raised from 2
billion to 5.2 billion dollars over six months.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day fair, inaugurated earlier Wednesday by Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, is attended by about 1,000
foreign companies from 46 countries, including Iraqi firms, in
addition to 2,500 local firms.
</P>
<P>
Saleh held talks Tuesday with Egyptian Minister of Trade and
Supply Ahmed Goweili on propelling bilateral trade exchange and
meeting Iraqi needs of commodities and services under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
It was within the framework of the agreement that Egypt last
May signed three contracts worth 12.2 million dollars with Iraq to
allow Cairo to export food and detergents.
</P>
<P>
Following this deal, Egypt has twice sent representatives of
several pharmaceutical and food-processing companies to display
their products in the Iraqi capital in an attempt to secure
Egyptian producers a decent portion of the deals to export food,
medicine and other basic humanitarian stuff.
</P>
<P>
Cairo is also considering to export manpower to Iraq. Before
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Egypt used to have an estimated
3 million blue and white collar workers in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Legislator on China's Success in Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conclusion was made by Li Honggui, vice-minister of the
State Family Planning Commission and a deputy to the current
session of the National People's Congress (NPC), in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A trend toward globalization has resulted in a steady
increase of cross-country immigration," said Li. "Resources
and environment, both are related to population growth, are global
issues, and China's success story in population control is
therefore a great contribution to the mankind," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China's population growth was cut by
400 million people owing to 20-odd years' family planning effort.
The move has greatly help alleviated the pressure on resources,
environment, employment and economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's success in family planning has postponed for three
years the world's "Five-Billion People Day" and Asia's
"Three-billion-People Day" by seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's population growth rate fell to 1.006 percent
and birth rate fell to 1.657 percent, one of the lowest birth-rate
countries in terms of the United Nations standard. The average
life expectancy for the Chinese people reached 70.8 years, the
highest among developing countries whereas the average life
expectancy was 35 years in the 1940s, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics show that China's population growth rate has
been brought under control and people's life quality and health
conditions have markably improved," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the current population situation, Li noted that
China's population quality still doesn't match its social
development and the number of senior citizens have kept
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that China will enter an aging society early
next century. The number of senior citizens above 65 years makes
up 6.6 percent of the total population today and the figure comes
up to 11 percent in Shanghai, China's largest industrial and
commercial city.
</P>
<P>
China will pay close attention to population control among
those who are needy, handicapped or transient, said Li, whose
commission has adopted a number of measures to earnestly protect
the rights of existence and development of the citizens, he said.

<HEADLINE> Busy Motions Office before Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- As the deadline for the
submission of motions to the ongoing session of China's
legislature approached this afternoon today, workers in the
Motions Handling Office of China's National People's Congress were
more busy than ever.
</P>
<P>
"I have to work longer hours today," said Zhou Xiaodong, who is
in charge of the office and has been working at least 14 hours
each day since the NPC session opened last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Draft motions have kept coming in and we must register and
sort them out," said Zhou. "I have the impression that we have
better, if not more, motions this year."
</P>
<P>
A preliminary analysis shows that a large proportion of the
draft motions propose enacting more economic laws and laws on
environmental protection and social security, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
According to NPC laws, a draft bill must be put forward either
by an NPC delegation or jointly by at least 30 deputies, and
issues involved should be within the jurisdiction of the lawmaking
body. The presidium of the NPC session will then decide whether or
not a draft bill should become a formal NPC motion.
</P>
<P>
As deputies for the new legislature are better educated, they
seem to have a better understanding of NPC functions as well as
their obligations and responsibilities as people's
representatives, noted Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Previously, many motions were just proposals or opinions on
ways to improve government work or requests for more government
funding for construction projects.
</P>
<P>
"These past few years have seen an increase in the number of
drafts becoming formal motions," said Zhou. "This year, we expect
to see an even higher proportion of such draft bills."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Chief Executive Meets French Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The French Senate President Rene
Monory said Wednesday he believed the Asian financial crisis will
not undermine economic relations between Hong Kong of China and
his country.
</P>
<P>
Monory was talking with Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, who is
on a three-day visit to France.
</P>
<P>
Monory said he and Tung focused their talks on the economic
situation in Hong Kong, the present financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia and trade relations between Hong Kong and France.
</P>
<P>
Monory said Tung had assured him that Hong Kong would not
devalue its currency as the region enjoyed sufficient foreign
reserves and solid economic foundations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the annual trade volume between Hong Kong and
France averaged 18 billion France francs (2.88 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Monory said he believed Hong Kong's return to China would
further help France enter the China market.
</P>
<P>
France has a trade surplus of 13 billion francs (2.08 billion
dollars) with Hong Kong. There are about 500 French enterprises
and 5,000 French people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here earlier Wednesday after a two-day visit to
Germany.

<HEADLINE> China to Contract All Grasslands to herdspeople </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government strives to
contract all grasslands to herdspeople by the end of the century
as part of its effort to boost animal husbandry and better protect
ecological environment in grasslands, Vice-Minister of Agriculture
Qi Jingfa said.
</P>
<P>
Contract responsibility system has been carried out in China's
pastoral areas in recent years, he said. Up to now, 40 percent of
the usable grasslands and pastures have been contracted.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the country's reform, collective-owned
domestic animals were contracted to herdsmen. Since 1989, pilot
work has been tried out in some areas to contract grasslands to
herdsmen, and the practice has been spread nationwide following
1995, Qi said.
</P>
<P>
"The contracting of pastures constitutes a key measure to
deepen reform in pastoral areas," he said, noting that such a
contract system will effectively put an end to random reclamation
and excessive breeding.
</P>
<P>
Practice has shown that grassland contracting system has
aroused the initiative of herdsmen who are able to integrate
temporary interests with long-term interests in their effort to
protect and renew their grasslands.
</P>
<P>
In the areas with grasslands contracted system in practice, the
vegetation of the grasslands has been improved to great extent and
more animals are able to be raised.
</P>
<P>
All in all, China boasts some 400 million ha of natural
grasslands, which account for 40 percent of the country's entire
land areas. Three quarters of the grasslands can be utilized for
animal breeding.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sue Eight Member States on Open Skies Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union decided on
Wednesday to prepare legal action against eight of its member
states for alleged violation of the union law via concluding
bilateral aviation agreements with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The decision, taken at the initiative of European Commissioner
for Transport Neil Kinnock, stated that the signing of bilateral
aviation agreements with the U.S. has a negative impact on the
operation of the liberalized EU market in civil aviation and is
thus an infringement of EU laws.
</P>
<P>
The eight EU countries in question are Austria, Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, asked for and was granted a mandate in July 1996 to
negotiate aviation agreement on behalf of the union to guarantee
free and fair competition for all EU air carriers.
</P>
<P>
But at present, EU member states have limited the scope of the
union's mandate and the commission argued that without immediate
change to the situation, it is impossible for it to open a
dialogue with the American side.
</P>
<P>
The eight member states were given two months to reply to a
"reasoned opinion" which will soon be sent out by the commission.
</P>
<P>
If it considers the response not satisfactory, the commission
may subsequently decide to take the case to the European Court of
Justice.

<HEADLINE> Annan Visits Washington for U.S. Support for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan begins his two-day visit to Washington Wednesday and is
expected to defend his deal with Iraq on weapons inspection and
ask the U.S. to pay its dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton at noon Wednesday
at the White House, where he is to have a working lunch with the
president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general is also expected to meet with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in the afternoon and Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The focus during the meetings will be the deal on Iraqi weapons
inspection Annan signed on February 23 in Baghdad with the Iraqi
authorities. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday Annan
would be "seeking political support" for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In their Oval Office talks, Clinton is expected to note the
success in recent days of U.N. inspections at sites Iraq considers
to be sensitive and to inquire about some details of Annan's plan.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators, particularly the Republicans, criticized
Annan's deal with Iraq by accusing him of selling out to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the agreement comes at a time when the
United Nations is again appealing to Washington to pay its
arrears.
</P>
<P>
After Annan's first visit to Washington Last year, the U.S.
Senate approved a plan to pay more than 800 million U.S. dollars
in arrears to the United Nations, but with conditions which the
administration is not willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.N. official warned on Tuesday that the United States
was close to losing its voting rights in the U.N. General Assembly
if it did not pay a major part of the arrears, which reaches 1.3
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Acclaim Accelerated Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Many deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), now in session, said today that
China has achieved remarkable progresses in legislation and
supervision over law enforcement in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yan, head of the No.2 Law Office in Xi'an City of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, said that over the past five
years, China has carried out bold reform in legislation, with a
large number of laws enacted and their quality improved.
</P>
<P>
Discussing a report on the work of the standing committee of
the previous NPC, the Ninth NPC deputy said legislation in the
last five year has been able to keep pace with the country's
reform and opening-up, and laws conform better with the
development of a socialist market economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign legal notions and precedents have been used as
reference in legislation, she said, enabling laws enacted to
promote China's economic opening.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liming, vice-president of the Institute of Law under the
People's University of China, said that Law on Administrative
Procedures, Law on Administrative Punishment and Regulations on
Administrative Appeal of the State Council have standardized the
practices of state departments and their functionaries and
strongly pushed China's legal system to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the Eighty NPC stepped up supervision
over law-enforcement by judicial organs. However, he said,
legislation and supervision have to be strengthened as there are
still strong complaints from people and the fight against
corruption is arduous.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xueqing, a professor with the Southwest China University
of Political Science and Law, said that, in addition to the laws
and regulations enated by the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee and formulated by the State Council, local people's
congresses and governments have also enacted or formulated a large
number of local rules and regulations to make the country's legal
system more complete.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's reform and opening-up, more than 200 laws
and law-related decisions have been enacted, of which 118 were enacted
by the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Development of Rural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) reach consensus that township-run
enterprises face both arduous tasks and great potential in future
development.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance of a great change in market development
and macro-control policy, township-run enterprises across China
gained an added-value of 1.8 trillion yuan last year, said Wu
Xuefeng, general manager of Xinghua Group in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Though the figure was 18 percent more than the previous year,
it dropped by 24 percent in term of increase range as compared
with 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, township-run enterprises experienced a
lower growth rate, with declined efficiency and more losses.
</P>
<P>
Han Chang'an, chairman and genenal manager of the Lubao
Company Group in north China's Shanxi Province, said a low pace
for development of township-run enterprises will directly affect
the growth of agriculture and cut the number of the labor force it
enrolled from rural areas, thus exerting a heavier pressure on
employment in urban districts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the farmers, with less income, have to buy less raw
production materials and machinery and equipment from state-owned
enterprises, hindering the development of production element
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhenlian, a Party secretary of an ethnic-inhabited
township in Yunnan Province, said township-run enterprises
should improve their quality and economic efficiency by
technological upgrading and strengthening management in a bid to
survive in fierce market competition.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shaoming, director of agricultural department of Jilin
Province, said, "Only we readjust the industrial structure, can
rural enterprises attain a sustained development."
</P>
<P>
He called on rural enterprises to develop high-tech industries,
expand their production scale and boost export-oriented
production.

PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- France is opposed to the forming of
a secessionist government on the Comoros island of Anjouan, an
official spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot approve this intransigent attitude," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.

The Comoros separatists on the Indian Ocean island of Anjouan

They have called for a return of French colonial rule in
Comoros, which was a French colony and gained independence from
Paris in 1975.
</P>

Unrealistic actions only created extra obstacles to a lasting
solution to the crisis besetting the Islamic Federal Republic of
Comoros, said the foreign ministry spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The Comoros separatists, dissatisfied with the government's
policy, declared on independence on August, 8, 1997, and a

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Macro-Controls a Bulwark against Financial Crisis  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Except China, almost all
major Asian countries have been seriously hit by a financial
crisis that began in the latter half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists hold that China has successfully built a
bulwark against a possible financial crisis by attaining its
macroeconomic control targets and adopting a timely and rational
financial policy.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the Chinese economy overheated and prices rose
sharply. A national retrenchment program succeeded in driving
inflation down to 6.1 percent in 1996 and to 0.8 percent last
year. Annual economic growth of China's national economy averaged
11 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has a favorable balance of international
payments. It had a surplus under both the current and capital
accounts in the 1994-97 period.
</P>
<P>
Its foreign exchange reserves have increased to 140 billion
U.S. dollars, laying a solid foundation for stabilizing the
Chinese yuan's exchange rates against the US dollar, according to
Xiao Zhuoji, a Beijing University professor.
</P>
<P>
He said that the structure of China's foreign debts is
rational. By the end of 1997, China had used total foreign funds
of 320 billion US dollars, of which two thirds are foreign direct
investment, and the rest loans. Of the country's foreign debt,
medium- and long-term types account for 88 percent of the total,
and the short-term type the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, therefore, has no difficulty paying its debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic observers say one of the root causes for the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia is runaway borrowing from abroad and an
irrational foreign debt structure. Bad policies on interest and
exchange rates are also to blame.
</P>
<P>
In China, reform of the financial sector has separated "policy"
banking from commercial banking. The central bank's function of
macro-controls and supervision has been strengthened. The Chinese
yuan's dual exchange rates have long been unified. All these,
they say, have strengthened the country's ability to ward off a
financial crisis.

<P>
Gunter Gao, chairman of the Sunbase International (Holding) Ltd
of Hong Kong, said that China's method of opening its market to
the outside world in a step-by-step way and its decision not to
make the Chinese yuan convertible under the capital account have
made it possible for the country to prevent an exodus of funds and
raids by international speculators.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongru, vice president of the Chinese Monetary Society,
called for building a new government-bank relationship that is
suited for a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Banks' bad debts, he said, have been caused mainly by their
lack of independence and interference from the government. This
state of affairs should come to an end, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shiying, a professor from the Hunan Institute of Finance
and Economics, said financial crisis is a manifestation of grave
problems of a country's financial system. To remove hidden danger,
the central bank of a country should strengthen controls over its
financial system.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 90 percent of China's social funds are handled
by banks. As a result, tightening controls over commercial banks
is the key to lowering financial risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, has revealed that there will be a major breakthrough
in banking reform: the state will allow commercial banks to
operate independently, among other measures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Sign Contract on Iranians' Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Two companies of Iraq and Iran
have signed a contract for organizing the visits of Iranians to
the holy places in Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The contract, the first of its kind in 18 years, was signed
here late Tuesday night between the Al-Hodda Company for Religious
Tourism of Iraq and the Morning Breeze Company of Iran. It
includes items dealing with how Iranians are to be accommodated
and carried to the holy places in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The news agency pointed out that the contract is in line with
Iraq's laws and regulations pertaining to religious tourism, as
well as with the Iraqi leadership's decision to allow Iranian
citizens to visit the holy places in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq lifted a travel ban on Iranian pilgrims on September 4
last year and allowed them to visit Shiite Muslim shrines on Iraqi
territory. The ban was imposed in 1980 when the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war broke out.
</P>
<P>
This issue had been discussed during the recent visit of Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has the tombs of Imam Ali Bin Abu Talib, Imam Al
Hussein and several other sites holy to the Shiite Muslims, who
make up the overwhelming majority of the Iranian population.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Transatlantic Marketplace Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission -- the
EU's executive body -- approved on Wednesday a wide-ranging
proposal to remove trade barriers between the European Union and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, known as the New Transatlantic Marketplace (NTM),
provides for action in four key areas.
</P>
<P>
The commission will now be seeking authorization from the
Council of Ministers in order to open formal negotiations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The areas expecting NTM action include:
</P>
<P>
-- The widespread removal of technical barriers to trade
through increased mutual product recognition and/or harmonization;
</P>
<P>
-- A political commitment to eliminate all industrial tariffs
by 2010 as long as a critical mass of other trading partners also
agree to do so;
</P>
<P>
-- The creation of a free trade area in services;
</P>
<P>
-- And further liberalization of investment, public procurement
and intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said: "The New
Transatlantic Marketplace is a specifically tailored package of
measures to address the real barriers that exist in the EU-U.S.
trading relationship.
</P>
<P>
"It represents a huge leap forward for Europe's relationship
with the U.S., bringing not only strong economic benefits for both
business and consumers, but also a new political momentum to
relations across the Atlantic."
</P>
<P>
The commission set out nine requirements for the NTM to meet,
which are:
</P>
<P>
-- The NTM should address the real barriers to EU-U.S. trade
and investment;
</P>
<P>
-- It should bring economic benefit to the EU and the U.S.
commensurate with the effort involved;
</P>
<P>
-- It should not damage and should indeed promote objectives in
the future multilateral negotiations within the World Trade
Organization;
</P>
<P>
-- It should not lead to the creation of new trade obstacles to
third countries or reduce their access to the EU and the U.S.
markets and nor should it weaken their support for multilateral
liberalization;
</P>
<P>
-- It should be ambitious, capture political interest, but be
technically achievable;
</P>
<P>
-- It should be consistent with and should not jeopardize the
agreed multilateral rules of the WTO and other international fora
such as the OECD;
</P>
<P>
-- It should serve to enhance the broader political
relationship between the EU and the U.S.;
</P>
<P>
-- It should benefit consumers and should preserve the EU high
level of protection for health, safety, consumers or the
environment;
</P>
<P>
-- And, it should not impede the further development of the
European community.
</P>
<P>
The commission vice-president said that the NTM will be fully
compatible with WTO rules and will help pave the way for further
multilateral trade liberalization, bringing benefits to third
countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade relationship between the EU and the U.S. is of vital
importance to both.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, two-way trade in goods and services amounted to
upwards of 355,000 million ECUs (383,400 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The EU and the U.S. account for around 19 percent of each
other's total trade in goods. It is estimated that high
technology products account for 20 percent of their two-way trade
flow.
</P>
<P>
The EU is by far the biggest investor in the U.S., accounting
for 59 percent of the total foreign direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Charcoal Export Threatens Forests in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's forests are being
depleted at a very high rate which terrified many Somali
politicians and environmental organizations after large
quantities of charcoal is seen being exported illegally from its
natural ports by businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his executive committee on Wednesday,
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed called for the complete
cessation of the exportation of charcoal, female domestic and
wild animals from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi accused Somali businessmen in accomplice with
foreigners of being behind the continuing deforestation which is
spoiling the country's environmental beauties.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was prompted by the presence of three vessels
loading charcoal from the natural port of El-Ma'an, 30 km
northeast of the capital. Two of the ships have already left with
a minimum of 1,200 tons of charcoal to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Hammi Environmental Care Organization, a local organization,
also condemned and strongly opposed the charcoal exports by
organizing a demonstration at the port of El-Ma'an.
</P>
<P>
Hammi characterized this as the largest charcoal ever exported
from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The shipping of more than 350,000 bags of charcoal are
expected to be completed in the port of El-Ma'an in the next few
days," declared Hammi.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Hassan Mohamud, chairman of Hammi, said in a written
report that more than a hundred heavy duty trucks and 72 heavily
armed militiamen with six battle wagons are involved in
collecting the charcoal from the regions of Bay and Bakol.
</P>
<P>
With the floods now receding, many of the roads cut by the
waters will be open and more of the tree chopping business will
continue unless something is done about it, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that apart from the regions of Bay and
Bakol, the charcoal is also being taken from the northeastern
regions of Nugal and Bossaso after the authorities of the Somali
Salvation Democratic Front refused its exports in the port of
Bosasso.
</P>
<P>
"The businessmen are then forced to use the ports where the
laws against the contraband are loose," said Mohamud, adding
"This is the worst deforestation campaign Somalia has ever
experienced."
</P>
<P>
With the ban on Somalia's meat imposed following the suspicion
of the Rift Valley Fever disease among Somalia's livestock, some
businessmen sought fortune in the charcoal exports as an
alternative business.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even though it is now discovered that no more of
the Rift Valley Fever exists in Somalia, it will still be late
for the annual livestock exports to Saudi Arabia on the occasion
of the pilgrimage and the charcoal exports will painfully
continue unless concrete measures are taken by authorities
concerned.

<HEADLINE> Market Force, Macro-Control: Two Wheels for Economic Take-off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Giving free rein to market forces
while stressing macro-control will be the tune in China's economic
development in a long period of time, providing more room for
stable economic growth in the 21st century, economists said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingwen, director of the Institute of Econometrics and
Tech-Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
the Chinese government is fully aware of the law of the market
economy,"an invisible hand," and appropriate measures for
macro-control.
</P>
<P>
While bondly introducing and using market mechanism, the
central government has taken a series of macro-control measures to
put a brake on repetitive and redundant investment and ease
monetary control, which has made it possible for China to achieve
a "soft landing" with a "high growth rate, and low inflation", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li and other noted economists are present at the current
sessions of National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature and the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
This noted Chinese economist, one of the principal members in
China's think tank, noted that the rigid planned economy practiced
for more than three decades before China's introduction of market
reform in early 1980s has been proved incompatible with the
national economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, pure market means will result only in widening gap in
regional economic growth and income distribution, which is likely to
affect negatively China's social stability and national economic
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the extremely imbalanced economic system formed between
different localities and industries, there is all the more need to
for China to integrate both market mechanism and macro-control
as compared with developed countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Like Li Jingwen, many other leading Chinese economists
attributed the economic achievements scored over the past five
years to the economic policy of "giving full play to market roles
and enhancing and improving macro-economic control".

<HEADLINE> Market Forces, Macro-Control: Two Wheels for China's Economic Take-off (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The policy is widely cited an apt appraisal to China's economic
development, said an economist. This pragmatic economic idea will
surely become a policy basis for the country's economic take-off
in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, however, experts cautioned that it will
still be delicate and difficult to handle well relations between
market forces and macro-control in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, they say, China should give full play
to market forces in order to minimize costs and maximize economic
returns. Efforts must also be made to accelerate the retooling and
upgrading of enterprises to promote economic take-off and
facilitate macro-control.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shulian, a CPPCC member and reputed economist from the
Institute of Industrial Economics under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, said government institutions should not meddle in
the production and operation of enterprises, adding that they
should, instead, give guidance to national economic development
through the adoption of economic and legal means, with aid of
essential administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
The central government's move to bring market prices under
control is successful by underlining the importance of
agriculture. The policy change to irregulate the market prices of
electrical appliances, and bring about the fast growth of the
industrial sector has proved it a rationable and necessary move,
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu Jinglian, another famous economist, research
fellow from the Development and Research Center under the State
Council, cautioned that government should restrain from
meddling in the affairs of the enterprises. "Governments
should be play the part of a coach instead of a sportsman or
sportswoman," Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Wu's idea was shared by Dong Furen, deputy director of the
Financial and Economic Committee under the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, and Xu Bonian, director of the
Economic and Social Development Research Center under Inner
Mongolia University.
</P>
<P>
The two economists suggested that strategic restructuring be
undertaken in the state sector, which has overextended itself to
all fields of economic development. They both hold that if the
situation keeps going on like this, the limited state-owned
assists cannot withstand "the huge plate of the state-owned
economy".

The head of Israeli Army's Central Command Uzi Dayan held
an emergency meeting Wednesday morning with Palestinian police
officials to discuss ways to calm the situation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany's Jobless Rate to Remain High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment would
continue to rise in 1998 despite the strongest growth since the
post-reunification boom, said a report issued by the Economy
Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany would see a 2.5 to 3.0 percent growth in the gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1998, compared with 2.2 percent last
year and 1.4 percent in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's unemployment is expected to average 11.5
percent, compared with 11.4 percent in 1997, 10.4 percent in 1996
and 9.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But unemployment would decline during the year from the monthly
record of 12.6 percent in February, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that in the eastern part of the country, the
unemployment situation would worsen to top the current level of 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
It said the real level there was even higher as joblessness was
being disguised in some ways by state-funded job-creation projects
and job-retraining programs.
</P>
<P>
As for exports, the report said it will remain the force
driving the country's economic recovery, but export growth will
drop from 10.7 percent in 1997 to 7.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some business leaders also feared that cheaper Asian goods,
because of currency devaluation, could affect German exports.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand would climb in the long run despite the
continuing weakness in the country's key construction sector, the
report said. The average German household would see a 1.5 percent
increase in purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The report put Germany's inflation at 1.5 percent in 1998, the
same as last year.

<HEADLINE> Reception Held for Representatives from Minority Ethnic Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held at the Great
Hall of the People this evening for ethnic minority deputies to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and ethnic minority
members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), both in session here
since last week.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, an executive chairman of the presidium of the First
Session of the Ninth NPC, presided over the reception.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Hu
Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing were present at the reception.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, an executive chairman of the presidium of the
First Session of the CPPCC Ninth National Committee and head of
the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, delivered a speech at the reception.
</P>
<P>
"The new NPC and new CPPCC National Committee are composed of
outstanding representatives from the 56 ethnic groups of the
country, demonstrating our Party's policy on ethnic affairs and
the great unity of the Chinese nation," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is a socialist country consisting of many
ethnic groups which share the same aspiration and goal of pushing
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into
the 21st century and realize the revitalization of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
Along with the progress of reform and opening-up, areas
inhabited by minority ethnic groups are facing extremely good
development opportunities, Wang Zhaoguo said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has made it a strategy to speed up the
development of the country's central and western regions, and
narrow the gap between west and east so as to achieve a
coordinated development of China's regional economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experience in the past has shown that the system of autonomy in
areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups suits realities of the
country well and that it is a good system for safeguarding central
leadership and ensuring the rights of ethnic minority people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies and CPPCC members watched artistic performances at
the reception.

<HEADLINE> US Observers Comment On Chinese Village Elections (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The villages of northeast
China's Jilin Province are trying a new election method that could
be the envy even of American voters.
</P>
<P>
The new method, "Haixuan", gives each person in a village an
opportunity to nominate a particular person he or she trusts, not
like before when the candidate must be nominated by a political
party or at least by ten-voter groups.
</P>
<P>
"It (the new method) gives the people a chance to democratize
the process, so that is a very encouraging step. They understand
the importance of opening the process while it is possible to
permit the people to control the process," said Robert Pastor,
head of a delegation from the Carter Center in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I think our entire delegation was impressed by what we saw and
by the commitment of the villagers to have free and fair
elections, by the competition, and by the sincerity with which all
of you try to make this election successful," said Pastor, an
expert on elections.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has allowed its rural voters to choose
their own village leaders for about ten years now, and villagers
can suggest candidates they trust, along with those of village
Communist Party members, village teams, or ten-voter groups.
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamt of anything like 'Haixuan' some 20 years ago,"
said one 73-year-old man in the village of Gujialingzi, who
explained, "Landlords and rich peasants were stripped of the right
to vote, and poor and middle-level peasants who were busy bringing
home food hardly cared about things other than making a living,
but the Party reforms and opening-up policy have given us hope."

<TEXT>
<P>
About 60 percent of the village committees in Jilin, which are
being reshuffled, planned to use the "Haixuan" method, and other
provinces are trying their hand at more democratic, competitive
and suitable election methods.
</P>
<P>
The "Haixuan" method prevents any small group from being the
sole nominator of candidates, according to Zhan Chengfu, a Civil
Affairs Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
This shows that China's central government does not hope the
grass-roots level Party organization to completely control the
nomination and the Chinese Communist Party is a matured political
party, which welcomes greater competition in the process of
nominating candidates for village committees, Pastor commented.
</P>
<P>
In Hengdao Village, Jiang Ying, a candidate for public office,
said: "If you elect me, I swear to do a good job. Even if I fail,
I still will dedicate myself to our village."
</P>
<P>
Pastor called the speech "terrific" and said: "I found that
very encouraging. They both would accept and respect the process
and they would continue to contribute to the community."
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, village voters can deputize a person
to vote for them, but Pastor suggested: "Perhaps it would be
desirable to eliminate the proxy entirely. That may lower the
voting of participation, but would encourage people to vote for
themselves."
</P>
<P>
When asked the prospects of these village elections, Pastor
said that "China is doing it right".
</P>
<P>
"They are starting at the village level, trying to make sure
that technical elements of an election are working properly before
they start moving that process of the ladder to the national
level," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Cathay Pacific Airways Eager to Become Best Airline in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways can overcome the current difficulties and is determined to
 become the best airline in the Asia-Pacific region, its chairman
Peter Sutch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to all the employees of the Cathay Pacific, Sutch
said 1997 was an undeniable hard year for the Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Though the Cathay Pacific's cargo turnover gained a 10-percent
increase over 1996 to reach 6,584 million HK dollars (844 million
U.S. dollars), the airline group's passenger operations met a
severe fall-off in the tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the 2.9-percent drop in the Cathay Pacific's
total turnover in 1997 to the dramatic downturn in the tourism
industry caused by a number of unexpected factors, including the
financial turmoil in Japan and other Asian economies, the forest
fires and haze in Southeast Asia and the "bird flu" scare in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, "we are fighting hard against these difficult market
conditions," Sutch said. "We know that we can weather the current
storm and that we have the ability to establish Cathay Pacific as
the best airline in Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Cathay Pacific has worked with the Hong Kong
Tourist Association and the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region in promoting Hong Kong as "an attractive
tourist destination."
</P>
<P>
"As a leader in the Hong Kong tourism industry, the Cathay
Pacific is proud to have taken this initial step in reminding the
world that Hong Kong remains a vibrant, exciting place to visit
and we hope it is a clarion call to others in the industry to act
accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sutch also said that great progress has been made in the new
airport located at Chek Lap Kok as the Cathay Pacific prepares to
move into its new headquarters, Cathay Pacific City, in the
world's most sophisticated airport.
</P>
<P>
The Cathay Pacific's phased move to the new facilities begins
shortly and the airline will be ready and operational when the
airport opens on July 6, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized: "Through its significant investment in Chek Lap
Kok, the Cathay Pacific is demonstrating its confidence in Hong
Kong as the premier air transportation hub in Asia."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Bank Official Arrested for Bribe-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Bank of
Japan (BOJ), Japan's central bank, was arrested Wednesday on
suspicion of taking 4.3 million yen (33,858 U.S. dollars) in
bribes from two major banks.
</P>
<P>
Yasuyuki Yoshizawa, head of the Capital Markets Division of
BOJ's Credit and Market Management Department, is suspected of
receiving the bribes in the form of entertainment, mainly through
wining, dining and golf outings, over four years since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Several former or incumbent finance ministry officials have
already been arrested on suspicion of being wined and dined, but
it is the first time that a BOJ official has been arrested since
the central bank was established in 1882.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office said
Yoshizawa, in exchange, leaked information relating to the central
bank's market operations and its lending policy to the Industrial
Bank of Japan (IBJ) and Sanwa Bank.
</P>
<P>
Investigative sources said Yoshizawa may have received a total
of seven million yen (55,118 dollars) in bribes. Several other
Japanese banks are also suspected of having spent money on him.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the BOJ are liable to punishment for taking bribes
because its employees are viewed as public servants under the Bank
of Japan Law.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the BOJ, Yasuo Matsushita, said he feels "grave
responsibility" over Yoshizawa's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita may resign to take the blame for the scandal, the
central bank's senior deputy governor, Toshihiko Fukui, told the
Diet (parliament) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also expressed regret over the
arrest of Yoshizawa. He said he was enraged over the spread of
bribery scandal which had already snared several former or
incumbent finance ministry officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A CD-ROM about the Nanjing
Massacre was at the top of the list of China's top ten for the
past five years, which was announced today.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 Chinese were killed by Japanese troops in
the Nanjing Massacre in late 1937 and early 1938 following the
Japanese occupation of the city.
</P>
<P>
The other nine are are Collection of Chinese Jadeware, the
Poetry of the Tang Dynasty, Three Hundred Ci (a poetic form) of
the Song Dynasty, Chinese Art Works, the Potala Palace, Joyful
Chinese Language, Martian Man, Chinese Imperial Tombs, and Chibi
(site of a famous battle).
</P>
<P>
The list was prepared by Multi-Media World Magazine, with
support from China's Press and Publication Administration and was
based on a four-month survey.
</P>
<P>
It found that 37 percent of China's multi-media purchases are
used at home, and 95 of those surveyed said that it had helped
them s lot and that is being used more for learning and fun
instead of on the job.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that fewer pirated CD-ROMs are used these
days and that the number of people who don't want to use pirated
CD-ROM's was twice what it was the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It also found that the range of CD-ROMs available does not meet
the market demand for more subjects, and that market studies
should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Last year 3.2 million PCs were sold in China, which now has
about 9 million computers in use. And, last year more than 2,000
types of electronic publications were published in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The total trade volume between
China and Nepal hit an all-time high last year at 67.74 million
U.S. dollars, up 68.7 percent over the previous year, an official
of the Chinese Embassy in Nepal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, China's exports to Nepal stood at 58.08 million
dollars, up 55.9 percent over the previous year, while its imports
from Nepal were 9.66 million dollars with an increase of 233.2
percent over the previous year, said Zhu Mincai, economic and
commercial counselor at the embassy, quoting statistics released
by the China Customs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the momentum of increasing deficit for the
Nepalese side has been reduced to some extent, he said. In 1995
China imported Nepalese goods worth only 197,000 dollars, but the
following year saw the figure increase to 2.898 million dollars
and the third year witnessed another drastic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said China's main exports are textile yarns, fabrics and
related products, machinery and electronics, footwear, clocks,
electric torches, garments and garment accessories and raw silk.
</P>
<P>
Its main imports include cereal and cereal products, he added.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng On Economic Development in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged Inner Mongolia to turn its rich natural resources into
economic strength and narrow its economic disparity with coastal
areas by accelerating the pace of economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Inner Mongolia is rich in coal and other mineral resources,
and it has good conditions for developing agriculture and
livestock breeding," he said in a group discussion attended by
Inner Mongolia deputies to the National People's Congress, in
session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a superiority," he said. "Inner Mongolia should turn
its superiority in natural resources into economic strength."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the region has great development potential for
farming and livestock breeding, especially in the Yellow River
Bend area in western Inner Mongolia, where there is much arable
land.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng encouraged the region to develop water-efficient
farming and stressed the need to protect water resources.
</P>
<P>
He urged people in the region to plant more trees and grass and
control sand encroachment to protect vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Turning to industry, the premier urged Inner Mongolia, a major
coal producer, to convert coal into power at where coal is
produced and change long-distance transportation of coal into
long-distance transmission of electricity. This is a way to raise
economic efficiency, he said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Habibie, Indonesia's New Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Consultative
Assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative body, Wednesday elected
State Minister of Research and Technology Bacharuddib Jusuf
Habibie the country's vice president for a five-year term
(1998-2003). Here is a profile of the new vice president:
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
He, the third of four children, began reading newspapers when
he was a child. His lifelong religious devotion continues in
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, from the South Sulawesi
town of Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his
Javanese mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of a deep sea submarine and a
high pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
With the Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HF) aircraft industry, he
designed the world's first aircraft with one consolidated wing,
which remains the only aircraft in the world capable of vertical
landing and takeoff.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto summoned Habibie home and made him
his technological consultant. Habibie has been state minister of
research and technology since 1978.
</P>
<P>
His close ties with Soeharto began when he was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's strengths, according to political observer Riswandha,
include his popularity among the majority Muslim community, the
esteem he holds among youth and his long service as Soeharto's
minister.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Shooting as Big Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- In his first public comment
over the Tuesday killing of three Palestinians, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat condemned it Wednesday as a "big crime" by Israel
against Palestinian workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, a gloomy-faced Arafat said:"
This is a big crime against our workers and people who were
returning back home from work to their homes."
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were killed and four others wounded when
the van they were driving came under fire by Israeli border
soldiers manning the Tarkumiya checkpoint near Hebron. The van
was carrying Palestinian workers who returned home from their
work in Israel
</P>
<P>
The soldiers said they thought the driver was launching a
terror attack by trying to run over them. But Palestinian
witnesses said the driver was just accelerating in an attempt
to cut into the long line waiting to pass. Initial Israeli
probe showed that the driver was only trying to cut into the
line.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes were triggered immediately following the
shooting incident, as Palestinian youths in Hebron area threw
stones and petrol bombs at Israeli soldiers in protest. At
least 14 Palestinians were wounded Wednesday as the clashes
entered the second day.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned Arafat late
Tuesday night to offer condolences to the victims, while
promising to make efforts to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials denounced the Israeli soldiers for
violating human rights of the Palestinian people. Senior
negotiator Saeb Erekat demanded for an independent international
committee to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident signaled the simmering tensions between
Israel and the Palestinian side at a time when the peace talks
continue to be deadlocked over Israel's refusal to implement
further troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The "China Farm Machinery Repair
Training Project", which has been aided by the Japanese
government, has been completed, according to a report at a project
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The project contract was signed at the end of 1991, and for the
past six years the Japanese government has provided some 40
million yuan (nearly 5 million US dollars) to establish farm
machinery repair training centers in various parts of China.
</P>
<P>
According to an Agriculture Ministry official, Chinese and
Japanese experts have compiled 39 training textbooks, and trained
more than 200 advanced repair technicians and more than 1,600 at
the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
Those who have got their training through this project will
form the backbone of work units located in 20 provinces or
autonomous regions.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Legislation on Soil Erosion Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Scores of ecological and
geological experts at the ongoing session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, the top legislature, as deputies have submitted
a motion aimed to legislate long-term planning for control of soil
erosion on the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The motion says that despite its status as one of China's
officially-sanctioned "key ecological projects", the project of
water and soil conservation for the Loess Plateau is making
an extremely slow pace due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it says, free use of contracted land by farmers on
the plateau has led to new soil erosion in some regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Shan Lun, a research fellow with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, more than 70 percent of the Loess
Plateau, which covers a total area of 640,000 square kilometers,
suffers from soil erosion, one of the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't enact a law on water and soil conservation and
take effective measures to regulate the use of land and stop rampant
tree felling, the situation could go worse," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
China now has a law on environmental protection and some
relevant regulations, but there is no special law concerning water
and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
"Soil erosion on the Loess Plateau not only hampers local
economic growth, but also results in an annual increase of 1.6
billion tons of silt in the Yellow River, causing a rise of
riverbed and serious threats of flooding in the lower sections of
the river," Shan noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Zhou Weijian, an expert on the study of loess regions
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, proposed that a scientific
system be instituted promptly to monitor soil erosion and
supervise on water and soil conservation on the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, the Chinese government has made persistent
efforts to control soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. The work has
taken effect in areas of 150,000 sq km, where grain output has
scored an average annual growth of four billion kilograms and the
total water storage has exceeded 80 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the amount of silt added to the Yellow River has been
lessening by 300 million tons a year.

<HEADLINE> China Provides 1 Billion Yuan in Aid to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China has provided over one
billion RMB yuan (about 130 million U.S. dollars) in assistance to
Nepal since the two countries established diplomatic relations in
1955, an official of the Chinese Embassy in Nepal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This amount included assistance in the form of goods such as
wheat, maize, trolley bus and trucks, said Zhu Mincai, economic
and commercial counselor at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China has helped Nepal build 27 complete projects
including roads, paper mill, irrigation facilities, hydropower
plant, leather factory and conference center, Zhu said in an
interview with Nepal's official RSS news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said 24 of the projects have been completed and the
remaining three under construction are the B.P. Koirala Memorial
Cancer Hospital, the 196-meter-long and 9.5-meter-wide Seti River
bridge and the sports facilities project for the South Asian
Federation Games scheduled for 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of investment in Nepal, he said many Chinese
companies and enterprises hope to invest in Nepal, but Nepal
should work out some policies to improve the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal allows machinery and equipment to enter
Nepal free of duty for a project, but when the project is
finished, the machinery and equipment have to be removed from
Nepal. For a new project, new machinery and equipment have to be
imported. "This takes time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The counselor said another problem is that the non-tourist visa
fee is very high. For the first year one has to pay 60 U.S.
dollars per month, and from the second year on, one has to pay 100
dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the cost of the project is sure to increase," he
said. "China and Nepal are very close neighbors. In order to
promote economic relations between the two countries, some
preferential policies should be adopted."

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Launch Human Gene Research Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to use its abundant
scientific resources to develop a local human gene research
project, according to an official with the Beijing Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission has organized a group of academicians from the
China Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the China Engineering Academy
and renowned scientists from other institutes for in-depth
discussions concerning implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
China initiated the major state project known as "Studies on
Several Gene Loci Structures of the Chinese Human Genome" in
1994. The project has been carried out at a cost of 3.6 million
yuan (430,000 US dollars), according to Du Ruofu, a research
professor at the CAS Institute of Genetics.
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in the project have recorded major progress
in human gene studies over the past four years, said Du.
</P>
<P>
In additon, the Biological Engineering Center under the State
Science and Technology Commission (SSTC) initiated a gene research
project in 1996 to study major diseases. The program was listed as
a state major project in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The SSTC has also invested 13 million yuan (1.6 million US
dollars) to establish a human gene research center in Beijing and
20 million yuan for the establishment of a similar center in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai center was formally founded in 1998, with
completion of the Beijing center awaiting additional
funding. However, a number of state-owned enterprises have
expressed their willingness to invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
Genes are specific transmitters of the hereditary
characteristics of living things. Scientists have found that genes
are not only related to various hereditary diseases, but also to
cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that human gene research will promote a series of
basic studies in the realm of life sciences and will also
accelerate the development of new and high technology industries.

TOKYO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Knut Lundstroem wrapped
up his fourth gold medal in the men's 1,000 meters ice sledge
while Japanese Yutaka Takeda set a 1,000m world record in his
class at the Nagano Winter Paralympic Games on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lundstroem completed the last event with a time of two minutes
15.83 seconds to beat Japan's Tadashi Kato and Hiroyuki Nakamura
to second and third after winning the 100m, 500m, and 1,500m in
Nagano.
</P>
<P>

Lillehammer Games four years ago as well as one in 1992 and seven
in 1988 for a total of 14 golds.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian confirmed it was his last Paralympic Games "for
sure", and would finish his career after the Games "because I have
a family, I have two boys to take care of."
</P>
<P>
Japan took three gold medals in the M-Wave ice arena as Yutaka
Takeda clinced his third gold by setting a world record in 2:25.91
in his 1,000m category, severer disabilities in lower limbs than
Lundstroem's class.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark of 2:26.92 was set by Terje Johansen of
Norway at Lillehammer in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 1,000m, Miki Matsue collected her third gold
medal beating Tone Edvardsen of Norway and her compatriot Yoshie
Kanai, while Wakako Tsuchida won the other category.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China (SDB) is leading other Chinese banks in the use of a new
credit assessment method with five types of credit rating that is
believed to better reflect the true value of credit as well as the
risk involved.
</P>
<P>
The five are: normal, flawed, problematic, seriously
problematic, and the handling of the creditor's right, a bank
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The criteria of the credit rating is risk involved in the loan
project before and after it starts, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new classifications make it possible to
evaluate the current value of a person's credit and therefore
reflect the reliability of the SDB's credit system.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council decided early this year to make the new
classification system national by the end of this year. Details
of the new method will be released by the People's Bank of China,
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The SDB, which has assets valued at more than 300 billion yuan,

<HEADLINE> More Rallies Planned to Back Nigerian Head of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Following the successful two-day
two-million-man rally in the capital Abuja last week to ask the
head of state, General Sani Abacha, to contest in the forthcoming
presidential election, the organizer is planning similar events
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the national chairman of the organizer, Alhaji
Ilya Ibrahim, a rally of the kind will be held in Lagos, the
economic center of the country, next Wednesday and then spread to
all the other five geo-political zones across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja rally was organized in good order thanks to the
support of the government, a sharp contrast to the anti-Abacha
rally in Lagos which was dispersed by the police before it
actually began.
</P>
<P>
Under the military government's transition to civil rule
program, presidential election will start on August 1 and the
elected government will be inaugurated two months later.
</P>
<P>
However, no official presidential candidate has been produced
by the five political parties less than five months ahead of the
election.
</P>
<P>
The situation is said to be the result of the alleged
possibility that Abacha might some day later make known his
intention to run the race.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who started to head the current administration in late
1993, has been tight-mouthed on whether or not he is to do so,
saying that the issue should be decided by the constituency.
</P>
<P>
Although the parties failed to agree on making Abacha their
consensus candidate at a consultation last month, the idea of one
person to move the nation ahead has been endorsed by one of the
three government transition institutions.
</P>
<P>
B.I.C. Ijomah, a member of the Transition Implementation
Committee, said Tuesday there is nothing wrong for the parties to
consider consensus candidacy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the issue of consensus candidate is not a
bad idea, given the political uncertainties that "we have
traversed over the years, and considering the fact that electoral
malpractices have been frequently linked with military
intervention", the Daily Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest example of military intervention in election in
Nigeria took place in 1993, when the then military regime
annulled the election result.
</P>
<P>
Ijomah, the first official of the transition institutions who
openly makes such remarks on the sensitive issue of Abacha's
candidacy, further said he saw nothing wrong in Abacha succeeding
himself.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that no politician in the country seemed bold
enough to challenge the credentials of Abacha which he said was
obviously intimidating.
</P>
<P>
Allaying the fears of one party domination, he added, "We
envisage the emergence of a national government in which all the
parties would participate in the governance of this nation."
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of Ijomah's remarks with the announcement of
more pro-Abacha rallies, is, to many observers, expected to give
a boost to the campaign to press Abacha to contest the election.
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself may not continue to keep silence over the issue
and would make known his decision before long, they added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Scientists Make Medical Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian scientists,
conducting studies on the recent Coxsackie viral outbreak in
Sarawak, East Malaysia, has made a medical breakthrough with the
successful cloning of a new virus strain.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made by a team of Universiti (University)
Malaysia Sarawak (shortened as Unimas), Unimas' Institute of
Health and Community Medicine (IHCM) Director Mary Jane Cardosa
told a news conference in Kuching, Sarawak, Wednesday, according
to official media reports.
</P>
<P>
The virus has been identified as a member of the Adenovirus
family of virus, commonly associated with the common cold, she
said, adding it was found in many of the 31 children who were
suspected to have died from an epidemic of hand, foot and mouth
disease in Sarawak last year.
</P>
<P>
"The findings are not conclusive. We cannot prove yet that it
caused the deaths of the 31 children because it is a new virus but
that is an interesting finding in itself," she was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cardosa said the IHCM, which commenced the research last
August, was expected to come up with a test on the viral clones by
the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
So far, she said, the virology team had determined part of the
viral DNA sequence for which the data was made freely available to
other scientists involved in similar studies.
</P>
<P>
The work done at Unimas has also attracted the attention of
Science, the official journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, renowned for its scientific accuracy and
publication of ground-breaking research, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday, Sarawak State's Deputy Chief Minister
George Chan announced that the state government had allocated
500,000 ringgit (about 129,870 U.S. dollars) to the IHCM to
continue its ongoing studies on the viral outbreak.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Wednesday
said the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front
(NDF) rebels have resolved the issue of indemnification of victims
of human rights violations under the Ferdinand Marcos regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference at the Presidential
Palace, Ramos said that the settling of the disputes paved the way
for the completion of the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for
Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law between the two
panels.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the agreement covers a wide spectrum of human rights
concerns and can be considered as a landmark as it would be the
first substantive agreement reached between the government and the
NDF after 28 years of armed conflict and 12 years of on-and-off
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The president congratulated the two panels while urging them to
redouble their efforts to end the conflicts so that the country
can pursue lasting peace and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"As the two panels move on to the discussion of social,
economic and political reforms, I pledge the support of our
government for the attainment of these social reforms that would
foster authentic development, social justice and peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, currently the second largest rebel group in the
country, reached the consensus over the human rights issue in a
latest round of peace talks with government negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Former president Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986 after
ruling the country for 20 years. He died in Hawaii, the United
States, in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Results of Bird Flu Study Announced in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The results of a case-control
study conducted on the bird flu, or flu A (H5N1), in Hong Kong
show that visiting poultry stalls in the one week before becoming
ill was the strongest risk factor, a spokesman for the local
health authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study was jointly carried out in the past few months by the
Department of Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the results of the study, the spokesman said the
findings so far suggested that the transmission of the virus,
regardless of the modes, continues to be inefficient.
</P>
<P>
He said that the case-control study was aimed at comparing
different exposure risk factors between patients and controls.
</P>
<P>
It covered a number of areas including live poultry exposure,
exposure when preparing food, food eaten during the week before
onset and human illness exposure during the week before onset.
</P>
<P>
"The strongest risk factor identified is visiting poultry
stalls in the one week before becoming ill," the spokesman pointed
out. This supported earlier findings that human-to-human
transmission of the disease is inefficient, he added.
</P>
<P>
There were 18 confirmed bird flu cases in Hong Kong, and the
onset day of the last case was December 28, 1997. A 24-year-old
female patient is still under treatment and in stable condition
while 11 others have been discharged after recovery. Six people
died of the disease.

FUZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has

<HEADLINE> Special Court Proposed in Malaysia to Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A special court has been
proposed to be set up in Malaysia to deal with cases of illegal
entry of immigrants to expedite their deportation, a senior police
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, by the police, was discussed at the first meeting
on illegal immigrants between the police, the Immigration
Department, the National Registration Department and the
Attorney-General's Chambers here Wednesday, said Deputy Director
of the Department of Internal Security and Public Order at the
federal police headquarters Yusof Said.
</P>
<P>
The normal courts take a long time to dispose of cases
involving illegal immigrants because they also have to deal with
other cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
"When cases involving illegal immigrants are delayed, it means
a longer detention for them and further costs for the country.
Therefore, with the setting up of a special court, prosecution and
the various process will take a shorter time and they could be
deported faster," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The special court would only deal with cases of illegal entry
of immigrants while criminal cases involving illegal immigrants
would still be heard in normal courts.
</P>
<P>
"The matter will be proposed to the government to overcome the
problems relating to illegal immigrants... the court may operate
for a year or two and when the problem is over, it can be closed
down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday's meeting, chaired by Inspector-General of
Police Abdul Rahim Noor, also discussed various proposals to deal
with the problem of illegal immigrants including the imposition of
whipping for illegal immigrants and the mastermind behind their
illegal entry, the expansion or construction of holding centers
for illegal immigrants and intensified patrols to prevent illegal
entry of immigrants.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Discount Chains Permitted to Sell Reimported Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Discount retailers in the
United States have won a legal case concerning whether they are
permitted to sell copyrighted U.S. goods in the country that they
have bought for less from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The case began in Los Angeles over the selling of shampoo
produced by L'Anza, a hair care company. L'Anza shipped several
cases of its shampoo to a British company at a 35 percent discount
on the understanding that it would sell in Malta and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
But the company simply shipped it to discounters in the United
States. Later L'Anza sued the discounter, claiming copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright owners do not
have the exclusive right to control such marketing of their
products.
</P>
<P>
The rule now allows distributors and retailers to take
advantage of the lower prices manufacturers offer overseas and so
consumers will get benefits, said lawyers representing discount
retailers.
</P>
<P>
However, other lawyers said that it could also have the
unintended effect of disencouraging companies from exporting their
products.

<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed

promised "a new beginning" for his country, with priority on
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, who has been in exile in neighboring Guinea since
being overthrown in the coup last May, arrived in the Lungi
international airport Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He then rode on a motorcade across the capital to the main
stadium, where a ceremony was held to mark his return to power,
which has been made possible after the west Africa peace-keeping
force led by Nigeria dislodged the force the military junta of
Johnny Koroma that has taken power since the coup.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Creole local language, Kabbah told the 40,000

<P>
Kabbah also promised a national reconciliation among all
parties and rebuilding of the war-ravaged infrastructure and
economy.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the occasion, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity said

collective victory, but most importantly, to send a clear and
loud message to all men with guns in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The message, he said, is that "Africans will no longer
tolerate irresponsible people with guns to challenge the will of
the people, and to disrupt the democratic process now in motion
in the continent."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha was reportedly
given a hero's welcome in Freetown, for Nigeria's leading role in

Sierra Leone meant that "African problems can be solved and
should be solved by Africans."
</P>
<P>
He noted that for the first time in Africa's political
history, a government that came to power through violent means
was overthrown through "the collective effort of the sub-region".
</P>
<P>

Tuesday include Guinean President Lansana Conte, Malian President
Alpha Kunare and Niger's President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara,

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) - A high-ranking government
mission led by Tanzanian Health Minister Aaron Chiduo is in the
northwestern region of Kagera to probe a mysterious fever which
has killed some 700 people since last July.
</P>

began to check the gravity of the fever in response to an appeal
from the Muleba District of the Kagera Region which lies on the
western bank of the Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that they thought the fever was malaria
at first, but it killed people in a very short period of two
days, and in Rubya hospital alone 665 people had died of the
fever between last July and January this year.
</P>
<P>
"The unknown fever is killing some 20 to 30 people daily in
the district and it is feared that unrecorded deaths in villages
might be twice as much," they said.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Plans to Extend 95 Billion Yuan in Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China (SDB), a policy-oriented bank that finances major projects,
plans to extend a total of 95 billion yuan (11.4 billion
U.S. dollars) in loans this year to support the country's economic
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The amount breaks down into 90 billion yuan in loans for
working capital and 5 billion yuan in loans for investment in
fixed assets, according to bank president Yao Zhenyan.
</P>
<P>
Loan extensions will be tilted toward basic industries,
infrastructure, the less-developed central and western regions,
information industry, large enterprises and enterprise groups, he
said.
</P>
<P>
No more loans will be issued to luxury real estate projects and
flush commercial facilities, he said, nor will loans be extended
to small projects or projects with low economic returns.
</P>
<P>
SDB is one of China's three policy-oriented banks set up in
1994 to fund major national projects. During the past four years
it has accounted for one-third of all fixed-asset loans extended
by state banks, with loans for capital construction at 70 percent
of the national figure.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that SDB issued 107.7 billion yuan in loans
last year, of which 95.5 percent went to large or technical
upgrading projects.

<HEADLINE> ADB Future Aid Focuses on Poverty Reduction in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Poverty reduction in Nepal will
remain the focus of the assistance by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) in the coming three years starting from 1999, the bank said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the Country Programming
Mission of the ADB and the Nepali government, the assistance aims
to help Nepal attain higher sustainable growth to create jobs and
increase incomes for the poor, the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture will continue to be an important sector due to its
poverty reduction potential as well as its large share in the
overall output, and further support will be provided for reforms
in the sector, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said support will also be given for physical and social
infrastructure projects, capacity building, human development and
natural resources management, in particular environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
The programmed level of lending will be about 75 million U.S.
dollars per annum, while the projected level of technical
assistance grants will be around five million dollars each year,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be provided by the Asian Development Fund, the
bank's soft loan window which provides loans with no interest and
a 40-year repayment schedule, including a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the bank lent Nepal annually 90 to 100
million dollars, said Ali Shah, resident representative of the ADB
in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that substantial progress has been
made in the ADB-aided sectors in Nepal, such as education, road
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Programs for the coming three years include projects for urban
water supply for the Kathmandu Valley as well as for small towns,
rural electrification and distribution improvement, the
development of private sector through capital market development
and the creation of an enabling environment, crop diversification,
roads and basic education, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said technical assistance will be provided for the
preparation of these projects as well as for policy advice and
capacity building.
</P>
<P>
The bank's assistance will also focus on sub-regional
cooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal with an
emphasis on projects which can be implemented in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The bank will look into the Pancheswor hydropower project and
conduct technical study and, if feasible, it will provide loans,
an official from the bank told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is a founding member of the ADB and an important borrower
from the Asian Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
On a cumulative basis, the bank's lending to Nepal had reached
1.5 billion dollars for 92 loans by the end of 1997, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the agriculture sector received 45 percent of the
amount, followed by energy, transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, Nepal had a portfolio of 24 loans
totaling 602 million dollars, the bank added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Observe Two Special Supernovae </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Beijing
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) observed two special supernovae
earlier this month, according to BAO President Li Qibin.
</P>
<P>
Li said a massive stare was the progenitor of one Type II
supernova. He noted that the spectral lines of its multiple
components indicate that surrounding stellar matter is excited
during a supernova explosion.
</P>
<P>
He said the second sighting involved a Type Ib supernova, a
rare stellar event which can observed on earth. A massive star was
also the progenitor of the second supernova, said Li, adding this
its hydrogen envelope has faded. The fact that the supernova
appears in a least a couple of interacting galaxies will
contribute to studies on the evolution of galaxies and the
formation of large stars.
</P>
<P>
The supernovae, which the Central Bureau for Astronomical
Telegrams under the International Astronomical Union titled SN
1998S and SN 1998T, have attracted the attention of astronomers
throughout the world, according to Prof. Hu Jingyao, a scientist
at the observatory's Xinglong Station.
</P>
<P>
Two 10m telescopes, the largest of their kind in the world,
located in Hawaii are currently tracking the supernovae, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Supernovae are an important study project for astrophysics and
are an important tool in cosmological research.
</P>
<P>
The 60cm telescope at the Xinglong Station has been used to
observe some 25-odd supernovae, with China ranking a world leader
in terms of number of bright supernovae thus far observed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Granted Favor on Exporting Cotton into EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been granted
derogation on the exportation of ployester-cotto. yarn into the
European Union (EU) with an exemption from the rules of origin
contained in the Lome Convention starting in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Export Information available at Export
Board of Zambia in Lusaka, the derogation was granted to Zambia
by the Customs Cooperation Committee of the EU and the ACP
(African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries late last year.
</P>
<P>
The derogation stipulated that polyester-cotton yarn
originating from Zambia starting in 2000 will be exempted from
the rules of origin contained in the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The rules in the Lome Convention require the exported products
to be labeled in metric for firms using metric system in the EU
markets.
</P>
<P>
Exports which do not convert their products to metric system
but simply provide a description of the products in metric units
may not meet EU customers' real requirements.
</P>
<P>
The rules provide that the products exported into the EU
markets target various cultures there sinc.e technical standards
are yet to be harmonized. Packaging and labeling of products may
be affected by environmental laws prevailing in the EU markets.
</P>
<P>
But the EU and ACP committee has exempted Zambia's
polyester-cotton yarn exported into the EU markets from all these
rules, making Zambian cotton exporters to European countries at
easy to export their cotton products into this region.
</P>
<P>
According to the derogation, the amount exempted will be 3,500
tons per year and will become effective when the decision is
published in the official journal of the European Community.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide environmental
knowledge contest among China's middle school students began today
with the publication of the test questions and an answer sheet in

</P>
<P>
The contest, jointly sponsored by the National Environmental

with the help of schools and parents, it won't be too hard," he
added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tourists Cut Sharply in Egypt due to Terror Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is being hit by a sharp
decline in the number of foreign tourists in recent months after a
terrorist attack last November, the Egyptian Gazette reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last December, only 178,000 tourists, less than half the figure
in December 1996, visited Egypt, the English-language newspaper
quoted a bulletin issued by Egypt's Central Bank on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure further dropped to 168,000 in January 1998, Abdel
Abdel-Aziz, chairman of the General Authority to Promote Tourism,
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the tourism depression to the bloody killing in
southern resort Luxor by Muslim militants, which left 58 foreign
tourists dead.
</P>
<P>
After the massacre, foreign travel agencies and tourists
forwent their plans to travel to Egypt, dealing a heavy blow one
of its major hard currency earners.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui said early this
month that hotel occupancy plunged from an average of 67 percent
to December's 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
And EgyptAir, the national carrier, has lost a total of 600
million pounds (176.47 million U.S. dollars) in international
flights after the assault, according to Hossein Hosni, head of the
commercial section.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has been striving to recover the
tourism, and the tourism minister said that many countries have
responded positively to its efforts.

closed in firmer territory Wednesday assisted by a record-breaking
finish on Wall Street overnight and stronger markets in Hong Kong,

</P>
<P>
It was also supported by good gains in the banking sector and
in major industrial stocks on the local bourse.

stronger at 2714.8 points, off its early high of 2724.2 points.

<P>
The all industrials index added 41.0 points to finish at 4657.7
while the all resources index climbed 6.3 points to 1164.4.

<P>
"News Corp continued its recent rally ... and the banking
sector was strong again," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
News Corp shares rose 30 cents after a strong performance on
U.S. markets overnight due to speculation that the global media
group could buy back some of its convertible notes.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower on Japanese Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A corruption scandal at a major
Japanese bank took its toll on the yen Wednesday, dragging the
Australian dollar lower, while bond-friendly economic surveys
fueled market speculation of a further interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia Bank foreign exchange manager Darrin Stewart said
the yen suffered against its U.S. counterpart after prosecutors
arrested a senior Bank of Japan official suspected of taking
bribes.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the yen saw the Australian dollar slip lower,
unable to sustain its intraday high of 67.15 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar finished the local session at 66.78 U.S.
cents, from 66.85 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan official was allegedly wined and dined by at
least two banks in return for leaking information on the central
bank's operations, AFX-Asia reported.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the U.S. dollar finished the Asian session on a
firm note, causing the Australian dollar to weaken.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the U.S. dollar/yen is quite strong. The market
is keen to buy U.S. dollars or sell yen on the back of this
scandal in Tokyo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Australian bonds continued to build on recent gains,
buoyed by positive sentiment as market participants see the
likelihood of a further interest rate cut increasing.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a few positives for interest rates delivered
to the market over the last couple of days," traders said.
</P>
<P>
They said recent business and consumer sentiment surveys had
been weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 85.65 yen, from 85.08 yen
at Tuesday's close, and at 1.2223 marks, up from 1.2207 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. NASA scientists
declared Tuesday that the Pathfinder spacecraft is officially dead
following a last-ditch attempt to communicate with the little
rover and the lander which had sent more than 16,000 images to the
Earth last summer.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the Pathfinder spacecraft likely had long
ago succumbed to the cold and dust of the Martian winter.
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense of pleasure amongst the fight team because
we did everything we started out to do during the course of the
mission," said Ben Toyoshima, the flight controller at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
</P>
<P>
Pathfinder landed on Mars on July 4 and immediately began
sending home images of a reddish, rocky terrain as well as daily
weather reports. With the rover designed to last at least a week
and the lander at least a month, Pathfinder had outlived all
expectations.

LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Corel Corp., with its

DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) - France encourages its

SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices increased sharply
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) surged by 31.79 points to close at 1577.84 points on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that stock prices finished mostly higher as
moderate index-fund buying propelled the STII up by 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said that firmer Southeast Asian currencies and
expectations that February's non-oil domestic exports will post a
strong growth boosted the market sentiment. However, they also
noted that most foreign funds remained sidelined as they await
more companies to announce their financial results.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 341.37 million units, valued
at 400.5 million Singapore dollars (about 245.71 million U.S.
dollars). Declines led advances by 204 to 142, while 267 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd again was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 30.86 million units. It was followed by
M. Resources which had 22.34 million shares traded. Rekapac was
next with 21.67 million of its shares changed hands.
</P>

Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investment Helps Upgrade Aviation Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's aviation sector has
attracted foreign investments totalling 15 billion U.S. dollars
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The sector has grown by an average of 20 percent annually since
China's introduction of the reform and opening-up policies in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Demand continues to outstrip increases in the nation's aircraft
fleet and number of airports, with many airports unable to service
advanced imported aircraft, according to the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Accelerating the construction of basic facilities is a
necessity, despite limited state investments available for the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ability to add new aircraft in recent years has mainly
depended on foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, China operated only a small fleet of
airliners mainly manufactured in the former Soviet Union. Somewhat
later, air carriers adopted international leases, and have since
introduced over 200 aircraft involving foreign funding of some 12
billion US dollars. CAAC plans to increase its aircraft fleet to
over 1,000 units by the year 2000.

</P>
<P>
Fifteen airports had attracted similar loans totalling 900
million US dollars by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign government loans totalling 123 million US dollars have

project. Construction of the project has been accelerated, and the
facility will be completed at a cost of over nine billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Phones Arafat to Express Regret over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
late Tuesday night to express regret over the killing of three
Palestinians by Israeli soldiers near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made midnight, the Prime Minister's Office said
Netanyahu requested Arafat to pass on his condolences to the
families of the killed Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised that a thorough probe would be made into
the shooting incident, in which the Israeli soldiers at the
Tarkumiya roadblock shot at a Palestinian van which they claimed
was trying to run over them. Three Palestinians were killed and
four others wounded in the shooting, two of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army claimed that an Israeli soldier was lightly
wounded by the van, forcing the nearby soldiers to open fire. But
Palestinian witnesses and security officials disputed the
soldiers' account of the incident, saying the van driver was just
accelerating to prevent another car from overtaking in the long
line waiting to pass the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian worker riding in the van said because the driver
was shot first while accelerating and his foot kept stepping on
the accelerator, so the van ran into a concrete block.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli statement added that Netanyahu ensured Arafat that
Israel is working towards advancing the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly replied that he shared Netanyahu's desire to
push forward the peace talks, and he agreed to pass on the
Israeli leader's condolences to the victim families.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier Tuesday evening at a joint news conference
held after meeting with visiting Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in
Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said he had received a message from Arafat on
the latter's willingness to hold a summit with him. He added that
Israel will examine the message in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Following the Tuesday shooting, tensions between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian residents flared in the Hebron
area. Incidents of stone-throwing and petrol bomb attacks at
Israeli soldiers were reported in Hebron overnight, as
Palestinians vowed to avenge the killing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops were put on high alert and additional troops
were deployed in sensitive areas in the West Bank to brace for
possible eruption of Palestinian violence. Jewish settlements
have also been warned to keep high alert against Palestinian
attacks.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's State Secretary
for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchet arrived in Kuwait Wednesday to
discuss with Kuwaiti leaders issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The minister who is in charge of the Middle East affairs is
scheduled to hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah and the Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah during his two-day stay here, Kuwait
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
This is Fatchet's second visit to Kuwait in less than a
year. Diplomatic sources in Kuwait was quoted as saying that
Fatchet would reiterate Britain's commitment to the independence,
security and stability of the small Gulf state which was occupied
by Iraq for seven months in 1990-91..
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks would cover Britain's keenness
on Iraq's full compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1154 which stipulates that Iraq must fully implement
the accord it signed with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Fatchet will also discussed with the Kuwaiti leaders the
U.N. 1153 resolution which raises the Iraqi oil exports from
the current 2 billion U.S. dollars every six months to 5.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He will also inspect the British air force detachment of
Tornado aircraft based in Kuwait. Britain sent eight Tornado
warplanes to Kuwait on February 9 to join a U.S. military
build-up in the Gulf region following the crisis between Iraq
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Fatchet's first visited Kuwait in June 1997.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's State Secretary

<P>
The minister who is in charge of the Middle East affairs is
scheduled to hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah and the Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah during his two-day stay here, Kuwait

Fatchet would reiterate Britain's commitment to the independence,
security and stability of the small Gulf state which was occupied
by Iraq for seven months in 1990-91..

The sources said the talks would cover Britain's keenness
on Iraq's full compliance with United Nations Security Council

the accord it signed with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan over arms inspections.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computers Penetrate Nearly Half of U.S. Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Personal computers penetrated
45 percent of U.S. households in 1997, up from 40.2 percent in
1996, according to preliminary data released Tuesday by market
research firm Computer Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The study found that PC ownership is linked to education and
income levels. Nearly 80 percent of high-level annual income
(100,000 U.S. dollars and above) households have a PC, compared
with about one-quarter of households with annual income under
30,000 dollars have a PC.
</P>
<P>
U.S. homes with some college education are much more likely to
have PCs, with ownership at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I expect penetration to continue to climb and surpass 50 percent
of all U.S. homes by the end of the century," said David Tremblay,
senior analyst at Computer Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary findings are drawn from a survey of 50,000 U.S.
households conducted by the research firm, he said, adding that
the final results will be released in May.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Believers Enjoy Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some lawmakers from religious
circles expressed appreciation for efforts made by the Chinese
government to protect normal religious activities and the
legitimate rights and interests of religious bodies.
</P>
<P>
Sadic Karihagi, a deputy to the National People's Congress
(NPC) which has been in session here since last Thursday and heat
of the Aitga Mosque in Kashgar in the central Asian region of
Xinjiang, said the Chinese government has always provided
protection for freedom in religious belief and the customs of
moslems.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided various kinds of services for
moslems making pilgrimages, he said. Since the 1980s, more than
43,000 Chinese moslems have been to Mecca, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present there are more than 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, more
than 20 times the number two decades ago, and Xinjiang has a
higher density of mosques relative to moslem population than any
Arab country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there are more than 28,000 clergies like him
in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old NPC deputy said that the government also
respects the diet and funeral customs of moslems. In recent years,
he said, China's law enforcement departments have severely cracked
down on the publishing of reading materials that harm the feelings
of moslems.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice-chairman of the Buddhist
Association of China, said that since the 1980s, the central
government has spent more than 200 million yuan renovating
lamaseries in Tibet and publishing Tibetan Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
The China Advanced Institute of Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibet
Institute of Tibetan Buddhism have been established in Beijing and
Lhasa, respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 1,700 places of worship for
Tibetan Buddhists in Tibet, with 46,000 monks and nuns living in
monasteries.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Shi Yongxin, abbot of the Shaolin Temple in central
China's Henan Province, said local governments have set aside 30
million yuan in repairing the temple.
</P>
<P>
"Localities throughout China have formulated regulations to
protect the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles,
and we religious people should in turn learn to protect ourselves
according to law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the temple filed suits against some
factories who used the temple name in their trademarks without
Shaolin's consent. The temple won all the cases, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Cypriot Delegation Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from "The Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" is currently in Iran for an "official
visit", seeking Tehran's support for the Turkish-Cypriot
self-claimed state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tehran Times published Wednesday, Peker
Turgud, special envoy of Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
appealed Islamic nations to cooperate with his government.
</P>
<P>
"The Muslims of northern Cyprus need the friendly attention of
the Islamic world and, more importantly, those of the people of
the Islamic Republic of Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran is currently president of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and "we hope that attention will
be paid to the resolution passed by the OIC."
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of its visit to Iran, the three-man
northern Cypriot delegation believed that "it will have
far-reaching impact on the ties between Iranian nation and the
people of northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So far the U.N.-led peace negotiations during the past years
between the two sides have not achieved any concrete results that
could lead the reunion to the two communities.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Terror Attacks on Israel Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security service has
issued a stiff warning about possible terror attacks in Israel,
Israel Radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"All terrorist organizations, and especially the Hamas, plan to
carry out large-scale attacks unprecedented in their scope," the
Israeli General Security Service chief Ami Ayalon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Islamic radical group Hamas has been planning
attacks in populous areas of Israel, Ayalon told the Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee of the Israeli Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
According to his assessment, Hamas is gaining strength in the
Palestinian society due to the deadlock of the peace process, and
the renewed activity of its founder and spiritual leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, who was released by Israel last October.
</P>
<P>
He said the tranquility in recent months has resulted from
successful prevention efforts by the security service.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 100 terror attacks have been thwarted
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, about 460 terrorist activities were reported in
1997, 200 more than in 1996, killing 29 Israelis and wounding 414
others, the security official said.

<HEADLINE> Province Wages War against Monopoly by Public Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The provincial administration for
industries and commerce in east China's Shandong Province has
waged a war against a monopoly of local public utilities who often
force consumers to pay for what they do not want to buy.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the authorities have been investigating
monopoly activities conducted by state-owned enterprises in the
fields of telecommunications, power-supply, water and cooking gas.
</P>
<P>
In China, these industries long have been under state monopoly
and these firms have used their privileges to ward off
competitors. They frequently infringe on the legal rights of
consumers, provincial officials say.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of illegal activities long has existed, but none of
them have been handled seriously and punished according to the
law," says Zhang Jingwu, an official from the provincial
administration.
</P>
<P>
For example, some power-suppliers have asked their clients to
buy the equipment they supply or threaten to halt the supply of
electricity. Some gas companies also have forced clients to buy
their gas-ovens.
</P>
<P>
In August of 1993, China issued a law governing unlawful
competition. Since then, the administration has dealt with 2,188
cases related to illicit competitive activities, 90 percent of
them related to fake products and infringements of intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that it is very difficult to handle these
cases because of difficulties in verification and protectionism in
some localities.
</P>
<P>
As a normal practice in the country, these public utilities
enterprises are both managers of the companies as well as the
administrators of the industries, he said, noting that the kind of
units are a typical combination of officials and merchants.
</P>
<P>
This year, the authorities have made it a main task to limit
the monopoly of these units, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Hails Chongqing's Good Beginning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin lauded
Chongqing for its good beginning since its municipality was
approved a year ago at the National People's Congress (NPC), the
top legislature as China's fourth municipality after Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion with deputies from Chongqing to the
current NPC session, which opened last Thursday, Jiang noted that
Chongqing has achieved smooth transition in administrative
divisions and the new structure as a municipality has embarked on
the track of normal operation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee, said the
municipality has worked out a new development strategy and plan
and adopted a series of measures to maintain steady economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the founding of Chongqing municipality signifies
that it has entered a new period of growth, Jiang urged the city
authorities to do work well in the following fields:
</P>
<P>
-- Complete as scheduled the displacement of people in the
gigantic Three Gorges Project, which has been under construction
since 1993. And Some 85 percent of the population to be relocated
are in the area of the municipality.
</P>
<P>
-- Promote the retolling of state-owned enterprises and
reinvigorate Chongqing as an old industrial base.
</P>
<P>
-- Step up rural economic growth and resolve the problem of
feeding and clothing the local needy people adequately by the end
of the century and,
</P>
<P>
-- Further strengthen eco-environmental development and achieve
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
In another development, in joining in a panel discussion with
deputies from east China's Shandong Province, Jiang addressed the
importance of handling well the relationships between reform,
development and stability.
</P>
<P>
He noted the eight-percent economic growth rate was decided in
accordance with China's current situation and need for its
long-term development. China, as a developing country, is still in
the primary stage of socialism. It will have stronger
comprehensive strength and accomplish different work well only if
it can be developed a little faster economically, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"The speed we are aiming at is a practical and substantial
one with the prerequisite of ceaselessly increasing efficiency and
optimizing structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Shandong officials to emancipate their minds
and be bold in blazing new trails to work for a new situation in
reform and opening up, and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, increased efforts should be made to strengthen and
improve Party organizations, and especially leading bodies, Jiang
urged. And attention should be paid to selecting good and
competent officials, leading officials in charge of principal
duties in particular.

<HEADLINE> 60 Key Projects in Tibet Completed with Nationwide Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from China's
Tibet Autonomous Region said today that 60 out of the 62 key
projects decided to be built in Tibet by the central government
have been completed, and that construction of all the projects
will have been completed by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibet regional people's
government, said at a press conference sponsored by the ongoing
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), to which he
is a deputy, that the projects required a planned investment of
2.3 billion yuan (277 million US dollars), but that by the end of
last year, actual investment had exceeded three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The projects are playing a vital role in boosting economic
development in Tibet," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The projects were decided right after a national Tibet-related
work conference was convened in 1994. The central government and
local governments across the country are responsible for funding
the projects.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet
Regional People's Congress, said at the press conference that
since the conference, the central government and local governments
in other parts of China have been giving considerable human,
financial and material assistance to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, more than 600 cadres from other
parts of the country have gone to work in Tibet, contributing much
to the region's economic reform and development, Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
According to Raidi, Tibet's local GDP in 1997 reached 7.35
billion yuan, an increase of ten percent over the previous year.
The per capita incomes of urban and rural people there in 1997
were 5,130 yuan and 1,040 yuan respectively, up two percent and
6.7 percent respectively over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Creates Parliament-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait saw the most serious
clash between the National Assembly and government Tuesday after a
no-confidance motion was tabled against a high powered cabinet
minister in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The row came as the Crown Prince and Prime Minister strongly
criticized some parliamentary members of trying to abuse democracy
in the small Gulf state which has the only parliament in the
region's emirate states.
</P>
<P>
Islamist parliamentary members Tuesday secured 10 signatures
and submitted a motion for a vote of no-confidence against the
Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah who were accused
of violating the country's laws through allowing controversial
books to be publicly displayed which are blasphemous to the
Almighty and Islamic teachings.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah sternly warned the opposition
political group that their activities could put the country's
future at stake.
</P>
<P>
All newspapers, English and Arabic, carried stories in their
front pages Wednesday regarding the new trouble on the country's
political arena.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said after seven hours of intense grilling over
the banned books issue, a motion was submitted which opens the
doors for a vote of no-confidence against the minister.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad stressed that "the interests of Kuwait is at the
top of all issues and every other issue disappears when the
interests of Kuwaiti matter."
</P>
<P>
He explained that Kuwaiti government will not be lenient with
those who are trying to undermine the country's security.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwaiti constitution, the no-confidence will be
taken up for voting next Tuesday, seven days following it was
tabled in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
If a simple majority of 26 members in the 50-member parliament
approves, the minister will immediately be forced out of
office. Some Kuwaiti cabinet ministers who are also parliamentary
members are not allowed to vote in the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The motion against Sheikh Saud tabled by 10 parliamentary
members is the fourth such motion in Kuwait's 35 years of
democracy, but none of the three previous no-confidence attempts
has passed.
</P>
<P>
Last July, some parliamentary members lodged a grilling
against Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan over alleged
mismanagement, irregularities in handling public funds and
negligence. But they failed to to initiate a vote of
no-confidence against him after 13 hours of strenuous questioning
in the parliament.

SHENZHEN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Airport Co. Ltd. in
south China's Guangdong Province expects to raise 623 million yuan
from 100 million A shares issued today through the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange. Each share costs 6.38 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build a 60,000-square-meter expansion
of the terminal building to improve the airport's yearly handling
capacity to be 7.7 million passengers by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Airport, which handled 4.43 million passengers and
99,000 tons of cargo in 1997, has become China's fourth largest
with 87 flights connecting 57 domestic and foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project, which started at the end of 1996, is
expected to be finished by the end of this year and put into
operation in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The airport also is making an effort to develop its air cargo
business and started cooperating with U.S.-based Federal Express

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Israel's Economic Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel deserves praise for its
economic achievements in 1997, local daily Haaretz Wednesday
quoted the vice president of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Stanley Fischer, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Normally the IMF writes letters to ministers of finance when
things are going badly; in this case it is a pleasure to have the
opportunity to write a letter of congratulations on your country's
economic achievements," Fischer said in a letter sent Tuesday to
Israeli Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has just finished preparing its annual report on the
Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Fischer noted that Israel succeeded in
significantly reducing inflation last year for the first time in
several years.
</P>
<P>
The country also made significant progress in structural
reforms, especially in privatization, most notably via the sale of
some of the state-owned banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third area in which the Israeli government deserved praise,
the IMF official said, was its fiscal policy, particularly the
fact that it met its deficit reduction target for 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer warned that the government can not afford to
rest on its laurels, especially given the current instability on
world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it must utilize the momentum that it has built up to
continue reducing its involvement in the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Neeman responded to the letter by saying that the policy of
budgetary restraint, adherence to deficit reduction goals, and
implementation of structural reforms taken by the Israeli
government was a signal to the international financial community
that Israel is a stable and attractive country to invest in.
</P>
<P>
Only by sending the signal, he said, could Israel continue to
attract foreign investors and improve its ability to raise
capital on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Israel soared in 1997 to 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars, compared to only 2.4 billion dollars in 1996. This
represents an increase of almost 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Price Increase Blamed on Demand, Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Alcohol is becoming more
expensive in China this year because of the rising cost of raw
materials and increasing demand, according to a recent issue of
the Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that shortages of maize, sugar cane and
sweet potatoes used to make alcohol and a rising domestic demand,
led by chemical factories and hospitals, is resulting in spiraling
prices for alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with overseas prices of alcohol rising, Chinese
producers are taking a keener interest in exports, which also is

CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,500 firms from 46
countries and regions will show their best quality at the Cairo
International Trade Fair that opens in the Egyptian capital
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 3,500 Egyptian companies participated in the largest
annual trade extravaganza in the Middle East and Africa, which
runs from March 11 until 20. Public entry will be allowed in the
second half of this period.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Egypt has taken advantage of the annual
event to attract investment and partners and promote export.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo fair is hosting a record number of global attendants
and providing the most spacious ever display floor this time in
its 31-year history, Egyptian Minister of Trade Ahmed Goweili told
reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among many other amenities offered to the exhibitors, a customs
zone has been set up for the fist time at the fair grounds for the
Customs Department to clear customs procedures for goods brought
from abroad to be shown at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Also, for the first time, an international communication center

absent from the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
China, marking its 13th turn-up at the gathering, has a
100-strong delegation to do business here with its world

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police on High Alert for Purim Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police across the
country are on high alert for possible terror attacks as the
Jewish holiday Purim will begin Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, police reinforcements were already deployed in
public places and places of entertainment, which are the easy
targets for possible terror attacks. Police are to increase
security checks at the entrances to major cities to prevent the
penetration of Palestinian militants.
</P>
<P>
The Purim festival, which celebrates the victory of Jews over
the likes of Haman who tried to kill the Jews of Persia, will
begin at sunset. It is customary for adults accompanied by
children in masquerade to bring gifts of food to neighbors,
friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
But in the past years, the Purim holiday was ominously
associated with a spate of violence and terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, three people were killed and dozens wounded when a
Hamas suicide bomber blew up himself in a street side cafe in
central Tel Aviv. On the Purim day 1996, 13 people were killed
and 108 others injured in a Hamas suicide bombing of a bus
outside the Dizengoff Shopping Center in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
In February 1994, Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein gunned
down 29 Palestinian worshipers at the Tomb of Patriarchs (Ibrahim
Mosque for Arabs) in Hebron on the Purim day.
</P>
<P>
A week before Purim in 1993, two people were killed and nine
others wounded in Tel Aviv by a knife-wielding Palestinian from
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
This year seemed to be no exception for violence as three
Palestinians were killed and four others wounded Tuesday evening
at a roadblock near Hebron when Israeli soldiers opened fire to
prevent a Palestinian van from running over checkpoint. Israeli
troops in the West Bank are also on high alert against eruption of
Palestinian violence and revenge attacks.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Province Reports Balanced Energy Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics show that
east China's Jiangsu Province has recorded balanced energy supply
and demand in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's energy sector, once faced with severe shortages, has
grown rapidly since the initiation of the nation's Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). The province's installed power
generating capacity has grown by an average one million kw
annually, representing 10.4 percent. The province's annual coal
output has jumped to 21 million tons, with crude oil output
exceeding one million tons.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu formerly relied on other parts of China to provide as
much as 80 percent of its total energy needs. While Jiangsu's
energy production grew by an average two percent annually between
1980 and 1985, the accompanying 7.4 percent growth in annual
consumption resulted in a massive shortfall in energy.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that improving balance in Jiangsu's energy supply
and demand can be mainly attributed to increasing coal production
and rising energy imports.
</P>
<P>
The province's power supply currently exceeds demand in most
periods of the year, with exception in summer when additional
power is needed to counter characteristic heat waves.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) representing Taiwanese
compatriots living in the mainland is the smallest compared with
other NPC delegations, but it is no less active during the NPC
session.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation consists of only 13 members, who
represent the 34,000 Taiwanese compatriots living in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
This rate of representation is the highest among all the NPC
delegations.
</P>
<P>
"While every half a million people in Henan elected one deputy
to the NPC, every 3,000 or so Taiwan compatriots living in the
mainland did one deputy," said Yang Guoqing, head of the Taiwan
NPC delegation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 NPC deputies of Taiwan origin, ten were elected
for the first time. More than half of them are highly-accomplished
professionals.
</P>
<P>
The deputies ar full of ideas on issues of national importance,
and they are not shy about voicing their opinions on issues
concerning reunification of the motherland, institutional
restructuring and the impact of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Lifestyle Changing in Inland Shaanxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Early in the morning, Wang Gang, a
farmer in suburban Yan'an City, leaves his stone cave dwelling in
a Western-style suit, gets on his motorcycle, and heads for the
city to look for business.
</P>
<P>
Wang, an individual transportation businessman of Yaodian
Township, is representative of the present-day lifestyle in inland
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Located on the loess plateau, this northwest China province
long was a symbol of poverty and backwardness despite its rich
resources. The reform and opening-up policy brought a chance for
people in Shaanxi to tap their huge resources of coal, oil and
natural gas. Their lives have greatly changed as a result.
</P>
<P>
With fatter wallets, more urban people can afford to eat in
restaurants, which satisfies their taste as well as helping them
better cope with the fast pace of life. For farmers, to have
enough food is no longer a goal. Instead, they give more thought
to nutrition and health.
</P>
<P>
While urbanites are increasingly choosy about their clothes,
preferring fashion and brand names, farmers have also begun paying
attention to the style and quality of their clothing.
</P>
<P>
While in the past many rural people stayed in their mountain
villages their whole lives, many of them have begun to travel by
train and even by plane.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by the end of last year, there were 35
telephone subscribers for every 100 urban families. Rural families
are also becoming connected by telephone.
</P>
<P>
About 70 urban residents have moved into apartment flats
equipped with kitchens and toilets. In rural areas, per capita
housing area has reached 18.6 square meters.

<HEADLINE> Tazara Rakes in $20M in First Half of 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Zambia Railway
(Tazara) Authority has recorded a passenger and freight revenue
of about 30 billion Zambian Kwacha (about 20 million U.S.
Dollars) over the first half of the financial year 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia paper Wednesday quoted a joint statement
released here Tuesday by Anoshi Chipawa, Communication and
Transport Minister, and his Tanzanian counterpart William Kusila
as saying that the authority's council of ministers appreciated
measures taken by the Tazara board and management which have
yielded many positive results.
</P>
<P>
These include an operating surplus of 2.7 billion Kwacha
(about 1.8 million Dollars) for the first half of the financial
year.
</P>
<P>
Freight trains' transit time between Kapiri Mposhi, 180
kilometers north of Lusaka, and Dar-es-Salaam, capital of
Tanzania, has been reduced from 15 days several years ago to three
days at present coupled with improved availability of wagons and
locomotives.
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers also noted an improvement in
passenger services, a timely procurement of fuel and lubricants
for operations and stabilization of emolument dispensation.
</P>
<P>
They attributed these improvements to the revamped Tazara
management which has halted the further deterioration of the
railway's performance in the past years.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued after a one-day meeting here, the two
ministers urged the management to "intensify efforts in the areas
of marketing, organizational, operational and financial
restructuring."
</P>
<P>
They also called on the business community to maximize the use
of the Tazara route which is said to have become efficient and
cost-effective for traffic from Zambia and other neighboring
countries.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 computers in China
are now plugged into the Internet and the country's real Internet
users now total 620,000.
</P>
<P>
According to a report compiled by the Data Communication
Department under China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
China had less than 20,000 Internet subscribers in 1993, when
it opened its international gateways to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The figure for 2000 is projected at two million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
On the composition of users, the report says more than 60
percent of subscribers are between 20 and 30, similar to the age
range of computer users in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Net-surfers in general sort materials on the information
industry, and those on business and finance, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that, of the more than 100 Internet Service
Providers (ISP), few offer local users China-related information
that can reflect the country's political, economic, cultural and
social changes, or other daily-use information.
</P>
<P>
Personal computer sales in China this year are expected to top
700,000 units. The expanding network and increasing Net-users
provide massive business opportunities for content providers,
especially those who can provide Chinese-based information.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production to Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's unhusked dry rice
output this year is expected to reach 45 million tons, accounting
for 84.3 percent of the targeted 53.25 million tons, a senior
agriculture official said.
</P>
<P>
The area of paddy fields that could be harvested in the 1997/98
planting season covered 6.24 million hectares, accounting for
86.12 percent of the targeted 7.247 million hectares, Antara News
Agency Wednesday quoted Secretary General of the Agriculture
Ministry Syarifuddin Karama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The lower rice output was among others attributable to the fact
that this year's planting season was two months late, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government would make efforts to increase
rice production to 51 million tons by achieving a new
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough includes expansion of paddy fields through an
intensification program in the 1998 planting season which would
affect 4.624 million hectares of paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia lost an estimated 5 million tons of unhusked dry rice
because of the prolonged drought last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On food aid to Indonesia, he said Japan has pledged 500,000
tons of rice while the United States would grant wheat flour, rice
and soybeans worth between 21 million and 26 million U.S. dollars.

HAIKOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese college graduates will
encounter a more difficult job market this year, while expanding
employment channels and changing employment concepts are
imperative, school officials report.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting on employment of college graduates,
participants said an unprecedented large college class of '98 is
the main cause of this year's severe employment crisis. About 1.01
million undergraduates and 51,000 postgraduates will complete
school this year.
</P>
<P>
Other factors creating a difficult job market for graduates
include the financial problems of some state-owned and township
enterprises, and increasing layoffs and staffing cuts by
government bodies.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of student employment required related
departments to expand channels of employment, and suggested that
college graduates change their concepts and try to find jobs in

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Russian-Latvian Relations Sink Into Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Latvia and
Russia were further strained following the Russian Foreign
Ministry's reaction over the March 3 demonstration in Latvia's
capital of Riga.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Foreign Ministry Tuesday presented an official note
to Russia's Foreign Ministry, saying that it can not accept the
tone of the high-ranking Russian officials talking about the
demonstration, especially that of Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
That "went beyond the diplomatic framework and even ethnic
norms," the note said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 ethnic Russians, mainly pensioners, held a
picket in front of the building of the city legislature in Riga on
March 3 in protest against rising tariffs, when Latvian police
used forces to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused strong repercussions from Russia
particularly when Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts alleged
that Moscow was involved in the action.
</P>
<P>
Russian Premier Chernomyrdin last Friday sharply denounced his
Latvian counterpart's allegation, saying "How is it possible to go
to such lengths as to claim that Russia allegedly put pensioners
on the picket line."
</P>
<P>
"It is inadmissible to trample underfoot human rights in Europe
at the end of the 20th century. There is no justification for
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cautioning Latvia to pay attention to the bilateral relations,
Chernomyrdin said that the Russian-Latvian relations would
degenerate into very dramatic development.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Russian State Duma adopted in principle an
appeal to the Inter-parliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe, and the Inter-parliamentary Union, urging them
"not to neglect the violation of the universally recognized norms
of international law, committed by the Latvian authorities."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Russian presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky sounded an alarm to Riga, saying that Moscow could
take a number of economic and trade sanctions against Latvia in
connection with the developments in Riga.
</P>
<P>
Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts denied any violation of
human rights, saying police acted properly during the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Russia's threat, Riga's Foreign Ministry
said Monday, "Attempts to influence Latvia by economic sanctions
will draw a negative response from the European Union countries
and other partner states."
</P>
<P>
On March 8, the tomb of Soviet soldiers who perished fighting
the Nazis during World War II was vandalized in the central
cemetery of the Latvian city of Liepaja, which added fuel to the
flames.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the vandalizing of the
tomb as a link "in a whole chain of events in Latvia caused by the
logic of nationalism, Russophobia and violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
It noted relations between Russia and Latvia began to
deteriorate after the Riga incident on March 3.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Russia and Latvia have become tense since
Riga declared independence in 1991. Latvia's treatment of its
large ethnic Russian minority has put a strain on its ties with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs said Tuesday
he is ready and willing to visit Moscow in the nearest future to
meet Primakov and other Russian officials to discuss the bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Stone Processing Industry of China Advances Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's stone processing industry
has witnessed rapid development since the introduction of reform
and opening policies in the late 1970s, according to International
Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of 1996 show that the output of
manufactured stone products (slabs) and related raw materials
reached 110 million sq.m. and 4.8 million cu.m. respectively, with
the total value of said products surpassing 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.6 million people work the industry, with the work force
growing by an average 30 percent annually. The sector is currently
one of the most rapidly growing areas in the construction materials
industry.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports of stone materials have also grown
steadily. For example, imports in 1997 were valued at 150 million
yuan, with exports hitting 700 million yuan. Exports of processed
stone products surpassed raw materials for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 Sino-foreign joint ventures are currently operating in
the stone processing sector, with several hundred Chinese
enterprises manufacturing over 1,000 sets of stone processing
equipment annually. The processing capacity of related equipment
stands at 25 million square meters.

Consul General in New York Qiu Shengyun announced that China has
also offered the university five Chinese Culture Research
Fellowships.
</P>
<P>
The books cover Chinese classical literature and modern
political, economic, law, medical and cultural aspects. The
fellowships are the first of its kind that China offered to the
university.
</P>
<P>
The presentation is a follow-up to Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's state visit to the United States last year when he and his
U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton signed a joint statement which says
the two countries will expand educational and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Praising Harvard for its contribution to the enhancement of
mutual understanding between the two peoples, Qiu Shengyun said he
hoped that Sino-American educational cooperation will continue to
be promoted.

<HEADLINE> Better Flood Prevention Urged for Dongting Lake Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some senior advisors to the
Chinese government have called for an early improvement of flood
prevention facilities in areas around the country's second largest
fresh water lake, the Dongting, in the central province of Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven members of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, have raised a joint proposal to the
ongoing CPPCC session, urging immediate government support for a
safety-enhancing project in the lake's vast flood-water-storage
areas.
</P>
<P>
"We suggest the central government approve as soon as possible
a plan of the Hunan provincial government to improve safety
facilities in the flood-water-storage areas of the Dongting Lake,
and start this year to provide major support for the plan," says
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
An increased financial input by relevant departments of the
state is the key to ensuring the life and property safety of the
more than 1.5 million people living in the flood-water-storage
areas, the proposal notes.
</P>
<P>
"With the existing safety facilities, if the lake is hit by a
major flood similar to those in 1935 or in 1954, tens of thousands
of people could be killed, hundreds of thousands of people
infected with epidemics and properties worth tens of billions of
yuan lost," it estimates.
</P>
<P>
In response to this proposal, the Proposals Examination
Committee of the current CPPCC session organized a special forum
here today, which was attended by representatives of the 27
advisors, officials from the State Development Planning Commission
and the Ministry of Water Resources, and relevant officials and
experts from Hunan.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, the State Development Planning Commission
promised that it would give priority to the Dongting Lake flood
prevention project in allocating this year's capital construction
funds.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources and the Hunan provincial
government also said that they would soon increase investment in
developing water conservancy facilities in the lake's
flood-water-storage areas.
</P>
<P>
"We're quite satisfied with the government's answer to our
proposal," said Liu Zheng, one of the 27 advisors, who is a former
governor of Hunan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Suspends Sugar War With Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African and Swazi
sugar industries have reached an agreement over ending a sugar
war which has lasted more than three years, the South African
Sugar Association (SASA) disclosed.
</P>
<P>
SASA Chairman Don MacLeod had signed the accord with his Swazi
counterpart Peter Huges Tuesday, SASA sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Details of the accord are not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
However, MacLeod said last September after penultimate
negotiations between the two industries that the new pact would
be significantly different from the one that fell away when Swazi
export sugar began to leak into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's illegal export of sugar to South Africa undermined
the local market, which culminated in SASA barring the Swazi
sugar industry from exporting facilities at the Durban port.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement cleared the way for the restoration of
good relations between the two countries and paved the way for
further South African investment in the Swazi sugar industry,
SASA officials said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Destroy Sanctuary in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Fires that started in January in
a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand's northern Uthai Thani Province
have destroyed more than 560 hectares of forests, a Forest
Department official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But fire-fighters have been able to keep under control most of
the fires in the Huay Kha Khaeny wildlife sanctuary, the official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to a Forest Department report released Tuesday, there
were four other spots under fire, including Khao Khiew which is
located north of the sanctuary linking to Mae Wong national park.
</P>
<P>
The department admitted a lack of personnel in putting out the
fires. At present, 13 fire squads with a total of 195 persons are
stationed all over the sanctuary. But the department is confident
that the situation would be put under control as the army is
lending a hand.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires are common in the sanctuary as they happen every
year. A study by the Forest Department shows that all the fires
resulted from human activities including hunting, food gathering
and clearing for farm land. And this time is no exception.
</P>
<P>
Forest Department officials said the fires would have an
environmental impact in the long run, including soil erosion and
degradation of forest conditions.
</P>
<P>
The worst forest fire in the history of Huay Kha Khaeny was in
1994 when 10,923 hectares of forests were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Education on Patriotism be Strengthened Among HK Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Wu Suk-ching, member of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, today called for bigger efforts to be made to
educate Hong Kong youth in patriotism as they need to learn much
about their motherland's history and culture.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at a forum of the First Session of the Ninth
National Committee of the CPPCC this morning, she suggests that
museums, memorial halls and other cultural facilities in the
interior should open wider to Hong Kong children and youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Primary and secondary schools in the interior areas should
forge still closer ties with their counterparts in Hong Kong and
organize various kinds of activities to increase exchanges among
the youths.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cultural and publishing agencies in both the
interior areas and Hong Kong should provide more publication works
featuring splendid culture of the Chinese nation for Hong Kong
students.
</P>
<P>
As a renowned entrepreneur and social activist in Hong Kong, Wu
concerns herself with problems prevalent among the Hong Kong youth
and funded a tour for more than 1,000 Hong Kong youngsters to
travel to the interior areas, where they learned a lot about the
history and culture of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Australia Claims Breakthrough in Plant Gene Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers have
pinpointed the gene for cellulose production in plants, claiming a
breakthrough that could revolutionize agricultural industries,
according to the Australian National University (ANU) newspaper
ANU Reporter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Williamson, who is head of the research team with
the university's Cooperative Research Center for Plant Science,
said "finding the gene answers a central question in plant cell
biology."
</P>
<P>
Cellulose is the major component of plants, giving them their
strength and shape.
</P>
<P>
The finding may also be significant for industry because
cellulose is the main component in natural fibers, the newspaper
said, citing as an example that cotton is 90 percent cellulose.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the cellulose gene has been identified, trees could
be made to produce stronger wood or better paper and farmers could
grow more productive corps," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is the result of 20 years' research, following
some initial work by researchers at the University of California
in the United States, who first identified a possible candidate as
the RSW1 gene in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, it was Dr. Williamson's lab that positively identified
RSW1 gene as the cellulose production gene.
</P>
<P>
They selected a mutant plant in which cellulose production
halved above 30 degree centigrade and showed it had a defect in
the RSW1 gene, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the cellulose it produced above those
temperatures was different with an unusual, non-crystalline
structure.
</P>
<P>
The non-crystalline form of cellulose is more dissolvable.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said talks with industry had begun on its
possible applications, including a dietary fiber which is more
digestible and nutritious.

</P>
<P>
It is reported that two-thirds of new business in the cellular
industry was due to prepaid packages. "Prepaid is rapidly coming
more profitable than contract business," he said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Funds ASEAN's Clean Air Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank (ADB) has set aside a 1-million-U.S.-dollar grant to help the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to deal with land
and forest fires, the Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has initiated a clean air project aimed at preventing
the recurrence of haze that affected the Southeast Asian region
late last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia blanketed
Southeast Asia for nearly four months and caused respiratory
ailments in countries in the region and the crash of an Indonesian
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The clean air project will cost 1.2 million dollars, of which 1
million dollars will come from the Japan Special Fund being
managed by the ADB. The balance will be provided by two ASEAN
organs, the ASEAN Secretariat and the ASEAN Specialized
Meteorological Center.
</P>
<P>
The 12-month project will be officially kicked off this month.
Its first phase will focus on elements of an ASEAN Regional Haze
Action Plan which details the collective measures ASEAN countries
have to undertake to address the haze problem.
</P>
<P>
Its second phase, to commence in June this year, is designed to
enhance understanding of the transnational dimension of the haze
and strengthen the capacity of the ASEAN Specialized
Meteorological Center and its national counterparts to deal with
land and forest fires.
</P>
<P>
This phase includes an early warning and monitoring system for
fire outbreaks in the region, prediction of the spread of the haze
based on meteorological conditions and tracking and control of the
haze.
</P>
<P>
The project will likewise involve public information and
effective communications that will make use of the Internet, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition MPs May Be Involved in Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Police probe shows that some
opposition members of parliament might be involved in the ethnic
killings in Kenya's Rift Valley Province where 127 people have
died since January 12, the press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the killed are from Kikuyu, the largest tribe of Kenya
and smaller Kalenjin, which is President Daniel arap Moi's home
tribe. The clashes are believed to be provoked by politics,
cattle thefts and land ownership wrangles.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition members of parliament were interrogated
during the two-week investigations into killings, Police
Commissioner Duncan Wachira was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There were loud and very provocative utterances by political
personalities which are deeply believed to have ignited this
massacre," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 20 suspects have been charged with murder,
while 15 with arson and 125 with carrying offensive weapons, he
added, but failing to reveal if any of them are lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, Moi linked the biggest opposition Democratic
Party (DP) to the killings which he described as a "prelude to a
wider scheme to attain political objectives in favor of certain
quarters."
</P>
<P>
In response, DP leader and parliamentary member Mwai Kibaki, a
Kikuyu, dismissed Moi's allegation and in return charged that Moi
was "looking for a reason to start harassing DP leaders and
sympathizers."
</P>
<P>
The ethnic killings, following the end of general elections
earlier January, further hurt the eastern African country's image
as both an attractive destination for international tourists and
a "stable oasis" in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Globalization Should Not Be Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Globalization should not be
reversed in response to the financial crisis gripping Asia,
economists said at an Asian Development Forum which entered its
third day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the meeting, however, the economists
agreed that the crisis has dramatically brought home the fact that
globally linked, liberalized financial markets can be perilous if
the necessary regulatory and institutional frameworks are not in
place.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a double-edged sword," Peter Sullivan of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) warned. "It rewards good policies but
punishes weak policies and institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rather than retreating from the global economy, Asian nations
should develop better strategies for managing risks inherent in an
inter-linked financial system, said Chalongphon Sussangkarn,
president of the Thailand Development Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Robert Lawrence of Harvard University's Kennedy
School talked about the outbreak of "globophobia" in the West -- a
recently-coined term describing some U.S. fears that despite
record employment level in the United States, the global economy
hurts American companies and workers.
</P>
<P>
He said that he doubted the trend would become dominant in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He assured Asian participants that the United States will
continue to be a major market for Asian goods.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Forum started Monday and will end Friday.
The participants are discussing lessons of the on-going financial
crisis in Asia and the region's future development strategies.

with leading officials from central government departments and
close to 2,000 CPPCC National Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Addressing sessions of the CPPCC national committees to raise

state affairs. The current session has received more than 450
written speeches, a record number.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Mei Xianming, vice-chairman of China
Association for Promoting Democracy Central Committee, proposed
concrete measures for establishing a well-functioning social
security system. Li Qisheng, vice-chairman of All-China Federation
of Trade Unions (ACFTU), urged great efforts to re-employ more
laid-off workers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Opposition Leader Registers for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Opposition leader
Sam Rainsy has formally registered in the Interior Ministry for
the general elections scheduled for July 26, Commercial News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy told reporters that he is willing to take part in the
elections on condition that the election will be free and fair.
Otherwise he will quit.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to deposed co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, he
said the election should be postponed if a constitutional council
could not be formed in the four months before election, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, he changed his party's name from Khmer Nation Party
(KNP) to Sam Rainsy Party and the party's logo from Khmer Angkor
to a Lighting Candle after a protracted battle with rival faction
leader Kong Mony, who also attempted to register for the election
under the name of the KNP.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Interior Ministry ordered both Sam Rainsy and
Kong Mony to change their party name in order to register by the
March 26 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Rainsy as saying that the renaming of his
party would likely boost his electoral chances because people know
Sam Rainsy much better than the KNP.
</P>
<P>
But he added his party would revert to the KNP after the July
polls.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Unemployment to Drop to 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin has predicted that unemployment in South Africa will
drop to as low as 12 to 13 percent by the year 2010, the daily
paper Business Reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current official rate of unemployment of 29 percent could
drop two to three percentage points by the end of the century,
but would fall to between 10 to 15 percent by 2010 with a very
good economic performance, Erwin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can stop unemployment getting worse and we can lower it...
We can bring it down to manageable levels and get it there
relatively quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected jobs to be created in new areas of
industrial activity such as downstream petrochemicals, steels,
the agro-industry, tourism and small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is battling to create jobs in an environment of
falling trade tariffs and economic growth unlikely to top about
two percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Some traditional industries, like gold mining, are laying off
thousands of workers, with between 50,000 and 100,000 job cuts
expected this year.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela warned recently of job
cuts in the public sector, while business has also argued that
new labor legislation has not encouraged job creation.
</P>
<P>
However, Erwin was confident the manufacturing sector would
meet the targets of the government's growth, employment and
redistribution macro-economic plan.
</P>
<P>
Zav Rustomjee, director-general of trade and industry, said
the manufacturing sector would create between 70,000 and 100,000
jobs a year by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Legislation on River Sources Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from northwest
China's Qinghai Province called for the enactment of a law on
environmental protection at the sources of the country's two
longest rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The law should explicitly stipulate on state funding for water
and soil conservation at the Yangtze and Yellow river sources, and
on the obligation of regions along the rivers to protect the
environment, the lawmakers said in a proposal submitted to the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze and Yellow rivers, China's first and second
longest, both have their sources in Qinghai. Due to climatic
changes, excessive logging of trees and lack of funds for
grasslands development, the ecological environment at both river
sources has deteriorated quickly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at present, the Yellow River source region
only has a forest coverage of 7.56 percent, and the Yangtze source
regions even less with just 2.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
The combined area suffering from soil erosion and
desertification along the two rivers' sources has reached 10.75
million hectares and 350,000 hectares respectively, and the
figures continue to rise by 2.2 percent each year, the proposal
says.
</P>
<P>
In the Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where the Yellow
River starts, more than 30 percent of grasslands have been
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tian Chengping, who is also secretary of the Qinghai
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that
due to harsh natural conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
known as "the roof of the world", it's very hard to restore the
ecological balance there once it is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental problems at the Yangtze and Yellow river sources
will have an impact on the life of hundreds of millions of people
in a dozen provinces and regions which the two rivers flow
through," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Qinghai would make intensified efforts to grow
grass and plant trees as a remedy.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts noted that environmental deterioration at
the Yellow River source has contributed to frequent flow
stoppages at its lower sections in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the water of the Yellow River comes from
Qinghai, where the river flows more than 1,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Prudent Efforts Should Be Made in Developing Conglomerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the on-going First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) regard the
strategy of developing large enterprise groups as a major option
for China's large, medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It plays a vital role in shifting national economy from the
planned economy to a market one and from an extensive to intensive
growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guixing, general manager of Northeast China Power Company
Group, noted that in forming and developing large corporations and
conglomerates, big efforts were made and importance paid soly to
formation of big enterprise groups aimed to yield quick returns.
</P>
<P>
And a large number of enterprise groups want to rank themselves
among the world's top 500 firms by the turn of the century and go
all out for expansion and merger of other enterprises, he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he underlined that the sales volume and assets of
such enterprise do increase in the short run but, since "haste
makes waste", this practice would fail in the long run. Any
breakthrough cannot be achieved without scientific and technical
improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pang Xijun, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Metallurgical
Group, said many enterprises held that an important way to
developing scale economy is to effect a proper scale.
Under no account, he said, does development on a large scale means
scale economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Pang advocated for seeking appropriate and effective
scale in the course of setting up and expanding enterprises
groups.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, reminded the participants of the
Financial Crisis in the southeast Asian nations, by saying that
China should draw both experience and lessons from the sole
development of conglomerates in the Republic of Korea. But he
noted that this will not affect China's strategy to develop
enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
At present, he noted, the capital assets of an enterprise in
China average only 10 million yuan (2.17 million Us dollars), a
scale that cannot be compared to that of its counterparts in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
So enterprises in some key sectors of the national economy
should form enterprise groups so as to tally with the needs of
China's economic growth, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Scientists on Way to Find Cure for Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand researchers said
they are on the way to find a cure for asthma, local newspaper The
Evening Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Research led by Graham Le Gros, director of the Malaghan
Institute of Medical Research in Wellington, shows that the
anti-tuberculosis vaccine suppresses asthma symptoms and, if given
early enough, stops asthma developing altogether.
</P>
<P>
Professor Le Gros studied mice which were given a mild form of
asthma and found they responded best when the TB vaccine was
administered directly into their airways.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery has huge potential for work on humans.
</P>
<P>
The research had been sent to international scientists for
verification and last month was published in the Boston-based
Journal of Experimental Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Professor Le Gros will present his research to international
asthma specialists at a conference to be held in Florida, the
United States, next week.
</P>
<P>
He described the research as the biggest finding of his career.
At present, asthma affects half a million New Zealanders and
hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A scientific research institute
merged with a large state-run firm in east China's Shanghai

</P>

It is the first case of its kind in China, which indicates that

The Shanghai 711 Research Institute studies ship propulsion and

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Xinzhong Power Plant, with total assets of 140 million
yuan, produced the first domestically-made diesel engine. Failing
to follow market demand and lacking advanced technology, the plant
is facing bankruptcy after several years of losing money.
</P>
<P>
Though in a difficult position, the plant has advantages such

<HEADLINE> Asia's Crisis Poses Special Risks for Poorest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia's financial crisis could
significantly set back social progress in the region but it also
opens potential to modernize social structures, says a senior
World Bank poverty specialist.
</P>
<P>
In a paper prepared for the week-long Asian Development Forum,
which entered its third day here Wednesday, Michael Walton of the
World Bank says that even if economic declines are moderate,
"poverty could increase by a few percentage points in affected
countries: a significant setback."
</P>
<P>
During the last decades of economic success, he says, East Asia
achieved "growth with equality." But he warns that if distribution
patterns worsen, poverty increases will be magnified.
</P>
<P>
The poor and workers in the informal sector will be the most
affected by job losses, rising prices and cuts in public services,
Walton says.
</P>
<P>
To help mitigate these hardships, Walton calls for continued
support for small-farm production, inclusive education policy and
greater transparency to reduce "unfair wealth acquisition."
</P>
<P>
He says protecting the poor is not only a moral imperative but
also a political and economic necessity.
</P>
<P>
"There are risks that the financial crisis will lead to neglect
of social issues and that this could exacerbate social conflict,
that would in turn make restoration of confidence tougher," he
points out.
</P>
<P>
There is potential, however, for governments to both protect
the vulnerable and move forward on the modernization of social
structures that will be central to the future advance of
competitive and caring societies in East Asia, he says.
</P>
<P>
The on-going forum, which has been jointly sponsored by the
World Bank's Economic Development Institute and the Asian
Development Bank, has brought together 350 economists, government
officials and journalists to discuss lessons of the Asian
financial crisis and the region's development strategies.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Pledges to Overcome Economic Crisis Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called here Wednesday all walks of life in the country to overcome
the current economic crisis through their hard work and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto made the call in his address at the swearing-in
ceremony of the president-elect before the people's Consultative
Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 76, was re-elected Tuesday by the MPR, the country's
highest legislative body, to his seventh term of office.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are going through extremely difficult test and
trials. We are being subjected to very hard economic and financial
turmoils," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, Indonesia has been facing with spiraling
inflation, growing unemployment and other serious economic and
financial problems caused by the rapid decline of the rupiah
currency.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation, we must tighten our belts. As an individual, as a
group, some of us may lead an affluent life. But, as a nation, we
can no longer afford to lead an extravagant life," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the crisis, He said, Indonesia will never enjoy
again an economic growth such as it has experienced for more than
the past a quarter of a century. In the past 20 years, Indonesia's
economic growth was averaging seven percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said during the present hardship, the Indonesia people
need precisely a stronger solidarity, a sense of sharing the same
fate and destiny.
</P>
<P>
The president was convinced that Indonesia will be able to
overcome safely these difficult times. Subsequently, it shall
continue with development towards the creation of an advanced and
thriving, a just and prosperous society, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On international situation, Soeharto said, the world is filling
with changes and these changes seem to take place faster and
faster over time.
</P>
<P>
The essence of development is a change towards progress, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said new powers are emerging in the international scene,
especially in the economic area. Nations are all developing
themselves with a view to attaining progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In the face of such trends, Soeharto said, the basic stance of
Indonesia's free and independent foreign policy is encouraging
changes that lead to peace, prosperity and progress of all nations
on the one hand, and preventing events that may lead to an unjust
and insecure world on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto told the 1,000-seat MPR members who have been
attending the 11-day General Session since March 1, he will fully
fulfill everything which was decided by the Assembly, especially
in the implementation of the State Policy Guideline for next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will elect a vice president Wednesday evening before
closing its five-yearly session.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to cut its land, water and sea surface rents for
businesses funded by foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The decision, part of a policy to attract foreign investment,

The highest group is projects in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City,
where the minimum rate of one U.S. dollar per square meter a year
is down 41 percent, and the maximum rate of 12 U.S. dollars is down
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors in Vung Tau and Bien Hoa in the south and Hai
Phong in the north will also enjoy lower land rents.
</P>
<P>
Reductions from 84 to 99 percent will be applicable to projects
in delta areas. In inland areas, the rents will be cut between 88
to 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rates will be valid for at least five years.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Suspended From Dealing in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has
banned French bank Credit Lyonnais from dealing in the foreign
exchange market in the country for one month due to operational
irregularities, an official report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a decision on the suspension made on Monday, the central
bank claimed that Credit Lyonnais was found to have deviated from
the trading band for official foreign exchange rates as set by the
SBV.
</P>
<P>
Credit Lyonnais was also ordered to pay back 29.84 billion
Vietnamese dong (about 2.53 million U.S. dollars) that it had
illegally collected from customers through the trading.
</P>
<P>
Credit Lyonnais was found by SBV inspectors to have set a
higher than permitted profit margin on foreign currency
transactions by widening the trading band for buying and selling
of transferred foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Credit Lyonnais is the first foreign bank to be found guilty of
violating Vietnam's state-set exchange rate bands since October 13
last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 domestic banks and branches of foreign banks have
so far been licensed to deal in foreign currencies in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Current Account Surplus in Japan Rises Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
January jumped 212.8 percent to 476.2 billion yen (3.7 billion
U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise over the previous January marks the tenth
straight monthly year on year increase.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise to robust exports supported by
favorable economies in the United States and Europe and to weak
imports due to Japan's stagnant domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of goods and services as
well as investment income and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
Japan posted a surplus of 26.7 billion yen (206 million
dollars) in goods and services trading in January, against a
deficit of 294.1 billion yen (2.3 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade more than doubled to 538.8
billion yen (4.2 billion dollars), up for the 10th consecutive
month, following a 35.7 percent rise the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 7.6 percent to 3.74 trillion yen (28.9 billion
dollars), while imports declined 1.4 percent to 3.2 trillion yen
(24.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In services trade, Japan posted a deficit of 512.2 billion yen
(3.9 billion dollars), less than the deficit of 521.8 billion yen
(four billion dollars) a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Charest to Lead Quebec Liberals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Jean Charest, leader of Canada's
Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, indicated Tuesday that he
could leave the federal politics to fight separatists in his home
province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the 39-year-old politician had been saying that he
was staying in Ottawa as the federal PC leader despite mounting
pressure from across Canada for him to head the pro-unity Liberal
Party of Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Liberal Party leader Daniel Johnson announced on March 2
that he would step down to give his party a better chance of
winning the next provincial election.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that Quebec Liberals would beat the
ruling Parti Quebecois in the next election with Charest as the
leader.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, there has been a draft-Charest movement, in
which politicians and ordinary Canadians both in and outside
Quebec joined in voicing their strong wish that Charest would move
from Ottawa to Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
He was also promoted by some people as savior of Canada,
assuming that he would ultimately prevent another Quebec
referendum by defeating the separatist Parti Quebecois.
</P>
<P>
"After having consulted my wife and children, we have decided
to listen and to consult on the choice before us," Charest told a
news conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The choice is a very difficult one because I have a deep
attachment to my party and to those people who have shown trust in
me and supported me with a great deal of conviction."
</P>
<P>
Charest's remarks was interpreted as he was considering running
for the Liberal leadership in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The currency markets also responded, with the Canadian dollar
gaining more than a quarter of a cent immediately after the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Charest asked his Canadian countrymen to take a step back
and wonder why so many are placing the future of the country into
the hands of one person.
</P>
<P>
"I also happen to believe that we would all be well-served to
take a step back beyond what my candidacy would be about and ask
ourselves: Why is this happening this way? What is it that has
caused this vacuum?"
</P>
<P>
Charest became famous in the unity debate during the 1995
referendum in Quebec. He was widely believed as a great help for
the federal forces, which won a slim majority against Quebec
separatists.
</P>
<P>
He was also instrumental in rebuilding the PC Party, which was
reduced from a ruling party to only two seats in the House of
Commons in the 1993 general election.
</P>
<P>
With Charest at the helm, the party won 20 seats in the 1997
election and regained official party status in Canada's
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accepts Apology for Harassment Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has accepted an apology from the journalist who wrote the article
that sparked Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against the
president, a White House spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Former American Spectator reporter David Brock Monday
apologized to Clinton in an open letter in the April edition of
Esquire magazine, saying he questioned the credibility of the
sources used in his article published in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The president read the article and he appreciates and accepts
Mr. Brock's apology," White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Brick wrote: "I wasn't hot for this story in the interest of
good government or serious journalism. I wanted to pop you
(Clinton) right between the eyes."
</P>
<P>
Brock's 1993 article was based largely on interviews with state
troopers and has become known as "Troopergate." It refers to a
woman known only as "Paula" with whom Clinton allegedly had an
untoward meeting in a hotel room. Paula Jones later came forward
and identified herself publicly and filed a sexual harassment suit
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, it was Monica Lewinsky's testimony in the Jones'
case that prompted Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr to open an
investigation into whether Clinton had an affair with the former
White House intern and urged her to lie about it in a sworn
deposition.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of apology, Brock said he was tipped off to the
story by a major contributor to GOPAC, a conservative political
action committee. The donor put Brock in touch with a longtime
Clinton critic in Arkansas who steered him to the troopers he
eventually interviewed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened between you and Monica Lewinsky any
more than I know how much of Troopergate or Paula Jones' story is
true," he writes. He later adds, "If sexual witch-hunts become the
way to win in politics, if they become our politics altogether, we
can and will destroy everyone in public life."
</P>
<P>
Brock said today that given the benefit of hindsight, "I don't
know that 'Troopergate,' even if it's all true, taught us all that
much that's worth knowing about Bill Clinton's character."
</P>
<P>
"... What, I'm saying is that I can't stand by that story
anymore, that I think some of it's true, some of it isn't true,
but that's not good enough. That standard is not good enough,
certainly not," he said in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning
America."

FUZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Quanzhou city in
east China's Fujian Province have successfully operated on a
14-year-old girl who suffered from congenital bone problems and
had had deformed limbs.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Liu Ting, came from Yangzhou city in Jiangsu
Province in east China. When she was born, Liu Ting's head was
larger than normal, but her mental processes were unaffected and
she could move her limbs normally, according to her parents.
</P>
<P>
However, her bones were so brittle that she has had more than
20 breaks in recent years. She was unable to walk, as her limbs
were deformed and could not support her body.
</P>
<P>
For years, she had to lie in bed and was carried around by her
parents. She looked like a frog, her family said.
</P>
<P>
Three doctors at Donghai Hospital in Quanzhou operated on the

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia will be grateful to China
if the latter delays the Renminbi's devaluation for the next 12 to
18 months as this will give regional currencies time to recover,
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times, one of Singapore's major national
newspapers, reported on Wednesday that in a recent interview with
Time magazine, Lee said that if the Renminbi (RMB), China's
currency, stays stable for the next one year to one year and a
half, Asian currencies would have stabilized and any downward
adjustment then by 10-12 percent would not spark off another round
of meltdown.
</P>
<P>
"But if they have to do it now in the present volatile mood,
there will be another round (of devaluation)," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he believed that the Chinese would stand by
their word not to devalue as they had enough resources to see them
through the year.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said Lee's remarks will be carried in the
March 16 issue of Time magazine, which is released in Asia this
week.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Wants More Cuts in Government Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has asked the
Budget Bureau to cut more tied-over projects approved by the
previous government, a newspaper report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The previous government had approved 1,216 projects with an
investment cost of more than 82 billion baht (about 186 million
U.S. dollars) spread across fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
In view of the tied-over budget of only 3.59 billion baht
(about 815 million dollars) set for this fiscal year, the cabinet
had to cut down the projects dramatically, the Bangkok Post
reported, but did not mention what projects would be cut.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has rejected a proposal by the Budget Bureau to
trim only eight projects with tied-over budgets worth about 12.5
billion baht (about 284 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
If all the projects went ahead, the government would have less
than 10 billion baht (about 227 million dollars) to implement
other necessary projects, the paper quoted Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1,216 projects approved by the previous government requires
4.27 billion baht (about 97 million dollars) this fiscal year and
another 78.67 billion baht (about 178 million dollars) during the
1999-2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Budget Bureau was ordered to review these projects as the
current government could not afford the investment, particularly
in projects considered non-productive.
</P>
<P>
However, the review submitted to the government saw only eight
projects scrapped. The cabinet, therefore, instructed the Budget
Bureau on Tuesday to resubmit a new proposal within two week. It
also ordered all ministers to examine their ministries projects to
ensure only essential projects be implemented, despite approval of
tied-over budgets by the previous government.

<HEADLINE> Rural Consumers of China Complain Fraud Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows that 66 percent of
the rural consumers in China complained their rights and interests
were infringed upon last year.
</P>
<P>
The national survey, made by the China Consumers' Association,
said that immediate and great efforts are needed to improve the
rural consumption environment, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
From early January to mid-February, the association surveyed
5,500 rural consumers across the country.
</P>
<P>
The investigation disclosed that small private businesses and
shops are the most likely places where rural consumers might
encounter unhappy shopping experiences because of counterfeit or
substandard commodities.
</P>
<P>
More than 71 percent of the rural residents involved said they
suffered losses from buying daily commodities with quality
problems, and 35 percent of those surveyed reported loses while
buying substandard farming materials.
</P>
<P>
About 55 percent of the rural consumers said they know of the
four-year-old law on consumer protection, but many of them do not
know where to turn for a solution to a complaint. Many also show
no confidence in successfully settling a complaint.
</P>
<P>
This poor consumer confidence can be traced to the high
percentage of rural consumers who complain that many shop managers
know the laws but do not abide by them, and from complaints that
businesspeople have been punished too lightly by law enforcement
departments when they are found to be at fault, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Busts Biggest Local Drug Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Central Narcotics
Bureau (CNB) has busted the biggest local drug gang, seizing more
than 24 kilograms of heroin worth about 762,200 U.S. dollars and
arresting 20 suspects, the Straits Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the syndicate, made up mainly of Malays, is
believed to be operating the largest drug network in the country
and the 24 kilograms of heroin was the largest haul of the drug
meant for local addicts.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the gang imported about 40 kilograms of
heroin from Malaysia each month, which it then sold to Malay
addicts living in the eastern part of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The CNB was quoted as saying the key members of the gang were
classified as dangerous as usually they were armed with knives and
daggers which they would use in skirmishes with rival gangs or if
confronted by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior CNB officer, the report said the raid,
code-named Operation Phantom, was launched on Monday after the CNB
uncovered the syndicate following the arrest of several Malay
traffickers recently.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the CNB learnt that the syndicate had
received a new shipment of heroin and some of it was being kept in
a hotel room in the eastern part of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very ambitious gang. They had planned to extend
their drug network and possibly lure more Malays into drugs," the
CNB officer said.

<HEADLINE> Southernmost Chinese Province Takes To Oil, Gas Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, the southernmost province
in China, plans to make the local oil and gas processing sector
its pillar industry, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province, which administers the South China Sea, has the
largest sea area in the country.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea has a potential gas reserve of 5.8 trillion
cubic meters and a potential oil reserve of 29.1 billion tons. Gas
and oil reserves have been found in 11 sea basins so far.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts have proposed that the digging and
processing of gas and oil could lead to other related sectors such
as petrochemicals, energy, fertilizer and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, four gas- or oil-based industrial projects -- a
power plant, a fertilizer factory, a refinery and a nylon media
manufacturer -- have been set up or are under construction in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1996, Hainan has provided Hong Kong with
gas through a 770-kilometer pipeline, with a yearly supply of 2.9
billion cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Motion to Protect Old Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some deputies to the Chinese
legislature, in session here since last Thursday, urged Beijing
municipal government to make sure not to encroach upon the already
cramped space in downtown areas of the Chinese capital or cause
further damages to a limited number of existing old buildings when
it approves new constructions such as office buildings and
flyovers.
</P>
<P>
In a motion submitted yesterday to the on-going session of the
National People's Congress, lawmakers from Beijing and Taiwan say
that, despite the city government's efforts to protect cultural
sites and relics, the modernization drive in the capital has left
some "permanent regrets" in its wake.
</P>
<P>
Height limits for new buildings to be erected in downtown
Beijing set in the early 1980s have long been breached; towering
scaffolds outside the Forbidden City dwarf the palatial complex;
and hutongs, or alleys, and courtyard houses -- both distinct
features of old Beijing -- are fast disappearing, they complain.
</P>
<P>
Even some architectures of historical significance were leveled
down to make way for new buildings, according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
With a history of more than 3,000 years, Beijing was the
imperial capital of four dynasties after the 12th century. Its
prosperity and splendor were first described and made known to
Westerners by Italian explorer Marco Polo, the motion says.
</P>
<P>
When the Communist armies closed in on the city in the war of
liberation almost a half century ago, Mao Zedong, worried that
cultural sites and old buildings might be bombed out of existence
if fighting was to start, had asked the renowned architect Liang
Sicheng to mark in a map the locations of major old buildings and
gave the order that such buildings be not targets of attacks.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was later peacefully liberated, leaving the
city intact.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the important old buildings did not survive
massive construction launched in the late 1950s. Since the early
1990s, the city has been fast losing its distinctiveness and has
become "a curious mixture of architectures styled after the former
Soviet Union and Western countries, interspersed with some old
buildings with local flavors," according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
"As an ancient cultural city, Beijing belongs to the whole
Chinese nation and the world as well," the motion says."Therefore
greater efforts should be made to protect existing cultural sites
and old buildings".
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to do, say the deputies, is to change
the mentality of some officials and real estate developers who
regard highrises as a symbol of modernization.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that old buildings and most old residential
areas be preserved. Architects and historians should be consulted
should there be a necessity to pull down any one of them, they
say in their motion.

<HEADLINE> Fight Against Corruption a Protected &AMP; Arduous Task, Top Advisors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The remarks were made by Cao Keming, member of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), at a panel discussion of the Ninth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
held here today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there still exist the phenomena of corruption, Cao,
who has contributed tremendously to the settlement of a number of
major corruption cases, said the CPC Central Committee had
referred to crackdown on corruption as a matter of life and death
for the Party and the state.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that China is firm and unshakable in fighting
against corruption," said Cao.
</P>
<P>
At present, 90 percent of the cases related to corrupt were
reported and uncovered by individual residents, he said, adding
that the state will continue protecting them and relying on their
support and participation.
</P>
<P>
The current government institutional restructuring will
facilitate the anti-corruption drive because the restructuring can
cut down redundant and overlapping staffs and raise their
efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NPC deputies from Beijing rendered their support to
the decision to prosecute the Chen Xitong case that was announced
in the report of Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate to the Third Plenum of the ongoing NPC
session yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiuyun, a judge of the Haidian District People's Court in
Beijing's western outskirts, said that "Chen's case sounded the
alarm for us," in the hope that it would be dealt with as earlier
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yifeng, a NPC deputy from Beijing, described the case of
Chen Xitong as a major one to the concern of the people across
China.
</P>
<P>
In the nationwide effort to fight against corruption, it is
imperative to introduce a supervision mechanism that includes
supervision by people's deputies, Luo said. He also called for
promulgating a supervisory law at an early possible day.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Calls For Price Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, march 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai consumers, who have been
under the increasing pressure of inflation, might now heave a sigh
of relief as Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi has asked
manufacturers of more than 100 products to lower prices, the
Bangkok Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is also commerce minister, said manufacturers
have been asked to lower prices because the baht has appreciated
and stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers had earlier raised the prices, citing higher
costs incurred by the devaluation of the baht from 25 to more than
50 to the U.S. dollar. However, the Thai currency has been stable
at around 45 baht against the dollar in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry said steel, chemical fertilizer,
lubricating oil, plastic pellet are among the products whose
prices are expected to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
The prices of powdered milk, pasteurized milk and seasoning
sauce will also come down, according to the ministry.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government on
Tuesday reiterated its desire to work within the framework of the
Serbian Constitution and international laws to solve issues
related to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the situation in Kosovo, a province of the Yugoslav
republic, the Serbian government said that escalating terrorist
activities in the province have led to heavy casualties among
innocent Serbs, ethnic Albanians and the police force in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
It said actions taken recently by the Interior Ministry were
aimed at protecting the lives and properties of local residents
and only directed at ethnic Albanian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The government condemned ethnic Albanian terrorists in Kosovo
but noted that innocent ethnic Albanians must be distinguished
from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that all citizens within the Republic of Serbia
will continue to be treated equally and protected by law
regardless of their nationality and religion.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government has emphasized that people of all
nationalities in Kosovo can expect a bright future only when they
can live together peacefully and equally in the spirit of mutual
tolerance.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Warns Against Electronic Media's Bad Effects on Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator warned here
today that the country's fast-developing electronic media are
casting some negative effects on the children's healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Di, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's top legislature, in session here since last
Thursday, said that electronic media, including radio, television,
audio and video facilities, computer network and software games,
have increasingly affected negatively the life of many Chinese
families nowadays.
</P>
<P>
"While helping widen the children's horizon and increase their
knowledge, the electronic media have also exerted a negative
impact on the children's physical and psychological health," noted
Zhao, who is also vice-chairwoman of the All-China Women's
Federation.
</P>
<P>
There are now too many TV programs about romance and violence,
and some love stories even show encouragement for extramarital
affairs, she complained.
</P>
<P>
"This is not good to children's physical and mental health and
social morals," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, some TV advertisements and programs are
highly misleading children, with TV shown feats of "flying men", which
led to occurrence of a few kids' jumping from the window of
highrises.
</P>
<P>
She suggested the Ministry of Education add media selection
courses to the national program for basic education, to
mainly teach the children on selection of appropriate TV programs.
</P>
<P>
"Relevant departments should specify on the time limit on radio
and TV programs that are inappropriate for children, and be
resolute in action to ban promoting electronic publications that
are detrimental to their maturing," Zhao urged.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member Calling for New Policies to Promote High-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body suggested today that relevant policies be adopted to promote
the development of a new and high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, a vice-minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission, said at a session of the Ninth Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee today, that China has great potential in high-tech
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country's 53 state-level high-tech industry
development zones, established five to six years ago, produced 320
billion yuan worth of industrial output, with 32 billion yuan in
annual profits and tax payment and 5.5 billion US dollars in
export volume, he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country makes more than
30,000 scientific research findings above the
provincial-ministerial level a year, and 70,000 patents are
registered in the country annually, but they constitute only a
very small proportion of the technologies applied in the high-tech
zones, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu suggested that China adopt new financial, taxation and trade
policies to promote the development of a new and high technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
"In some strategic fields, the state should concentrate
financial, material and human resources and invest heavily to
promote a by-leaps-and-bounds development of a considerable number of
high and new-tech enterprises," he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Women Sue Tyson for Abuse in Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Two women are suing former
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson for verbally and physically
abusing them in a restaurant and claiming for 22.5 million U.S.
dollars, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sherry Cole, 30, and Chevelle Butts, 30, alleged in their
lawsuit that Tyson became abusive during breakfast at a Georgetown
bistro after a night out March 1.
</P>
<P>
They said that Tyson verbally and physically abused them after
one spurned his sexual advances at a Washington restaurant.
</P>
<P>
They said Tyson became enraged after his sexual advances were
spurned. They also claimed that Tyson, who served three years in
prison for rape, also overturned a table during the 5:30 a.m.
breakfast and cursed at Butts, who threw coffee on him.
</P>
<P>
The women are seeking damages for assault, battery, defamation
and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said he had not seen the lawsuit, filed
here Monday, but called it absurd.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is not the first against Tyson. In 1988, Sandra
Miller of New York filed a lawsuit claiming Tyson grabbed and
propositioned her at a nightclub. A jury awarded her 100 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
And in 1990, Phyllis Polaner, former aide to Tyson's ex-wife
Robin Givens, filed a lawsuit claiming Tyson sexually assaulted
and harassed her. That suit is pending.

Frankfurt, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, concluded
his two-day visit to Germany on Tuesday, fulfilling his aim to
tighten economic links with Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Tung has met many German political and business leaders during
his visit. He asked Germany to maintain a strong business presence
in Hong Kong, which was returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He briefed German leaders on Hong Kong's stable development and
the smooth operation of the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive, leaving for Paris on Wednesday for a
three-day visit, also explained how Hong Kong's well regulated
financial markets and open economy have helped it weather the
sweeping Asian financial storm.
</P>
<P>
German leaders also showed great interest in the future
prospects of both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Tung on Tuesday afternoon, Willem Duisenberg, president
of the European Monetary Institute, briefed him on the development
of the planned single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg expressed confidence that the euro will be launched
punctually on January 1, 1999. The single currency will bring
great benefits to EU trade, EU internal price stability as well
as the international financial system, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, Tung paid a visit to the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange and held talks with its Chief Executive Officer Werner
Siefert.
</P>
<P>
Siefert said the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, as an important
capital market, is expected to be strengthened after the launch of
the euro, adding that the stock exchange is looking for a future
partner in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Shipyard Develops Air-Cushioned Oil-Drilling Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A self-lifting, air-cushioned,
combination drilling platform has been built by the innovative
work shop of Dalian Shipyard in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The platform was built for Dagang Oil Field Co. Ltd. of Tianjin
and will soon be shipped to designated sea waters for drilling
operations, said an engineer with the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
According to the engineer, the platform -- which is 66 meters
long, 36 meters wide and 4 meters high -- can be used for
oil-drilling operations in offshore areas with depths ranging from
the surface to 2.5 meters below the water surface of western Bohai
Bay during ice-free periods.
</P>
<P>
The platform, development of which is listed as one of the
state's major technological equipment projects, has filled a gap
for China and is believed to lead the world for its advanced
technical features.

<HEADLINE> hke031107 -Australian Firm Launches Miniaturization Tech Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An Australian company has
developed technology which it said could revolutionize database
systems and one day make telephone books obsolete, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Garry Mele, business development director of ZENtronix Pty Ltd,
a company in east Australia's coastal city of Gold Coast, said his
company had created a database miniaturization and encoding system
which would enable information to be packed onto electronic
platforms as small as credit cards.
</P>
<P>
Unlike compression, the miniaturization technology allows data
to be accessed, updated and searched on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Mele said the technology had the capability to replace all
printed telephone directories, including those in payphone booths.
</P>
<P>
He said miniaturized data could be stored and accessed in any
electronic platform, including the standard small credit
card-sized Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association
(PCMCIA) cards that use solid state "flash" memory.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the CD-ROM system the PCMCIA card is cost-effective,
portable, updateable, has a life span of 10 years and is
environmentally friendly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mele said the new technology would assist such businesses as
banks, telecommunication companies and government departments in
reducing the costs of maintaining their database systems.
</P>
<P>
He said he developed the miniaturization technology almost 10
years ago but was unable to launch it onto the world market
because compatible technology had not been developed until now.
</P>
<P>
ZENtronix said it was currently negotiating with a leading
telecommunications company, which is considering using the
technology to replace its current data processes.
</P>
<P>
Mele launched the new system Wednesday at the Australian Stock
Exchange's Enterprise Market at the Melbourne Convention Center,
AAP said.

MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in the Philippines
plunged by 52 percent to just 3,659 units in February as compared
with a year earlier, the latest data from the Chamber of
Automotive Manufacturers showed on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Funds Boost Power Industry in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The inflow of overseas funds has
vigorously boosted the development of power industry in east
China's Shandong Province and helped make it the largest
independent power grid in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Zhenya, general manager of the Shandong
Provincial Power Group Company, Shandong had utilized a total of
1.5 billion US dollars of overseas funds by the end of last year
to upgrade its power facilities and modernize the management.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has a total installed capacity of 16.5
million kilowatts and yields 84 billion kwh of electricity
annually, both rank second among other provinces and
municipalities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the province has made efforts to pool
overseas funds in different channels to fuel the expansion of
power industry, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank, for instance, has provided a loan of 310 million US
dollars to the third-phase expansion of the Zouxian power plant,
which involves the installation of two 600,000-kilowatt generating
units.
</P>
<P>
The province also made good use of overseas capital market. The
Shandong Huaneng Electricity Co. Ltd was listed in 1994 in New
York Stock Exchange, collecting 330 million US dollars. And the
Shandong International Power Supply Development Co. Ltd is
expected to be listed soon in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The province's fine investment environment attracted overseas
direct investment to form joint venture there. The Shandong Rizhao
Electricity Co. Ltd is one such enterprise partnered with Israeli
and German companies. With investment of 600 million US dollars,
it has two 350,000-kilowatt generating units.

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister Leaves for Visit to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
left here for the United States early Wednesday on a visit aimed
at seeking mutual understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told reporters before departure that he believed his trip
would bring some positive results although he has nothing to
bargain with U.S. government and business leaders in their talks.
</P>
<P>
He said one of his missions is to persuade the U.S. public and
business sectors to roll over loans to Thai public and corporate
borrowers so as to allow them to continue their businesses.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything to bargain with in asking them to roll
over loans except to tell the truth that we don't have any money.
Most Thai businessmen have suffered heavy foreign exchange
losses," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say what we expect to get, but I will simply
explain the facts to them in the hope that they will better
understand Thailand," he added.
</P>
<P>
The visit, Chuan said, would promote Thailand's image. He
expressed the confidence that he would be able to convince U.S.
government and business leaders of Thailand's potential to recover
from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's visit came at a time when financial and economic
reforms are deepening in the country. The International Monetary
Fund has voiced satisfaction with Thailand's economic performance
and eased certain conditions for releasing rescue loans to the
country. But the Thai public are unhappy with what they see as
U.S. apathy toward Thai economic hardships.

Turboatom however has not fulfilled the contract due to
pressure from Washington. Kiev finally decided to cancel the
contract on March 6 when U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has
welcomed the declaration made by the international Contact Group
to solve the Kosovo crisis, an Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting in London on Monday, foreign ministers
of the six Contact Group countries called for an arms embargo against
Yugoslavia and threatened to freeze its assets unless Belgrade
halts the violence in Kosovo and starts talks.
</P>
<P>
The declaration by the group -- the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- was very pragmatic,
spokesman Sokol Hjoka said.
</P>
<P>
Its implementation would preserve the stability of the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said his country would firmly fulfil its
obligation formulated in the declaration, and urged all
conflicting parties and countries concerned to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities put the official death toll from last
week's violence at 46 ethnic Albanians and six Serb police, but
the Albanians say at least 80 people were killed in the crackdown
by police.

<HEADLINE> Southeastern European Countries Calls for Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from five
Southeastern European countries on Tuesday called on parties
concerned to initiate a genuine dialogue and refrain from use of
violence to resolve their conflict.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania
and Turkey signed a joint declaration on Kosovo and expressed
their "serious concern with the deteriorating situation in Kosovo
and with the grave consequences of an inter-ethnic conflict and
its possible spill-over in the region."
</P>
<P>
"The ministers reiterate that a first step to reduce tensions
in Kosovo is the initiation of a genuine dialogue between the Serb
authorities and the ethnic Albanians and call on both parties to
take prompt measures to that end," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties should condemn and refrain from use of violence
as a means to resolve their conflict," the declaration added.
</P>
<P>
It said a lasting solution to the Kosovo problem can be based
only on the full protection of the rights of Albanians, Serbs and
all others living in Kosovo and in the meantime, should be
searched in full respect to the existing border.
</P>
<P>
According to the document released by the BTA news agency, the
ministers urged all organizations of the ethnic Albanians to deny
any secessionist policies and to fully respect the territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they called on Belgrade to face the problems with
utmost responsibility and search for mutually acceptable solutions
based on granting a large autonomy to Kosovo within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers declared the readiness of their states to play an
active role in the efforts to find a peaceful and political
solution to all issues related to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are Andrei Plesu (Romania), Blagoj Handziski
(Macedonia), Ismail Cem (Turkey), Nadezhda Mikhailova (Bulgaria)
and Theodoros Pangalos (Greece).
</P>
<P>
The ministers adopted the joint declaration in response to the
growing ethnic tension in Kosovo, a province of the Republic of
Serbia of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in the
province. The Belgrade announced death toll from ethnic conflicts
since February 28 is 46 ethnic Albanians and six Serb policemen.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the declaration on Tuesday, Bulgarian Foreign
Minister Mikhailova described it as "best evidence that the
Balkans are already tangibly turning into a South-Eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of Turkey, Romania, Greece and the charge d'
affairs of the Macedonian Embassy in Sofia also expressed the
support of their countries for the declaration, the BTA
said.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's re-elected President
Soeharto was sworn in here Wednesday before the People's

</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who has been ruling the country since 1967, was

the highest legislative body in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
When accepting the nomination for a new term by the ruling
Golkar Party and other four factions in the MPR on Sunday, the
76-year-old Soeharto said that if it were the wish of the people
that someone of his age leads the country, he would do so with a
"fighting spirit."

The re-election of Soeharto came in the midst of the country's
worst economic crisis since he came to power 32 years ago.

The monetary crisis, which started hitting Southeast Asian
countries including Indonesia in early July last year, has caused
spiraling inflation, growing unemployment and other serious
economic problems in the country.

CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian federal MPs will be given a 130,000 U.S. dollar
bonus to spend in their electorates under the federal government's
660 million U.S. dollar Federation Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The shockwaves from the Asian economic crisis are continuing
to widen with Australian manufacturers now expecting their exports
to plunge to their worst levels and business confidence diving to
a two-year low.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Controversial changes to the state of Victoria's gun laws,
which include provisions to reduce the 28-day waiting period for
those who already own guns and wish to buy more, to allow people
to carry and use guns within town boundaries, are likely to be
passed by the state parliament before May.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard has made a private promise to
consider an aboriginal compromise plan on the government's Wik
native title legislation in a last-ditch attempt to avoid a race
election, which would occur if the legislation was rejected by
parliament this year.

<HEADLINE> USG for Management Says UN is Borrowing More from a </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations cash
was "weak and getting weaker", the Under-Secretary-General for
Management, Joseph E. Connor, told the fifth Committee
(Administrative and Budgetary) on Tuesday as it began its
consideration of the United Nations financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Connor said while the overall amount owed by Member states
was decreasing slightly, the Organization was forced to
cross-borrow against peacekeeping funds to make up for deficits in
the regular budget.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the projected amounts in both the regular
and peacekeeping budgets would be 577 million US dollars, the
smallest amount in four years, he continued. By the same date, the
United Nations would be forced to cross-borrow 25 percent of
peacekeeping cash to cover the deficit in regular budget cash, a
largest percentage in four years. The Organization was, thus,
borrowing more and more from a smaller and smaller source.
</P>
<P>
When the amount of cash on hand was low and the amount of
unpaid assessments was large, said he, the United Nations was
forced to slow its payment for troops and contingent-owned
equipment for peacekeeping operations. The Organizations's debt to
member States had now become resistant to change.

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
announced here Tuesday the approval of a 96 million U.S. dollar
long-term guarantee for the sale of gas compression equipment and
related engineering services to Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline deal will help Turkmenistan transport and sell
natural gas to external markets which will increase the country's
gas export earnings and support the future development of the
economy. Export credit agencies from Israel and the Czech Republic
will also provide financing in addition to the U.S. bank's 96
million dollars. The total cost of the project is some 180 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time Ex-Im Bank has financed an oil
transaction in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan's vast oil and gas
sector represent a huge potential export market for U.S. goods and
services," James A. Harmon, Chairman of the Ex-Im Bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The new deal could sustain 350 jobs in some related states in
this country.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is a governmental agency that supports U.S.
exports by providing financing or credit guarantee.

UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday appointed a group of high-level experts to
examine United Nations efforts to combat illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The 13 experts will undertake a comprehensive review of how the

Nations International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The experts are also charged with formulating recommendations
on how to strengthen future international cooperation against
illicit drugs. In addition, they will identify measures aimed at
reinforcing UNDCP's activities in the field of drug control,
including through increased financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The group's first meeting will be held in Vienna from 22 to 24
April. During the session, the group is expected to prepare a

<HEADLINE> Airlines' Free Training for Inspectors Risks Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A report by the Transportation
Department of the United States said agreements that Airlines to
provide free training to Federal Aviation Administration
inspectors could risk aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Inspector General Lawrence Weintrob said in a report
that such agreements could prevent the FAA from grounding an
aircraft, crew members or carriers even if there was a high safety
risk.
</P>
<P>
One agreement prevented the FAA from acting unilaterally
against a violation until its officials and airline executives
agreed on how to correct the problem. Another arrangement
prevented an FAA lawyer from imposing penalties on an airline for
unsafe practices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"These agreements tend to preclude effective surveillance and
oversight, and significantly diminish FAA's ability to enforce
safety regulations," the report said.
</P>
<P>
As of January 1997, there were some 30 cargo and passenger
airlines participating in the program. But the report would not
identify which airlines had entered into arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general of the Transportation Department asked
the FAA to avoid any future deals for free training if they could
impede the agency's ability to enforce safety regulations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judges Ask for New Courthouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Leading judges of the United
States Tuesday voiced their concern about the lack of money for
construction of new federal courthouses, a federal judge said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There's a very pressing need for new buildings... across the
country," U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges said, while
discussing a report received by the policy-making U.S. Judicial
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The 27-judge conference chaired by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, in its semiannual meeting behind closed doors, heard
about what judiciary sources called an "impending crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has not requested, and Congress has
not authorized, any federal funding for courthouse construction in
the 1999 fiscal year beginning October 1. No such funding was
included in the current budget either.
</P>
<P>
The conference heard Tuesday from Judge Norman Stahl of the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who in his congressional testimony
last week, said, "Most existing court facilities were built over
50 years ago and are now seriously obsolete.... It is clear that
deplorable working conditions exist at many locations."
</P>
<P>
Hodges said the construction moratorium "is a matter about
which the conference is concerned" and referred to "a large number
of construction projects in various stages of completion." He said
numerous federal courthouses date back to the 1920s and should be
renovated or replaced.

<HEADLINE> Balladur Makes Final Attack in Left Rival Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Former French prime minister
Edouard Balladur, who is candidate of the opposition Rally for the
Republic and Union for French Democracy for the presidency of the
municipal council of Paris, Tuesday attacked the Socialist
government in all its social and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made on the eve of the regional elections for local
parliaments across France on Sunday, Balladur said that the
leftwing government is still in power for "too short a time to
show its noxiousness."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Lionel Jospin is profiting from a bright
spell of the economic situation, but it is like the jay of the
fable who dresses itself up with feathers of peacock," said
Balladur.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the Socialist candidate for the Paris parliament
presidency, Jean-Paul Huchon, who is former secretary of Michel
Rocard, Balladur recalled that the former Socialist government
under Rocard had increased taxes, inflated deficits, stopped
privatization and supported public enterprises such as the Credit
Lyonnais in carrying out disastrous policies.
</P>
<P>
"Those who pretend to lead tomorrow our region are those same
people who made France lose its precious time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the vote on March 15 is the "only occasion to
restrict the powers of the new government team, and to give it a
warning."
</P>
<P>
"The left should not have full powers. It would be dangerous
that the Paris region choose to turn back to the past," said
Balladur.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses Family, Children's Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday urged Congress to help poor parents facing a "crying,
unmet need" for quality child care.
</P>
<P>
In a short tour of the child care center at Housatonic
Community Technical College in Connecticut, the president chatted
and played with about a dozen preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants to earmark 21.7 billion dollars for tax credits
to help parents pay for day care and tax incentives for businesses
to provide child care for their employees.
</P>
<P>
"What I see here today is what I believe every child in America
needs," The Associated Press quoted Clinton as saying. "There is a
crying, unmet need... all over the country for the kind of high
quality child care that you offer here.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need to wait another year just because this is an
election year. We need to do this now," he said. "We cannot have a
country that asks people to make a choice between succeeding at
home and succeeding at work. If we have to choose, we lose."
</P>
<P>
Clinton ordered improvements in federally sponsored child care
facilities, such as ensuring that all centers are fully accredited
and that proper background checks have been conducted on
employees.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also ordered that federal workers be given full
information on which child care benefits and options are available
to them.
</P>
<P>
His order covers federal centers, including those run by the
military, the General Services Administration and other
departments. They serve about 215,000 children.
</P>
<P>
The president noted a new report by the Department of Health
and Human Services which shows that, due to constrained resources,
states have set eligibility levels for child care subsidies far
below what is allowed by federal law.
</P>
<P>
Today's visit was part of a series of events this week that
revolve around family and children's issues.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton called on Congress to act on tobacco
legislation this year, and devote some funding to an effort to
prevent teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to focus Wednesday on women's issues during an
observance of International Women's Day, and will take up the
youth smoking issue again on Thursday in a speech at the White
House before the National Association of Attorneys General.
</P>
<P>
White House aides said Clinton was drawn to the Housatonic
school because it serves so many poor children and those from
single-parent homes.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Arrested After Double Murder in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Two men were charged on Tuesday
with the murder of two lifelong friends in the village of
Poyntzpass that rocked the Northern Ireland peace talks last week.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two men, aged 26 and 28, from County Down,
would appear in court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Damien Trainor, 25, and Philip Allen, 34, Catholic and
Protestant respectively, were killed when masked gunmen burst into
the Railway Bar in Poyntzpass, County Armagh, and killed the two
men with two others being wounded.
</P>
<P>
The extremist Protestant pro-British Loyalist Volunteer Force
was blamed for the killings but there has been no claim of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Politicians on both sides of the sectarian divide expressed
horror at the killings and promised to continue with peace talks
in spite of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The killings were part of a growing spiral of violence by
Protestant and Catholic guerrilla groups which threatens to
destroy multiparty peace talks on the future of British-ruled
Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will meet with Gerry Adams and other Sinn Fein officials in
Downing Street Thursday Morning, BBC report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republic Army(IRA),
was expelled from Northern Ireland's multi-party peace talks late
last month by Britain and Ireland for IRA's involvement in two
killings in Northern Ireland. But the party was allowed to return
to the talks on March 9.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, however, insisted that it would not return to the
peace talks before Adams meets with Blair on the current crisis in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says the two governments treated it unjustly by
suspending it. The party insists that it has no links with the
outlawed IRA guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Blair will now hope that after Sinn Fein rejoins the meeting,
the multi-party talks can move ahead to meet his May deadline for
referendum on the talks proposals on the future of the divided
British province.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Predicts Increased Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with
Microsoft, a global computer software giant, has predicted
increased investment in information technology (IT) of Kenya, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in Kenya has been phenomenal. The market grew by
30 percent last year," said Felipe Sanchez Romero, the Microsoft
Regional Director for Africa, Mediterranean and Middle East
(AMME).
</P>
<P>
However, intensive surveillance on piracy and prosecution of
culprits will have to be implemented if the region is to attract
increased foreign investment in the field, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Microsoft boss was in Kenya to attend a Microsoft business
conference aimed at launching the Microsoft Small Business
Server, a product designed for the African market.
</P>
<P>
The small business server offers users the benefit of running
a networked, computerized office at a minimum cost and with
little or no technical support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that Windows'98 would be launched in
Kenya later this year.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Year 2000 computer problem, called
"Millennium Bug," would affect most organizations, unless urgent
measures are taken to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of all computers in Kenya are designed with
two-digit years which will require conversions by 2000. It is
believed that without corrective measures, more than 75 percent
of all business applications will fail at the end of 1999.

JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Gauteng
provincial education authorities would investigate "as a matter
of urgency" a claim that all 920 pupils of a Soweto high school
were infected with HIV virus, The Citizen daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) leads to the deadly
disease of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Sunday newspaper City Press reported that as a result of the
HIV infection, health authorities had to destroy about 400 liters
of contaminated blood taken from the pupils.
</P>
<P>
The Gauteng education department was investigating the
veracity of the story, Gauteng education chief Mary Metcalfe said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Blood Transfusion Service (SABTS) has
dismissed the City Press report as "devoid of truth."
</P>
<P>
The service also denied that it had to destroy 400 liters of
contaminated blood as a result.
</P>
<P>
"The SABTS regards Soweto high schools as an important source
of low risk blood," SABTS said in a statement. The service's
statistics of Soweto high school donor clinics indicated that 0.2
percent of pupils were HIV-positive.
Soweto is the largest black townships in South Africa.

LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Students in Ilorin City in west Nigeria
turned to rioting Tuesday at the end of their patience, after waiting
for hours in vain for buses to take them to school.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria said about 2,000 students of the Kwara
State Polytechnic waited for several hours at the post office for
vehicles to take them to school.
</P>
<P>
The students later started rioting, commandeering government and
commercial vehicles.
</P>
<P>
When the situation became rowdy and students began breaking car
windscreens, the police stepped in and fired several cannisters of
tear gas to disperse them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the students were arrested, it added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer with a daily output of over two
million barrels, have been suffering persistent fuel shortages for a
long time, due to the poor performance of its refineries.
</P>
<P>
In Ilorin, biting fuel scarcity has virtually brought all
commercial activities to a halt, making it impossible for students to
secure transport to their schools, the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Calls for Flexibility in Solving Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. envoy Tuesday
called on the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to show more
creativity and flexibility in bridging the deep gap between them
and reaching a settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Thomas Miller, U.S. State
Department's Cyprus Coordinator, described his two-day separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash as "very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
But he said that "our task is now more difficult than it was a
couple of months ago, no question about this, as a result of
events in the past couple of months."
</P>
<P>
The two Cypriot communities' leaders held two rounds of
U.N.-sponsored peace talks last summer, which ended in failure
due to Denktash's refusal for further talks because of the
European Union (EU)'s decision to start accession negotiations
with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has ordered suspension of bicommunal contacts since
last December in retaliation for the EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded for recognition of his breakaway state
unilaterally declared in 1983 in northern Cyprus as precondition
for resumption of peace negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But Miller said the U.S. will not be deterred by a so-called
resolution of the Turkish Cypriot regime not to participate in EU
accession talks and not to attend peace negotiations unless it
gains international recognition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy refrained from characterising the positions of
the two communities but stressed that "the goal of a bizonal,
bicommunal federal solution is feasible but very difficult."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Miller said Greece and Turkey have a significant role to play
in the Cyprus question and described them as "key players."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in his dealings with Greece and Turkey he does
not demand for anything but tries to persuade them to adopt
positive positions to help move things forward.
</P>
<P>
"That is how we are going to resolve this thing, not through
demands or pressure," he added.
</P>
<P>
Miller reiterated his government's views on Cypriot
government's decision to deploy Russian anti-aircraft S-300
missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think taking the missiles is a good idea in terms of
helping us do our job as negotiators," the U.S. envoy said, adding
that he did not secure what he called a satisfactory answer about
the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government decided to purchase the Russian-made
missiles early last year, and the missiles are due to arrive in
the island later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Waive Duty on Maize Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government announced
Tuesday duty wavier on maize to facilitate the import of maize by
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Tuesday by Kenyan Ministry for
Agriculture and Ministry for Finance said that the government
decided to waive the duty initially from April 1 to June 30,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government will review the duty exemption depending
on grain availability to ensure that local maize producers
are protected, it added.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that Kenya is estimated
to import 630,000 tons of maize to feed its 28 million population
until the next major harvest in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya usually consumes about 2.88 million tons of maize
while maize harvest realized only 2.13 million tons in 1997/98
crop year due to the drought experienced in the first half of
1997 and unusual heavy rains caused by the El Nino phenomenon
during late last year and early this year.
</P>
<P>
The long raining season (March to May) of 1997 started off
fairly well and nearly all parts of the country registered
high-than-normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the rains stopped abruptly during the grain
filling stage and some of the major maize growing districts did
not harvest their maize as a result of heavy rains during the
period from October to December last year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia has formally
recommended a Russian as a second deputy of the U.N. Special
Commission on scrapping Iraq' weapons of mass destruction
(UNSCOM), U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is headed by Richard Butler of Australia, whom Iraq
has repeatedly criticized as pro-Americans and anti-Iraq in his
arms inspection leadership in Iraq. Butler's deputy is Charles
Duelfer of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Placing a Russian in such a post would give Moscow a strong
role in management of the program and in evaluating data uncovered
by the weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the UNSCOM is the key to U.N. Security
Council's decision on whether to lift U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly said that it has destroyed all illegal
weapons. But U.N. inspectors say that they cannot verify Iraq's
claims.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached after intense negotiations between
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership on
February 23, Iraq will open its eight "presidential palaces" to
U.N. inspectors accompanied by senior diplomats selected by the
U.N. chief.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) - A 67.1 million U.S. Dollar
project to link the three East African states with digital
transmission lines is expected to be in operation by the end of the
year, Tanzanian communication officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and
the East Africa Development Bank (EADB) and the communications
companies of the three states, covers some 2,000 kilometers with a
fiber optic transmission system.
</P>
<P>
Its major routes run from Mombasa through Nairobi in Kenya to
Kampala and Mbarara in Uganda on one side and link Mombasa-Tanga,
Nairobi-Arusha-Dodoma and Mutukula-Bukoba-Mwanza on the other side.
</P>
<P>
A central project implementation unit has been working round the
clock since last year at the headquarters of the East African
Cooperation Secretariat in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha to
coordinate the construction.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed last year by high-level
representatives of the two banks and three communications giants in
East Africa, TTCL of Tanzania, UPTC of Uganda and KPTS of Kenya, the
investment was shared among the EIB by 61.5 percent, EADB by 13.5
percent and three companies together by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the EIB loan is risk capital financing
involving direct lending to the telecommunications authorities at a
fixed interest rate of three percent with a repayment period of 15
years and a grace of four years.
</P>
<P>
The EADB loan will be commercial loan financed from the capital
markets at a fixed interest rate of 12 percent and a repayment period
of 12 years including the grace period of three years. It is secured
by either government guarantees or other bank guarantees or assets of
the telecommunications authorities.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday urged the international community to make
contribution to the national reconstruction and reconciliation in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the return to Sierra Leone of President Ahmmed
Tejan Kabbah, Annan said the restoration of the democratically
elected Government of Sierra Leone is a step that strengthens
democracy and the rule of law in Africa, and the will of the
people must be the basis of governmental authority.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the international community played a crucial
role in this return of events and he urged it to respond
generously to the urgent appeal for humanitarian assistance
launched by the United nations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-General said the United Nations is looking
forward to working closely with President Kabbah in helping to
broaden his Government' base, reassert its authority and
strengthen its capacity throughout the country, in order to create
a stable, united and democratic state.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the international community must coordinate its
efforts to help the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
into civilian life of all ex-combatants in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the U.N. chief proposed that a number of the
United Nations military observers be deployed alongside the
peacekeeping troops from African countries to monitor the military
and security situation in the country, to help draw up the
necessary demobilization plans and to assist in the process of
normalization within the country.
</P>
<P>
Anna said he also planned to strengthen the office of his
Special envoy and to establish a Trust Fund for Sierra leone.

It said that the joint military exercises, which come according
to a decision by the defense ministers of the six GCC states at
the end of last year, are aimed at "improving battling
capabilities of GCC troops to enhance the (GCC) states' roles of
defending security in the region."
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not give further details of the exercises,
but said that the maneuver will involve "a number of naval, air
and ground forces" and will take place in the UAE soon.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and defense alliance
established in 1981, groups the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the GCC defense ministers approved two military
projects on further improving their self-defense capabilities,
which included setting up a common radar network for naval and
air surveillance and an early warning system covering all the GCC
states, as well as increasing the number of the "Peninsula
Shield" from 4,000 to 20,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich GCC states currently are reliant on foreign
military presence to protect their security due to relatively
limited human resources.
</P>
<P>
The United States deploys some 20,000 troops and 30 combat and
support ships in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- At least six crew members of an
Egyptian cargo plane died when the plane crashed in Kenya's port
city of Mombasa Tuesday, Kenya News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-707 plane carrying a consignment of fish crashed at
Jamvu on the outskirts of the city about 4 p.m. (local time),
shortly after its take-off at the Moi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Peter Kimanthi was quoted as saying:
"Police have been able to retrieve five bodies burned beyond
recognition and we are looking for the sixth body. No one on the
ground was killed as far as we know."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that before crash, the plane had been swaying
from side to side apparently after developing a mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
On hitting the ground, the plane burst into flames which
destroyed several acres of bush before it was put out by the
municipal and airport fire brigades.
</P>
<P>
The accident brought business at the busy Mombasa-Nairobi
highway to a standstill as thousands of local people flocked to
the scene.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the plane had landed for refueling at
Kenya's airport from Mwanza in northwest Tanzania and was due to
fly on to Cairo, capital of Egypt.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgium reported on Tuesday its
second case of mad cow disease, found in a milk cow farm in the
west of the country.
</P>
<P>
The finding was announced by Belgian Agriculture Minister Karel
Pinxten who said that the five-year-old milk cow found with the

None of the part of the diseased milk cow was used as either
human or animal food, the agriculture minister ensured.
</P>
<P>
The diseased milk cow was found during medical checks at

</P>
<P>
The country's first case of mad cow disease was reported last

<HEADLINE> German President Willing to Encourage Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman
Herzog said Tuesday that he was willing to encourage German
investment in South Africa, but indicated that conditions in the
country must improve, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who is in South Africa for a five-day official visit,
told a joint sitting of parliament in Cape Town that he was aware
that the South African government wanted to see increased German
investment, and that he was willing to encourage this under South
Africa's "wise political management."
</P>
<P>
"Potential investors need to know their money is secure, their
managers and families can live in safety, and productivity is
good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Companies would only make substantial investments abroad if
they could count on favorable and stable conditions in the
country in question.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is among countries with highest crime rates in
the world.
</P>
<P>
German companies have invested about 2.6 billion Rand (520
million U.S. dollars) in South Africa since 1994, making Germany
one of the largest foreign investors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Herzog also met with South African President Nelson Mandela and
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki Tuesday. The two heads of state
witnessed the signing of several bilateral agreements, including
a 240-million-Rand (48-million-dollar) German grant for urban
low-cost housing infrastructure.

UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Saeed al-Sahaf is continuing his talks here with senior U.N.
officials on the new U.N. "oil-for-food" program, U.N. spokesman
Fred Echhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf, accompanied by deputy ministers from Iraq's oil, trade
and health ministries, discussed Monday technical issues of the
new program with new U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise
Frechette of Canada, including the country's capacity of oil
production, the spokesman told reporters at the regular press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister will continue his talks Tuesday
afternoon, and it is hoped that the talks be concluded Wednesday,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently allowed to sell only 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy basic food, medicine and
other goods for its impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan approved a
proposal to expand the current oil exporting level of Iraq to 5.2
billion U.S. dollars for six months to ease the worsening
humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the new program cannot be carried out until Annan approves
a detailed plan by Iraq to distribute the food and medicine under
the new program.

<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will meet with Gerry Adams and other Sinn Fein officials in
Downing Street Thursday Morning, BBC report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republic Army(IRA),
was expelled from Northern Ireland's multi-party peace talks late
last month by Britain and Ireland for IRA's involvement in two
killings in Northern Ireland. But the party was allowed to return
to the talks on March 9.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, however, insisted that it would not return to the
peace talks before Adams meets with Blair on the current crisis in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says the two governments treated it unjustly by
suspending it. The party insists that it has no links with the
outlawed IRA guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Blair will now hope that after Sinn Fein rejoins the meeting,
the multi-party talks can move ahead to meet his May deadline for
referendum on the talks proposals on the future of the divided
British province.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia has formally
recommended a Russian as a second deputy of the U.N. Special
Commission on scrapping Iraq' weapons of mass destruction
(UNSCOM), U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is headed by Richard Butler of Australia, whom Iraq
has repeatedly criticized as pro-Americans and anti-Iraq in his
arms inspection leadership in Iraq. Butler's deputy is Charles
Duelfer of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Placing a Russian in such a post would give Moscow a strong
role in management of the program and in evaluating data uncovered
by the weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the UNSCOM is the key to U.N. Security
Council's decision on whether to lift U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly said that it has destroyed all illegal
weapons. But U.N. inspectors say that they cannot verify Iraq's
claims.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached after intense negotiations between
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership on
February 23, Iraq will open its eight "presidential palaces" to
U.N. inspectors accompanied by senior diplomats selected by the
U.N. chief.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday urged the international community to make
contribution to the national reconstruction and reconciliation in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the return to Sierra Leone of President Ahmmed
Tejan Kabbah, Annan said the restoration of the democratically
elected Government of Sierra Leone is a step that strengthens
democracy and the rule of law in Africa, and the will of the
people must be the basis of governmental authority.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the international community played a crucial
role in this return of events and he urged it to respond
generously to the urgent appeal for humanitarian assistance
launched by the United nations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-General said the United Nations is looking
forward to working closely with President Kabbah in helping to
broaden his Government' base, reassert its authority and
strengthen its capacity throughout the country, in order to create
a stable, united and democratic state.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the international community must coordinate its
efforts to help the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
into civilian life of all ex-combatants in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the U.N. chief proposed that a number of the
United Nations military observers be deployed alongside the
peacekeeping troops from African countries to monitor the military
and security situation in the country, to help draw up the
necessary demobilization plans and to assist in the process of
normalization within the country.
</P>
<P>
Anna said he also planned to strengthen the office of his
Special envoy and to establish a Trust Fund for Sierra leone.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua)-- Police in southern Butare
Prefecture, south of the Rwandan capital Kigali, has netted 32
the area.
</P>
<P>
''The police has gone tough on acts of banditry hitting some
communes of Butare,'' officials in the area said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, 36 armed criminals raided homes of villagers
in Runyinya commune, looting people's property and plundered
shops, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The armed bandits have been sowing terror in parts of Butare.
A number of people have sustained seriously injuries by machette
blows.
</P>
<P>
''Those arrested include a good number of former Rwandan
government soldiers,'' officials in Butare said, but the exact
number of the arrested was withheld.
</P>
<P>
A security meeting held in Butare early this month was aware
of the deteriorating security situation in some communes due to
armed roberry and resolved to fight all trouble-makers.
</P>
<P>
Among the main causes of insecurity, the officials in Butare
had singled out the rising number of idlers who have neither a
well-known job nor a fixed residence.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that has worsened the situation is the endemic
food shortages that hit most households in southern Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Jordanian Leaders Hail New Beginning of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan Tuesday hailed a new
beginning of bilateral ties that would contribute to bilateral and
regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference following their meeting
here, Netanyahu said Israel and Jordan agreed to improve their
relations in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Israeli-Jordanian relations could serve as a
"shinning example" for achieving regional peace which would bring
benefits for all peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Hassan discussed a wide range of bilateral and
regional issues, including promoting trade and economic
cooperation and advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The statements made by both leaders showed that the strained
relations between Israel and Jordan, one of the two Arab countries
that signed peace treaty with the Jewish country, has been put
back on track.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's visit here was the latest in a current flurry of
diplomatic activities by both countries to normalize bilateral
relations, that have been strained by Israel's botched attempt to
assassinate Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) leader Khaled
Mashaal in Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
In the joint communique issued after the meeting, the two
sides emphasized the need to reinvigorate the peace process in
all tracks and multilateral working groups.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called for the Palestinian side to follow the
Jordanian example to conduct direct negotiations with Israel
instead of trying to soliciting outside pressure on Israel. He
stressed that Israel would not make any compromise on the issue of
security.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hassan demanded Israel to implement the signed
agreements with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
redeploy troops in the West Bank. The Israeli-Palestinian talks
have been stalled mainly because of Israel's delay in carrying out
further redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hassan visited the Palestinian city Ramallah to
meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss ways to
break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While Jordan hopes to reap economic benefits from forging
close relations with Israel, Israel is eager to resume the
strategic intelligence cooperation with Jordan that has been
suspended since the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Hassan said Israeli-Jordanian security
cooperation would continue, but "on the basis of trust and mutual
respect."
</P>
<P>
The forced resignation in February of Israeli intelligence
service Mossad's head Danny Yatom, who was responsible for the
Mashaal affair, paved the way for the recent wave of diplomatic
activities towards rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky visited Amman
separately on Sunday and Monday to hold talks with King Hussein
and other officials to discuss enhancing economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to launch a series of joint projects
on water supply and electricity generation and pledged to work
towards reaching a free trade agreement in order to boost
bilateral trade, which doubled to 32 million U.S. dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> 1st writethru: 3 Palestinians Killed by Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (xinhua) -- Three Palestinians were shot
dead and at least two others wounded by Israeli soldiers at a
check point near the West Bank city of Hebron Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Channel 2 Television reported that Israeli soldiers
opened fire at a Palestinian-owned van, when it tried to rush
through a roadblock set up by Israeli troops. It also said that an
Israeli soldier was injured by the van.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians at the scene said that the van did not
deliberately run the check point, but it experienced mechanical
problems and veered off the road.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at a main road, which linked Israeli
coastal area and the West Bank, between Palestinian villages of
Tarkoumiah and Idna.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news, the Palestinian residents of Hebron
held a protest against the actions of Israeli troops and hurled
stones at Israeli soldiers stationed in the city.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident happened during the tense situation in
the region. Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
has warned of a new Palestinian intifada (uprising) in the
territories, if no breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for nearly a
year over Israel's construction of a Jewish neighborhood in Arab
East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Cyprus Leaders Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis held talks here Tuesday with visiting Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides on developments in the Cyprus problem and
negotiations for the island republic's accession to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after 90-minute talks, Simitis
urged neighboring Turkey to make a positive contribution to
efforts for a just and viable solution of the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had the responsibility for the successful outcome of
efforts to settle the Cyprus issue, he said, adding that the
settlement of the problem would bring Turkey closer to Europe and
open up "new horizons" for the relations between Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Simitis stressed that both Greece and Cyprus were ready to
provide all assistance to the U.N. chief's special advisor for
Cyprus for the recommencement of intercommunal talks with the aim
of seeking a solution to the Cyprus problem in accordance with
U.N. decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Greek premier called on the United States and the EU to
back the efforts made by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, saying
that Greece and Cyprus welcomed international interest in a
settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
As for the Turkish Cypriots' participation in Cyprus's
accession talks to the EU due to begin at the end of this month,
Simitis said that the form and objectives of the Turkish Cypriot
participation must mortgage neither the European nor the political
future of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Clerides said that his government would formulate
a generous proposal to make sure that there would be no
repercussions for the issue of the legitimacy of the Cyprus
government and the recognition of northern Cyprus, which
unilaterally announced independence in 1983, but it has been
recognized by no countries except Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, together with Britain, are the guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 treaty on the establishment of
the Cyprus Republic, but the two neighboring countries have been
at odds over Cyprus for many years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in a wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last year to include Cyprus to the list of
countries waiting to join the group, and the accession talks will
begin this month, but this did lead to opposition by northern
Cyprus and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to Greece
and he will meet with other Greek leaders and U.S. State
Department special coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller, who also
arrived here from Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Russian Commission Opens 10th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore opened the 10th
meeting of the Russian-U.S. Commission on Economic and
Technological Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
that the commission has worked to "expand areas of cooperation and
to advance concrete practical joint projects that have...brought
our two great countries closer together."
</P>
<P>
"Time and again, the commission has demonstrated the dynamism
and potential of the U.S.-Russian partnership," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin also sent a message to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the work of the commission which was set up five
years ago, Yeltsin said that the two sides are working "very
closely" together in a number of key directions including the
development of science and technology, health care, environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The message read out by Chernomyrdin said, "In other words,
we've done quite a bit. But this is just the beginning."
</P>
<P>
"Before the commission now is painstaking work on strengthening
the economic foundations of strategic relations between Russia and
the United States and moving forward into the 21st century,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Gore emphasized a need for economic reform and to engage more
state and regional officials in cooperative ventures, while
Chernomyrdin said the commission was moving the two countries "to
new horizons."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this session will become an important milestone
not because it's the fifth anniversary, but because we will
succeed in moving forwards new horizons that are opening up before
us," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
The Chernomyrdin-Gore commission was set up in April 1993 at a
summit between Clinton and Yeltsin. It convenes a session
semi-annually and respectively in Moscow and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Start Census on October 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has delayed the
national census from August 30 to October 4 due to the
destruction of roads caused by recent heavy rains, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the Planning Commission said that the rains have
hampered the preparations, particularly demarcation of enumeration
areas and misplaced or forced people to vacate their original
residence areas.
</P>
<P>
"For example, we have already earmarked Msimbazi Valley as one of
the areas in our maps but we have to make changes because those people
are supposed to move," they complained.
</P>
<P>
According to the census program, which is estimated to cost 5.3
billion Tanzanian Shillings (1 US dollar equals 670 Tanzanian Shillings),
the exercise to divide the country into small manageable
areas for population counting started last July and was expected to
continue up to June.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, with a territory of 945,087 square kilometers, carried
three census in 1967, 1978 and 1988. Since the last census, which
accounts for 23.1 million, the population of Tanzania has risen to
about 30 million now.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Implement U.N. Resolution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Head of Lebanese parliament's
foreign affairs committee Ali Hailili Tuesday urged Israel to
implement the U.N. Resolution 425 to the letter and without any
condition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after the committee's meeting,
Hailili said that this is the committee's position on the
Israeli withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel has suggested for several times that it withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon in return for Lebanese government's
approval of its security demands.
</P>
<P>
Hailili said that in light of the upcoming visit by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to the country and Israeli
international diplomatic efforts to rally for European countries'
support for its withdrawal offer, Lebanon must unify its position
and transfer it to Annan and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will refuse any conditions Israel sets such as
security arrangements and also refuse to negotiate with Israel
on how to implement the U.N. resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution 425 adopted in 1978 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed that Lebanon insists to be on the same track with
Syria in the peace talks with Israel," Hailili said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most efficient way to counter Israeli
diplomatic efforts is Lebanon's national unity and unified
position.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have flatly rejected Israeli's offer, saying
that the Israeli initiative is aimed at trying to change the
international community's impression on its hardline policy in the
Middle East peace process and driving a wedge between Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Due to the refusal, the Israeli government began to seek the
support of Europe which always pledges to play a larger role in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai made separate visits to several European
countries last week, including France which has good relations
with Lebanon, calling on them to encourage Lebanon to accept
Israeli demands.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1978 with the aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Returned Kabbah Faces Challenge of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone finally got back to the country's top seat after
more than nine months self-exile in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was said to be greeted by his jubilant country men in
the capital Freetown, where a lot of street parties became a
common scene on the epoch-making day.
</P>
<P>
However, the returned president, the first leader in west
Africa who regained power from coupists, also faces serious
challenge in the rehabilitation, reconstruction and
reconciliation of the country that was ravaged during the rule of
the military junta.
</P>
<P>
Among the critical areas of need are security and economy of
the poorest country in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that for the foreseeable future, the security
of Kabbah and Sierra Leone could be one of the top tasks for the
Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG,
which overthrew the junta and paved way for the return of the
ousted legitimate president.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Sierra Leoneans who were celebrating the
comeback of Kabbah also gave Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha an extraordinarily warm welcome to thank the Nigerian
soldiers for their sacrifice and contribution in the battle
against the junta.
</P>
<P>
They have reportedly called on ECOMOG to stay in the tiny
country as long as possible, the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite its mineral wealth, particularly diamond and bauxite,
and rich tourism resources, the revitalization of the economy in
Sierra Leone is an arduous job because of the destruction of
infrastructure and other productive and business facilities all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the tens of thousands of refugees, who fled
the country in the wake of the coup last May, are there waiting
for the returned government to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenges, both Sierra Leoneans and Kabbah are
reportedly optimistic about the future of their country.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony to celebrate his return at Freetown's national
stadium Tuesday, the president said, though briefly, that he has
always maintained he will go back to continue with the mandate
given to him by the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah announced earlier his consideration of government
policies which would be characterized by avoiding the politics of
confrontation, destruction, suspicion and notorious pulling-down
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
He is also planning to restructure his cabinet to
ostentatiously downsize the "large bureaucracy" in the
government.
</P>
<P>
All the policies measures, if well implemented, are expected
to bring a stable political situation and effective government
functionaries, factors favorable to the economic construction of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, national reconciliation and reconstruction have
become a hot topic among Sierra Leoneans, who after more than
nine months chaos caused by the coup, are determined to fight and
die, if necessary, for freedom and peaceful life.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's representative in the United Nations Children's
Fund may have spoken out what Sierra Leoneans want to say.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford to leave the country to be managed
the way it was managed. We have so many resources and it will not
take long for us to come back if the resources are managed
properly."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the increasing inflow of aid from the entire
international community will also give a boost to the Sierra
Leonean government's effort to revitalize the country.
</P>
<P>
To many observers, if the international community can assist
the legitimate government of Sierra Leone to regain power from
coupists, the first ever example in west Africa, it will be able
to help the country to rise from the debris of the nine-month
nightmare.

</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians must fulfill its commitments to fight

Netanyahu said.
